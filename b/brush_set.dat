50|$|Fluoride varnish has {{practical}} {{advantages over}} gels {{in ease of}} application and use of smaller volume of fluoride than required for gel applications. The principle of fluoride varnish is to apply fluoride salt in a very high concentration (approximately 50,000 ppm) {{onto the surface of}} the teeth. Fluoride varnish is a resin-based application that is designed to stay {{on the surface of the}} teeth for several hours. As this varnish rests on the tooth’s surface, saliva dissolves the fluoride salt, which in turn allows fluoride ions to be released and absorbed by the teeth and soft tissues. Later, the fluoride is re-released into the oral cavity from these reservoirs which acts as protection for the teeth against cavities. Currently, there is also no published evidence that indicates that professionally applied fluoride varnish is a risk factor for enamel fluorosis. The varnish is applied with a <b>brush</b> and <b>sets</b> within seconds.|$|R

40|$|Mycotoxins {{are highly}} toxic {{compounds}} produced by molds that commonly occur in cereal grains. These toxins can have {{adverse effects on}} human and animal health. Mycotoxin decontamination procedures {{can be divided into}} three different groups: chemical, biological and physical. Procedures from the first two groups are often regarded as unacceptable for lowering the mycotoxin level. A laboratory brush was developed for the purpose of physical cleaning of corn kernel. Three samples of commercially available corn kernels were subjected to the brushing procedure in order for the experimental study to be conducted. The mass of 100 g of corn kernels was placed on motionless screen of the brush. A rotating part of the experimental device, the polypropylene bristle <b>brush</b> was <b>set</b> to high­er speed (higher than 800 rpm). During the corn brushing, dust and broken kernels were brushed out through the motionless screen. Corn samples were taken before and after the brushing procedure and they were analyzed for aflatoxin concentration by HPLC-UV RED. By comparing the control and brushed samples, it can be noticed that removal of fines caused the reduction in the level of mycotoxins in all three brushed samples...|$|R
50|$|<b>Brushes</b> are a <b>set</b> of {{bristles}} {{connected to}} a handle so that the bristles make a rounded fan shape. They are often used in jazz or blues music, but also in other genres such as rock, country and pop. The bristles can be made of metal or plastic; the handles are commonly made of wood or aluminum, and are often coated with rubber. Some brushes are telescoping so that the bristles can be pulled inside a hollow handle and the fan made by the bristles can be of variable length, width and density. Retracting the bristles also protects the brush {{when it is not}} being used. The non-bristled end of the brush may end in a loop or a ball.|$|R
40|$|Larger scale {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) require compact architectures to efficiently treat wastewater. We examined how anode-brush diameter, number of anodes, and electrode spacing affected {{the performance of}} the MFCs operated in fed-batch and continuous flow mode. All anodes were initially tested with the <b>brush</b> core <b>set</b> at the same distance from the cathode. In fed-batch mode, the configuration with three larger brushes (25 mm diameter) produced 80 % more power (1240 mW m- 2) than reactors with eight smaller brushes (8 mm) (690 mW m- 2). The higher power production by the larger brushes was due to more negative and stable anode potentials than the smaller brushes. The same general result was obtained in continuous flow operation, although power densities were reduced. However, by moving the center of the smaller brushes closer to the cathode (from 16. 5 to 8 mm), power substantially increased from 690 to 1030 mW m- 2 in fed batch mode. In continuous flow mode, power increased from 280 to 1020 mW m- 2, resulting in more power production from the smaller brushes than the larger brushes (540 mW m- 2). These results show that multi-electrode MFCs can be optimized by selecting smaller anodes, placed {{as close as possible to}} the cathode. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
