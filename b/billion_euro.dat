5|$|Furthermore, the {{legislative}} branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority. The EU's budget (which is around 155 <b>billion</b> <b>euro)</b> is subject {{to a form of}} the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (prior to 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. But if the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively. In addition to the budget, the Council coordinates the economic policy of members.|$|E
5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low debt level among advanced economies {{prior to the}} crisis. Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, France or the US, and more than 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the bubble burst, Spain spent {{large amounts of money}} on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 <b>billion</b> <b>euro</b> bailout, on top of the previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses. During September 2012, regulators indicated that Spanish banks required €59 billion (US$77 billion) in additional capital to offset losses from real estate investments.|$|E
