This research also investigates the potential need for ethnic minorities in commercial property to have the key legal terms of commercial property leases made available in both English and other languages. There is little previous academic research on reform of commercial property leases through legislative intervention (other than Crosby Reading reports). This research aims to contributute towards filling the gap {{that exists in the}} literature by investigating reform through legislation. This research involved semi-structured interviews with participants from five groups: lawyers, surveyors/agents, landlords, tenants and business owners. Most interviewed supported reform of commercial property leases through legislative intervention, and better guidance explaining the meaning of key legal terms of commercial property leases, especially from ethnic minority businesses...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the article}}. The {{aim of the}} article is an {{analysis}} of technological aspects of leasing application for agricultural enterprises {{in the context of}} complex innovative development of agrarian sphere. The results of the analysis. It is shown that the latest technology and recovery techniques must be at all stages of the agricultural sector. The first stage is selection of breeding. The last is sale of agricultural products. Asset structure of agricultural enterprises occupies about one third of machines and equipment, which are now physically and morally outdated. Authors of the article analyze the technological aspect of leasing and prove that leasing of biological assets and leasing equipment should be considered separately, which are more consistent with the structure of the innovation needs of agricultural businesses (purchase of machinery and equipment, research and development, acquisition software and industrial design). Innovative technologies and leasing are proposed to be considered {{in the context of the}} eco-village system to ensure maximum utilization of all natural resources: low-temperature heat of the earth, air and water (heat pumps), alternative energy (solar, biomass, wind, water, etc.), not carbon motor fuel (biogas, air, electricity), new modes, innovative agricultural technologies, safe disposal of solid waste of local wastewater treatment (biological, resonance, mechanical), technologies in the construction and infrastructure development. Stability of eco-village is affected by a lot of factors, including: economic (existence of a business within the eco-village and use the most cost-effective technologies); social (creating conditions for the development of human capital); technological (business uses the most effective technologies); environment (rational use of natural resources); political (agreement with the objectives of the state and its support); information (high level of information and transport connectivity). New agricultural technologies can be effective because there will be always transition period the period of recovery of higher costs and lower profits. Economic support companies can have different forms: compensation of losses (when food production in transition cannot be sold as organic); financial assistance for infrastructure development (such as may be allocated funds for the purchase of machinery or reconstruction of rural buildings, compensation cost of drugs and bio-mechanical means); compensation costs for certification and annual inspections of facilities, research and implement technologies. Conclusions and directions of further research. Modern methods of work at agricultural farms enable to reduce the impact of adverse weather factors which prevent serious crop losses and improve the quality of the crop. The use of leasing in conjunction with the introduction of innovations contributes to efficient interaction of businesses and financial institutions and the growth of innovative activity that has a positive effect on accelerating the use of the results of basic and applied research and the creation of conditions for the production of competitive products. The application of an intangible asset in a business practice of <b>business</b> <b>lease</b> as innovation has become the subject of research for economists and lawyers...|$|E

40|$|This study, about {{techniques}} used in commercial leasing contracts in companies that practice economic development, {{is influenced by}} a specific working hypothesis. It {{is the study of}} an entrepreneurial organization that succeeded {{in the space of a}} few short years to create an economic initiative capable of promoting the development of a flourishing commercial district in the Cagliari area. This example can give insight into a beneficial use of linked contracts systems for the creation of big economic operations and the development of productive activities during times where resources are scarce and the economy is contracting. Commercial leasing has always been thought of (and this is also the case with Policentro Domus de Janas corporation) as an excellent contractual technique for developing economic initiative. Even if one only considers how it gives the property owner an income from giving the right to use all or part of a productive activity, and how the tenant (who generally does not have the capital to risk investing in the beginning) tests the market by starting its own professional activity. With this objective in mind, this paper will develop in the space of three chapters. 1 The first chapter will frame commercial leasing in the context of the circulatory phenomena of productive apparatuses. The second will concentrate on analyzing the types of contracts used. In this way, the evolution of commercial leasing contracts will be retraced. Evolution that has affected applicable regulations of the business branch and the importance of the starting plan for the purposes of presenting negotiations in doctrine and in jurisprudence. The implications that this kind of contract has on a procedural level should not be omitted. With the inclusion of this figure by the legislator on the list of matters to be decided according to article 447 bis c. p. c. on one side, and subject to the condition of admissibility pronounced by the legislative decree no. 28 / 2010 on the other. The body of this treatise will consist of analysis in the third chapter of the kind of contracts used by the Policentro Domus de Janas Corporation for the development of its commercial structures. It will also examine the linked contracts system prepared for the economic operation, the marketing of the areas. This sequence, which would eventually get underway with the signing of a preliminary leasing contract and then evolve into a sale of the same areas leased, makes it clear that they are specific in nature with regard to the so called organizational and promotional contract and the veritable business leasing contract. In the first of the two negotiations, the parties intend to base the economic operation and regulate all aspects about the start up and entrance of an entrepreneur in an integrated commercial structure. With the second, the strategy involved in deciding to give to that entrepreneur the right to use the areas through a kind of branch business leasing contract instead of a <b>business</b> <b>lease</b> or a rental of commercial space. 2 In conclusion, the final objective is to understand the peculiarities and limits of application of the model created by the Policentro and the eventual exportability to other kinds of commercial development projects. It is clear that negotiating tools such as commercial leasing allow for mobilizing capital and getting past restrictions on economic initiatives, restrictions due to the unwillingness of property owners to risk entrepreneurially during economic recession and to scarce creditfrom banking institutions. ...|$|E
