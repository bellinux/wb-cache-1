We also present a variety of changes to system operation and planning that can help in meeting these challenges. The chapter provides background on ongoing industry and government efforts to integrate and increase the penetration of VERs, as well as context for later chapters. The topics described in this chapter are of primary interest to industry decision makers. Section 3. 1 describes the <b>basic</b> <b>technical</b> and economic <b>characteristics</b> of VERs and introduces the challenges for the power system derived from the variability and uncertainty of these generation sources. This is followed in Section 3. 2 by a discussion of the impact that high penetrations of VERs could have on system operating reserve requirements and several ways to limit system operation cost increases. These include improving VER forecasts and situational awareness, moving generation scheduling decisions closer to real time, and expanding cooperation among neighboring balancing areas. We find that these operational changes will become increasingly important as VER penetrations grow. Section 3. 3 discusses the impact of high VER penetrations on the future well-adapted generation mix and the need to ensure adequate system flexibility.

40|$|The {{situation}} when the metal structure {{is subjected to}} the simultaneous impact {{of two or more}} sources of simple stress is common in mechanical engineering, aviation and civil engineering. The fatigue life of the material by the impact of Biharmonic loading is 1. 5 ‒ 4 times lower than in single-frequency operation loading. Unlike the single-frequency loading under Biharmonic loading degradation of the material is accelerated because of the intensification of the process of fatigue damage accumulation. Description of the process of damage accumulation of fatigue in the material under biharmonic loading is closer to the real situation. The aim of the workis ‒ to create an effective setting for testing of ferromagnetic samples for fatigue and durability. To achieve the objectives small-sized laboratory facility for testing ferromagnetic sample flexural fatigue developed and produced. Studies have been conducted using the method of magnetic Barkhausen effect. The article describes the design and its basic characteristics, as well as the <b>basic</b> <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics</b> the sample. The principle of operation is based on the bi-harmonic load acting on both ends of the sample. The device use two electric motors with two special agents of power, based on the use of rolling bearings. Installation and testing of samples by the method of independent regulation of dual-frequency cyclic loading allows to simulate the condition of the test sample in the approximation to the real working conditions. This allows a detailed investigation of fracture toughness of the material, the stages of fatigue crack propagation and identify new patterns of development of fatigue. Unlike analog unit has small dimensions and weight (the length of the sample does not exceed 20 cm, width – 13 cm, height – 25 cm, weight of the unit is 12 kg).

40|$|Taking {{into account}} the fact that thermal power plants are {{responsible}} for the 1 / 3 of the anthropogenic CO 2 emitted to the atmosphere, it is argued that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies will contribute drastically to the reduction of the Greenhouse effect. This reality justifies the intensive research activity towards the CO 2 abatement from thermoelectric power units in order to achieve feasible technical and economic solutions. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the performance of a power plant representative to the Greek electricity production industry fired with low quality lignite. The gross power output of a typical Greek lignite power plant lies within the range of 300 - 350 MWel. Taking into account that the application of CCS technologies results in the considerable reduction of the net power output of the unit, the size of the unit under investigation is 380 MWel gross, while the fuel chosen is the lignite extracted from the region of Florina. In order to estimate the performance parameters of the thermal power plants, the GateCycle software is used which is developed by General Electric. In the context of this thesis, the basic design characteristics of the CCS units are determined. In addition, the optimization of the thermodynamic design as well as the economic feasibility study is included. The application of the oxy-fuel technology is examined in the 3 rd chapter of the thesis. Specifically, this chapter includes the <b>basic</b> <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the steam boiler, the flue gas treatment line, the air separation unit and the CO 2 purification and compression system. Primarily, the power plant performance is assessed without any efficiency optimization options being investigated. However, a large amount of heat produced from the air separation and flue gas treatment processes, is rejected to the cooling water. The exploitation of this low quality heat results in the significant reduction of the efficiency penalty implied by the application of the oxy-fuel CO 2 abatement technology. Finally, the thermodynamic design that maximizes the plant’s net efficiency is proposed. In the 4 th chapter the CO 2 chemical absorption from the flue gas with amines is evaluated. The CO 2 removal equipment consists mainly of the absorption column and the amine solution regeneration column. The technical characteristics of the equipment are presented. Importance has been placed on the examination of the requirements regarding the SOx and NO 2 concentration of the flue gas at the inlet of the absorber. Given that the amine will react preferentially with more acidic gases than CO 2 such as SO 2 and NO 2 to form more stable salts that cannot be broken down in the stripper, the concentration in the flue gas should be very low. Additionally, the technical options concerning the integration of low quality heat that is rejected to the cooling water are investigated. Finally the process integration that results in the optimal power plant performance is proposed. The conclusions that emerge from this thesis concern the performance of the steam generators, the specific heat consumption of the steam turbine as well as the net electrical efficiency of the power plant which integrate the CO 2 control technologies. The optimum plant design which maximizes the thermodynamic performance is proposed taking {{into account the}} CO 2 capture equipment requirements. As far as the economic viability is concerned, emphasis is placed on the economic remarks specific to the CO 2 control technologies application. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulatory}} control of nuclear materials (nuclear safeguards) {{is a prerequisite}} for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Finland. In order to uphold the Finnish part of the international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation – mainly the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – this {{regulatory control}} is exercised by the Nuclear Materials Section of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). The results of STUK'’s nuclear safeguards inspection activities in 2014 continued to demonstrate that the Finnish licence holders take good care of their nuclear materials. There were no indications of undeclared nuclear materials or activities and the inspected materials and activities were in accordance with the licence holders’ declarations. Safeguards are applied to nuclear materials and activities that can lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These safeguards include nuclear materials accountancy, control, security and the reporting of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities. The main parties involved in a state nuclear safeguards system are the facilities that use nuclear materials – often referred to as “licence holders” or “operators” – and the state authority. A licence holder shall take good care of its nuclear materials and the state authority shall provide the regulatory control to ensure that the licence holder fulfils the requirements. The control of nuclear expert organisations, technology holders and suppliers, to ensure the nonproliferation of sensitive technology, is also a growing global challenge for all stakeholders. In Finnish legislation, all these stakeholders are dealt with as users of nuclear energy. At then end of 2013, the new STUK regulations – called YVL Guides – entered into force. All the stakeholders were requested to prepare their safeguards manuals as a part of their quality managements systems. The approval process will continue in 2015. Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared nuclear materials (uranium, plutonium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. Additionally, there is the research reactor in Espoo, as well as a dozen minor nuclear material holders in Finland. Nuclear dual-use items and instrumentation for the third reactor under construction at the Olkiluoto site are being imported and installed. The import licences are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission made their site visits to the construction site prior to the installation of safeguards instrumentation and fuel delivery. The planning and design of the fourth reactor at the Olkiluoto power plant and at a new nuclear power plant site Hanhikivi in Pyhäjoki were authorised in 2010. The safeguards systems for these new reactors will be designed together with facility design and development. Similarly to the Olkiluoto 3 reactor that is under construction, the import licences for the new facilities are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology and sensitive information. The operators have submitted the preliminary <b>Basic</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Characteristics</b> to the European Commission and obtained Material Balance Area codes for the future reactors before the vendor companies were selected. In December 2013, Fennovoima announced that the Hanhikivi reactor will be supplied by Rusatom Overseas. This was not included as an option in the application of 2009, and thus the re-evaluation of the conditions for the previous authorisation was carried out in 2014, resulting in new Decision-in-Principle endorsed by the Parliament in December 2014. In parallel with this, the TVO application to extend the time line for the fourth unit was denied by the Government. Owing to these decisions, the construction licence applications are expected in 2015. Uranium production as one of the by-products of nickel at the Talvivaara mine was given approval from the Government in accordance with the nuclear energy legislation in March 2012. In 2013, the company constructed the uranium extraction plant, but the Supreme Administrative Court rescinded the approval, owing to claims of environmental and economical issues in December 2013 before the commissioning of the plant. The difficulties continued in 2014; and, finally in November 2014 the Talvivaara Sotkamo Ltd. filed for bankruptcy. Currently, uranium residuals are extracted from the nickel at Harjavalta Nickel Refinery and at Freeport Cobalt in Kokkola, and reported to STUK. STUK maintains a central national nuclear materials accountancy system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union legislation and international agreements. These tasks are performed to guarantee that Finland can assure itself and the international community of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities and materials. In addition to this, the IAEA evaluates the success of the state safeguards system, and the European Commission participates in safeguarding the materials under its jurisdiction. The number of the routine inspection days of the international inspectorates has been reduced significantly due to the state-level integrated safeguards approach for Finland, which has been in force since 2008. The number of international inspection days per year is approximately 25. Neither the IAEA nor the Commission made any remarks nor did they present any required actions based on their inspections during 2014. By means of their nuclear materials accountancy and control systems, all licence holders enabled STUK to fulfil its own obligations under the international agreements relevant to nuclear safeguards. STUK continues with 40 annual inspections and 60 inspection days. In 2014, the number in inspection days was significantly higher owing to the extensive survey campaign carried out at Onkalo, the planned geological repository. In total, 65 working days were required for the one-week long scanning of the tunnels. The application for the construction licence for the disposal facility, which consists of the encapsulation plant and the geological repository, was submitted to the government in December 2012. The licensing of the facility {{was one of the main}} topics over the year as a whole at STUK. During 2013 and 2014, the IAEA and the Commission defined the requirements for the safeguards equipment for the encapsulation plant in an interactive process with STUK and Posiva. This document will be included in the STUK statement to be finalised in 2015. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is one of the elements of the global nuclear non-proliferation effort. STUK has two roles in relation to the CTBT: STUK operates the Finnish National Data Centre (FiNDC) and one of the radionuclide laboratories (RL 07) in the CTBT International Monitoring Network (IMS). The main task of the FiNDC is to inspect data received from the International Monitoring System and to inform the national authority, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, about any indications of a nuclear weapons test. The FiNDC falls under the non-proliferation process in STUK’s organisation, together with the regulatory control of nuclear materials. A major goal of all current CTBT-related activities is the entry into force of the CTBT itself. An important prerequisite for such positive political action is that the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is functioning and able to provide assurance to all parties that it is impossible to make a clandestine nuclear test without detection. The FiNDC is committed to its own role in the common endeavour, so that the verification system of the CTBTO can accomplish its detection task. The human resources development at the Nuclear Materials Section during 2014 was focused on nuclear material control: in particular, information security issues were addressed. This was partly due to the need to regulate the construction of the final disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel at the Olkiluoto repository site. In addition, STUK contributed to educational workshops and training courses for authorities who represent nuclear newcomers: countries that aim at uranium production or nuclear power in cooperation with the IAEA. STUK and Finnish Customs continued the joint multi-year border monitoring development project. The project covers customs officers training as well as the updating of technical equipment and of operational procedures. In 2014, the partnerships programme between King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K. A. CARE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and STUK began supporting Saudi Arabia’s nuclear energy programme. In the field of safeguards and nuclear security, STUK’s safeguards and security experts initiated practical cooperation with their colleagues at K. A. CARE...|$|E

In Finnish legislation, all these stakeholders are dealt with as users of nuclear energy. At the end of 2013, the revised STUK requirements were published as regulatory guides on nuclear safety, security and safeguards, called YVL guides. According to the Guide YVL D. 1 Regulatory Control of Nuclear Safeguards all the stakeholders were requested to prepare their safeguards manuals as a part of their quality managements systems. During 2015, in total 19 draft manuals were submitted to STUK, and 14 of those were approved. Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared nuclear materials (uranium, plutonium and thorium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa.

The operators submitted the preliminary <b>Basic</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Characteristics</b> to the European Commission and obtained Material Balance Area codes for the future reactors before the vendor companies were selected. During 2015, the construction licence application for the new Hanhikivi plant was submitted to the Government. The authorisation of the Olkiluoto 4 unit expired as the operator did not apply for the construction licence within the 5 year period of validity of the authorisation, i. e. the Decision-in-Principle by the Government, so the material balance area code was also withdrawn. The research reactor was shut down in 2015 and the preparations for decommissioning continue in Espoo. On the other hand, in order to continue research activities, the new VTT Centre for Nuclear Safety was under construction at the research campus in Espoo. Uranium production as one of the by-products of nickel at the Talvivaara mine was given approval by the Government in accordance with the nuclear energy legislation in March 2012. In 2013, the mining company constructed the uranium extraction plant, but the Supreme Administrative Court rescinded the approval, owing to claims of environmental and economic issues in December 2013 before the commissioning of the plant. The difficulties continued in 2014, and finally in November 2014 Talvivaara Sotkamo Ltd. filed for bankruptcy. During 2015 a new operator, Terrafame Mining Oy took over the mining and milling activities, but no uranium extraction nor safeguards activities took place at Talvivaara. Currently, uranium residuals are extracted from the nickel at Harjavalta Nickel Refinery and at Freeport Cobalt in Kokkola, and reported to STUK and to the European Commission. STUK maintains a national nuclear materials accountancy system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union Safeguards Regulation and international agreements.

These needs were included in the STUK statement and safety evaluation concerning the construction licence application finalised in February 2015. In November 2015 the Government granted the construction licence. In the meanwhile, the detailed design of the facility was updated resulting in the continuation of the planning of the safeguards system.

In 2015 a concise survey campaign was carried out at Onkalo resulting in an increased number of inspection days since 2013. The number of annual inspection days for nuclear material holders has remained at 20 days per international inspectorate.

STUK has two roles in relation to the CTBT: STUK operates the Finnish National Data Centre (FiNDC) and one of the radionuclide laboratories (RL 07) in the CTBT International Monitoring Network (IMS). The main task of the FiNDC is to inspect data received from the International Monitoring System and to inform the national authority, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, about any indications of a nuclear weapons test. The FiNDC falls under the non-proliferation process in STUK’s organisation, together with the regulatory control of nuclear materials. A major goal of all current CTBT-related activities is the entry into force of the CTBT itself. An important prerequisite for such positive political action is that the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is functioning and able to provide assurance to all parties {{that it is impossible to}} make a clandestine nuclear test without detection. The FiNDC is committed to its own role in the common endeavour, so that the verification system of the CTBTO can accomplish its detection task. The human resources development at the Nuclear Materials Section during 2015 was focused on nuclear material control: in particular, information security issues were addressed. This was partly due to the need to regulate the construction of the disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel at the Olkiluoto repository site. In addition, STUK contributed to educational workshops and training courses for authorities who represent nuclear newcomers: countries that aim at uranium production or nuclear power in cooperation with the IAEA. STUK and Finnish Customs continued the joint multi-year border monitoring development project. The project covers customs officers training as well as the updating of technical equipment and of operational procedures. In 2014, the partnerships programme between King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K. A. CARE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and STUK began supporting the establishment of the Saudi Arabia’s regulatory authority in relation to its nuclear energy programme. In the field of safeguards and nuclear security, STUK’s safeguards and security experts continued practical cooperation with their colleagues at K. A. CARE...|$|E

Special attention should be paid to the occurrence of metal particles in oil and the tendency in the change of their number. The signs that point to changes in viscosity, oxidation increase and additive wear are also considered. The state of impurities in oil was discussed, with a particular focus on the number of particles, water content and metal impurities. It is inevitable to use an oil analysis programme in the case of motor oils, which provides several advantages: reduction of unscheduled vehicle downtime, improvement of vehicle reliability, help in organizing effectiveness of maintenance schedules, extension of engine life, optimization of oil change intervals and reduction of cost of vehicle maintenance. The paper also gives the results of the experimental research of physical- chemical characteristics of the motor oils sampled from the engines of Mercedes OM 345 vehicles in operational use. It was shown that there is a change in physical-chemical properties of lubrication oils. These changes are in a direct correlation with the state of all the elements of the tribomechanical motor system, i. e. with their functional characteristics. The conclusion based on the realized testing comes {{at the end of the}} paper. Introduction As a contact element of the tribomechanical system, lubricant is a carrier of information about the state of the whole system, from the aspect of tribological as well as other ageing processes. Therefore, an analysis of oils, based on a properly defined program, represents a very effective method for monitoring the state of technical systems, which ensures early warning signals of potential problems that could lead to failure and break down of technical systems. Using Oil Analysis programs for engine oils has several benefits: reduction of unscheduled vehicle downtime, improvement of vehicle reliability, help in organizing effectiveness of maintenance schedules, extension of engine life, optimization of oil change intervals and reduction of vehicle maintenance costs. Physico-chemical characteristics of lubricating oils Basic physico-chemical characteristics which determine the quality of oil are: a) physical characteristics: viscosity, density, flash point, cloud Point, pour point, volatillity, emulsibillity, deemulsibillity, foaming, air release, viscosity index, etc. b) chemical characteristics: neutralization number (TAN-total acid number), total base number (TBN), oxidation stabillity, chemical and thermal stabillity, corrodibillity, ash content and carbon residue, water content, compatibility, toxicity, etc. Diagnostics of the tribomechanical system of an internal combustion engine The diagnostics is based on the prediction (recognition) of damage and/or failure through characteristic diagnostic parameters. This allows prevention of delays and increases reliability, cost-effectiveness, and usage life. The diagnostics of the tribomechanical system can provide verification of the system condition, working capacity and functionality, and can point out the place, form and cause of a failure. The diagnostics is carried out through the detection of symptoms, determining the value of the characteristic parameters and their comparison with the limit values. If the engine assemblies are considered from the aspect of tribomechanical systems (e. g. piston-piston ring-cylinder, cam-valve lifter, bearing journal bearing) defined by tribological processes, it can be shown that the determination of the content of wear products, content of contaminants, state of lubricants and lubrication conditions have a significant influence on the implementation of maintenance of these systems. We should emphasize the importance of monitoring oil for lubrication of tribomechanical engine assemblies, which provides identification of potential causes and phenomena leading to damage and failure in the early stages of the functioning of the system. Prediction, i. e. detection of potential and/or current damage and failures in the system, checking the functionality of oil and determination of usage life are the main factors of the implementation of oil monitoring. Since mobile components of tribomechanical system engines are necessarily exposed to wear and contaminants and wear products deposit in the lubrication oil, it is necessary to monitor changes in fluid properties during exploitation, because the monitoring of lubricants is the key monitoring technique for maintenance as well as for achieving certain techno-economic effects. The analysis of the contents of different metals in lubricants is very important. Metal particles are abrasive and act as catalysts in the oxidation of oils. In motor oils, the origin of the particles may be from additives, wear, fuel, air and cooling liquid. Metals from additives can be Zn, Ca, Ba, or Mg and that indicates the change in additives. Metals originating from wear are: Fe, Pb, Cu, Cr, Al, Mn, Ag, Sn, and they point to increased wear in these systems. Elements originating from cooling liquids are Na and B, and their increased content indicates the penetration of the cooling liquid into the lubricant. The increased content of Si or Ca, originating from the air, points to the air filter malfunctioning. Wear of the parts is the main cause of malfunctioning in the process of exploitation of mechanical components of vehicles. Wear is characterized by the change in shapes and dimensions of working parts. Friction leads to surface wear which causes the increase of clearance between moving joined parts and the change in their mutual relations, thus resulting further in deviations from required specifications of assemblies and vehicles in general. Diagnostic procedure for the condition of lubricants 1) Selection of a type of vehicles and vehicle parts from which oil samples will be taken. 2) Consideration of the mode of the system (vehicle assembly) operation, lubrication systems, exploitation conditions and its purpose, and an overview of the <b>basic</b> <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics.</b> 3) Analysis of the tribological processes in components of motor vehicles. 4) Analysis of the failure of functional components of vehicles (as tribomechanical systems) 5) Information about the condition of a vehicle assembly and oil during the analysis and monitoring Results of motor oil investigation during exploitation In this part of the paper, the results of the experimental testing of motor oils in the Laboratory for fuels and lubricants, VTI Belgrade, are presented. The physico-chemical characteristics of oils were examined in accordance with standard methods, shown in Table 3. The analysis was done on fresh (new) oils and oils used in vehicle engine assembles. Testing of used samples was carried out in accordance with common criteria defined by the quality of used oil. The values of allowable deviation limits of individual characteristics of oil depend on the type of oil, working conditions and internal recommendations of the manufacturer of lubricants and users. The limited values of oil characteristics which condition the change of the oil charge from the engine are given in Table 4. They represent the criteria for the oil charge change. Deviation of only one characteristic results in the change of the oil charge, regardless of the characteristic itself. The research was carried out on three vehicles (MERCEDES O 345 buses) with the Mercedes-Benz engine, OM 447 HLA type. This is a four-stroke engine with six in-line cylinders, turbo Diesel, liquid cooled and with combined lubrication, which meets Euro 2 emission standards related to exhaust gases. The research was conducted through periodic sampling of oil from the engines of the vehicles listed above. Apart from fresh oil ('zero' sample), samples were taken after 10. 000 km, 20. 000 km and 30. 000 km. After 30. 000 km oil charges were replaced in all three engines. During the oil sampling, the sampling sites were carefully chosen, taking care of actual oil usage, which enabled each sample to be a representative one. Each sample was taken from the living zone, i. e. zone closer to the elements in contact. The sampling of oil from the bottom of the motor housing (discharge outlet) was thus avoided, as the highest concentration of contaminants occurs there. This is achieved by simply modifying the outlet for oil, by extending it towards the active zone of oil within the housing with a tube of appropriate length. Special attention was also paid to the preservation of samples from contamination, both in the phase of sample taking and in the phase of manipulation, which is fully met by applying the prescribed procedures. A very high level of purity of all elements in the chain of the sampling systems was thus provided as well as the separation of samples in a way that does not perturb the integrity of their data on the state of the vehicle components from which the sampling was done. Conclusion On the basis of all the mentioned above, the following conclusions can be drawn: - motor oil VALVOLINE, API CF and ACEA E 4, of SAE 10 W- 40 gradation, analyzed during exploitation, achieves its primary function and meets the prescribed replacement interval of 30. 000 km in the EURO 2 engine category, which was found by the analysis of characteristic physico-chemical properties of oil and wear products (Fe and Cu) during exploitation; - the fall of viscosity is evident during the first 10. 000 km, and after this period, viscosity remains approximately constant until the end of the interval changes of the oil charge. Maximum viscosity fall during the exploitation of the oil from all three engines is significantly below the allowed limit of 20 %; - after 30. 000 km the TBN value has not exceeded the allowable limit for oil samples from all three engines; - the content of insoluble substances in the oil is negligible in comparison with the limit value, because there is no significant presence of oxidation products and mechanical impurities or insoluble substances such as coke, scale, dust, soot, particles originated from wear contact area of the engine tribomechanical systems and other mechanical impurities; - small decrease of the flash point values shows that there was no significant penetration of fuel into the system for lubrication; - content of iron and copper is significantly below the allowable limits for all three vehicles; - the appearance of water in the samples is not found, - after 30. 000 km, oil is replaced, following exactly the manufacturer's recommendation about the oil charge change...|$|E
