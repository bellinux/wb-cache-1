50|$|The 15-40-hp is {{fitted with}} Humber-Perrott semi-servo front wheel brakes. The driver's foot pedal still works the {{transmission}} brake {{and now the}} front wheel brakes as well. A floating shoe gives the semi-servo effect and it relies to some extent on forward motion. Applying the brakes when backing the car receives only half the force. Front axle and stub axles are strengthened to accommodate the higher loads from braking, to the same end the springs are wider {{and there is a}} new cross tube linking the dumb irons (forward ends of the main longitudinal chassis members). Front <b>brake</b> <b>adjustment</b> is carried out by jacking up that end of the car and the hand operated nuts turned until equal pressure is provided to each wheel. The following year a compensating device is installed between the two sets of brakes.|$|E

40|$|Introduction To be {{successful}} in the confusion of daily traffic, executing appropriate brake manoeuvres is an important skill. When following a car, a driver needs to be alert in order to quickly register and act upon decelerations of a leading vehicle. From the literature, it can be concluded that monocular information sources like the optical variable tau {{play an important role in}} the visual control of braking, but that several other visual cues, such as depth information from stereo vision, might have a supplement impact on brake behaviour. In present experiment, the contribution of stereo vision was investigated when performing a braking task Methods 26 female participants with normal (≤ 40 arcsec on a Grade Circle Test; StereoN; N = 13) or weak (≥ 800 arcsec; StereoW; N = 13) stereo vision performed braking tasks when driving at a speed of approximately 11 km/h on a go-cart. Subjects could start braking at 4, 7 or 10 meters from a target vehicle when a red lamp on the rear of this vehicle lit. The momentanuous position of the go-cart was measured at 200 Hz with a laser (Noptel CMP 2 - 30) and velocity and acceleration were calculated. From these data, time and distance of brake initiation, and time of maximal deceleration were calculated as principal dependent variables and submitted to a 3 (conditions of distance: 4 m vs. 7 m vs. 10 m) x 2 (group conditions: stereoW, stereoN) ANOVA with repeated measures on the first factor. Results StereoW group started braking earlier in time than StereoN (p≤. 05). In the <b>braking</b> <b>adjustment</b> phase, maximal deceleration occurred closer in time to contact for StereoN group than StereoW (p<. 01). This effect increased up to 2596 msec in the 10 m-condition, as the interaction effect showed up (p<. 01). StereoN group reached standstill on a greater distance than StereoW group (p<. 05). Conclusions From this experiment, it can be concluded stereo vision contributes to the initiation as well as to the control of a braking manoeuvre. However, this does not mean that people with a lack of stereo vision may cause greater risks in traffic negotiation, in particular situations in which rear-end collisions may occur. The lack of good stereo vision is even associated with more prudent brake behaviour, i. e. an earlier brake initiation and an earlier maximal deceleration...|$|R
40|$|The new Swiss budget rule or “debt brake” {{is based}} on the idea or rather the aim that the {{structural}} deficit should be zero. 1 Therefore, the size of the structural deficit is of special importance for the conduct of fiscal policy under the debt brake. In 2003, it was estimated that there is a structural deficit in the order of CHF 3. 5 billion, which represents about 7 % of central government expenditure or under 1 % of GDP. In comparison to the European Union deficit rule (Maastricht criteria) of 3 % of GDP, this is of course a small number. However, this excludes the social security accounts, which are not included in the federal financial accounts in Switzerland. In addition, under the regime of the debt <b>brake,</b> the <b>adjustment</b> of a structural deficit has in principle to be immediate, which can be quite painful even for relatively small deficits. The adjustment can also be delayed, but this requires special provisions either through the law or through a decision of parliament to overrule the debt brake for extraordinary circumstances. The latter has to be supported by a qualified majority of both chambers of parliament. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1971, the TR6R Tiger and TR6C Trophy {{adopted the}} P39 frame {{like the other}} 650 models. The twin high pipes were {{retained}} on the left side. The main improvement over the previous models was the handling, helped by the stronger frame and improved front forks. However, many problems occurred with these new models. The oil capacity was reduced, causing the engine to run hot and the new 'conical' hub front <b>brake</b> required frequent <b>adjustment</b> to avoid fade. The new electrics proved unreliable. Mid-year changes attempted to correct these problems. For 1972, a five-speed was offered as an option, thus creating the TR6RV and TR6CV models. The TR6 model ended in 1973 when it {{was replaced by the}} 750-cc TR7 model.|$|R
40|$|A noisy {{disc brake}} vibrates in a wavelike manner with a {{diametral}} mode of vibration. The mode shape exhibits antinodes with angular spacing {{of a specific}} size related to the noise frequency and mode order. The sizes of the antinodes vary slightly with brake pressure which causes a slight change in noise frequency. If the angular spacing of the callipers is arranged such that an integer of antinodes between the callipers is not possible then the disc is inhibited from vibrating in a given mode and noise at that frequency is prevented. The paper demonstrates that at particular angular settings of the callipers certain frequencies exist yet as the angular settings are changed the disc mode order and related frequency changes. It is shown that the frequencies {{can be related to}} the angular spacing between the callipers and the free mode angular spacing of the disc waveform antinodes. An analysis of the geometry allowed the brake noise frequency to be predicted for a certain angular setting of the callipers and specific angular settings to be predicted when the brake would be quiet. It is shown that this analysis was successfully applied in practice on the test rig and on the problematic vehicle. It is shown that the theory may be extended to single calliper <b>brakes</b> and <b>adjustment</b> of the pad/disc interface geometry...|$|R
50|$|Brake {{failure is}} also caused by brake drum thermal {{expansion}} in which brake shoe clearance becomes excessive from wear. This was largely remedied in the 1950s by self-adjusting brakes. Maladjustment with wear {{is still a}} factor in trucks with drum air brakes. A Canadian survey of randomly stopped heavy trucks found over 10% of trucks using self-adjusting brakes {{had at least one}} <b>brake</b> out of <b>adjustment,</b> due either to failure of the self-adjust mechanism or wear beyond the capacity of the self adjuster. Newer brake pistons ("cans") extend stroke from about 65 mm to about 75 mm; since about 30 mm of stroke is used just putting the pads in contact with the drum, the added 10 mm of stroke is over 25% increase in useful stroke. Longer stroke reduces especially wear-related fade, but drum brakes are still fundamentally prone to fade when hot.|$|R

Hamilton began to lap faster than any other driver {{in an effort to}} move into the lead upon making his pit stop. He was asked by his team on lap 28 to make an energy recover switch to increase his car's harvesting rate but had not made a forward <b>brake</b> bias <b>adjustment.</b> When Hamilton applied his brakes for the Descida do Lado turn, his rear tyre locked and attempted to regain control of his oversteering car but went off into the corner's run-off area.

Ricciardo's front-left suspension began to move unsteadily on the main straight on lap 39, and entering the Senna chicane, his car veered right. Ricciardo limped back to the pit lane to retire, ending his fifteen-race finishing streak, extending back following the Malaysian Grand Prix. Hülkenberg attacked Bottas entering the Senna chicane and passed the Williams driver for eighth after forcing him onto the turn's run-off area on lap 42. Räikkönen immediately took advantage and attacked Bottas who defended at the outside of the Descida do Lago corner before the Ferrari got ahead of Bottas who went wide leaving the turn. Bottas made a pit stop on lap 44 which proved problematic: one of his mechanics struggled to make a front wing adjustment and Bottas emerged in 16th place. Magnussen was suffering worse tyre degradation than teammate Button and came under attack from Alonso on lap 45, who moved to the outside lane heading towards the Senna chicane but was unable to pass. The battle continued through the following corners and Magnussen went defensive driving into the Descida do Lago turn which compromised his exit and Alonso overtook him around the inside of turn five.|$|R
50|$|In this episode, Martin {{attempts}} {{to break the}} world speed record for a gravity racer, set in 2012 by American Doug Anderson at 84.4 mph on a public road in North Carolina. Under Guinness World Records rules {{it was to be}} human controlled and undergo a controlled stop, but could take place anywhere, with push starts allowed. Working with a team from Sheffield Hallam University (one of whom also appeared in the gravity sled episode) and external contractors, a custom racer is designed and built. A 2 km stretch of public road on Mont Ventoux, Southern France, is chosen (closed and additionally crash barriered for runs), with a timing gate on the fastest 100m measuring the racer's average speed. It touches on the history of racing, the Derby Downs races of the 1930s and the car manufacturer builds in the 2000s at Goodwood, and examines the science and engineering involved - gravity, rolling resistance, inertia, braking and stopping distances. Martin pulls a truck under the guidance of Gemma Magnusson, tests braking distances on a mountain bike and gets towed on a rig to identify the best wheels. Taught the basics by Street luge champion Helene Schmit, Martin reaches 48 mph at a course in Pontrhyfendigiad, Mid Wales. The completed racer, weighing 190 kg (with Martin), has a steel chassis, carbon fibre fairing, and disc brakes on all four 21-inch wheels. Braking is by foot pedal, with in-cockpit <b>brake</b> balance <b>adjustment.</b> The SHU team are trained in push starts by Team GB athletes Nikki McSweeney and Anya Kay at the University of Bath bobsled facility. In testing at Harewood Hill Climb in Leeds, Martin reaches 38 mph and finds no issues. On the first day in France, after walking the course, Martin reaches 71 mph on a first practice run, with no push start. With changed tyres and a push start, he reaches 77.2 mph on the second practice, but experiences handling issues, so 5 kg of ballast is added (in the form of 5 bottles of water). On a third and final practice run he reaches 81.8 mph. On the second day - with tyre pressure increased and a further 5.5 kg added, the record was attempted and beaten with a run of 85.6 mph, but Martin reports handling issues under braking again. It is decided to make a second run to find the racer's max speed, adding a further 10 kg, taking the total weight to 200 kg. During braking, the racer fishtails, spins around and hits the barrier, causing it to roll over several times before coming to rest on its roof, but still on the road. Emerging unscathed but with the racer damaged beyond repair, Martin reflects that he should have paused the run when he had felt braking issues in the first corner, to make further adjustments and go again.|$|R
