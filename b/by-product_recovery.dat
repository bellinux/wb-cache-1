Versatility of applications ranging from biomedicines, textile, food, pharmaceuticals to cosmetics made chitin a lucrative way to channel waste from marine food processing industry into valuable products. Despite potential of providing outstanding properties for commercial purposes, the industrial application of chitin in various sectors is still limited due to issues regarding optimization of mechanical and biological properties according to intended application.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Industrial Technologies, Mining Industry of the Future Program, {{works with}} the mining {{industry}} to further the industry's advances toward environmental and economic goals. Two of these goals are (1) responsible emission and by-product management and (2) low-cost and efficient production (DOE 1998). DOE formed an alliance with the National Mining Association (NMA) to strengthen the basis for research projects conducted to benefit the mining industry. NMA and industry representatives actively participate in this alliance by evaluating project proposals and by recommending research project selection to DOE. Similarly, the National Research Council (NRC) has recently and independently recommended research and technology development opportunities in the mining industry (NRC 2001). The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Colorado School of Mines engineers conducted one such project for DOE regarding by -product recovery from mining process residue. The results of this project include this report on mining industry process residue and waste with opportunity for <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery.</b> The U. S. mineral processing industry produces over 30, 000, 000 metric tons per year of process residue and waste that may contain hazardous species as well as valuable by-products. This study evaluates the copper, lead, and zinc commodity sectors which generate between 23, 300, 000 and 24, 000, 000 metric tons per year. The distribution of residual elements in process residues and wastes varies over wide ranges* because of variations in the original ore content as it is extracted from the earth's crust. In the earth's crust, the elements of interest to mining fall into two general geochemical classifications, lithophiles and chalcophiles** (Cox 1997). Groups of elements are almost always present together in a given geochemical classification, but the relative amounts of each element are unique to a particular ore body. This paper generally describes copper, lead, and zinc mining operations and their associated process wastes and residues.

Closing down of iron ore mines due to environmental constraints spurred the captive iron ore washing plants to workon a custom plant mode and also recover the values from their slimy tails. This paper enumerates the difficulties faced by a captive iron ore fine washing plant [treating iron ore fines assaying Fe∼ 58 % yielding sands assaying Fe> 60 %] due to raw material change yielding unsalable sands {{and discuss the}} importance of process plant audit for improving the mineral processing plant performance. Based on the base line study, laboratory tests on typical samples followed by short term modifications, retrofitting of downstream slime concentrating wet high intensity magnetic separators and dewatering of products could produce readily salable sinter grade [Fe> 60 %] and pellet grade[Fe> 62. 5 %] with an overall increase of concentrate yield by 11. 5 %. Even the previous wash plant tails [which assayed Fe > 45 %] may be reprocessed in the retrofitted slime processing VPWHIMS plant. The final tails assayed 38. 60 % Fe at weight % yield of 28. 5. Efforts are on for utilizing the above tails in bricks- tiles manufacture. Also, R&D efforts to concentrate Fe values from above 38. 60 % Fe tails by Magnetizing roast followed by magnetic separations in bench scale has given encouraging results. Thus auditing not only improved the quality, quantity and rate of production of concentrate but mitigated the problem of tailing disposal.

40|$|A {{by-product}} of glucose produced during sterilization (121 °C, 15 lb/in 2, 15 min) at neutral pH {{and in the}} presence of phosphate (i. e., phosphate-buffered saline) was bactericidal to Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 (ATCC 43895). Other six-carbon (fructose and galactose) and five-carbon (arabinose, ribose, and xylose) reducing sugars also produced a toxic by-product under the same conditions. Fructose and the five-carbon sugars yielded the most bactericidal activity. Glucose concentrations of 1 % (wt/vol) resulted in a 99. 9 % decline in the CFU of stationary-phase cells per milliliter in 2 days at 25 °C. An rpoS mutant (pRR 10 ::rpoS) of strain 43895 (FRIK 816 - 3) was significantly (P < 0. 001) more sensitive to the glucose-phosphate by-product than the parent strain, as glucose concentrations from 0. 05 to 0. 25 % resulted in a 2 - to 3 -log 10 reduction in CFU per milliliter in 2 days at 25 °C. Likewise, log-phase cells of the wild-type strain, 43895, were significantly more sensitive (P < 0. 001) to the glucose-phosphate by-product than were stationary-phase cells, which is consistent with the stability of rpoS and the regulation of rpoS-regulated genes. The bactericidal effect of the glucose-phosphate by-product was reduced when strains ATCC 43895 and FRIK 816 - 3 were incubated at a low temperature (4 °C). Also, growth in glucose-free medium (i. e., nutrient broth) did not alleviate the sensitivity to the glucose-phosphate by-product and excludes the possibility of substrate-accelerated death as the cause of the bactericidal effect observed. The glucose-phosphate by-product was also bactericidal to Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae, and a Klebsiella sp. Attempts to identify the glucose-phosphate by-product were unsuccessful. These studies demonstrate the production of a glucose-phosphate by-product bactericidal to E. coli O 157 :H 7 and the protective effects afforded by rpoS-regulated gene products.

The polyporal fungus Trametes versicolor was cultivated in soy or barley media supplemented with dry olive mill residue (DOR) as well as with grape pomace and stalks (GPS) in solid state fermentation (SSF). This strategy led to a 4 -fold increase in the activity of laccase, the principal enzyme produced by SFF, in DOR-soy media as compared to controls. T. versicolor managed to secrete lignin-modifying enzymes in GPS, although no stimulative effect was observed. GPS-barley media turned out to be the appropriate medium to elicit most of the carbohydrate active enzymes. The reuse of exhausted solid by-products as amendments after fermentation was also investigated. The water soluble compound polymerization profile of fermented residues was found to correlate with the effect of phytotoxic depletion. The incubation of DOR and GPS with T. versicolor not only reduced its phytotoxicity but also stimulated the plant growth.

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth in demand for certain materials, {{compounded}} by political risks associated with the geographical concentration of the supply of them, a shortage of these materials could be a potential bottleneck to the deployment of low-carbon energy technologies. In order to assess whether such shortages could jeopardise {{the objectives of the}} EU’s Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan), an improved understanding of these risks is vital. In particular, this report examines the use of metals in the six low-carbon energy technologies of SET-Plan, namely: nuclear, solar, wind, bioenergy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and electricity grids. The study looks at the average annual demand for each metal for the deployment of the technologies in Europe between 2020 and 2030. The demand of each metal is compared to the respective global production volume in 2010. This ratio (expressed as a percentage) allows comparing the relative stress that the deployment of the six technologies in Europe is expected to create on the global supplies for these different metals. The study identifies 14 metals for which the deployment of the six technologies will require 1 % or more (and in some cases, much more) of current world supply per annum between 2020 and 2030. These 14 significant metals, in order of decreasing demand, are tellurium, indium, tin, hafnium, silver, dysprosium, gallium, neodymium, cadmium, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and selenium. The metals are examined further in terms of the risks of meeting the anticipated demand by analysing in detail the likelihood of rapid future global demand growth, limitations to expanding supply in the short to medium term, and the concentration of supply and political risks associated with key suppliers. The report pinpoints 5 of the 14 metals to be at high risk, namely: the rare earth metals neodymium and dysprosium, and the by-products (from base metals) indium, tellurium and gallium. The report explores a set of potential mitigation strategies, ranging from expanding European output, increasing recycling and reuse to reducing waste and finding substitutes for these metals in their main applications. A number of recommendations are provided which include: •	ensuring that materials used in significant quantities are included in the Raw Materials Yearbook proposed by the Raw Materials Initiative ad hoc Working Group, •	the publication of regular studies on supply and demand for critical metals, •	efforts to ensure reliable supply of ore concentrates at competitive prices, •	promoting R&D and demonstration projects on new lower cost separation processes, particularly those from by-product or tailings containing rare earths, •	collaborating with other countries/regions with a shared agenda of risk reduction, •	raising awareness and engaging in an active dialogue with zinc, copper and aluminium refiners over <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery,</b> •	creating incentives to encourage <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery</b> in zinc, copper and aluminium refining in Europe, •	promoting the further development of recycling technologies and increasing end-of-life collection, •	measures for the implementation of the revised WEEE Directive, and •	investing broadly in alternative technologies.

A common process for the production of antioxidant extracts (a two-step hydro alcoholic solvent extraction) and another for the fractionation of cellulose (an acid hydrolysis step followed by an alkali hydrolysis and, then, an oxidative bleaching step) was applied to all the materials with the objective of selecting ideally a unique by-product for the production of both antioxidants and cellulose. The extracts were characterised in terms of total phenols content (based on Folin assay and expressed as gallic acid equivalents) and antioxidant activity (evaluated with both the radical ABTS test and the Ferric Reducing/Antioxidant Power assay). The highest total phenols recovery was obtained for orange peels (9. 50 ± 0. 66 mg per g of dried by-product), while the yields for the other byproducts were not statistically different and ≤ 2 mg/g. Regarding the antioxidant activity, all the extracts showed very similar results with the ABTS assay, whereas orange peels extract exhibited the highest level of FRAP activity. The obtained cellulose residues were analysed for the total cellulose content and the level of lignin and hemicellulose impurities. In this case, the best by-product resulted wheat straw, with the recovery of 45 % of the original cellulose, a cellulose content (purity) of 84 % and residual impurities of hemicelluloses and lignin of 2 % and 12 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Waelz slag is an {{industrial}} <b>by-product</b> from the <b>recovery</b> of {{electric arc furnace}} (EAF) dust which is mainly sent to landfills. Despite the different chemical and mineralogical compositions of Waelz slag compared to traditional clays, previous experiments have demonstrated its potential use as a clay substitute in ceramic processes. Indeed, clayey products containing Waelz slag could improve mechanical and environmental performance, fixing most of the metallic species and moreover decreasing the release of some potential pollutants during firing. However, {{a deeper understanding of}} the complex phase transformations during its thermal treatment and the connection of this behaviour with the end properties is desirable in order to explain the role that is played by the Waelz slag and its potential contribution to the ceramic process. For this purpose, in the present study, the chemical, mineralogical, thermal and environmental behaviour of both (i) unfired powdered samples, and (ii) pressed specimen of Waelz slag fired up to different temperatures within the typical range of clay based ceramic production, has been studied. The effect of the heating temperature on the end properties of the fired samples has been assessed. In general, an increase of the firing temperature promotes sintering and densification of the products and decreases the open porosity and water absorption which also contributes to the fixation of heavy metals. On the contrary, an increase in the leaching of Pb, Cr and Mo from the fired specimens is observed. This can be attributed to the creation of Fe and Ca molybdates and chromates that are weakly retained in the alkali matrix. On the other side, at temperature above 950 °C a weight gain related to the emission of evolved gases is observed. In conclusion, the firing temperature of the ceramic process is a key parameter that affects not only the technical properties but also strongly affects the leaching behaviour and the process emissions.

40|$|Coal {{combustion}} by-products {{generated from}} {{coal-fired power plant}} and cause enormous problems for disposal unless a way can be found to utilize these <b>by-products</b> through resource <b>recovery</b> programs. The implementation of air act regulations to reduce NOx emission have resulted millions of tonnes of pulverised fuel ash (PFA) accumulated with high percentage of unburned carbon made it un-saleable for the cement industry. Moreover, alternative fuels such as biomass and import coals were suggested to reduce gas emissions {{but on the other}} hand PFA marketability was reduced. The main objective of this study was thus to utilise high carbon PFA into value added products. Through this work, the relationships beside the factors that could influence the carbon content in the PFA and reduce it in terms of producing raw material useful for different applications were explored. These factors were extensively investigated through thermogravimetric analyses, surface area measurements, microscopy and optical studies, and particle size distribution analyses. Five high unburned carbon PFAs were selected as feedstocks for PFA beneficiation, cement tests, and carbon activation. In order to beneficiate a high carbon PFA, incipient fluidisation was selected as the preferred route being a dry separation method which does not expose the carbon to potential contaminants that may alter its reactivity or physical properties. Enriched PFAs (i. e. depleted carbon) were separated and then cement tests were conducted in different mixture ratios (PFA/cement) throughout different time scales. These tests were demonstrated by using samples derived from biomass co-firing and import coals. The PFA/cement mixtures achieved good strength and workability via standard values. Unburned carbon (i. e. enriched carbon) streams were activated using steam at temperature 850 C and time from 60 - 300 minutes. For all unburned carbons investigated in this project, the surface areas of their activated counterparts increased to reach maximum level after three hours and four hours compared with other works. But this increase dropped back according to the reduction of the pore widening. Consequently, the surface area exhibited a high level of low carbon burn-out for the carbon sourced from biomass co-firing (1435 m 2 /g and 38 wt. %, respectively). This was revealed due to the carbon gasification and pore widening level. In addition, optical studies showed that the carbon types changed in a different manner during the activation.

40|$|The Cement Kiln Flue Gas Recovery Scrubber Project was a {{technical}} success and demonstrated the following: CKD {{can be used}} successfully as the sole reagent for removing SO 2 from cement kiln flue gas, with removal efficiencies of 90 percent or greater; Removal efficiencies for HCl and VOCs were approximately 98 percent and 70 percent, respectively; Particulate emissions were low, {{in the range of}} 0. 005 to 0. 007 grains/standard cubic foot; The treated CKD sorbent can be recycled to the kiln after its potassium content has been reduced in the scrubber, thereby avoiding the need for landfilling; The process can yield fertilizer-grade K 2 SO 4, a saleable by-product; and Waste heat in the flue gas can provide the energy required for evaporation and crystallization in the <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery</b> operation. The demonstration program established the feasibility of using the Recovery Scrubber{trademark} for desulfurization of flue gas from cement kilns, with generally favorable economics, assuming tipping fees are available for disposal of ash from biomass combustion. The process appears to be suitable for commercial use on any type of cement kiln. EPA has ruled that CKD is a nonhazardous waste, provided the facility meets Performance Standards for the Management of CKD (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1999 d). Therefore, regulatory drivers for the technology focus more on reduction of air pollutants and pollution prevention, rather than on treating CKD as a hazardous waste. Application of the Recovery Scrubbe{trademark} concept to other waste-disposal operations, where pollution and waste reductions are needed, appears promising...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{analysis is}} presented involving alternative processes and costs for producing liquid fuels and chemicals from sources other than petroleum. A number of critical conclusions are drawn {{and recommendations for}} future development are made. ^ Earlier studies conclude that the highest priority {{is the development of}} synthetic fuels; because of capital cost (1 to 5 billion $) other alternatives must be sought. Liquid fuels from biomass is an attractive alternative because biomass is renewable. ^ Acid or enzyme hydrolysis converts the cellulosic fraction of biomass into fermentable sugars. Acid hydrolysis recovers about 50 to 60 % of the available sugars; moreover, glucose decomposition products are unavoidable and costly to separate. Enzyme hydrolysis also converts cellulose to reducing sugars but the cellulose should be separated from about 50 % of the lignin for effective enzyme action. In contrast to acid hydrolysis, no commercial enzyme hydrolysis plants are operating yet. ^ Acid hydrolysis costs are estimated to range between $ 1. 90 to $ 2. 00 per gallon (25 million gal/yr plant); the capital investment is about $ 100 million. For the same size plant using enzyme hydrolysis from Thermomonospora the capital expenditure is $ 104 million with a selling price of $ 1. 90 per gallon for a 24 % return; 60 % of the investment is borrowed. A sensitivity analysis shows that <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery</b> is important; an income increase of $ 0. 37 per gallon results if at least 60 % is recovered. The wood feedstock cost can vary up to $ 37 per ton and still return 18 % after taxes. Sensitivity to several other factors arises: enzyme activity and enzyme production schedule; level of by-products recovered; model assumed for cellulose hydrolysis; batch or continuous method of glucose fermentation. ^ Computations show that extractive distillation of 5 % ethanol to 99. 6 % ethanol using calcium chloride reduces the steam consumption by more than a factor of 2 compared to conventional distillation. ^ Stopping the process at the glucose step is not economic; the cellulose pulp is then more valuable as a paper feedstock than as a substrate for hydrolysis to glucose. ^ Finally, a detailed material and heat balance is given in addition to new ethanol-water enthalpy tables at atmospheric and reduced pressure. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen the {{development}} of considerable interest in activities involving the recovery of materials and byproducts from the waste streams of industrial firms and their utilisation, by either the waste-producing firms themselves or other firms, as raw material inputs into production processes. This interest derives, of course, from community concern in the developed nations regarding the problem of environmental pollution. The use of waste recovery and re-use techniques actually reduces the volume of industrial wastes requiring discharge, {{in one form or}} another, into the environment and thus avoids the environmental pollution problems which tend to accompany the waste disposal activities of industrial firms. It would appear however, that waste recovery and re-use techniques have not yet received wide application, with economic considerations apparently playing an important role. This study focusses on the Illawarra region {{as an example of a}} region in which waste recovery and re-use activities have not yet received wide application and investigates the treatment given in the economics literature to these activities, with this investigation being carried out with a view to assessing the contribution that has been made by economists to both the understanding of the particular nature of waste recovery and re-use activities and the stock of policy prescriptions appropriate as a means of inducing an increase in the level and extent of those activities and thus achieving a significant and sustained improvement in environmental quality. A subsidiary aim involved in carrying out this literature review is that of outlining and assessing the current state-of-theart in respect of the treatment of recovery and re-use activities by economists. The thesis is divided into six chapters. Chapter I introduces the study by briefly outlining some of the background of, and justification for, the literature review carried out. Chapter II expands on this brief introduction by considering, and explaining, both the interest which has been expressed in waste recovery and re-use activities in the Illawarra region in recent years and the observation that these activities appear to be 2 ̆ 7 restricted and fragmented 2 ̆ 7. Chapters III and IV present a detailed examination of the economics literature concerned with the analysis of waste recovery and re-use activities. The first of these chapters considers the literature concerned with the inclusion of these activities in analyses relating to the problem of environmental pollution. These analyses have been carried out within the theoretical framework provided by modern welfare economics. The economy-wide perspective of the static and dynamic general equilibrium analysis carried out within this framework reveals that the factors underlying the restricted and fragmented nature of waste recovery and re-use activities basically relate to the existence of a defective system of economic incentives arising out of deficiencies in the operation of market processes. The second chapter referred to above examines the work of those economists who have analysed waste recovery activities by including them within a framework which deals explicitly with that entity known as 2 ̆ 7 the firm 2 ̆ 7. The theoretical and quantitative analysis carried out within this framework indicates that economic factors are seen by economists as playing an extremely important role in the behaviour of firms in relation to waste generation, abatement and discharge activities. The emphasis placed on economic factors in the literature is accompanied by the prescription of policies, particularly the effluent charge strategy, which seek to induce an increase in the amount of materials and <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery</b> carried on through market related means. In view of this Chapter V considers, and evaluates the importance of, problems and difficulties likely to be encountered in any practical implementation of the effluent charge strategy. It is concluded (Chapter VI) that the economics literature has made an important contribution to the understanding of waste recovery and re-use activities as they are carried on in the Illawarra region. The factors making for the particular nature of these activities, however, operate on an economy-wide scale, so that the policies advanced by the literature represent an approach that might be taken by governments at a state or national, rather than regional, level...|$|E
40|$|Sequestration {{of carbon}} dioxide in mineral rocks, also known as CO 2 Capture and Mineralization (CCM), is {{considered}} to have a huge potential in stabilizing anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. One of the CCM routes is the ex situ indirect gas/sold carbonation of reactive materials, such as Mg(OH) 2, produced from abundantly available Mg-silicate rocks. The gas/solid carbonation method is intensively researched at Åbo Akademi University (ÅAU), Finland because it is energetically attractive and utilizes the exothermic chemistry of Mg(OH) 2 carbonation. In this thesis, a method for producing Mg(OH) 2 from Mg-silicate rocks for CCM was investigated, and the process efficiency, energy and environmental impact assessed. The Mg(OH) 2 process studied here was first proposed in 2008 in a Master’s Thesis by the author. At that time the process was applied to only one Mg-silicate rock (Finnish serpentinite from the Hitura nickel mine site of Finn Nickel) and the optimum process conversions, energy and environmental performance were not known. Producing Mg(OH) 2 from Mg-silicate rocks involves a two-staged process of Mg extraction and Mg(OH) 2 precipitation. The first stage extracts Mg and other cations by reacting pulverized serpentinite or olivine rocks with ammonium sulfate (AS) salt at 400 - 550 oC (preferably < 450 oC). In the second stage, ammonia solution reacts with the cations (extracted from the first stage after they are leached in water) to form mainly FeOOH, high purity Mg(OH) 2 and aqueous (dissolved) AS. The Mg(OH) 2 process described here is closed loop in nature; gaseous ammonia and water vapour are produced from the extraction stage, recovered and used as reagent for the precipitation stage. The AS reagent is thereafter recovered after the precipitation stage. The Mg extraction stage, being the conversion-determining and the most energy-intensive step of the entire CCM process chain, received a prominent attention in this study. The extraction behavior and reactivity of different rocks types (serpentinite and olivine rocks) from different locations worldwide (Australia, Finland, Lithuania, Norway and Portugal) was tested. Also, parametric evaluation was carried out to determine the optimal reaction temperature, time and chemical reagent (AS). Effects of reactor types and configuration, mixing and scale-up possibilities were also studied. The Mg(OH) 2 produced {{can be used to}} convert CO 2 to thermodynamically stable and environmentally benign magnesium carbonate. Therefore, the process energy and life cycle environmental performance of the ÅAU CCM technique that first produces Mg(OH) 2 and the carbonates in a pressurized fluidized bed (FB) were assessed. The life cycle energy and environmental assessment approach applied in this thesis is motivated {{by the fact that the}} CCM technology should in itself offer a solution to what is both an energy and environmental problem. Results obtained in this study show that different Mg-silicate rocks react differently; olivine rocks being far less reactive than serpentinite rocks. In summary, the reactivity of Mg-silicate rocks is a function of both the chemical and physical properties of rocks. Reaction temperature and time remain important parameters to consider in process design and operation. Heat transfer properties of the reactor determine the temperature at which maximum Mg extraction is obtained. Also, an increase in reaction temperature leads to an increase in the extent of extraction, reaching a maximum yield at different temperatures depending on the reaction time. Process energy requirement for producing Mg(OH) 2 from a hypothetical case of an iron-free serpentine rock is 3. 62 GJ/t-CO 2. This value can increase by 16 - 68 % depending on the type of iron compound (FeO, Fe 2 O 3 or Fe 3 O 4) in the mineral. This suggests that the benefit from the potential use of FeOOH as an iron ore feedstock in iron and steelmaking should be determined by considering the energy, cost and emissions associated with the FeOOH <b>by-product.</b> AS <b>recovery</b> through crystallization is the second most energy intensive unit operation after the extraction reaction. However, the choice of mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) over the “simple evaporation” crystallization method has a potential energy savings of 15. 2 GJ/t-CO 2 (84 % savings). Integrating the Mg(OH) 2 production method and the gas/solid carbonation process could provide up to an 25 % energy offset to the CCM process energy requirements. Life cycle inventory assessment (LCIA) results show that for every ton of CO 2 mineralized, the ÅAU CCM process avoids 430 - 480 kg CO 2. The Mg(OH) 2 process studied in this thesis has many promising features. Even at the current high energy and environmental burden, producing Mg(OH) 2 from Mg-silicates can play a significant role in advancing CCM processes. However, dedicated future research and development (R&D) have potential to significantly improve the Mg(OH) 2 process performance...|$|R
