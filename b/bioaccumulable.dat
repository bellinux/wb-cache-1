40|$|Organic halogens from chlorobleaching of {{kraft pulp}} {{were not as}} biorecalcitrant as has been assumed. Fifty percent were removed during biotreatment of wastewater, and 50 % of the {{remaining}} organohalogens faded in fresh water ecosystems in 200 to 400 days. Molecular size seemed not to hinder biodegradation up to sizes of approximately 2000 daltons. Anoxic biodegradation was of prime importance for halomineralization of pulp bleaching organohalogens but could also lead to toxic metabolites such as vinyl chloride from tri- and tetrachloroethene in anoxic soil. Indigenous soil microbes were unable to clean old organohalogen pollution but had converted chlorophenols into polymeric substances, chlorohumus, which were found <b>bioaccumulable</b> by earthworms {{in spite of the}} large (up to 5000 g/mole) molecular sizes. Because of the danger of formation of toxic metabolites, the biochemistry of the xenobiotic degradation must be elucidated before active bioremediation is practiced on polluted soil or water. Groundwater pollution by chlorophenols led to increased disease among the exposed population in one well-studied case. Two further cases of potential environmental health impact are described. - Environ Health Perspect 1 03 (Suppl 5) : 63 - 69 (1995...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHere, we {{show the}} {{possibility}} to change superhydrophobic properties from soft to hard polymer nanofibers by {{the control of the}} nature of branched molecules. In fact, we report the synthesis of original monomers derived from 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) and bearing two branched alkyl chains and their electrodeposition by cyclic voltammetry. We point out that hydrocarbon moiety (cheaper, available, non-toxic) can be an alternative to long fluorocarbon chains (expensive, from synthetic pathways, <b>bioaccumulable)</b> to reach anti-wetting properties. Moreover, we show that the change in the size of branched chains can change the surface morphology, from soft to hard nanofibers with an increase in the water adhesion due to a lower intrinsic hydrophobicity. Surprisingly, if these hard nanofibers can by generally obtained from inorganic chemistry, which are more resistance to lateral collapse and coalescence, we demonstrate {{the possibility to}} produce them from soft matter, i. e. polymers. In the case of the hard nanofibers, cross-section images reveal that these fibers are vertically aligned to the substrate. Moreover, we show that the height and the diameter of the hard nanofibers, as well as the distance between the fibers can be controlled by the number of deposition scans. Such materials could be used for many biomedical applications...|$|E

40|$|Perfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) {{are emerging}} pollutants with so peculiar physico-chemical characteristics that these compounds found wide applications in several industrial processes and daily products. Their characteristics {{and the wide}} use make them widespread in all environmental compartments, very persistent and partially <b>bioaccumulable.</b> A past survey at the basin closures of the main European rivers highlighted that river Po was the most contaminated (200 ng/L) by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the currently most diffused perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA). This evidence led to a funded project which aimed to evaluate the PFAA distribution in main Italian river basins and to assess the correlated environmental and sanitary risks. An UHPLC-MS/MS multi-residue method based on an on-line SPE procedure was developed for the simultaneous determination of 12 PFAAs to support the sampling program in river basins that covered about 40 % of the Italian surface area and about 45 % of the Italian population. In Italy the most important sources of PFAA are fluorochemical plants, followed by discharges from tannery and textile industrial districts, while the contribution of urban areas is limited. Considering the most populated and industrialized Italian area, the river Lambro basin, Lombardy, detailed mass balance of the emission sources have been carried out. The environmental risks for the aquatic ecosystem were evaluated in river Bormida (Piedmont) downstream the discharge of a fluoropolymer plant {{which is the most}} significant source of PFOA in Italy.

40|$|International audienceThe {{consumption}} of pharmaceuticals and their excretion in wastewater is a continuous {{source of pollution}} for aquatic ecosystems. In certain cases these compounds {{are found in the}} environment at concentrations high enough to cause disturbance in aquatic organisms. Aware of this problem hospitals are giving increasing attention to the nature of their effluents and their impact on the environment, by implementing more efficient effluent management policies. This concern is justified in view of the large volumes of toxic products consumed (detergents, disinfectants, pharmaceuticals, chemical reagents, radioactive elements, etc.). Moreover, these effluents usually do not undergo any specific treatment before being discharged into urban sewage networks. In this article, we present a method for selecting the pharmaceuticals discharged in hospital effluents that have the worst impact on the aquatic ecosystem, primarily based on their bioaccumulation potential. This study focused on the pharmaceuticals consumed at the Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), the second largest hospital structure in France (5200 hospital beds). Of the 960 substances consumed in HCL hospitals, a shortlist of 70 substances considered as being potentially <b>bioaccumulable</b> was established. The use of aggravating factors of risk has then led to the final selection of 14 priority compounds. They include 4 compounds consumed in large quantities in HCL hospitals, 6 endocrine disruptors and 4 potentially ecotoxic compounds. For all these compounds, it is now advisable to verify their bioaccumulation potential experimentally and confirm their presence in the environment. In addition, in order to monitor the risk relating to possible contamination of the food chain, {{it will be necessary to}} measure accumulated dose levels in species of different trophic levels. Lastly, chronic ecotoxicity tests will permit evaluating the danger and risk that some of these substances may represent for aquatic ecosystems...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is}} to address the questions of the abundance, distribution, production and exchanges of methylated mercury species (MeHgT), including MMHg and dimethylmercury (DMHg), in the waters, atmosphere and sediments of the Northwestern Mediterranean margin including the Rhone River delta, the continental shelf and its slope (Gulf of Lions) and the adjacent open sea (North Gyre). Concentrations of MeHgT ranged from < 0. 02 to 0. 48 pmol L- 1 with highest values associated with the oxygen-deficient zone of the open sea. The methylated mercury to total mercury proportion (MeHgT/HgT) increased from 2 % to 4 % in the Rhone River to up to 30 % (averaging 18 %) in the North Gyre waters, whereas, within the shelf waters, MeHgT/HgT proportions were the lowest (1 - 3 %). We calculate that the open sea is the major source of MeHgT for the shelf waters, with an annual flux estimated at 0. 68 +/- 0. 12 kmol a(- 1) (i. e., equivalent to 12 % of the HgT flux). This MeHgT influx is more than 80 times the direct atmospheric deposition or the in situ net production, more than 40 times the estimated "maximum potential" annual efflux from shelf sediment, and more than 7 times that of the continental sources. In the open sea, ratios of MMHg/DMHg in waters were always < 1 and minimum in the oxygen deficient zones of the water column, where MeHg concentrations are maximum. This observation supports the idea that MMHg could be a degradation product of DMHg produced from inorganic divalent Hg...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEndocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDC) {{are found}} in many {{everyday}} products, like food packaging, food preservative or additive, pesticides residues, etc… Widely distributed throughout the environment and <b>bioaccumulable</b> in living organisms, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a specific class of EDC that accumulate in fat deposit. Some {{of them have been}} recognized as causing adverse effects on human’s health such as diabetes and cancer by mimicking hormone effects on metabolism. Cancer cells display high metabolic flexibility allowing them to grow in various cellular environments and favoring their proliferative and invasive capacities. Mitochondria are key players in this complex interplay as they produce ROS, generate energy and participate in nucleotide synthesis and in glutamine metabolism of cancer cells. Regarding the importance of hormones on prostate cancer risk and outcomes, we are developing multiple parameters in vitro assays conducted in a high-throughput screening format relevant for prostate cancer metabolism and aggressiveness. This screening method includes, inter alia a microscopy based analysis of mitochondria structure and function. We analyzed the effects of five EDCs (Aldrin, BDE 28, TCDD, PCB 153, PFOA) identified in the plasma of patients on two prostate cancer cell lines, 22 RV 1 (androgen-responsive) and DU 145 (androgen-unresponsive). Each compound was tested in a dose dependent manner to determine its effects on total mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS production, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. In addition, we performed an image based computational analysis of the mitochondrial network morphology and dynamics. This strategy allows us to extract some quantitative parameters on the mitochondrial network as fragmentation index, compactness, average volume, etc. When combined, morphological and functional parameters allow us to discriminate subtle perturbations of the mitochondrial structure-function induced by POPs in prostate cancer cells. We are confident that this multiparameter analysis strategy could represent a new perspective in identification and characterization of EDC based on their effects on cell metabolism (phenoscore) in order to estimate their potential risk on human health...|$|E
40|$|The {{upper limit}} {{concentrations}} of metals established by international legislations for dredged sediment disposal and soil quality {{do not take}} into consideration the properties of tropical soils (generally submitted to more intense weathering processes) on metal availability and ecotoxicity. Aiming to perform an evaluation on the suitability of these threshold values in tropical regions, the ecotoxicity of metal-contaminated dredged sediment from the Guanabara Bay (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) was investigated. Acute and avoidance tests with Eisenia andrei were performed with mixtures of dredged sediment with a ferralsol (0. 00, 6. 66, 13. 12, 19. 98, and 33. 30 %) and a chernosol (0. 00, 6. 58, 13. 16, 19. 74, and 32. 90 %). Mercury, lead, nickel, chromium, copper, and zinc concentrations were measured in test mixtures and in tissues of surviving earthworms from the acute tests. While ferralsol test mixtures provoked significant earthworm avoidance response at concentrations ≥ 13. 31 %, the chernosol mixtures showed significant avoidance behavior only at the 19. 74 % concentration. The acute tests showed higher toxicity in ferralsol mixtures (LC 50 = 9. 9 %) compared to chernosol mixtures (LC 50 = 16. 5 %), and biomass increased at the lowest sediment doses in treatments of both test soils. Most probably, the expansive clay minerals present in chernosol contributed to reduce metal availability in chernosol mixtures, and consequently, the ecotoxicity of these treatments. The bioconcentration factors (BCF) for zinc and copper were lower with increasing concentrations of the dredged sediment, indicating the existence of internal regulating processes. Although the BCF for mercury also decreased with the increasing test concentrations, the known no biological function of this metal in the earthworms metabolism lead to suppose that Hg measured was not present in <b>bioaccumulable</b> forms. BCFs estimated for the other metals were generally higher in the highest dredged sediment doses.

40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{establishes}} Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) {{in marine}} water for 34 priority substances. Among these substances, 25 are hydrophobic and <b>bioaccumulable</b> (2 metals and 23 organic compounds). For these 25 substances, monitoring in water matrix {{is not appropriate}} and an alternative matrix should be developed. Bivalve mollusks, particularly mussels (Mytilus edulis, Mytilus galloprovincialis), are used by Ifremer as a quantitative biological indicator since 1979 in France, to assess the marine water quality. This study {{has been carried out}} in order to determine thresholds in mussels at least as protective as EQS in marine water laid down by the WFD. Three steps are defined: -	Provide an overview of knowledges about the relations between the concentrations of contaminants in the marine water and mussels through bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and bioconcentration factor (BCF). This allows to examine how a BCF or a BAF can be determined: BCF can be determined experimentally (according to US EPA or ASTM standards), or by Quantitative Activity-Structure Relationship models (QSAR) : four equations can be used for mussels. BAF can be determined by field experiment; but none standards exists. It could be determined by using QSAR but this method is considered as invalid for mussels, or by using existing model: Dynamic Budget Model, but this is complex to use. -	Collect concentrations data in marine water (Cwater) in bibliography for those 25 substances; and compare them with concentration in mussels (Cmussels) obtained through French monitoring network of chemicals contaminants (ROCCH) and biological integrator network RINBIO. According to available data, this leads to determine the BAF or the BCF (Cmussels /Cwater) with field data. -	Compare BAF and BCF values (when available) obtained with various methods for these substances: BCF (stemming from the bibliography, using experimental process), BCF calculated by QSAR and BAF determined using field data. This study points out that experimental BCF data are available for 3 substances (Chlorpyrifos, HCH, Pentachlorobenzene). BCF by QSAR can be calculated for 20 substances. The use of field data allows to evaluate 4 BAF for organic compounds and 2 BAF for metals. Using these BAF or BCF value, thresholds in shellfish can be determined as an alternative to EQS in marine water...|$|E
