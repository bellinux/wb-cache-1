2500|$|A {{resurgence}} in violence by Pattani guerrilla groups began after 2001.

50|$|The <b>BRN-Coordinate</b> or BRN-C (BRN-Koordinasi) is {{currently}} the largest, most active and best organised of the BRN subgroups. Rejecting the Pan-Arab socialist thought that influenced the early BRN, it favours Salafist ideology and is involved in political activism in the mosques and indoctrination at Islamic schools. The main recruiting unit of the BRN-C is the Pemuda (youth) student group and its leaders are mainly Islamic religious teachers, including veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|The Pejuang Kemerdekaan Patani (Patani Independence Fighters) are the {{paramilitary}} {{wing of the}} BRN-C. These militant units operate {{in the rural areas}} of southern Thailand working along with the <b>BRN-Coordinate</b> leadership in a loosely organised strictly clandestine cell system dependent on hard-line religious leaders for direction. These armed groups of youth have routinely intimidated and terrorised local Buddhists, as well as local Muslims who don't share the extreme ideologies of the BRN. They are also behind the attacks on schoolteachers.|$|E
