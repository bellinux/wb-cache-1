40|$|The {{taxation}} and grant arrangements for UK forestry were radically changed in April 1988. This paper considers {{the consequence of}} these changes for new forestry investment in Scotland by examining five models which describe different site types. The investment appraisals show that after April 1988 forestry {{will no longer be}} of interest to investors seeking a tax shelter or wishing to <b>invest</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>capital.</b> Acceptable real returns to capital will be found only on relatively good quality sites. A major reduction in the rate of new planting is indicated and a shift away from poorer planting land. The rate and location of new planting will depend critically on farmland prices {{and the extent to which}} better-quality land is released for planting under the normal consultation procedures. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We use {{residual}} income (RI) to decompose earnings growth into growth in RI, growth in <b>invested</b> <b>capital</b> and other components and use this decomposition to explain stock returns. Our approach provides {{a significant increase}} in explanatory power vis-à-vis a regression of returns on levels and changes in earnings. While the market values growth in RI more than growth in <b>invested</b> <b>capital,</b> it still undervalues growth in RI and overvalues growth in <b>invested</b> <b>capital.</b> Earnings growth from growth in RI is more persistent, while earnings growth from growth in <b>invested</b> <b>capital</b> is more likely to reverse. Future returns are positively associated with growth in RI and negatively associated with growth in <b>invested</b> <b>capital.</b> A trading rule based on these findings generates significant hedge returns that persist after controlling for known risk factors. Hence, RI, a measure long recommended by accountants, allows investors to differentiate and evaluate different sources of earnings growth...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We use {{the concept}} of {{residual}} income (RI) to decompose earnings growth into a growth in RI component, growth in <b>invested</b> <b>capital</b> component and other components. We use this decomposition to explain the cross-section of returns.

Further, markets appear to value growth in RI more than growth in <b>invested</b> <b>capital.</b> However, markets undervalue growth in RI and overvalue growth in <b>invested</b> <b>capital,</b> as future returns are positively associated with growth in RI and negatively associated with growth in <b>invested</b> <b>capital.</b> A trading rule based on these findings generates significant hedge returns that persist after controlling for known risk factors.

50|$|To {{compute the}} ratio, take the pro forma net income (same one {{used in the}} EPS figure {{mentioned}} above) and divide it by the <b>invested</b> <b>capital.</b> <b>Invested</b> <b>capital</b> can be estimated by adding together the stockholders equity, the total long and short term debt and accounts payable, and then subtracting accounts receivable and cash (all of these numbers {{can be found on}} the company's latest quarterly balance sheet).

50|$|This {{valuation}} technique measures {{how much}} money the company makes each year per dollar of <b>invested</b> <b>capital.</b> <b>Invested</b> <b>Capital</b> {{is the amount of}} money invested in the company by both stockholders and debtors.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to suggest a concept of {{financial}} planning for business valuation. Entry chapters are dedicated especially to the examination of differences between financial plan as one of company's activities and plan for business valuation. In the following chapter key parameters essentially influencing company's value (value drivers) are described. Two of them are accented: rate of growth and <b>invested</b> <b>capital</b> which is necessary for company's main business including its rate of return. I examine an impact of historical growth of the company, growth based on analyst's estimates and fundamental growth of the company on company's growth rate in the extraordinary growth period (first stage). In the next part I pay attention to factors and empirical studies influencing long term rate of growth. Then the rate of similarity of accounting <b>invested</b> <b>capital</b> and <b>invested</b> <b>capital</b> for business valuation {{and its impact on}} rate of return of <b>invested</b> <b>capital</b> is analysed. I point out intangible assets and in Czech accounting principles financial leasing assets. Then the relationship between rate of return of <b>invested</b> <b>capital</b> and costs of capital is described; the length of the first stage is suggested; use of models, which are necessary for transition of the company to its steady state is suggested; there are company's key characteristics, which change together with stabilization of the company, identified and there are advantages and disadvantages of value drivers formula and Gordon growth formula discussed. An empirical study dealing with planning for business valuation in the Czech Republic, where business valuation experts took part, was accomplished. The results of the study are presented in several different parts of this thesis...|$|R
