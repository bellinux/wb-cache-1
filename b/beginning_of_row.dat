50|$|Founded in 1818, Leander Club is the world's oldest public rowing club. The second oldest club {{which still}} exists is the Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club {{which was founded}} 1836 and marked the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>rowing</b> as an {{organized}} sport in Germany. During the 19th century, as in England, wager matches in North America between professionals became very popular attracting vast crowds. Narragansett Boat Club was founded in 1838 exclusively for rowing. During an 1837 parade in Providence, R.I, a group of boatmen were pulling a longboat on wheels, which carried the oldest living survivor of the 1772 Gaspee Raid. They boasted to the crowd {{that they were the}} fastest rowing crew on the Bay. A group of Providence locals took issue with this and challenged them to race, which the Providence group summarily won. The six-man core of that group went on the following year to found NBC in 1838. Detroit Boat Club was founded in 1839 and is the second oldest continuously-operated rowing club in the U.S. In 1843, the first American college rowing club was formed at Yale University. The Harvard-Yale Regatta is the oldest intercollegiate sporting event in the United States,http://rowinghistory.net/Time%20Line/TL%20-1849images.htm having been contested every year since 1852 (excepting interruptions for wars).|$|R

50|$|Mercury is {{a special}} case of Simple spaces technique. Its name comes from the way mercury pulls back {{from the sides of}} a container.If there is a box in a row that is in the same {{distance}} from the border as the length of the first clue, the first cell will be a space. This is because the first clue would not fit {{to the left of the}} box. It will have to spread through that box, leaving the first cell behind. Furthermore, when the box is actually a block of more boxes to the right, there will be more spaces at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>row,</b> determined by using this method several times.|$|R
50|$|The ISSF World Shooting Championships {{are governed}} by the International Shooting Sport Federation. World Shooting Championships began in 1897, after the {{successful}} 1896 Summer Olympics, and although the ISSF was not founded until 1907, these early competitions are still seen by the organization as the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a continuous <b>row</b> <b>of</b> championships. By this logic, the 2006 competition in Zagreb was called the 49th ISSF World Shooting Championships. These championships, including all ISSF shooting events, are held every four years since 1954. For the shotgun events only, there is an additional World Championship competition in odd-numbered years. These extra competitions are not numbered. In running target, there will be World Championships in Olympic years.|$|R
2500|$|Crocheted {{fabric is}} begun {{by placing a}} slip-knot loop on the hook (though other methods, such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used), pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a {{suitable}} length. The chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined to the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>row</b> with a slip stitch and worked in rounds. Rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop. Stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain. At any one time {{at the end of}} a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook. Tunisian crochet, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time. [...] Like knitting, crochet can be worked either flat or in the round.|$|R
5000|$|Rowing is a {{low impact}} {{activity}} with movement only in defined ranges, so twist and sprain injuries are rare. However, the repetitive rowing action can put strain on knee joints, the spine and the tendons of the forearm, and inflammation of {{these are the most}} common rowing injuries. If one rows with poor technique, especially rowing with a curved rather than straight back, other injuries may surface, including back pains. Blisters occur for almost all rowers, especially in the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> one's <b>rowing</b> career, as every stroke puts pressure on the hands, though rowing frequently tends to harden hands and generate protective calluses. Holding the oars too tightly or making adjustments to technique may cause recurring or new blisters, as it is common to feather the blade (previously described). Another common injury is getting [...] "track bites", thin cuts on the back of one's calf or thigh caused by contact with the seat tracks {{at either end of the}} stroke.|$|R
30|$|In {{the current}} study, rowing economy across work rate was {{significantly}} improved {{in both groups}} (Fig.  1), possibly indicating that plyometric and aerobic training had a similar effect on rowing economy. Previously, running economy {{has been shown to}} improve after plyometric training [21, 24, 28], and the reason for this improvement has been suggested to be increased musculotendinous stiffness (MTS) in the legs of runners [24]. A high MTS increases an individual’s ability to absorb, harness, and recoil force during the stretch-shortening cycle, such as in running [33]. An increase in MTS is thus beneficial for a sport such as running, which involves an eccentric contraction when the runner’s foot makes contact with the ground, where after plyometric training, the increased MTS results in more stored energy in the series elastic elements and reduces eccentric muscle demand. However, the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rowing</b> stroke (known as the catch), is an anticipated motion in which the athlete is actually pulling themselves towards their feet, followed by a rapid press of the legs to apply power [34]. As there is not so much of a reactive movement, or ground reaction force in rowing when compared with running, increased MTS is likely less beneficial in rowing. Although, plyometric training has also been shown to increase muscle activation [20] and muscle force [35] and decrease ground reaction times [36] suggesting plyometrics might alter the work to rest ratio <b>of</b> <b>rowing,</b> through improved drive speed, allowing more time of the stroke cycle to be spent in recovery for a given stroke rate. Such a change, perhaps independent of economy, might correspond to improved boat speed, allowing for greater maintenance of the forward propulsion or “run” <b>of</b> the <b>rowing</b> shell in the water from each stroke. It is worth noting that these hypotheses warrant further investigation to confirm if this is, in fact, the case.|$|R
