40|$|It {{is shown}} that black hole spacetimes in {{classical}} Einstein gravity are characterized by, {{in addition to}} their ADM mass M, momentum P⃗, angular momentum J⃗ and <b>boost</b> <b>charge</b> K⃗, an infinite head of supertranslation hair. The distinct black holes are distinguished by classical superrotation charges measured at infinity. Solutions with supertranslation hair are diffeomorphic to the Schwarzschild spacetime, but the diffeomorphisms are part of the BMS subgroup and act nontrivially on the physical phase space. It is shown that a black hole can be supertranslated by throwing in an asymmetric shock wave. A leading-order Bondi-gauge expression is derived for the linearized horizon supertranslation charge and shown to generate, via the Dirac bracket, supertranslations on the linearized phase space of gravitational excitations of the horizon. The considerations of this paper are largely classical augmented by comments on their implications for the quantum theory. Comment: 42 page...|$|E

Through an arsenal of electrochemical techniques, we demonstrate that voltage hysteresis is triggered by anionic redox and grows progressively with deeper oxidation of oxygen in conjunction with the deterioration of both interfacial charge-transfer kinetics and bulk diffusion coefficient. We equally show that this anionic-driven poor kinetics keeps deteriorating further with cycling and we also find that voltage fades faster if oxygen is kept oxidized for longer. Our findings, which are in fact harsher for LR-NMC, convey caution that anionic redox risks practical problems; hence, when chasing larger capacities with this class of materials, we encourage considering real-world applications...|$|E

The charge carriers and the products of their decay, including protons, photons and neutrinos, are emitted as a narrow jets with opening angle θ∼ 1 /γ_c, where γ_c is the Lorentz factor of the cusp. The excitation of electric currents in strings occurs mostly in clusters of galaxies, which are characterized by magnetic fields B ∼ 10 ^- 6 G and a filling factor f_B ∼ 10 ^- 3. Two string parameters determine the emission of the particles: the symmetry breaking scale η, which for successful applications should be of order 10 ^ 9 [...] 10 ^ 12 GeV, and the dimensionless parameter i_c, which determines the maximum induced current as J_max =i_c e η and the energy of emitted charge carriers as ϵ_x ∼ i_c γ_c η, where e is the electric charge of a particle. For the parameters η and B mentioned above, the Lorentz factor reaches γ_c ∼ 10 ^ 12 and the maximum particle energy can {{be as high as}} γ_cη∼ 10 ^ 22 GeV.
