500|$|Throughout 1983's War Tour, Bono {{continued}} to reassure audiences that [...] "This song {{is not a}} rebel song, this song is 'Sunday Bloody Sunday'" [...] highlighting the non-partisan intentions of the lyrics. The live performances on this tour featured a routine during which Bono would set a white flag {{in the front of}} the stage while the band vamped three chords—B minor, D major, and G major. (though the band traditionally tune their instruments down a half step so the chords are <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> <b>minor,</b> D flat and G Flat). As the band vamped, Bono would sing [...] "no more!" [...] with the audience. These performances were highly effective with U2's audience (at the time, U2 were most popular as a college rock act). Live performances of the song subsequently appeared on their 1983 live album Under a Blood Red Sky and their concert film [...] In the Unforgettable Fire Tour of 1984 and 1985, [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] {{continued to}} be a prominent midpoint of each U2 concert—as did the [...] "no more!" [...] interlude. Along with a performance of [...] "Bad," [...] the song was performed at Live Aid in July 1985.|$|E
500|$|Clusters {{were also}} {{beginning}} {{to appear in}} more pieces by European composers. Isaac Albéniz's use of them in Iberia (1905–8) may have influenced Gabriel Fauré's subsequent piano writing. Joseph Horowitz {{has suggested that the}} [...] "dissonant star clusters" [...] in its third and fourth books were particularly compelling to Olivier Messiaen, who called Iberia [...] "the wonder of the piano." [...] The Thomas de Hartmann score for Wassily Kandinsky's stage show The Yellow Sound (1909) employs a chromatic cluster at two climactic points. Alban Berg's Four Pieces for clarinet and piano (1913) calls for clusters along with other avant-garde keyboard techniques. Claude Debussy's Piano Prelude “La Cathédrale Engloutie” makes powerful use of clusters to evoke the sound of “pealing bells – with so many added major seconds one would call this pan-diatonic harmony.”: In his 1913 piano prelude “General Lavine – Excentric”, one of the first pieces to be influenced by black American popular styles (the Cakewalk) Debussy features abrasive tone clusters {{at the conclusion of the}} following passage: [...] In his 1915 arrangement for solo piano of his Six Epigraphes Antiques (1914), originally a set of piano duets, Debussy includes tone clusters in the fifth piece, [...] Richard Strauss's An Alpine Symphony (1915) [...] "starts and ends with the setting sun—a <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> <b>minor</b> chord cluster slowly built down." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{sense of}} desolation returns, in what Hogwood calls the [...] "remote and barbarous" [...] key of <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> <b>minor,</b> for the tenor recitative [...] "All they that see him". The sombre {{sequence}} finally {{ends with the}} Ascension chorus [...] "Lift up your heads", which Handel initially divides between two choral groups, the altos serving both as the bass line to a soprano choir and the treble line to the tenors and basses. For the 1754 Foundling Hospital performance Handel added two horns, which join in when the chorus unites {{towards the end of}} the number. After the celebratory tone of Christ's reception into heaven, marked by the choir's D major acclamation [...] "Let all the angels of God worship him", the [...] "Whitsun" [...] section proceeds through a series of contrasting moods—serene and pastoral in [...] "How beautiful are the feet", theatrically operatic in [...] "Why do the nations so furiously rage"—towards the Part II culmination of [...] "Hallelujah". This, as Young points out, is not the climactic chorus of the work, although one cannot escape its [...] "contagious enthusiasm". It builds from a deceptively light orchestral opening, through a short, unison cantus firmus passage on the words [...] "For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth", to the reappearance of the long-silent trumpets at [...] "And He shall reign for ever and ever". Commentators have noted that the musical line for this third subject is based on Wachet auf, Philipp Nicolai's popular Lutheran chorale.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{following}} years, Wetz devoted {{himself to the}} music profession. He gave lessons in the Erfurt city conservatoire (in 1911–1921, composition and history of music), and honed his skills in conducting various choirs (the Erfurt Song Academy in 1914/15, the [...] "Riedelscher Gesangverein" [...] in Leipzig, and after 1918, the [...] "Engelbrechtscher Madrigalchor"). He also worked in composing choral music, a cappella, and orchestral accompaniments. Some of the most notable works of the period were the Song of Life (op. 29), Hyperion (op. 32) (after Friedrich Hölderlin) and a setting of the Third Psalm (op. 37). However, his mature style had not yet fully developed. In 1917, Wetz become a lecturer (assistant professor), and in 1920 professor, {{of the history of}} music and composition to the ducal college for music in Weimar. In 1917 he completed his First Symphony in C minor (op. 40). The symphonies No. 2 in A major (op. 47) and No. 3 in <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> <b>minor</b> (described as B flat major, op. 48) followed in 1919 and 1922.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the prelude}} is of a {{traditional}} harmonic nature. The modulation from <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> to D <b>minor</b> that occurs between measures 6 and 7 (and reappears at measures 14-15, 20-21, 41-42, and 49-50) is strongly characteristic of Rachmaninoff's music. In measure 7, Rachmaninoff reinforces the main theme by moving up a third to the dominant chord. The overall impression of the upward movement {{is a sense of}} elevation and grandiosity.|$|R

In addition to the aforementioned chords, the E-flat major chord (X55X567) was often featured in songs in a major key, usually C major (with downtuning B-flat or A major).|$|R

50|$|The {{main body}} of the song has a 3/4 feel and is pitched halfway between the keys of E minor and E-flat minor, {{possibly}} to accommodate the tuning of the harpsichord. The instrumental introduction, in (a very <b>flat)</b> <b>B</b> <b>minor,</b> is unconventional. The keyboard and harpsichord vamp in 3/4, and every fourth bar is in 4/4. The music was largely written by keyboardist Dave Greenfield and drummer Jet Black, with lyrics by singer/guitarist Hugh Cornwell.|$|R

50|$|The piece {{begins with}} three pianists playing {{different}} notes {{to the same}} 8-beat rhythmic pattern. Then two more pianists begin to play the same pattern shifted two beats out of phase. (Phasing is a prominent technique in most of Steve Reich's work.) Different phase shifts of the same motifs fade {{in and out of}} the ever-changing musical texture for the duration of the piece. The piece also uses the additive technique of gradually building up parts by substituting notes for rests, and the opposite. Six Pianos is also notable by being one of Reich's only pieces in duple time.Six Pianos has three sections, separated by relatively sudden changes of tonal center, though they all use the same seven pitch classes of the D major diatonic scale. The first section is in D major, with the tonality anchored in place by a persistent pattern of D and A in the bass. Then that pattern slowly fades out, leaving a B minor tonality which serves as a short transition to the second section in E Dorian. A sudden transition leads to the third section in B natural minor. Six Marimbas follows the same structure, but is transposed down by one semitone so that the piece opens in D flat major and concludes in <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> natural <b>minor.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Waley was {{a highly}} gifted musician. He began to compose as a child. His first {{published}} work, L'arpeggio (for piano), was published in 1848. He had piano lessons from Ignaz Moscheles, William Sterndale Bennett and George Alexander Osborne, and lessons in theory and composition from William Horsley and Bernhard Molique. As well as being a brilliant pianist (he performed regularly at concerts of the Amateur Musical Society conducted by Henry Leslie), Waley was a prolific composer. His published compositions include a piano concerto (op. 16), two piano trios (in <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> and G <b>minor,</b> op. 15 and op. 20), marches and caprices for piano, and many songs, including [...] "Angels' voices" [...] and [...] "Sing on, sing on, ye little birds".
