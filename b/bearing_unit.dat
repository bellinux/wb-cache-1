40|$|The work {{suggests}} {{a method of}} diagnostics and monitoring of <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> in induction electric machines according to the spectrum of the consumed current. The method {{is based on the}} assignment of character frequencies generated by the rotating parts of rolling bearings. The faults of the <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> cause periodic changes in the instant speed of the rotor, short-time changing of rotating electromagnetic torque, redistribution of magnetic field fluxes in air gap and occurrence of highest harmonics in the spectrum of consumed current. Analysing the spectrum and its changes during a particular period of time allows the diagnostics of <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> faults, monitoring and possible prognosis of <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> residual life...|$|R

50|$|The {{particle}} le {{is separated}} from its verb when the negation appears (trees b-d). Despite this fact, the particle still forms a catena with its verb in all four trees. These structures are therefore consistent with the catena-based understanding of meaning compositionality. The fundamental meaning <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> is the catena, not the constituent.|$|E
50|$|TACAN {{in general}} can be {{described}} as the military version of the VOR/DME system. It operates in the frequency band 960-1215 MHz. The <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> of TACAN is more accurate than a standard VOR since it makes use of a two-frequency principle, with 15 Hz and 135 Hz components, and because UHF transmissions are less prone to signal bending than VHF.|$|E

50|$|Well {{core data}} {{indicate}} that the Santa Clara valley aquifer consists of between four and six different water <b>bearing</b> <b>units.</b> The aquifer is composed of both confined and unconfined <b>units.</b> Water <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> are generally coarse-grained and separated by relatively fine-grained units. The thicknesses of coarse-grained sections vary between 10 and 25 ft in the southeast and between 50 and 200 ft in the south-central and southwestern areas of the valley. Temperature data from monitoring wells indicate that horizontal groundwater flow occurs primarily above 775 ft in southern-central regions and above 510 ft in southeastern areas.|$|R
5000|$|According to the North China Herald, the Bodyguard wore blue uniforms with scarlet facings {{and green}} {{shoulder}} straps <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> identification in Chinese characters. Artillerymen wore light blue uniforms with red facings and trouser stripes. Infantry wore dark green in winter dress with red facings and shoulder straps in regimental colours. In summer all branches wore white uniforms with scarlet facings. All units wore green turbans.|$|E
50|$|The tone <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> is a {{syllable}}, {{and each}} syllable is obligatorily assigned a tone. There are two tones with contrastive minimal pairs found in Ersu; high level, and mid level. The assignment of the tones {{in a particular}} morpheme or word is unpredictable, though data suggests that the high level tone is much more frequent than the mid level tone. The pitch contour of the Ersu tones is also much less stable/consistent compared to Mandarin Chinese, and often have contextual variation.|$|E

50|$|The Sinbad member {{consists}} of three layers: the , fossil <b>bearing</b> <b>unit,</b> the middle calcilutite part, and a top dolomitized calcarenite layer. It {{is a combination of}} limestone and five to twenty percent siltstone depending on the location. The makeup and location of the formation gives it viability as an oil reservoir. The formation is primarily composed of limestone, siltstone, and dolostone. It is due to this makeup that the formation has potential as an oil reservoir. The viability as a reserve depends upon the fractures and connectivity throughout the formation.|$|E
5000|$|The SB.1 glider was {{designed}} to be an inexpensive, simple machine, constructed primarily of spruce with reinforced sections using light alloy steel. The all-important wing controls had [...] "elevons" [...] pivoted on long, tapered light-alloy tubes extending from {{the leading edge of the}} tip, just inside the fixed part of the wing (illustrated by photographs in the Short SB.4 Sherpa article). The pivoting mechanism had a double-ball <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> on the inboard end with main loads transferred to a needle roller bearing at the outboard end of the fixed wing. Anti-balance tabs were fitted along trailing edges along with small pneumatically actuated flaps under the inboard sections. When the elevons were rotated in the same direction they functioned as elevators; when rotated in opposite directions they functioned as ailerons.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, as {{ordered by}} the State, Brown & Bryant {{excavated}} heavily contaminated soil underneath their pond and installed a liner. [...] The removed soil was then cleaned and treated {{and returned to the}} ground using an innovate technology called ultraviolet/ozone. In 1989, the EPA’s emergency response program began to evaluate the need to conduct removal action at the site; and Brown & Bryant Inc. was placed on the Superfund List. [...] The following year the EPA began to look into and develop long term solutions to the groundwater and soil contamination problems at the site. EPA decided to consolidate the contaminated soil, install a cap over this consolidated soil, and extract and treat water from the first water <b>bearing</b> <b>unit.</b> To remediate the groundwater EPA planned to extract and treat groundwater in the A-zone, which was the source of contamination to the B-zone.|$|E
50|$|With roots tracing back to 1963, NTN Bearing Corporation of America of Mount Prospect, Illinois {{produces}} and distributes roller {{and ball}} bearings to the United States industrial, automotive and recreational clientele. Products manufactured {{by the company}} include agricultural and farm implement bearings, angular contact ball bearings, automotive bearings, ball and roller <b>bearing</b> mounted <b>units,</b> cylindrical roller <b>bearings,</b> electrical motor bearings, heavy industrial bearings, machine tool bearings, micro and miniature ball bearings, needle roller bearings, radial ball bearings, spherical roller bearings, tapered roller bearings and ultra-class <b>bearing</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Spherical roller thrust {{bearings}} constitute of a shaft washer (for radial bearings often called [...] "inner ring"), a housing washer (for radial bearings often called [...] "outer ring"), asymmetrical rollers and a cage.

50|$|Usually, the {{mechanical}} stiffness {{of an air}} bearing’s body is overestimated {{in comparison to the}} stiffness of the air cushion. The diagram shows the characteristics of a flat air <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> (height 20 mm, diameter 80 mm) in comparison to the theoretical characteristics of an inelastic bearing body with the same geometry. Based on such simulations, we determine both the material of the air bearing as well as the distribution and number of micro nozzles such that it is perfectly adjusted to deformation.The deformation of an air bearing’s surface due to the force of the cushion is calculated {{on the basis of a}} structural analysis, calculated with a special software. The result obtained becomes a geometric parameter for the calculation of an air bearing’s simulation. With an iterative process, each point on the characteristics can be calculated. In doing so, an exact calculation of the deformation and air pressure profile is obtained.|$|E
50|$|The {{running gear}} {{and most other}} {{components}} stayed the same from the XM through to the XP. All of the utility, sedan delivery, and taxi/police kit vehicles had five-lug 13-inch wheels and larger 10-inch drum brakes, as had all previous commercial models. Commercials had always had lower-ratio differentials (4.00:1) and larger 6.70 x 13 tyres. The high-end Fairmonts came with 14-inch four-lug wheels to accommodate the standard disc brakes on this model, whereas other models had 13-inch wheels if disc brakes were not optioned. Fairmonts featured bucket seats, the 200 ci Super Pursuit engine initially in four-main bearing form and finally with the imported seven-main <b>bearing</b> <b>unit,</b> three-speed automatic transmission, and a padded dash along with carpets, perforated, colour-matched headlining, blower heater, screen washers, chrome-plated interior mirror, seven interior door-operated lights, and a handbrake on warning light flasher as standard. Vacuum-assisted disc brakes were standard in the Fairmont only and optional on other sedan and hardtop models.|$|E
50|$|The {{correspondence}} {{in meaning}} across inflected forms and their periphrastic equivalents {{within the same}} language or across different languages leads to a basic question. Individual words are always constituents, but their periphrastic equivalents are often NOT constituents. Given this mismatch in syntactic form, one can pose the following questions: how should the form-meaning correspondence across periphrastic and non-periphrastic forms be understood?; how does it come to pass that a specific meaning <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> can be a constituent in one case but in another case, it {{is a combination of}} words that does not qualify as a constituent? An answer to this question that has recently come to light is expressed in terms of the catena unit, as implied above. The periphrastic word combinations are catenae even when they are not constituents, and individual words are also catenae. The form-meaning correspondence is therefore consistent. A given inflected one-word catena corresponds to a periphrastic multiple-word catena.|$|E
50|$|When the 48th Armored Division was disbanded in 1968, its {{units in}} Florida {{became part of}} the 53rd Infantry Brigade (Separate). The {{distinctive}} unit insignia was originally approved for the non-color <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> of the 53d Armored Brigade on 9 January 1967. It was redesignated for the 53d Infantry Brigade on 25 July 1968.|$|R
50|$|Idiosyncratic {{language}} {{of all sorts}} can be captured in terms of catenae. When meaning is constructed {{in such a manner}} that does not allow one to acknowledge meaning chunks as constituents, the catena is involved. The meaning <b>bearing</b> <b>units</b> are catenae, not constituents. This situation is illustrated here in terms of various collocations and proper idioms.|$|R

50|$|Koti, {{like most}} Bantu languages, is a {{register}} tone language with two tones: High and Low. Tone is not lexically distinctive for verbs, {{but it is}} very important in verbal inflection and in some other parts of grammar. Contour tones (falling and rising tones) do occur, but only on long vowels, therefore they are analysed as sequences of the H and L level tones. There is a process of High Doubling which spreads any H tone to the following tone <b>bearing</b> <b>unit,</b> and a process of Final Lowering which deletes any utterance-final High tone. Both can be seen in effect in the following example (Low tone is unmarked): kaláwa 'boat', kaláwá khuúlu 'the biggest boat'. In kaláwa, High doubling is canceled because Final Lowering applies, so the last syllable has a Low tone. In the second example, the first H tone in kaláwá has spread to the next syllable (High Doubling) and Final Lowering again causes the very last syllable of the utterance to be Low in tone.|$|E
