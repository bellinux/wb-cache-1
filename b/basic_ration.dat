Because of the widespread development of GIN, resistant to allopathic drugs, further research into alternative parasite control methods is required [1]. Silver fir, Abies alba MILL (SF), is traditionally used by Swiss farmers {{in order to}} control GIN infections of goats but also to improve animal welfare. A survey among goat farmers revealed that goat farmers use SF in winter during a period of approximately five months. The SF-ration per animal and day differ between approximately 8. 2 g dry matter (DM) to 600 g DM [2]. As there is scientific evidence neither for an anthelmintic potential nor for the feed intake and milk performance of SF, we conducted a study with 30 goats. For a 20 days feeding experiment one group of 15 goats (A) was, additionally to their <b>basic</b> <b>ration,</b> daily fed with SF.

The methane is a powerful greenhouse gas representing a true energy loss for the ruminants and its reduction is beneficial for the animals and the environment. In order to test the effect of this natural feed additive, rich in thyme essential oil on the emission of methane by ruminants, five dairy cattle of Holstein breed were used and received a ration composed of 4 kg of industrial concentrated feed, 2 kg of alfalfa hay and 2 kg of wheat straw with free access to drinking water. After two weeks of adaptation to the feed, measurements of the production of methane were carried out without feed additive. Then, 50 g of the product rich thyme essential oil were daily added to the <b>basic</b> <b>ration</b> (7. 15 g/kg DM) during two weeks of adaptation and measurement of methane was taken in the third week.

40|$|It {{is evident}} that both dietary and meta-bolic factors {{influence}} plasma cholesterol levels {{and the development of}} experimental athero-sclerosis. The type of fat normally consumed is one of the important dietary factors. Al-though the "polyunsaturated " fatty acids (con-sisting primarily of linoleic acid) are known to depress plasma cholesterol levels, it does not follow that an excess of dietary linoleic acid is necessarily more beneficial than a proper ratio of fatty acids of different chain length and saturation. The literature indicates a striking disparity between the effects of various dietary fats on plasma cholesterol levels in human beings and in animals. 1 '- We ourselves were unable, in earlier studies, to find consistent differ-ences in hypercholesterolemia and athero-genesis in cockerels fed different saturated and unsaturated fats added to cholesterol supple-mented chick starter mash. 8 This may have been due to the presence in this mash of 3 to 5 % of fatty acids of variable composition.
