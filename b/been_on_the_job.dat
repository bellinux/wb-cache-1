2500|$|Afterward, it was {{revealed}} that although Poplawski's mother had told the 9-1-1 operator that Poplawski owned guns, the operator typed [...] "no weapons" [...] on her report, relaying the information to the police dispatcher. When the operator asked Ms. Poplawski if her son had weapons, she responded yes, and stated that they were all legal. When asked to confirm that she was not being threatened with the guns, Ms. Poplawski did not answer, instead repeating that she wanted her son out of the house. Management in the Allegheny County response center contend that the dispatcher meant to relay that no weapons were involved in the dispute. The county's Chief for Emergency Services stated that the 9-1-1 operator had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for less than a year, including training, and was placed on administrative leave and offered counseling.|$|E

I've seen--er--worse lookers than you, Miss Ileen; but what I like about you is the business way you've got of doing things. Cool and wise--that's the winning way for a girl.

The law aims to respect the religious and cultural needs of the Amish community of the United States. The Amish believe that one effective way to educate children <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> <b>The</b> new law allows Amish children the ability to work with their families, once they are passed eighth grade in school.|$|R

40|$|A {{couple of}} years ago we started experimenting with a new hiring {{procedure}} for our pruning crews. I feel the only fair way to hire pruners is through a practical test. We don’t have the problem any more of hiring people who claim to know how to prune only to find after they <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> that they don’t know.
