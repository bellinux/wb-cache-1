500|$|Cyber Rights {{received}} a positive review in Salon, which noted, [...] "Readers of 'Cyber Rights' will range {{from those who}} have never heard of Mike Godwin to those who have tangoed with him online at some point or have at least lurked silently as the debate raged. Whatever the number in the first category, those falling into the second are legion. Godwin has been online so long he's had a celebrated law that predicts the course of online discussions named after him." [...] The review observed, [...] "Throughout 'Cyber Rights,' it becomes clear that what makes Godwin a sometimes unpleasant online sparring partner is precisely what has catapulted him to the front lines in the seemingly endless battles for free speech on the Net. ... his tenacity and his insistence on wrestling every last <b>breath</b> <b>out</b> of his opponents' arguments." [...] Salon characterized the book as, [...] "an instructional book with an argument to convey â€“ a sort of cross between a dry, textbookish primer and a lively personal history." ...|$|E

Singles, [...] "Yellow Pansy Street", [...] "Tsubusa ni Koi", [...] "My Home" [...] serve as breaks in-between the album originals before the album closes with the ballad, [...] "wander", a lyrically heavy song that is filled emotional encouragement. [...] " [...] Give me the reason, I want to hold on to it/As I stand in a field I trust/I <b>breath</b> <b>out</b> as I continue on this path/Holding my head up proudly/As beautiful flowers bloom from my footprints/Where to wonder? I want to send true love [...] ", they sing in the final chorus.|$|E

60|$|When {{the twins}} were both asleep, I must tiptoe upstairs to see them. They lay cheek by cheek in the crib next the large white bed, {{breathing}} little, ruffling <b>breaths,</b> <b>out</b> of unison, so small and pathetic with their tiny shut fingers. I remembered the two larks.|$|R

[With a menacing, yet half-ashamed {{movement}} towards ROBERTS.] He'll speak to you again, mark my words, but don't ye listen. [The crowd groans.] It's hell fire that's on that man's tongue. [ROBERTS is seen laughing.] Sim 'Arness is right. What are we without the Union--handful o' parched leaves--a puff o' smoke. I'm no orator, but I say: Chuck it up! Chuck it up! Sooner than go on starving the women and the children.|$|E
