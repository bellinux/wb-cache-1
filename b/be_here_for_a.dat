500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} to the episode. Joseph P. Kahn, a {{critic for the}} Wilmington Morning Star, called the episode's writing and acting [...] "anything but hackneyed" [...] and stated, [...] "One safe prediction, Seinfeld will <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good long run this time around (referring to how its first season only had five episodes)." [...] Joyce Millman of Salon.com stated that she disliked Seinfelds pilot episode, but after seeing a scene from [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] in which Jerry and Kramer discuss returning fruit, she was [...] "awed by Seinfeld and co-creator/writer Larry David's brilliant grasp of, A) working-class Jewish craziness, and, B) the absurd humor of the deeply mundane." ...|$|E
500|$|Betty was the longest-serving barmaid of the soap's public house, The Rovers Return. She first served {{behind the}} bar in 1969 and had been shown to work there for 42 years, as of 2011. There have been brief breaks however, as storylines {{have led to the}} {{character}} being fired or quitting her post. She was fired by Annie Walker (Doris Speed), who accused her of theft, and she quit her post in 1995 when Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) took over as landlords. In the summer of 2009, Betty was sacked again temporarily by manager Poppy Morales. A Coronation Street insider reassured The Sun that Betty was not being written out of the show, however, stating: [...] "She’ll <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time to come – she’ll just be {{on the other side of}} the bar for a change". In a storyline that aired in February 2010, Betty – at 90 years old – was named Manchester's Oldest Barmaid. In a plot twist, a 91-year-old rival came forward, resulting in Betty fearing she killed her, when the rival consumes a two-month-old hotpot.|$|E
500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} to the season. During its 1991 Program awards, Entertainment Weekly, ranked Seinfeld {{second place in}} the [...] "Program of the year" [...] category, behind Roseanne. Joseph P. Kahn, a critic for the Wilmington Morning Star, praised the writing and acting of the season premiere and stated, [...] "One safe prediction, Seinfeld will <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good long run this time around." [...] Writing for The Spokesman-Review, critic Jon Burlingame stated that [...] "Seinfeld is an offbeat take on the standard sitcom concept. While rarely hilarious, it's often smart and amusing." [...] Dave Kehr of The New York Times felt that [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was a turning point for the show, noting that after the first few episodes, the show [...] "turn into something sharp and distinctive [...] Here, suddenly, is the tight knot of guilt and denial, of hypersensitivity and sarcastic contempt that Seinfeld would explore for the next eight years." [...] Despite the critical acclaim for the season and several of its episodes, two of the season's episodes, [...] "The Busboy" [...] and [...] "The Baby Shower", were named to a list of Seinfelds [...] "Not-so-top episodes", compiled by the New York Daily News.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Aulie was {{assigned}} to the Marlies after training camp with the Maple Leafs. [...] He was later called up to the NHL on November 12, 2010, when Dion Phaneuf was injured. Aulie played his first career NHL game the next day against the Vancouver Canucks, playing 12 games total with the Maple Leafs in his call-up before ultimately being returned to the Marlies. Despite the time he spent away from the AHL, Aulie was selected to the Western Conference team for the AHL All-Star Game. During the Skills Competition, Aulie competed in the hardest shot event, finishing third, with a top speed of 95.5mph. After the Maple Leafs traded defenceman François Beauchemin to the Anaheim Ducks, Aulie was called up to rejoin the team. Maple Leafs General Manager Brian Burke said {{one of the reasons for}} the trade was to open up a spot at the NHL level for Aulie: [...] "...as soon as we get a roster spot, we're calling up Keith Aulie. We expect him to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while." [...] Aulie engaged in his first career NHL fight against Scott Hartnell of the Philadelphia Flyers, earning him the nickname [...] "Muhammad Aulie." [...] He scored his first career NHL goal against the New York Islanders on March 9, 2011.|$|E

6000|$|... "Something like that," [...] he {{admitted}} bluntly. [...] "Prince Shan will <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week--perhaps a fortnight. When he goes, he goes {{a very long}} distance away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] {{said the}} Marshal [...] "we've had foolery {{enough for one}} morning. We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{execution}}, and a execution we'll have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rest, my dear fellow. For Heaven's sake don't {{get started}} on a new problem when your nerves are all in shreds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why has Mr. Julian Gray not <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole week?" [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "The {{servants}} {{say he has}} been abroad. Is that true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} quite a small party now," [...] said Mrs. Newberry; [...] "in fact, quite by {{ourselves}} till Mrs. Everleigh comes, and she won't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fortnight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{thought you}} were the {{lifeboat}} at first," [...] the captain said, {{as they reached the}} deck; [...] "but, of course, they cannot <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> couple of hours yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we're {{going to}} <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week, anyway," [...] put in Randy, and then {{both of the}} twins gave their mother such a hug as she had not {{received}} for a long time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not believe}} it," [...] he answered. [...] "You {{have not changed}} in the least. You will be better-looking still when you have <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few months." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely the Burra Sahib is mistaken," [...] the man answered, respectfully but firmly. [...] "I have <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour, {{and no one}} {{has passed}} from the tent." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barbara {{smiled in}} a {{listless}} fashion. [...] "I'm afraid I can't help that," [...] she said. [...] "Your friends, however, will presumably not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{hour or two}} yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|At last, {{when the}} money-lender's party were close at hand, I called out that three {{horsemen}} were just {{visible in the}} north. [...] "That's Gordon; Jacques and the rest can't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long while. It's time to come down," [...] said Steel.|$|E
6000|$|COMTESSE. I was {{a pretty}} woman then. I dare say I shall detest him now; but if I find I do not--let us have a little plot--I shall drop this book; and then perhaps you will be so charming as--as not to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little while? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I can't. That is {{just the}} trouble," [...] I said pleasantly. [...] "If I could leave it I shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute. Since I can't, it simply has to be cleaned. I can {{tolerate}} men and dogs when I am compelled to, but I cannot and will not tolerate dirt and disorder. Go into the sitting-room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, there is; {{something}} of the greatest importance. You do not suppose that I should have <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week waiting to tell it to you, if it was not." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, Grey! Surely no, it cannot be, {{and yet it}} is. De Boeffleurs, how d'ye do?" [...] {{said the}} Baron, with a face beaming with joy and a hearty shake of the hand. [...] "My dear fellow, {{how did you manage}} to get off so soon? I thought you were not to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fortnight: we only arrived {{ourselves}} to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|My dear Haydon--I am {{much better}} this morning than I was when I wrote the note: {{that is my}} hopes and spirits are better which are {{generally}} at a very low ebb from such a protracted illness. I shall <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little time and at home all and every day. A journey to Italy is recommended me, which I have resolved upon and am beginning to prepare for. Hoping to see you shortly ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week, Mr. Glover, and {{the doctor}} thinks that another run among the hills will do you good, {{therefore}} you can go and stay with your friends there until we sail again. If you return this day week that will do. You have stuck to your work well, for Doctor Bemish said {{that for the first}} month at least you ought to have been on the sick-list, and at any rate you deserve a holiday for your share in that fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|VERNON. Found <b>a</b> {{telegram}} waiting <b>for</b> {{me in the}} village. What's {{become of}} that niece of yours, Bennet--your sister Rose's daughter, who <b>was</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time and ran away again? Ever hear anything about her? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, not of need," [...] {{said the}} sister. [...] "Many a maiden who has <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time {{has gone out}} into the world, but some love this home the best, as I have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{my uncle}} is in Brazil. My father <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month, and <b>is</b> very kind; he seems very fairly {{satisfied}} with me; {{and he wants}} me to get prepared for the commission in the Life Guards.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} wanting to write you {{for some time and}} am not so {{indifferent}} as you would make out. I wish you could <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> day or two to see what I have to go through from breakfast until twelve at night, seven days in the week. I have now just got through with my mail for to-night, and as it is not yet twelve and the mail does not close until that time, I will devote the remainder of the time in penning you a few lines. I have no war news to communicate, however.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well now, {{this is how}} {{the land}} lies," [...] said the old seaman, resting his elbows on the table and {{clasping}} his hands before him. [...] "As Mr Moor and I, with the stooard and men, are quite sufficient to manage the affairs o' the brig, and as we shall certainly <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> considerable time to come, I've made up my mind to give you a holiday. You're young, you see, an' foolish, and your mind needs improvin'. In short, you want a good deal o' the poetry knocked out o' you, for it's not like your mother's poetry by any means, so you needn't flatter yourself--not built on the same lines by a long way. Well--where was I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] {{returned}} the captain, [...] "there {{is a certain}} owner named Captain David Roy, a very stern disciplinarian, who insists on the commander o' this here brig performin' his duty to the letter. You may depend upon it that if a man ain't true to himself he's {{not likely to be}} true to any one else. But it's likely that we may <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> couple of days, so I release you from duty that you may make the most o' your time and enjoy yourself. By the way, it will save you wastin' time if you ask that little girl, Kathy Holbein, to show you the best places to sketch, for she's a born genius with her pencil and brush." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Jolyon," [...] she said, [...] "we {{were just}} saying that you haven't <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time; but we mustn't be surprised. You're busy, of course? James was just saying what a busy time of year...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] Tavernake replied. [...] "I {{do not know}} how long I shall be in New York. If I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days, I shall take my chance at finding you at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week only, John; but Oswald has leave <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month, seeing that, at present, {{there is}} no great chance of Hotspur needing his services. The Scotch are quiet since the king returned, I hear." ...|$|R
