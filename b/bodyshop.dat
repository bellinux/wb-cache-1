3000|$|The {{available}} literature {{shows that}} between the mid- 80 s and the mid- 90 s, small software firms could access global markets to grow by resorting to <b>bodyshopping,</b> or the practice of providing inexpensive on-site (i.e., at customer locations overseas) labor on an hourly basis for low-value added programming services ([Parthasarathy 2004]). During the 1990 s, <b>bodyshopping</b> gave way to offshore development (i.e., software development in India for global customers) once Indian firms had built up their reputation and had access to reliable data communication infrastructure at the Software Technology Parks (STPs) that were established by the government. This was how many small firms which were established in the 1980 s grew to become large exporters. A {{case in point is}} Infosys which was established in 1981 by seven professionals with US $ 250 as capital and grew to US $ 414 million in revenues two decades later to become India’s second software largest exporter ([...] [Infosys 2012]).|$|R

3000|$|To {{the extent}} that local {{subcontracting}} takes place, it {{takes the form of}} domestic <b>bodyshopping</b> (euphemistically referred to as manpower consultancy services), rather than offsite execution.

Since large domestic firms predominantly serve export markets, projects subcontracted to the small firms are from foreign clients; hence, it appears that small firms access global markets indirectly.
