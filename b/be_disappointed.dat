5|$|Hogg {{gained the}} {{position}} of revising barrister for Northumberland and Berwick in 1838. This required him to travel to Northern England twice a year. Jane often complained about these trips, but Hogg enjoyed visiting the north. He hoped that his legal service would earn him an appointment as a judge, but he was to <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{staff at}} Canada Post's Montreal office were noticing a {{considerable}} number of letters addressed to Santa Claus entering the postal system, and those letters were being treated as undeliverable. Since employees handling those letters did not want the writers, mostly young children, to <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> at the lack of response, they started answering the letters themselves.|$|E
5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would <b>be</b> <b>disappointed,</b> as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E

5|$|When the war ended, Herring {{wished to}} return to Australia and see Mary before {{resuming}} his studies at the University of Oxford in October 1919. Mary wrote back pointing out the impracticality of this idea; while she would <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> not to see him, he should remain in England and complete his course at Oxford first. The university had awarded him a wartime Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1915; the Rhodes Scholarship Trust allowed him to resume his scholarship, and he studied for a Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) degree. Since it had been five years since he had been awarded his BA, he was entitled to a MA as well, and graduated with both degrees in July 1920. After a holiday in Britain and France with his sister Kathleen, he arrived back in Melbourne on 26 November 1920.|$|E

25|$|If {{our former}} {{subordinate}} to the Khans {{would have had the}} insight, sense of solidarity and would have followed its own interests less, then we would have joined together, had been able to prove the case, but now they will <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> and after the repent of their thoughtless mistakes, it has been already too late.|$|E
25|$|Cardinal O'Malley {{praised the}} new {{tone of the}} papacy of Pope Francis. He stated however that those that {{expected}} change in doctrine from the pope on sexual ethics like abortion, contraception, and gay marriage would <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b> He also indicated that the church would not alter the ban on communion for the divorced remarried and that he saw no theological justification for doing so.|$|E
25|$|As the Treaty {{would not}} be binding until it shall have {{received}} such Ratification in which we may <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the refusal of the Government of the United States, it is advisable that Hostilities should not be suspended until you shall have official information that The President has actually ratified the Treaty and a Person will be duly authorized to apprise you of this event.|$|E

25|$|Grace wore MCC colours for {{the rest}} of his career, playing for them on an {{irregular}} basis until 1904, and their red and yellow hooped cap became as synonymous with him as his large black beard. He played for MCC on an expenses only basis but any hopes that the premier club had of keeping him firmly within the amateur ranks would soon <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> for his services were much in demand.|$|E
25|$|If Rauhe's rivals hoped this {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a decline in the German's fortunes they were to <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b> In 2006 Rauhe was back on top form and won more titles than ever before. At the European Championships in Račice, Czech Republic he won three gold medals, retaining his K-2 500 m title, regaining the K-1 200 m crown from Pérez and winning the K-2 200 m {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} can {{be considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} computer, with mathematician Charles Babbage having designed the world's first computing system as early as the mid-1800s. Alan Turing went on to devise what is essentially the basis for modern computing and Maurice Wilkes later created the first programmable computer. The webcam was also invented at Cambridge University, as a means for scientists to avoid interrupting their research and going {{all the way down to}} the laboratory dining room only to <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> by an empty coffee pot.|$|E

25|$|In 737, Áed Allán {{met with}} Cathal at Terryglass, {{probably}} neutral ground outwith {{the control of}} either king. Byrne {{says that it is}} unlikely that Cathal acknowledged Áed Allán's authority—the Uí Néill had little enough influence in the south—but if Cathal had expected some benefit from the meeting, where he perhaps acknowledged the ecclesiastical supremacy of Armagh, he was to <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b> However, the clerics of Armagh may have been well satisfied as the Annals of Ulster, in the entry following that which reports the meeting of Cathal and Áed Allán, say that the law of Patrick was in force in Ireland. The presumably means that they agreed to the special treatment of the church, its lands and its tenants, as prescribed by the law of Patrick.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} two years of Fianna Fáil government, the IRA's {{membership}} grew from a low of 1,800 to over 10,000. This can be put down to the radicalising impact of the Great Depression on the population, to which the IRA's new social radicalism (see next section) appealed. Another important factor was the formation of the Blueshirts: a quasi-fascist organisation set up by Eoin O'Duffy, originally composed of Civil war veterans of the Free State Army. The IRA and the Blueshirts both attacked political meetings and also fought street brawls against each other. While most of the fighting was conducted with fists or boots, at least one Blueshirt and one IRA man were shot dead in these clashes. IRA leaders saw in these events the beginnings of a republican revolution and the overthrow of the Free State. They were to <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though, again a tough semi-final awaited against {{defending}} {{world champions}} Spain. The victory value was huge: the dreamed Olympic final, guaranteed silver {{and a chance}} at gold, while also providing {{the opportunity to take}} back on the 66–91 shellacking during preparations. Both teams played at their best, with Spain compensating the absence of José Calderón to lead by the first quarter, only for Lithuania to dominate for the following two and having a minimal 74–73 advantage by the fourth. Then rising performances by Rudy Fernandez and Pau Gasol (9 and 7 points respectively) during the concluding quarter along with the Lithuanians' exhaustion and lack of big men input lead the Spanish to barely edge and win the semifinal 91–86. Head coach Ramūnas Butautas said that the team played well and {{there was no need to}} <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|E

25|$|Through his {{association}} with Neave, Gow {{was introduced to the}} inner circles of the Conservative Party. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Margaret Thatcher in May 1979 at the time she became Prime Minister. While serving in this capacity between 1979 and 1983, Gow became a close friend and confidant of the Prime Minister. He was deeply involved in the workings of Thatcher's private office until his departure in June 1983. Though elevated to junior ministerial office as Minister for Housing and Construction before moving later to the Treasury, Gow was known to <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> by his loss of influence with the Prime Minister in his new role. In late 1983 he developed plans with Alan Clark to reinvigorate Thatcher's private office by expanding it and its influence over policy, thereby creating a new role for himself, but these came to nothing.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Giger and Tobler visited {{director}} Fredi M. Murer in London. Murer filmed a TV documentary, entitled Passagen (1972), about Giger's work. The documentary {{also featured}} interviews by both Giger and Tobler. In the 1972–1973 season, Tobler gained {{a part in}} the play My Woman, My Leader and had to travel all around Switzerland. Physically and mentally exhausted after 130 performances of the play, weary after the hectic schedule that required extensive touring around the country, and confused by her promiscuous erotic life, Tobler decided to take a leave of absence from the acting profession, as well as from her relationship with Giger. In 1974, she opted for leaving him and moving to San Francisco with her new American boyfriend. However, 30 days later, she returned to Zürich, claiming to <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> over the United States (as well as incapable of adapting to American lifestyle, according to Giger) and resuming her relationship with the painter.|$|E
25|$|Captain George Nicholas Hardinge (11 April 1781 – 8 March 1808) was {{an officer}} of the Royal Navy who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Possessing an ability to endear himself to senior {{officers}} through his intellect and good manners, he served under several important naval commanders, whose patronage allowed him to rise through the ranks. His own skill and bravery were also important factors in his promotion to his own command, a fact he demonstrated in 1804 when he led a daring cutting-out operation against two Dutch ships. Promotion to post captain left him temporarily without a command, and he was to <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> in a number of the ships he was offered when {{they turned out to be}} either unfit for service, or still under construction. Having ended up in the East Indies he was forced to make do with an elderly frigate he had first served on as a midshipman much earlier in his career. While commanding this ship he fought an action with a superior French opponent, and after a gruelling three-day battle the British were victorious and the French captain surrendered. Hardinge did not live to see the moment, having been killed by grapeshot shortly before. He was buried with full military honours and monuments to his memory were erected in St. Thomas Cathedral, Bombay and St Paul's Cathedral, London.|$|E
