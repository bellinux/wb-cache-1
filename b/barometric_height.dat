50|$|Turbulence {{causes the}} air within the lower {{atmospheric}} regions below the turbopause at about 110 km to be {{a mixture of}} gases that does not change its composition. Its mean molecular weight is 29 g/mol with molecular oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) as the two dominant constituents. Above the turbopause, however, diffusive separation of the various constituents is significant, so that each constituent follows its own <b>barometric</b> <b>height</b> structure with a scale height inversely proportional to its molecular weight. The lighter constituents atomic oxygen (O), helium (He), and hydrogen (H) successively dominate above about 200 km altitude and vary with geographic location, time, and solar activity. The ratioN2/O which {{is a measure of}} the electron density at the ionospheric F region is highly affected by these variations. These changes follow from the diffusion of the minor constituents through the major gas component during dynamic processes.|$|E

For global registration, Global Positioning System (GPS) {{is currently}} the best sensing technology, but its precision and update rate are not sufficient for high quality tracking. We present a system that uses Kalman filtering for fusion of Differential GPS (DGPS) or Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) based GPS with <b>barometric</b> <b>heights</b> and also for an inertial measurement unit with gyroscopes, magnetometers and accelerometers to improve the transient oscillation. Typically, inertial sensors are subjected to drift and magnetometer measurements are distorted by electro-magnetic fields in the environment. For compensation, we additionally apply a visual orientation tracker which is drift-free through online mapping of the unknown environment. This tracker allows for correction of distortions of the 3 -axis magnetic compass, which increases the robustness and accuracy of the pose estimates.

50|$|There are {{two leading}} {{theories}} about how siphons cause liquid to flow uphill, against gravity, without being pumped, and powered only by gravity. The traditional theory for centuries was that gravity pulling the liquid {{down on the}} exit side of the siphon resulted in reduced pressure {{at the top of}} the siphon. Then atmospheric pressure was able to push the liquid from the upper reservoir, up into the reduced pressure {{at the top of the}} siphon, like in a barometer or drinking straw, and then over. However, it has been demonstrated that siphons can operate in a vacuum and to heights exceeding the <b>barometric</b> <b>height</b> of the liquid. Consequently, the cohesion tension theory of siphon operation has been advocated, where the liquid is pulled over the siphon in a way similar to the chain model. It need not be one theory or the other that is correct, but rather both theories may be correct in different circumstances of ambient pressure. The atmospheric pressure with gravity theory obviously cannot explain siphons in vacuum, where there is no significant atmospheric pressure. But the cohesion tension with gravity theory cannot explain CO2 gas siphons, siphons working despite bubbles, and the flying droplet siphon, where gases do not exert significant pulling forces, and liquids not in contact cannot exert a cohesive tension force.|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} derived to {{calculate}} the pressure losses originating from the dilute phase pneumatic transport of coarse particles in the horizontal stationary flow regime. The model {{is based on the}} balance of drag forces and frictional forces acting on the particles during pneumatic transport. The particles are characterized by the particle terminal velocity, the particle âwall sliding friction coefficient and the coefficient of restitution between particles and wall. The influence of the inhomogeneous particle distribution in the pipe is taken into account using a particle density distribution resembling the <b>barometric</b> <b>height</b> formula. The model is verified experimentally by the use of particle velocity measurements and particle-wall collision measurements during pneumatic transport. For this purpose measuring techniques and tools have been developed. A Froude number, based on the mean square value of the radial particle-velocity component, appears in the model as an empirical parameter. This Froude number increases with increasing average air velocity but may also depend on the pipe diameter and the solids-mass flow to some extent. However this dependency could not be quantified and may restrict the accuracy of pressure loss predictions with the model. The assumption of a linear relationship between the Froude number and the average air velocity provides scaling and prediction possibilities for pressure losses.

30|$|There is no free {{parameter}} in {{the solution}} to calculate deposition currents. Only the first boundary condition of a constant soil concentration is considered. This difficulty is overcome by the arbitrary introduction of the Janicke Convention. It is explained that this differentially no mass conservation is guaranteed. One understands by deposition loss and not storage. The thought model for this purpose is defined according to Axenfeld et al. (1984), the deposition rate as the speed after the “-picturally speaking -… a rising {{on the surface of}} the earth, the column containing the depositionable material, by idling idle”. The concentration distributions calculated with the faulty reference solution for the case examples 22 a and 22 b, which are described in Janicke and Janicke (2002) show that deposition and sedimentation are described inaccurately. The law of mass conservation and the II law of thermodynamics are violated. For the calculation of the soil concentration in case 22 a, one obtains an indeterminate expression, which is why deviating from all other test cases, one must introduce a “volume source over the entire computing area” distributed there. The pollutant particles must be redistributed by the authors of the AUSTAL in the control volume so that they follow a <b>barometric</b> <b>height</b> distribution. However, this redistribution is more a result of procedural segregation rather than a calculation of the spread of air pollutants with physically based balance equations.|$|E
3000|$|First, {{the case}} study 22 a is of interest, in which, {{according}} to Janicke (2002), although sedimentation is allowed, but no deposition should take place. The results are described in Graph a of Fig.  1. With [...] L_z = 200 m the sedimentation velocity is given. The diffusion coefficient is [...] K = 1 [...]. The emissions are released by an evenly distributed volume source over the entire control area. Without further justification, the “specialization [...] F_c = 0 [...] “should continue to apply for this case, which implies according to Eq. (11) also [...] v_d = 0 [...], because one must assume a non-vanishing soil concentration [...] c_ 0. If one compares the specification [...] F_c = 0 [...] with Eq. (2), this assumption implies that the propagation process should only be described by a homogeneous differential equation, for which only the homogeneous solution (5) with [...] b = c_ 0 applies can be. Taking into account {{the definition of the}} deposition rate given in Trukenmüller (2017) according to Eq. (14), this assumption implies a vanishing conductive mass transport as well as a non-existent sedimentation stream. This leads to the conclusion that [...] F_c = 0 [...] can only be equated with a nonexistent emission. The other possibility that both transports cancel each other out also expresses a missing emission. This case is comparable to solving an eigenvalue problem according to Eq. (2) and is more theoretical than practical. In the case of practical applications, immissions can occur only in the presence of emissions, so that the <b>barometric</b> <b>height</b> distribution according to Eq. (5) can not be considered as a solution of the eigenvalue task (2) for propagation calculations. Despite this inadmissibility one wants to make believe with the graphic a, one can compute concentration distributions with missing emissions. However, the authors of the AUSTAL have the difficulty that no calculation equation for the soil concentration is available. Because of the given propagation parameters with [...] F_c = 0 [...] and [...] v_d = 0 [...], the relation [...] F_c = c_ 0 · v_d results in an indefinite expression [...] c_ 0 = 0 / 0, which allows any numerical value. Without specifying a calculation rule, a soil concentration of [...] c_ 0 = 1100.6 [...] is given. One would have to know that a validation of propagation models without knowledge of the algorithm used is not possible. It is up to the reader to find out this calculation rule. It turns out that the soil concentration, contrary to all ideas for calculating the spread of air pollutants, is determined speculatively. But not only this contradiction is objectionable. According to the prerequisite, no deposition should take place for the case 22 a. However, this would presuppose a vanishing concentration gradient on the ground for [...] z = 0, but this can not be seen from Eq. (15). According to Eq. (15), a deposition current of ṁ_d = v_s· c_ 0 - F_c = 0.01 · 1100.6 - 0 ≈ 11 [...] is calculated, which, however, precludes the assumption without deposition. The negative concentration gradient calculated incorrectly on the ground according to Eq. (12) forces a material flow {{in the direction of the}} positive height coordinate. However, a deposition current is directed towards the ground and not vice versa in the free atmosphere. It is calculated incorrectly in terms of amount and direction, which is why the II. Law of thermodynamics is violated. The calculated concentration distribution also suggests that the source of the source should be located in the ground and not evenly distributed as a volume source throughout the control area. Already the consideration of the graphic a excites unrest.|$|E

There {{is a distinct}} differentiation between aspiration pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis in humans {{that can be applied}} to bovines.

40|$|Magnetic loops {{filled with}} hot plasma {{are the main}} {{building}} blocks of the solar corona. Usually they have lengths {{of the order of}} the <b>barometric</b> scale <b>height</b> in the corona that is 50 Mm. Previously {{it has been suggested that}} miniature versions of hot loops exist. These would have lengths of only 1 Mm barely protruding from the chromosphere and spanning across just one granule in the photosphere. Such short loops are well established at transition region temperatures (0. 1 MK), and we investigate if such miniature loops also exist at coronal temperatures (> 1 MK). We used extreme UV imaging (EUV) observations from the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0. 3 " to 0. 4 ". Together with EUV imaging and magnetogram data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) data from Hinode we investigated the spatial, temporal and thermal evolution of small loop-like structures in the solar corona above a plage region close to an active region and compared this to a moss area within the active region. We find that the size, motion and temporal evolution of the loop-like features are consistent with photospheric motions, suggesting a close connection to the photospheric magnetic field. Aligned magnetograms show that one of their endpoints is rooted at a magnetic concentration. Their thermal structure, as revealed together with the X-ray observations, shows significant differences to moss-like features. Considering different scenarios, these features are most probably miniature versions of hot loops rooted at magnetic concentrations at opposite sides of a granule in small emerging magnetic loops (or flux tubes).

60|$|Hoping {{to obtain}} another view, which might enable me {{to correct the}} {{bearings}} taken that morning, I was tempted to spend a second night {{in the open air}} at Lacheepia, passing the day botanizing* [Scarcely a grass, and no Astragali, grow on these stony and snowy slopes: and the smallest heath-like Andromeda, a still smaller Menziesia (an erotic genus, previously unknown in the Himalaya) and a prostrate willow, are the only woody-stemmed plants above 15,000 feet.] in the vicinity, and taking observations of the barometer and wet-bulb: I also boiled three thermometers by turns, noting the grave errors likely to attend observations of this instrument for elevation.* [These will be more particularly alluded to in the Appendix, where will be found a comparison of elevations, deduced from boiling point and from <b>barometric</b> observations. The <b>height</b> of Lacheepia is 14,912 feet by boiling-point, and 15,262 feet by barometer.] Little rain fell during the day, but it was heavy at night, though there was fortunately no wind; and I made a more comfortable bed with tufts of juniper brought up from below. Our fire was principally of wet rhododendron wood, with masses of the aromatic dwarf species, which, being full of resinous glands, blazed with fury. Next day, after a very transient glimpse of the Kinchinjunga snows, I descended to Lachoong, where I remained for some days botanizing. During my stay I was several times awakened by all the noises and accompaniments of a night-attack or alarm; screaming voices, groans, shouts, and ejaculations, the beating of drums and firing of guns, and flambeaux of pine-wood gleaming amongst the trees, and flitting from house to house. The cause, I was informed, was the, presence of a demon, who required exorcisement, and who generally managed to make the villagers remember his visit, by their missing various articles after the turmoil made to drive him away. The custom of driving out demons in the above manner is constantly practised by the Lamas in Tibet: MM. Huc and Gabet give a graphic account of such an operation during their stay at Kounboum.|$|R
