5|$|Dromaeosaurid fossils {{have been}} found across the globe in North America, Europe, Africa, Japan, China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Madagascar, Argentina, and Antarctica, with fossilized teeth giving {{credence}} {{to the possibility that}} they inhabited Australia as well. They first appeared in the mid-Jurassic Period (late <b>Bathonian</b> <b>stage,</b> about 167 million years ago) and survived {{until the end of the}} Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage, 66 ma), existing until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The presence of dromaeosaurids as early as the Middle Jurassic has been suggested by the discovery of isolated fossil teeth, though no dromaeosaurid body fossils {{have been found}} from this period.|$|E
500|$|Megalosaurus (meaning [...] "Great Lizard", from Greek μέγας, megas, meaning 'big', 'tall' or 'great' and σαῦρος, sauros, meaning 'lizard') is a genus {{of large}} meat-eating {{theropod}} dinosaurs of the Middle Jurassic period (<b>Bathonian</b> <b>stage,</b> 166 million years ago) of Southern England.

50|$|The sediments {{in which}} it was found were {{originally}} thought to represent the Hauterivian to Barremian stages of the early Cretaceous Period, dating Jobaria to approximately 132 million years ago. However, re-interpretation of the sediments showed that they are more likely from the <b>Bathonian</b> to Oxfordian <b>stages</b> of the middle Jurassic in age, between 167 and 161 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Yangchuanosaurus is an extinct genus of metriacanthosaurid {{theropod}} dinosaur {{that lived}} in China during the <b>Bathonian</b> and Callovian <b>stages</b> of the Middle Jurassic, and was similar in size and appearance to its North American relative, Allosaurus. It hails from the Upper Shaximiao Formation and was the largest predator in a landscape which included the sauropods Mamenchisaurus and Omeisaurus {{as well as the}} Stegosaurs Chialingosaurus, Tuojiangosaurus and Chungkingosaurus.

2500|$|This {{skeleton}} {{was actually}} discovered during {{the construction of}} the Zigong Dinosaur Museum, in which it is now housed. This museum features many dinosaurs recovered from the famous Dashanpu Quarry outside the city of Zigong, in the Chinese province of Sichuan, including Agilisaurus, as well as Xuanhanosaurus, Shunosaurus, and Huayangosaurus. This quarry preserves sediment from the Lower Shaximiao Formation (sometimes called [...] "Xiashaximiao") which ranges from the <b>Bathonian</b> through Callovian <b>stages</b> of the Middle Jurassic Period, or from about 168 to 161million years ago.|$|R
25|$|The {{remains of}} Afrovenator were {{discovered}} in 1993 in the Tiourarén Formation {{of the department of}} Agadez in Niger. The Tiourarén was originally thought to represent the Hauterivian to Barremian stages of the early Cretaceous Period, or approximately 132 to 125 million years ago (Sereno et al. 1994). However, re-interpretation of the sediments showed that they are probably mid-Jurassic in age, dating Afrovenator to the <b>Bathonian</b> to Oxfordian <b>stages,</b> between 167 and 161 mya. The sauropod Jobaria, whose remains were first mentioned in the same paper which named Afrovenator, is also known from this formation.|$|R
5000|$|Despite being a frequented [...] "dinosaur-quarry" [...] at present, the Dashanpu Formation {{was once}} a lush forest, {{evidence}} {{of which has been}} found alongside dinosaur remains in the form of fossilised wood. Paleontologists speculate that the area also had a lake that was fed by a large river. Dinosaur remains would have been swept toward the lake over millions of years, thus accounting for the hundreds of specimens found. Paleontologists have dated parts of the formation at about 168 to 161 million years old, between the <b>Bathonian</b> to Callovian <b>stages</b> of the Mid Jurassic.|$|R
5000|$|Eoneustes (meaning [...] "dawn swimmer") is an extinct genus of metriorhynchoid crocodyliform from Middle Jurassic (late Bajocian {{to early}} <b>Bathonian</b> <b>stage)</b> {{deposits}} of France.

50|$|Arcticoceras kochi and A ishmanae {{have been}} found in the boreal <b>Bathonian</b> <b>stage</b> of central East Greenland. Arcticoceras and Arctocephalites are found the Volga River Basin, Sartov Region, and Arctocephalites in the Pechora River Basin {{indicating}} an earlier and deeper penetration of arctic water into European Russia than previously thought.|$|E
50|$|The holotype, or {{original}} specimen, of Abrosaurus is {{a fossil}} skull which is nearly complete and very well preserved. A fragmentary skull and a skeleton {{have also been}} referred to this taxon but published description is lacking (Zhang & Chen, 1996). All of the material comes from the famous Dashanpu Quarry near Zigong in China, and is housed in the dinosaur museum there. Abrosaurus and at least 4 other species of sauropod are known from the Lower Shaximiao Formation (also called Xiashaximiao) at Dashanpu. These sediments are dated from the <b>Bathonian</b> to Callovian <b>stages</b> of the Middle Jurassic Period, or about 168 to 161 million years ago.|$|R
5000|$|Huayangosaurus is a genus of stegosaurian dinosaur {{from the}} Middle Jurassic of China. The name derives from [...] "Huayang" [...] (華陽), an {{alternate}} name for Sichuan (the province {{where it was}} discovered), and [...] "saurus", meaning [...] "lizard". It lived during the <b>Bathonian</b> to Callovian <b>stages,</b> around 165 million years ago, some 20 million years before its famous relative, Stegosaurus appeared in North America. At only 4.5 metres long, it was also much smaller than its famous cousin. Found in the Lower Shaximiao Formation, Huayangosaurus shared the local Middle Jurassic landscape with the sauropods Shunosaurus, Datousaurus, Omeisaurus and Protognathosaurus, the ornithopod Xiaosaurus and the carnivorous Gasosaurus. It was found in Huayang in China.|$|R
50|$|Chuandongocoelurus was {{initially}} {{based on two}} partial skeletons. The holotype, a thighbone, is part of specimen CCG 20010. Vertebrae, pelvic bones and hindlimb elements, also catalogued under this inventory number, may {{belong to the same}} individual. The specimen has unfused neurocentral sutures in its vertebrae, meaning that the animal was immature at the time of death. The formation in which it was discovered was the Lower Shaximiao Formation, part of the Dashanpu Formation, meaning Chuandongocoelurus dates to the <b>Bathonian</b> or Callovian <b>stage</b> of the Middle Jurassic. A second specimen is CCG 20011, a set of neck vertebrae from a different and much larger individual. In 2012, it was concluded that both specimens represent different taxa, probably not even closely related.|$|R
50|$|The Oppeliinae {{gave rise}} to the Hecticoceratinae in the early <b>Bathonian</b> <b>stage,</b> near the middle of their range and to the Taramelliceratinae, in the late Callovian, near the end of their tange, which in turn {{gave rise to}} the Streblitinae in the early Kimmeridgian and to the Haploceratidae in the late Kimmeridgian.|$|E
50|$|The Fullers Earth Formation is a {{geological}} formation that outcrops in southern England.

40|$|The Jackson Mountains {{are located}} in the western Great Basin in Humboldt County, {{northwest}} Nevada. The range contains a late Paleozoic to Mesozoic depositional sequence. This sequence records sedimentation, volcanism and deformation in a back-arc setting. The Mississippian to late Early Permian McGill Canyon Formation was deposited in basinal to slope to distal shelf environments, dominated by hemipelagic and turbiditic facies. In the Permian there was an volcanic arc andesite component, and a nearby contemporaneous carbonate platform shed olistostromes into the unit. The McGill Canyon was laid down in an area between the McCloud arc and the Havallah back-arc basin. The late Middle Triassic to middle Norian Bliss Canyon Formation was laid down in basinal to fore-reef to carbonate platform to lagoonal to terrigenous littoral environments. Both of these formations are of flap sequences deposited on an east-facing, back-arc margin. The Bliss Canyon represents the western margin of the Early Mesozoic marine basin of the western Great Basin. From the late Norian to the <b>Bathonian,</b> several <b>stages</b> of subearial volcanism and alluvial epiclastic sedimentation laid down the Happy Creek Formation, a thick arc andesite volcanic pile. The Happy Creek is part of the Early Mesozoic Cordilleran magmatic arc province. In the Bathonian, this volcanic pile was cut by a conjugate sinistral high-angle wrench fault system as volcanism waned. During the Callovian, sediments of the King Lear Formation filled in and then overlapped the wrench basins. These sediments were derived from the east, where a west-vergent thrust system was active. This phase of thrusting ceased by the Oxfordian. Arc-related silicic volcanism and alluvial to fluvial sedimentation within the King Tear continued into the Aptian, when the thrusts were reactivated during a second phase. Both phases of thrusting verged both east and west. Stocks, dikes and sills of the Early Mesozoic Intrusive suite are comagmatic with the volcanism in the Happy Creek and King Lear, and intrude the sedimentary units. This suite both plugs and is truncated by the wrench faults and the first phase of thrusting, but is cut by the second phase. The Jackson Mountains are part of the Black Rock terrane in northwest Nevada. Within this terrane, the rocks share a common tectonic history and stratigraphy distinct from the neighboring terranes, and are separated from them by Mesozoic thrust and strike-slip faults...|$|R
5000|$|Dong et al. (1978) named Yangchuanosaurus shangyouensis on {{the basis}} of CV 00215, a {{complete}} skull and skeleton which was collected from the Shangshaximiao Formation, near Yongchuan, Yongchuan District, Sichuan. It dates to the <b>Bathonian</b> to Callovian <b>stage</b> of the Middle Jurassic period, about 161.2-154 million years ago. It was discovered in June 1977 by a construction worker during the construction of the Shangyou Reservoir Dam. A second species from the same locality, Y. magnus, was named by Dong et al. (1983) {{on the basis}} of CV 00216, another complete skull and skeleton. A detailed revision of tetanuran phylogeny by Carrano, Benson & Sampson (2012) revealed that both species are cospecific. Dong et al. (1978) and Dong et al. (1983) differentiated these species primarily {{on the basis of}} size. In addition, Dong et al. (1983) noted that the maxilla of Y. magnus has an additional fenestra within the antorbital fossa, whereas Y. shangyouensis possessed only a fossa in this location. However, it is considered to be an intraspecific, possibly ontogenetic, variation. Furthermore, the apparent difference in cervical vertebral morphology can be explained by comparing different positions within the column. Hence, the holotypes of the two species of Yangchuanosaurus are effectively identical, and their codings are identical in Carrano et al. (2012) matrix. Gregory S. Paul (1988) regarded this genus the same as Metriacanthosaurus, but this has not been supported.Carrano et al. (2012) assigned a third specimen to Y. shangyouensis. CV 00214 is represented by a partial postcranial skeleton lacking the skull. It was collected in the Wujiaba Quarry, near Zigong city, Sichuan, from {{the lower part of the}} Shangshaximiao Formation. CV 00214 was initially listed by Dong et al. (1978) in a faunal list as a new species of Szechuanosaurus, Szechuanosaurus [...] "yandonensis". There is no description or illustration of it, making S. [...] "yandonensis" [...] a nomen nudum. Later, Dong et al. (1983) described it, and assigned it to Szechuanosaurus campi, a dubious species which is known only from four teeth. Carrano et al. (2012) noted that CV 00214 can't be assigned to S. campi because the holotype materials of S. campi (IVPP V.235, V.236, V.238, V.239; teeth) are non-diagnostic and no teeth are preserved in CV 00214. A recent restudy of CV 00214 by Daniel Chure (2001) concluded that it represented a new taxon, informally named [...] "Szechuanoraptor dongi", into which Szechuanosaurus zigongensis should also be subsumed. However, the most recent revision (by Carrano et al. (2012)) suggested that CV 00214 and [...] "S." [...] zigongensis cannot be cospecific as there are no autapomorphies shared between them, and the latter derives from the underlying Xiashaximiao Formation. A phylogenetic analysis found CV 00214 to be most closely related to Y. shangyouensis, and thus the former is assignable to it. Furthermore, Szechuanosaurus zigongensis was found to be closely related to Y. shangyouensis and therefore was designated as the second species of Yangchuanosaurus.|$|R
