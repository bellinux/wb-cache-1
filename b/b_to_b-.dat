Fitch Ratings also lowered each of Venezuela's credit ratings in March 2014 from B+ to B and even lower from B to CCC in December 2014. In December 2013, Moody's Investors Service also downgraded both Venezuela's local (B1) and foreign currency (B2) ratings to Caa1.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of a laminin coating on calcium phosphate precipitation on three potentially bioactive titanium surfaces in simulated body fluid. Material and Methods: Blasted titanium discs were prepared by alkali and heat treatment (AH), anodic oxidation (AO) or hydroxyapatite coating (HA) and subsequently coated with laminin. A laminin coated blasted surface (B) served as a positive control while a blasted non coated (B-) served as a negative control. Surface morphology was examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The analysis of the precipitated calcium and phosphorous was performed by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). Results: The thickness of the laminin coating was estimated at 26 Å by ellipsometry. Interferometry revealed that the coating process did not affect any of the tested topographical parameters on µm level when comparing <b>B</b> <b>to</b> <b>B-.</b> After 2 weeks of incubation in SBF, the alkali-heat treated discs displayed the highest calcium phosphate deposition and the B group showed higher levels of calcium phosphate than the B- group. Conclusions: Our results suggest that laminin may have the potential to be used as a coating agent in order to enhance the osseoinductive performance of biomaterial surfaces, with the protein molecules possibly functioning as nucleation centres for apatite formation. Nevertheless, in vivo studies are required in order to clarify the longevity of the coating and its performanc...|$|E

40|$|Adult mice {{have two}} easily {{recognizable}} subsets of B cells: the predominant resting {{population of the}} spleen, called B- 2, and those called B- 1, which predominate in coelomic cavities and can express CD 5. Some antibody specificities appear to be unique <b>to</b> the <b>B-</b> 1 population. Cells expressing antibody specific for phosphatidyl choline (PtC) are the most frequent, comprising 2 - 10 % of peritoneal B cells in normal mice. To understand {{the basis for the}} segregation of the anti-PtC specificity to this population, we have produced transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the rearranged VH 12 and V kappa 4 genes of a PtC-specific B- 1 cell lymphoma. We find that VH 12 -Tg and VH 12 /V kappa 4 double-Tg mice develop very high numbers of PtC-specific peritoneal and splenic B cells. These cells have the characteristics of B- 1 cells; most are CD 5 +, and are all IgMhi, B 220 lo, and CD 23 -. In the peritoneum these cells are also CD 11 b+. In addition, adult mice have many splenic <b>B</b> cells (up <b>to</b> one third of Tg+ cells) that express the VH 12 Tg but do not bind PtC, presumably because they express a V kappa gene other than V kappa 4. These cells appear <b>to</b> be <b>B-</b> 2 cells; they are CD 23 +, CD 11 b-, IgMlo, B 220 hi, and CD 5 -. Thus, mice given either the VH 12 Tg alone or together with the V kappa 4 Tg develop a large population of PtC- specific B cells which belong exclusively <b>to</b> the <b>B-</b> 1 population. Since B- 2 cells can express the VH 12 and V kappa 4 gene separately, we interpret these data to indicate that the events leading to the segregation of PtC-specific <b>B</b> cells <b>to</b> the <b>B-</b> 1 population in normal mice are initiated after Ig gene rearrangement and expression. These data are discussed with regard to hypotheses of the origin of B- 1 cells.

We find in C 57 BL/ 6. xid mice that V H 12 pre-BII cell selection is normal and that PtC-specific B cells undergo modest clonal expansion. However, the majority of splenic PtC-specific B cells in anti-PtC Tg/xid mice are B- 0, rather than B- 1 as in their non-xid counterparts. These data indicate that PtC-specific B- 0 cell generation precedes segregation as predicted, and that Btk function is required for efficient segregation <b>to</b> <b>B-</b> 1.

We report here a bias for Vκ 4 / 5 H expression among VH 12 -expressing B cells, {{even among those}} that do not bind PtC and are not B- 1.

Thus, the bias for Vκ 4 / 5 H expression is independent of PtC binding, and, as segregation <b>to</b> <b>B-</b> 1 occurs after Ig gene expression, it precedes segregation <b>to</b> the <b>B-</b> 1 subset. In 6 - 1 mice, splenic B- 1 cells reside in follicles but segregate to follicles distinct from those that contain B- 2 cells.

Furthermore, we found that B- 2 cells express substantially more PU. 1 than B- 1 cells, which is consistent with the idea that maintenance of the B- 2 cell phenotype requires relatively high levels of PU. 1, but B- 1 cells require little...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the CDF {{collaboration}} {{has reported}} a {{measurement of the}} CP asymmetry in the B→ψ K_S decay: a_ψ K_S= 0. 79 ^+ 0. 41 _- 0. 44. We analyze the constraints that follow from this measurement on the size and the phase of contributions from new physics <b>to</b> <b>B-</b> mixing. Defining the relative phase between the full M_ 12 amplitude and the Standard Model contribution to be 2 θ_d, we find a new bound: sin 2 θ_d- 0. 6 (- 0. 87) at one sigma (95...|$|R
40|$|Herein, {{we report}} on the use of a {{tricyclic}} cytosine FRET pair, incorporated into DNA with different base pair separations, to study Z-DNA and B-Z DNA junctions. With its position inside the DNA structure, the FRET pair responds <b>to</b> a <b>B-</b> <b>to</b> Z-DNA transition with a distinct change in FRET efficiency for each donor/acceptor configuration allowing reliable structural probing. Moreover, we show how fluorescence spectroscopy and our cytosine analogues can be used to determine rate constants for the <b>B-</b> <b>to</b> Z-DNA transition mechanism. The modified cytosines have little influence on the transition and the FRET pair is thus an easily implemented and virtually non-perturbing fluorescence tool to study Z-DNA. This nucleobase analogue FRET pair represents a valuable addition to the limited number of fluorescence methods available to study Z-DNA and we suggest it will facilitate, for example, deciphering the <b>B-</b> <b>to</b> Z-DNA transition mechanism and investigating the interaction of DNA with Z-DNA binding proteins...|$|R
40|$|Two {{populations of}} B lymphocytes, B- 1 (CD 5 + and/or CD 11 b+) and B- 2 (CD 5 - and CD 11 b-) cells have been described. In mice, {{which is the}} species of {{reference}} for B- 1 and B- 2 cell studies, these two subsets present different developmental schemes, phenotypes, antibody repertoires, localization and behaviours. Interestingly, in sheep, B cells rearrange their immunoglobulin (Ig) loci around the neonatal period, similarly <b>to</b> murine <b>B-</b> 1 cells. However, the phenotype of the sheep B cells has not been characterized with regards to their developmental pathway. In this report, we show that two sheep B-cell subsets can be distinguished {{on the basis of}} CD 11 <b>b</b> expression. Relative <b>to</b> CD 11 <b>b-</b> <b>B</b> cells, the CD 11 b+ B cells frequently co-express CD 5, CD 11 c, higher levels of surface IgM (sIgM), show larger cell size and higher cell-cycling activity, and thus present a B- 1 -like phenotype. However, unlike murine B- 1 cells, sheep B- 1 like cells mainly localize in blood, display a higher propensity to spontaneous apoptosis relative <b>to</b> <b>B-</b> 2 -like cells, and proliferate after sIgM stimulation. Our data show that despite neonatal immunoglobulin loci rearrangements, sheep B cells do not all express a B- 1 -like phenotype. However, B- 1 -and B- 2 -like cells co-exist and present phenotypic and behavioural specificities. Nevertheless, sheep B- 1 -and B- 2 -like cells differ from the murine B- 1 and B- 2 cells in their cell behaviour. These subsets can thus not be considered as true homologues among species...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} decay B- 0 ->(D*+D*-KS 0) using (230 +/- 2) x 10 (6) B (B) over bar pairs {{collected}} by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II B factory. We measure a branching fraction B(B- 0 ->(D*+D*-KS 0)) =(4. 4 +/- 0. 4 +/- 0. 7) x 10 (- 3) and find evidence for the decay B- 0 -> D*-Ds 1 +(2536) with a significance of 4. 6 sigma. A time-dependent CP asymmetry analysis is also performed to study the possible resonant contributions <b>to</b> <b>B-</b> 0 ->(D*+D*-KS 0) and the sign of cos 2 beta. Our measurement indicates {{that there is a}} sizable resonant contribution <b>to</b> the decay <b>B-</b> 0 ->(D*+D*-KS 0) from an unknown D-s 1 (+) state with large width, and that cos 2 beta is positive at the 94 % confidence level under certain theoretical assumptions...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss whether}} the NuTeV anomaly can be explained, compatibly {{with all other}} data, by QCD effects (maybe, if the strange sea is asymmetric, or there is a tiny {{violation}} of isospin), new physics in propagators or couplings of the vector bosons (not really), loops of supersymmetric particles (no), dimension six operators (yes, for one specific SU(2) -invariant operator), leptoquarks (not in a minimal way), extra U(1) gauge bosons (maybe: an unmixed Z' coupled <b>to</b> <b>B-</b> 3 L_mu also increases the muon g- 2 by about 10 ^{- 9 } and gives a `burst' to cosmic rays above the GZK cutoff) ...|$|R
40|$|The layered ternary {{compound}} TaIrTe 4 has been predicted to be a type-II Weyl semimetal with only four Weyl points {{just above the}} Fermi energy. Performing magnetotransport measurements on this material {{we find that the}} resistivity does not saturate for fields up to 70 T and follows a rho similar <b>to</b> <b>B-</b> 1. 5 dependence. Angular-dependent de Haas-van Alphen measurements reveal four distinct frequencies. Analyzing these magnetic quantum oscillations by use of density functional theory calculations we establish that in TaIrTe 4 the Weyl points are located merely similar to 40 - 50 meV above the chemical potential...|$|R
