40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the effect of bottom and suspended mussel cultures, cultured in different physical environments, on the sedimentary environmental conditions and thereby the biodiversity structure of the associated macrofaunal community. We compared two <b>bottom</b> <b>cultures</b> (Limfjorden: microtidal, wind-driven; Oosterschelde: macrotidal) and one suspended culture (Ria de Vigo in an upwelling coastal region). The sedimentary environmental conditions (mud fraction, POC, PON, phosphorus content, chl breakdown products) were significantly elevated underneath and surrounding <b>bottom</b> and suspended <b>cultures</b> compared to culture-free sediments that were nearby and hydrodynamically similar. The relative change in environmental conditions was more pronounced in the Oosterschelde compared to Limfjorden, most likely due to differences in hydrodynamic forcing and characteristics of the mussel bed. The effect of the suspended cultures in Ria de Vigo on the surrounding sediments was influenced by local topographic and hydrodynamic conditions. The impact of mussels on the benthic community due to biodeposition was clearly seen in the community structure. The species composition changed from species which are typically present in sandy environments to more small opportunistic species, which are typically present in organically enriched sediments. The impact of <b>bottom</b> <b>cultures</b> on the benthic community due to changes in the habitat under the presence of mussels was positive, especially in the Oosterschelde where an increase in the number of epibenthic species was seen. The influence of <b>bottom</b> <b>cultures</b> on the sedimentary environment and on the macrobenthic community seems to be very local. Within the mussel site in Limfjorden, differences were detected between sites where none or almost no mussels were present with sites where mussels were very abundant...|$|R

Common scallops had slightly higher moisture, and total protein content, significantly higher total fat content, and significantly lower ash content than ivory white scallops when cultivated under both suspended and <b>bottom</b> <b>culture</b> conditions. For scallops of both colors, suspended culture individuals had slightly higher moisture, total protein content, significantly lower total fat and ash content, compared to <b>bottom</b> <b>culture</b> conditions. Most amino acids were more abundant in scallops from the <b>bottom</b> <b>culture</b> group than in scallops from the suspended culture group. The ivory white scallops contained slightly higher amounts of total amino acids, essential amino acids, and flavor-imparting amino acids, than the common scallops under a given culture method. In the suspended culture group, common scallops had higher content of unsaturated fatty acids, mono-unsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, lower contents of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, compared with ivory white scallops. In the <b>bottom</b> <b>culture</b> group, common scallops contained more unsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid compared with ivory white scallops.

40|$|In The Netherlands, several pilot {{projects}} {{are carried out}} {{on the use of}} spat collectors as an additional supply of seed for <b>bottom</b> <b>culture</b> of mussels (Mytilus edulis). The method proves to be successful in yielding substantial amounts of seed. One of the conditions for successful application of collector seed on bottom plots is a good yield of the seed on bottom plots. Mussel seed of different origin (from wild littoral and sublittoral beds or from collectors) was offered to predators (crabs Carcinus maenas and starfish Asterias rubens) and seed survival was monitored. In addition, the effect of density and size of collector seed on predation was studied. Circular cages containing predators and seed were placed in a basin with running seawater, or suspended from a jetty in a harbour. Two size classes of predators and three size classes of seed were used. Survival was monitored. Consumption of mussel seed by starfish was much lower than by crabs. Maximum observed consumption rates were 23 seed/day/crab and 1 seed/day/starfish. Consumption rates increased significantly with decreasing seed size. Seed larger than 20 mm were consumed at a significantly lower rate. Seed density did not affect survival. Collector seed was not consumed at higher rates than wild littoral or sublittoral seed. In conclusion, collector seed can be a promising additional source of seed for <b>bottom</b> <b>culture</b> of mussels in The Netherland...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{function}} and viability of cultured, transplanted, or encapsulated pancreatic islets is often limited by hypoxia because these islets {{have lost their}} vasculature during the isolation process and {{have to rely on}} gradient-driven passive diffusion, which cannot provide adequate oxygen transport. Pancreatic islets (islets of Langerhans) are particularly susceptible due to their relatively large size, large metabolic demand, and increased sensitivity to hypoxia. Here, finite element method (FEM) based multiphysics models are explored to describe oxygen transport and cell viability in avascular islets both in static and in moving culture media. Methods Two- and three-dimensional models were built in COMSOL Multiphysics using the convection and diffusion as well as the incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics application modes. Oxygen consumption was assumed to follow Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics and to cease when local concentrations fell below a critical threshold; in a dynamic model, it was also allowed to increase with increasing glucose concentration. Results Partial differential equation (PDE) based exploratory cellular-level oxygen consumption and cell viability models incorporating physiologically realistic assumptions have been implemented for fully scaled cell culture geometries with 100, 150, and 200 μ m diameter islets as representative. Calculated oxygen concentrations and intra-islet regions likely to suffer from hypoxia-related necrosis obtained for traditional flask-type cultures, oxygen-permeable silicone-rubber membrane <b>bottom</b> <b>cultures,</b> and perifusion chambers with flowing media and varying incoming glucose levels are presented in detail illustrated with corresponding colour-coded figures and animations. Conclusion Results of the computational models are, as a first estimate, in good quantitative agreement with existing experimental evidence, and they confirm that during culture, hypoxia is often a problem for non-vascularised islet and can lead to considerable cell death (necrosis), especially in the core region of larger islets. Such models are of considerable interest to improve the {{function and}} viability of cultured, transplanted, or encapsulated islets. The present implementation allows convenient extension to true multiphysics applications that solve coupled physics phenomena such as diffusion and consumption with convection due to flowing or moving media. </p...|$|R
