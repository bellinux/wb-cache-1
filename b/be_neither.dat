5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E

5000|$|These subtle, {{progressive}} socio-cultural shifts {{are somehow}} summarized succinctly in Chapter 3 of the Epistle to the Galatians: There <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> Jew nor Greek: there <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> slave nor free: there <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> male nor female. For {{you are all}} one in Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:28).|$|R
25|$|A {{subspace}} W of V that is invariant {{under the}} group action {{is called a}} subrepresentation. If V has exactly two subrepresentations, namely the zero-dimensional subspace and V itself, then the representation {{is said to be}} irreducible; if it has a proper subrepresentation of nonzero dimension, the representation is said to be reducible. The representation of dimension zero is considered to <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> reducible nor irreducible, just like the number 1 is considered to <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> composite nor prime.|$|E
25|$|María's {{whipping}} by Mexican bandits, {{which was}} {{the primary reason for}} the 18 rating in 1993. The scene was passed without cuts because the action was found to <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> sexualized nor titillating.|$|E
25|$|Hanna Barysevich: Barysevich {{claimed to}} have been 118. This can <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> {{verified}} nor disproven from Belarus records. The claim is demographically possible but incompletely verified. The probability of surviving to age 118 is low.|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{principle}} of Velayat e Faqih <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> intuitively obvious, nor rationally necessary. It <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> a requirement of religion (Din) nor {{a necessity for}} denomination (Mazhab). It <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> a part of Shiite general principles ('Usoul), nor a component of detailed observances (Forou') It is, by near consensus of Shiite Ulama, {{nothing more than a}} jurisprudential minor hypothesis." ...|$|R

25|$|In {{order for}} a citron to be kosher, it must <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> grafted nor hybridized with any other species. Only a few {{traditional}} varieties are therefore used. To ensure that no grafting is used, the plantations are kept under strict rabbinical supervision.|$|E
25|$|Thus finite-dimensional linear isometries—rotations, reflections, {{and their}} combinations—produce {{orthogonal}} matrices. The converse is also true: orthogonal matrices imply orthogonal transformations. However, linear algebra includes orthogonal transformations between spaces which may <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> finite-dimensional nor {{of the same}} dimension, and these have no orthogonal matrix equivalent.|$|E
25|$|Every speech must be put {{together}} like a living creature, with a body of its own; it must <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> without head nor without legs; and it must have a middle and extremities that are fitting both {{to one another and}} to the whole work.|$|E

25|$|Many polytheistic deities since prehistoric {{times have}} been assumed to <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> good nor evil (or {{to have both}} qualities). Thus dystheism is {{normally}} used {{in reference to the}} Judeo-Christian God. In conceptions of God as the summum bonum, the proposition of God not being wholly good would of course be an oxymoron.|$|E
25|$|APL also {{identifies}} those features {{built into}} the language, and represented by a symbol, or a fixed combination of symbols, as primitives. Most primitives are either functions or operators. Coding APL is largely a process of writing non-primitive functions and (in some versions of APL) operators. However a few primitives are considered to <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> functions nor operators, most noticeably assignment.|$|E
25|$|This was our paradox: no {{course of}} action could be {{determined}} by a rule, because every {{course of action}} can be made out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be made out to accord with the rule, then {{it can also be}} made out to conflict with it. And there would <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> accord nor conflict here.|$|E
50|$|Vishnu {{appeared}} {{in the form of}} Narasimha - half human and half lion, at dusk (when it <b>was</b> <b>neither</b> day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which <b>was</b> <b>neither</b> indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which <b>was</b> <b>neither</b> land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which <b>were</b> <b>neither</b> a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon). In this form, the boon of five special powers granted to Hiranyakashyapu were no longer useful. Prahlad and the kingdom of human beings were thus free from the compulsion and fear of Hiranyakashyapu, showing the victory of good over evil.|$|R
25|$|A {{statement}} that <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> provable nor disprovable from {{a set of}} axioms is called undecidable (from those axioms). One example is the parallel postulate, which <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> provable nor refutable from the remaining axioms of Euclidean geometry.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that both}} f+ and f&minus; are non-negative functions. A {{peculiarity}} of terminology {{is that the}} 'negative part' <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> negative nor a part (like the imaginary part of a complex number <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> imaginary nor a part).|$|R

25|$|During {{his days}} of exile, Qu Yuan {{is thought to}} have written Li Sao, his magnum opus and the first and {{centrally}} important piece of Chu Ci. The authorship, as in many a case of ancient literature, can <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> confirmed nor denied. Written in 373 verses containing 2490 characters, Li Sao is the earliest Chinese long poem and is acclaimed as the literary representative of Qu Yuan's high moral conduct and patriotism.|$|E

Here we see nothing but pagans, clad in shoes, with sombreros and blankets, and serving as muleteers to the {{settlers}} and rancheros, so {{that if it were}} not for the gentiles there would <b>be</b> <b>neither</b> pueblos nor ranches. These pagan Indians care neither for the missions nor for the missionaries.|$|E
25|$|Rogozhin is {{sentenced to}} fifteen years hard labor in Siberia. Myshkin goes mad and, {{through the efforts}} of Yevgeny Pavlovich, returns to the {{sanatorium}} in Switzerland.

As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.|$|E
