Galvis said, [...] "They told me that I couldn't play (pro) baseball. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I had the ability."

Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> there was the possibility her vocals would be different.

500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Moby for his fifth studio album Play (1999) and recorded in his Little Italy, Manhattan apartment. He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, and I loved her very much. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but knowing you shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E

I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten.

It might as well be called 'This Charming Song'." [...] In 2007, Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher described the first time he heard the track: [...] "The second I heard 'This Charming Man' everything made sense.

[...] Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave her play for him. Miles said that Solanas [...] "had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind."

In Grouse's {{scouting}} report, he wrote that Kinsler had a great feel for the game, athleticism, solid defensive skills, intensity, and leadership qualities. Grouse knew that Kinsler was probably being underrated by rival scouts who did not know that Kinsler had played with a foot stress fracture while at Missouri, [...] "so [...] really couldn't run like I knew he could. I'd seen him in Wichita the year before, so I knew he was a plus runner.

In addition, actors from Germany and Poland (including Thomas Mann, Rainer Bock, and Joanna Kulig) {{and other parts}} of the world were also cast. Viitala, a self-described [...] "big fan" [...] of Renner, said she was nervous at first, but found him [...] "extremely" [...] easy to approach, made a good connection, and enjoyed working with him. Wirkola said Berdal was chosen for her [...] "piercing" [...] eyes, adding: [...] "There are a lot of Norwegians in the film.

[...] Stormare said he was only surprised at [...] "how smart Tom [...] is, and how broad this fantasy is and the span of his imagination," [...] his favourite aspect being how [...] "some of the witches are so sexy and cool."

500|$|During this period, he billed {{himself as}} Thomas (or Thos) Stevens, but reorganised {{the name to}} its {{backward}} spelling of Mot Snevets; the name {{did not last long}} and he changed it to Thomas Terry. He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of Dame Ellen Terry, so inverted the name to Terry Thomas. He did not add the hyphen until 1947, and later explained that it was [...] "not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together. They didn't mean much apart; together they made a trade name": the hyphen was also [...] "to match the gap in his front teeth". By now, he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage. In order to avoid staining his fingers with smoke, he used a cigarette holder and later purchased [...] "the most irresistible holder in Dunhill's. It was slightly [...] because it was made of lacquered, black whangee... with a gold band twisting neatly round it". Adding to his look were a [...] "monocle, raffish waistcoat and red carnation". He later wrote that [...] "sartorially I was an eccentric. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that underneath the clothes I was very much a conservative Englishman who {{would have loved to have}} been a genuine eccentric".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} immediately after Johnston finished the Britain's Got Talent live tour over a six-week period in London.

[...] Johnston described recording the album as [...] "great", and said [...] "All I’ve ever wanted {{to do is go}} into a studio and record an album and it was everything I’ve ever dreamed of." [...] Johnson recorded [...] "Walking in the Air" [...] as a duet with fellow Britain's Got Talent contestant Faryl Smith, and the song was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. The recording was finished by September 2008, after which Johnston began to make appearances to publicise the release, including appearances on GMTV, Channel 5 News, BBC Breakfast, This Morning and Radio 2's Friday Night Is Music Night. In preparation for the album's promotion, Johnston received confidence tutoring. He said that [...] "I've got no confidence and sometimes people get on at me for being moody so I've had some help with that." [...] Johnston also received vocal training from Yvie Burnett, who was, at the time, coaching Leona Lewis and Leon Jackson, and with whom Smith trained during Britain's Got Talent.

500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had {{the heart of a}} lion, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that I was looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity." ...|$|E
