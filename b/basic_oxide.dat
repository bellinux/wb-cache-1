Both allotropes are black-brown {{in color and}} always contain some water, which cannot be removed, as heating also causes decomposition (to PbO and Pb3O4). The dioxide is a powerful oxidizer: it can oxidize hydrochloric and sulfuric acids.

Concurrent or successive reactions of simple carbonylation, homologation, hydrogenation to hydrocarbons, and etherification {{take place to}} varying extents. Carbonylation and etherification are favored by acid oxides and homologation and hydrogenation by <b>basic</b> <b>oxides.</b> This behavior {{is related to the}} formation and stabilization by the oxides of H+ and H- hydridocarbonylruthenium catalytic species, whose relative concentrations in solution depend {{on the nature of the}} oxide.

However, <b>basic</b> <b>oxides</b> such as alkaline earths or rare earths can stabilise the ruthenium by forming ruthenates, which have little tendency to volatilise. The ruthenates are synthesised either before the catalyst is made or in position on the catalyst support, which may be monolithic or pelleted. In the development of catalysts for the reduction of nitric oxide in the purification of automotive exhaust emissions one of the desired attributes of a catalyst {{is its ability to}} promote selectively the reduction of nitric oxide NO to molecular nitrogen (and not to ammonia as happens over a large majority of catalysts), in the presence of hydrogen...|$|R

50|$|The {{chemical}} elements can be broadly divided into metals, metalloids and nonmetals {{according to their}} shared physical and chemical properties.

Typical nonmetals have a dull, coloured or colourless appearance; are brittle when solid; are poor conductors of heat and electricity; and have acidic oxides. Most or some elements in each category share a range of other properties; a few elements have properties that are either anomalous given their category, or otherwise extraordinary.|$|E
40|$|The {{desorption}} of 13 CO 2 {{from the}} surface of <b>basic</b> <b>oxides</b> based on modified MgO was examined at conditions of chemical equilibrium using a 13 CO 2 / 12 CO 2 isotopic switch method. 13 CO 2 desorption rates increase with increasing concentration of 12 CO 2 in the gas phase and with increasing carrier gas flow rate, both during isotopic switch and transient temperature-programmed desorption of CO 2. These effects are caused by a decrease in the probability of 13 CO 2 readsorption and not by faster desorption steps assisted by gas-phase 12 CO 2. This isotopic switch method allows the determination of desorption rates and of the density of sites that can bind CO 2 reversibly at conditions typical of steady-state catalytic reactions. These measurements require, however, that we include in data analysis protocols any effects of readsorption processes...|$|R
