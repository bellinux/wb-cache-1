5000|$|After mid-1942, {{with the}} growth of armed Resistance, and the {{spectacular}} destruction of the Gorgopotamos <b>bridge</b> (<b>Operation</b> [...] "Harling") by a force of Greek guerrillas and British saboteurs on 25 November, the Italian authorities tried vainly to contain the surge in acts of resistance directed against their forces. The guerrillas were largely successful against the Italians, allowing for the creation of [...] "liberated" [...] areas in the mountainous interior, including sizeable towns, by mid-1943. At that time, however, German troops began being moved into Greece. Elite formations such as the 1st Panzer Division and the 1st Mountain Division were brought into the country, both in anticipation of a possible Allied landing in Greece (a concept deliberately promoted by the Allies themselves as a diversion from the landings at Sicily) and as a guarantee against a possible Italian capitulation.|$|E
50|$|In July 1943 the 8th DLI {{was part}} of the {{invasion}} force for Operation Husky, the allied campaign to capture Sicily from the Italian and German armies. Alerted to the invasion, the Germans airlifted paratroopers to Catania, north of the 8th Army's landing sites around Syracuse. One of the major links into mainland Sicily was the Primosole Bridge over the River Simeto between Syracuse and Catania. British Paratroopers were sent to capture the <b>bridge</b> (<b>Operation</b> Fustian), but, although the British 1st Parachute Brigade managed to take the bridge, they were forced to retreat due to an overwhelming enemy presence. The Durham Light Infantry and the 44th Royal Tank Regiment raced north to reinforce the paratroops. After wading the Simeto north of the bridge two companies of the 8th DLI succeeded in establishing a bridgehead on the opposite bank, taking the Primosole Bridge over which the remaining two companies of the Battalion were able to pass to reinforce the leading companies. Despite heavy casualties in hand to hand fighting the 8th DLI held the bridgehead until they were reinforced during the night by the 9th and 6th DLI. In the course of the battle Lucas’ position in the east of the bridgehead was struck by a German shell; he was seriously wounded in the back and hand and evacuated to Malta.|$|E

5000|$|The usual {{operating}} practice {{was that the}} number of powered cars in a train was at least one more than the number of trailers. Trailers, with or without train controls, were always placed in the middle of trains; train controls on trailers were mainly used in assembling or disassembling trains. As ridership declined and trains became shorter, trailers were primarily used only during rush hour. Combos were used to carry checked baggage to and from main-line trains at Oakland Pier and to deliver bundled newspapers. They were usually put {{on the end of the}} train toward Oakland Pier, and most commonly on the 7th St Line as far as Havenscourt or Seminary Avenue. When plans for longer routes were not implemented, 21 of the ACF combos were changed to motors at the time they received their round end windows in the 1920s. Due to the heavy grades on the Bay Bridge, 10 trailers were changed to motors in 1938 when all the passenger-carrying cars were modified with automatic train control and other safety equipment for <b>bridge</b> <b>operation.</b> The California Toll Bridge Authority (TBA) funded these changes and received title to 58 cars in return. All cars carried the name [...] "Southern Pacific Lines" [...] until Bay Bridge service began, when the IER-owned cars were repainted with [...] "Interurban Electric Railway Company".|$|E
40|$|The master’s thesis {{deals with}} a {{calculation}} of steady state and short-circuit conditions in a 110 kV system during a <b>bridge</b> <b>operation</b> of transformers in a Sokolnice substation. The theoretical part of the thesis {{deals with a}} calculation of steady state of a system using Newton’s iterative method, it investigates short-circuits – their timing, distinctive values and a method of their calculation. In the practical part the 100 kV grid supplied from Sokolnice substation is described. The main goal of the thesis is a comparation of two basic wirings: <b>bridge</b> <b>operation</b> of T 202 and T 203 transformers (contemporarily in service) and <b>bridge</b> <b>operation</b> of T 402 and T 403 (in service after 2017). These two wirings were controlled even during one state of emergency during which the Sokolnice substation {{will be affected by}} an outage of one busbar. Voltage conditions, loading of power line and transformers and overall power balance were controlled. Short-circuit conditions were also calculated and short-circuit resistance of particular substations was inspected.
