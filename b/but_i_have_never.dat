In a 1985 interview with Spin magazine, Ike admitted, [...] "Yeah, I hit her, but I didn't hit her more than the average guy beats his wife.... If she says I abused her, maybe I did." [...] He worded this slightly differently in his memoirs, Taking Back My Name (1999), writing: [...] "Sure, I've slapped Tina.... There have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> beat her." ...|$|E

[...] Journalist Bhawana Somaaya, who {{conducted a series of}} interviews with her during the 1980s, stated, [...] "She's a strange bundle of contradictions. Her moods change in a jiffy." [...] According to some critics, this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities as [...] "her unpredictable nature and moods have distanced many well wishers". In reply to this, and the said, [...] "I am moody by nature. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> consciously hurt anyone."

Among four Daley campaign appearances on a Sunday shortly before the primary was a rally of Polish Highlanders at 4808 S. Archer Ave. In a videotaped television newscast, it appeared that Daley said, [...] "You want a white mayor {{to sit down with}} everybody." [...] Sawyer said he was [...] "shocked." [...] Daley explained, [...] "It was my standard stump speech.

500|$|In 1952, King George VI died, {{the third}} of Queen Mary's {{children}} to predecease her; her eldest granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth, ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. The death of a third child profoundly affected her. Mary remarked to Princess Marie Louise: [...] "I have lost three sons through death, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been privileged {{to be there to}} say a last farewell to them." [...] Mary died the next year on 24 March 1953 at the age of 85, only ten weeks before her granddaughter's coronation. Mary let it be known that, in the event of her death, the coronation was not to be postponed. Her remains lay in state at Westminster Hall, where large numbers of mourners filed past her coffin. She is buried beside her husband in the nave of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E
500|$|Wanderone enjoyed {{promoting}} a feud with world champion Mosconi {{over how to}} present pool— either as a rough-and-tumble gambling game (Wanderone) or as a genteel pastime and art form (Mosconi). Mosconi's widow, Flora, said of the rivalry, [...] "My husband hated Minnesota Fats because he felt that [...] was always hurting {{the image of the}} game instead of helping it." [...] Wanderone would state smugly, [...] "I may have 'given away' a few games to deserving competitors, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> lost a real money game since I was old enough to spell 'Weeli Mesconi'." [...] The two competed on Valentine's Day (February 14), 1978 in a televised match on ABC's Wide World of Sports. With almost 11 million viewers, the game was the second-highest rated episode of the show for that year, behind only the Muhammad Ali vs. Leon Spinks rematch. The game was held at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, and was announced by Howard Cosell. Although Wanderone lost the game, he won the audience with his banter, and with his joking manner. Mosconi on the other hand was reportedly perceived as cold.|$|E
500|$|By the {{standards}} of the Western front, the gains of the first two days were nothing short of spectacular. A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties and a number of strategically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge. Additionally, the offensive succeeded in drawing German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector. In many respects, the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies but these gains were offset by high casualties and the ultimate failure of the French offensive at the Aisne. By the end of the offensive, the British had suffered more than 150,000 casualties and gained little ground since the first day. Despite significant early gains, they were unable to effect a breakthrough and the situation reverted to stalemate. Although historians generally consider the battle a British victory, in the wider context of the front, it had very little impact on the strategic or tactical situation. Ludendorff later commented [...] "no doubt exceedingly important strategic objects lay behind the British attack <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been able to discover what they were". Ludendorff was also [...] "very depressed; had our principles of defensive tactics proved false and if so, what was to be done?" ...|$|E

500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis. After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, fellow {{state senator}} Don Benton filed a {{complaint}} against Rivers, claiming she had broken a senate floor rule by swearing at him during a floor discussion. Benton also claimed that Rivers had screamed at him on one other occasion, during a Republican caucus. He claimed that he had felt physically threatened, saying, [...] "It was a very uncomfortable feeling. I {{have been on the}} receiving end of many heated comments over the years, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> before felt the threat of physical violence." [...] Rivers responded with an apology; he took issue with some of the wording in the apology and he filed the complaint. Many have come out in support of Rivers, who claims that Benton was harassing her, adding she will, [...] "stand my ground against anyone who attempts to bully, intimidate or threaten me." [...] Some have labeled Benton a hypocrite, as he recently lifted sanctions against Pam Roach, who had been seen screaming on the floor and had mistreated staff. In a January 2014 decision, officials in the Washington State Legislature have decided both Senators were at fault for the spat. They determined that Benton had harassed Rivers, which provoked her. On the decision, Rivers stated, [...] "I have to conclude that he was trying to bait me into this reaction, which unfortunately he did.” ...|$|E
500|$|In 1871, {{at the age}} of eight, Narendranath {{enrolled}} at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877. In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination. [...] He was an avid reader {{in a wide range of}} subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature. He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. Narendra was trained in Indian classical music, and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College). In 1881 he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884. Narendra studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin. He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him, translating Spencer's book Education (1861) into Bengali. While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature. William Hastie (principal of General Assembly's Institution) wrote, [...] "Narendra is really a genius. I have travelled far and wide <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> come across a lad of his talents and possibilities, even in German universities, among philosophical students' Some accounts have called Narendra a shrutidhara (a person with a prodigious memory).|$|E

500|$|The Workmans' trip to India, Burma, Ceylon, and Java lasted {{two and a}} half years, {{beginning}} in November 1897, and covered [...] At the time, Fanny was 38 and William 50. They bicycled about [...] from the southernmost tip of India to the Himalaya in the north. To ensure they had access to supplies, they rode along major thoroughfares near railways, and were sometimes forced to sleep in railway waiting rooms if no other accommodation was available. They carried minimal supplies, including tea, sugar, biscuits, cheese, tinned meats, water, pillows, a blanket for each of them, writing materials, and medical and repair kits. They dispensed with their bicycles at the northern end of their trip and hiked over passes between [...] and [...] The trip was grueling. They often had little food or water, dealt with swarms of mosquitoes, fixed as many as 40 bicycle tire punctures per day, and slept in rat-infested quarters. Fanny Workman's book, written after the trip, highlighted the ancient architecture that they had seen rather than the contemporary local cultures. Mrs Workman mentions in [...] "My Asiatic Wanderings" [...] about India [...] "I have wheeled through much enchanting scenery, in the palm and banyan grooves of Orissa, Over the green and scarlet slopes of the Terai... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> cycled 1200 miles in a country so continuously beautiful." [...] The Workmans possessed an unusual amount of historical knowledge about India for Westerners of the time and had read the Jakata, Mahabharata, and Ramayana before their trip. They were eager to learn about the culture that had produced these epics and spent more time learning about ancient history than interacting with living people.|$|E
500|$|In 1545, Charles Estienne was {{the first}} writer to {{identify}} the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded {{that it had a}} urinary function. Following this study, Realdo Colombo (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua, Italy, published a book called De re anatomica in 1559, in which he describes the [...] "seat of woman's delight". In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not say a word about it... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have well formed genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E
