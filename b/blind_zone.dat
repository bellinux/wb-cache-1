5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side <b>Blind</b> <b>Zone</b> Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E

The study is carried out using snapshot simulations of an actual city (Barcelona, Spain) with specific traffic and propagation profiles. A first layout is proposed in order to guarantee good coverage with a minimum number of base stations. This layout is approached taking into account the link budget analytical calculations and the first simulation results for a single-cell environment. A second layout is then presented in an attempt to solve the problems that arise in the first (e. g. shadows, <b>blind</b> <b>zones,</b> etc.). This is carried out by finely tuning parameters from the first layout, adding new base stations and changing the locations of the existing ones. ...|$|R

40|$|The general {{focus of}} this paper is the {{improvement}} of state-of-the-art Bayesian tracking filters specialized to the domain of ground moving objects to obtain high-quality track information, based on airborne ground moving target indication (GMTI) radar measurements. To counteract the numerous challenges, in particular, imprecise measurements and missed detections, a strong false alarm background, closely-spaced targets, technical and terrain obscuration as well as complex target motion, it is highly advisable to exploit additional context information in a tracking system. Three different classes of information are considered and used as extensions of standard tracking algorithms. These are the knowledge on range and Doppler <b>blind</b> <b>zones</b> of the GMTI sensor, road network information and signal strength measurements, where the latter is used to obtain estimates of a target's mean radar cross section (RCS).

For this geometry, Bayesian {{as well as the}} classical Cramér-Rao lower bounds on the target localization error variance were obtained. It was shown that each contributing multipath source, namely the walls, increases the FIM therefore improving the CRBs. Geometrical constraints, termed “multipath preservers” were derived to ensure that multipath was physically observable in the radar returns. Incorporating these into the D-optimal experimental design criteria, we demonstrated that FIMs and the BIMs aid in anticipating multipath <b>blind</b> <b>zones,</b> permitting optimal sensor or target positioning, and placing confidence levels on the multipath exploitation procedures. It was seen via simulations that the experimental design procedures discounted target or sensor positions in the shadow regions.|$|R
