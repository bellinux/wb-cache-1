5|$|Diaminocarbenes do {{not truly}} dimerise, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> form the dimer by {{reaction}} via formamidinium salts, a protonated precursor species. Accordingly, this reaction can be acid catalysed. This reaction occurs because unlike imidazolium based carbenes, {{there is no}} loss of aromaticity in protonation of the carbene.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, {{with the office of}} {{dictator}} falling out of fashion, the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, <b>but</b> <b>rather,</b> to the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final decree. This decree took the form of a recommendation from the Senate to the consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was hotly contested in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final decree did not grant legal authority to the consuls, <b>but</b> <b>rather,</b> served as an urging from the Senate to ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E
