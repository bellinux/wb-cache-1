Futility does not consider the harms of resuscitation and we should consider the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> and harm that results from our resuscitation endeavours. If a resuscitation is futile then any harm that ensues will bring about an unfavourable benefit/harm balance. However, even if the endeavour is not futile, by any definition, the benefit/harm balance may still be unfavourable if the harms that ensue are great. It is unlikely that we will ever achieve a consensus definition of futility and certainly not one that is applicable to every patient undergoing resuscitation. In the meantime our use of the term “futile”, in the mistaken belief that it tells us whether it is worth resuscitating or not, has no utility as it will never succeed in telling us this. Furthermore we risk causing oVence by use of the term and we risk harming the patient’s autonomy by using futility as an overriding force. Instead we should consider the utility of our endeavours, for which an assessment of the harms of resuscitation should be added to our considerations of its benefit. This <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> and harm should then be evaluated as best it can be from the patient’s perspective. The words futile and futility should be abandoned by resuscitationists...|$|E

40|$|Although {{growth hormone}} (GH) is {{primarily}} associated with linear growth in childhood, {{it continues to}} have important metabolic functions in adult life. Adult GH deficiency (AGHD) is a distinct clinical entity, and GH replacement in AGHD can improve body composition, strength, aerobic capacity, and mood, and may reduce vascular disease risk. While there are some hormone-related side effects, the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and risks is generally favorable, and several countries have approved GH for clinical use in AGHD. GH secretion declines progressively and markedly with aging, and many age-related changes resemble those of partial AGHD. This suggests that replacing GH, or stimulating GH with GH-releasing hormone or a GH secretagogue could confer benefits in normal aging similar to those observed in AGHD – in particular, could reduce the loss of muscle mass, strength, and exercise capacity leading to frailty, thereby prolonging the ability to live independently. However, while most GH studies have shown body composition effects {{similar to those in}} AGHD, functional changes have been much less inconsistent, and older adults are more sensitive to GH side effects.

This work {{examines}} the evidence on new mechanical percutaneous (catheter-based) methods for thrombus elimination compared with systemic and intra-arterial thrombolysis. Mechanical thrombolysis removes, the clot by suction, capture or stent based tools. The aim of this assessment is to present the evidence on benefit and harm for affected patients. Method: A systematic literature search identified 1270 bibliographic citations, 1018 abstracts were screened based on predefined inclusion criteria and the full text for 128 quotes was requested. The quality of the available evidence on assessing the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> and harm was evaluated using GRADE methodology. From the evidence, a recommendation was derived. Results: None of the identified studies met the methodological criteria for proof of efficacy and safety. To summarize the best available evidence and to make trend statements, three single-arm prospective studies with larger numbers (over 100) and 5 smaller case series in the pre-post-design were included. These studies with no direct comparison groups are limited in their validity because they differ in their basic characteristic when compared indirectly with other studies. Second, the investigated mechanical interventions were often mixed with other treatments. Third, their primary endpoints were often not those with the greatest patient-relevance. Finally, the numbers of cases are often very small. Two studies (with study limitations and a low number of cases) on stent-based systems show an indication of a good <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> and harm. The three studies with larger sample sizes with a (for the reasons stated above) problematic indirect comparison to intra-arterial lysis indicate no better benefit-harm balance.

Extracranial haemorrhage and orolingual angioedema are less common complications. Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy can be used in selected patients with imaging-proven large artery occlusion.

No hypnotic manufacturer has yet tried to refute the epidemiology data that shows that use of their product is correlated with excess mortality. The author stated that [...] "major hypnotic trials is needed to more carefully study potential adverse effects of hypnotics such as daytime impairment, infection, cancer, and death and the resultant <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and risks." [...] The author concluded that more independent research into daytime impairment, infection, cancer, and shortening of lives of sedative hypnotic users is needed to find the true <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and risks <b>of</b> benzodiazepine agonist hypnotic drugs in the treatment of insomnia. Significant increases in skin cancers and tumors are found in clinical trial data of the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics compared to trial subjects having taken placebo tablets. Other cancers of the brain, lung, bowel, breast, and bladder also occurred. An increase of infections, possibly due to decreased immune function, also occurred in the nonbenzodiazepine users. It has been hypothesised that either depressed immune function or the viral infections themselves were the cause of the increased rates of cancer.|$|R
