5000|$|The <b>Best</b> <b>Oil</b> and Refining Company Service Station is a {{historic}} building located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States. This was the third service station built by business partners George D. Shaler and George J. Albright. Albright had previously been a building contractor and had owned a lumberyard, while Shaler {{was one of the}} founders of the <b>Best</b> <b>Oil</b> Company. The two were also in a partnership that acquired a limestone quarry in Stone City, Iowa, and that stone may have been used for the exterior of this building. [...] This service station was located near a southeast side residential neighborhood, commercial and industrial areas from which it could attract customers. Built in 1930, the station sold gasoline and provided a wide-range of automobile related maintenance needs until 1960 when it and other local service station operators gave way to the larger chain stores. While the station originally sold its own <b>Best</b> <b>Oil</b> brand gasoline, it eventually sold national brands such as Conoco. The building features a large canopy where the pumps were located, a metal cornice, and a service bay. After its use as a service station came to an end, the building has housed several non-automobile related businesses. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} research, oil derived from several Brassica species, and related oilseeds, was {{investigated}} {{for use as}} a lubricant base-oil. <b>Oils</b> obtained from <b>B.</b> rapa L. were selected because of their superior cold temperature performance over Sinapis alba L., B. carinata A., B. napus, and B. juncea L. The commercial antiwear additive zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZDDP) was added (800 ppm) to <b>B.</b> rapa <b>oils</b> to determine the impact on oxidative stability and lubricity. It was found that the <b>B.</b> rapa <b>oil</b> ACS-C 7 had a low cloud and pour point. <b>B.</b> rapa <b>oils</b> had poor oxidative stability at 97. 8 °C when compared to a mineral oil (petroleum-based) standard. ZDDP had little effect on oxidative stability and cloud point. It was concluded that <b>B.</b> rapa <b>oils</b> have sufficient low temperature performance {{for use as a}} lubricant base oil. However, for continued use in a motor oil formulation, further modification of the oxidative stability will be necessary. All <b>B.</b> rapa <b>oils</b> with and without ZDDP were subjected to lubricity testing in a Plint High Frequency Wear Tester (TE- 77). Lubricity testing simulates the high temperature and pressure in a motor system. The coefficient of friction and resultant wear scar width were measured. <b>B.</b> rapa <b>oils</b> lower coefficients of friction and decrease wear scar widths when compared with a mineral oil standard. Addition of ZDDP to <b>B.</b> rapa <b>oils</b> slightly increased lubricity performance of the oils. The wear scars produced on the polished stainless steel disk were subjected to X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) analysis using two synchrotron beamlines at the Canadian Light Source. XANES analysis confirmed the presence of a lubricating tribofilm {{on the surface of the}} stainless steel disks following B. rapa lubricity testing. These results indicate that <b>B.</b> rapa <b>oils</b> are suitable candidates as lubricant base oils for motor oil formulation...|$|R

Essential oil A was extracted by microwave additional extraction method, and <b>oil</b> <b>B</b> {{was provided by}} a flavors company. SPME-GC-MS analyses revealed that two oils possessed 29 same compounds, and their main fragrance compositions were sesquiterpene accounting for 94. 99 % and 94. 19 % of total essential oils, respectively. However, oil A exhibited 61 volatile compounds with agarospiro (17. 32 %), guaiac acetate (15. 99 %), guaiol (15. 53 %) and beta-Ionon (13. 61 %) being the major constituents. <b>Oil</b> <b>B</b> had 59 ones, and the major constituent was spathulenol (56. 45 %). In the first 60 min, <b>oil</b> <b>B</b> showed 28 distinctive compounds. And in 78 ~ 91 min, oil A displayed 14 fragrance compositions, while, <b>oil</b> <b>B</b> showed 1. The results explained that two essential oils possessed similar scent. However, their aroma quality was very different. Oil A showed longer holding fragrance.

40|$|Whether {{there is}} an {{effective}} deep-buried lacustrine Triassic petroleum system in the Junggar Basin, NW China, has been enigmatic and debated for a long time. Here we conduct an oil-source correlation to address this issue. Results show that the extracted bitumens from the Triassic mudstones in the central basin have distinctive stable carbon isotope and biomarker compositions compared to the Permian-sourced and Jurassic-sourced hydrocarbons, the other two recognized sources {{in the study area}}. These characteristics include δ 13 C value of - 30. 46 ~- 26. 30 ‰, β-carotane/maximum n-alkane of 0. 22 – 0. 41, Pr/Ph of 1. 00 – 1. 51, C 24 tetracyclic terpane/C 26 tricyclic terpane of 0. 43 – 0. 96, Ts/Tm of 0. 34 – 0. 64, gammacerane/C 30 hopane of 0. 10 – 0. 14, and regular steranes C 27 > C 28 < C 29 with C 29 sterane in dominance (40 – 50 %). These suggest that the Triassic mudstones in the study area host fresh lacustrine organic matters with high input of higher plants. The Triassic-reservoired crude oils and extracts can be divided into two types. Through oil-source correlation, we infer that both type A and type <b>B</b> <b>oils</b> are derived from mixed Permian and Triassic source rocks. Linear regression analysis shows that the contribution from Triassic mudstones to type A and <b>B</b> <b>oils</b> is 67 % and 31 %, respectively. This implies that the deep-buried Triassic lacustrine mudstones in the Junggar Basin may have some oil-generation potential and thus might represent a new case of Triassic petroleum systems in China and deserves a more detailed and thorough study in future exploration and exploitation...|$|R
40|$|Air {{injection}} is {{an enhanced}} oil recovery (EOR) {{process in which}} compressed air is injected into a high temperature, light-oil reservoir. The oxygen in injected air is intended to react with a fraction of reservoir oil at elevated temperature resulting in in-situ generation of flue gases and steam, which, in turn, mobilize and drive the oil ahead towards the producing wells. To understand and determine the feasibility of the air injection process application to a given reservoir, {{it is necessary to}} understand the oxidation behaviour of the crude oil. The aim {{of this study is to}} screen two Australian light-oil reservoirs; Kenmore Oilfield, Eromanga Basin, and another Australian onshore oil and gas field “B”* for air injection EOR process, and to understand the oxidation reaction kinetics during air injection. It is carried out by the thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric (TGA/DSC) studies to investigate the oxidation mechanism during an air injection process. There has not been any TGA/DSC evaluation conducted to date with regard to air injection for Australian light-oil reservoirs. A series of thermal tests was performed to investigate the oxidation behaviour of two selected reservoirs in both air and oxygen environments. The first step undertaken in this study is thermogravimetric and calorimetric characterization of crude oils to (i) identify the temperature range over which the oil reacts with oxygen, (ii) examine the oxidation behaviour within the temperature identified, and (iii) evaluate the mass loss characteristics during the oxidation. This study also examines the effect of pressure on oxidation at different temperature ranges and the effect of core material (rock cutting) on oxidation reactions. Finally, kinetic data are calculated from thermal tests results by literature described method. Kenmore and Field B both are high temperature and light-oil reservoirs. Hydrocarbon distribution indicates that Kenmore oil contains 84 mole% of lower carbon number n-C₅ - n-C₁ ₃ compounds. Reservoir <b>B</b> <b>oil</b> also contains a substantial amount (i. e., 95 mole %) of lower carbon number n-C₄ - C₁ ₉ compounds. These lighter components may contribute favourably towards efficient oxidation. However, a high content of lighter ends in the oil may also result in a lower fuel load. Generally, low molecular weight oil gives fastest mass loss from heavy crude oil. Thermal tests on Kenmore oil showed two distinct exothermic reactivity regions in temperatures of 200 - 340 °C and 360 - 450 °C, with a 85 - 95 % mass loss when the temperature reached 450 °C. Reservoir <b>B</b> <b>oil</b> showed a wider exotherm range between approximately 180 °C- 260 °C with 90 - 95 % mass loss by temperature 350 °C. In the high temperature range, the combustion reactions of Reservoir <b>B</b> <b>oil</b> are weaker than Kenmore oil. This is due to insufficient fuel available for oxidations in high temperature region. Reservoir <b>B</b> <b>oil</b> has more chance to auto ignite; but it has less sustainability to the ignition process. Based on the sustainability study of the ignition process, between the two reservoirs, Kenmore is the better candidate for air injection. Based on the thermal tests, it is concluded that for light-oil oxidation, vaporization is the dominant physical phenomenon. At low temperature range, the addition of the core material enhanced the exothermic reactions of the oil. The elevated pressure accelerated the bond scission reactions. The largest amount and highest rate of energy generation occurred at the low temperature range. Activation energies (E) are calculated from thermal test results and the value of ‘E’ in oil-with-core combined tests is smaller than the oil-only test. This indicates that the rock material has a positive impact on the combustion process. Moreover, the compositional analysis result addresses the composition of oils, which can help understand the oxidation behaviour of light-oils. * For confidentiality reasons, the field name is coded as Field B at the request of the operating company.
