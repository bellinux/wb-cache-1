5000|$|After {{returning}} from the Soviet Union, Lee Harvey Oswald became close friends with Dallas resident and petroleum geologist George de Mohrenschildt. De Mohrenschildt would later write an extensive memoir in which he discussed his friendship with Oswald. [...] De Mohrenschildt's wife would later give the House Select Committee on Assassinations a photograph that showed Lee Harvey Oswald, standing in his Dallas <b>backyard,</b> <b>holding</b> two Marxist newspapers and a Carcano rifle, with a pistol on his hip. Thirteen years after the assassination, in September 1976, the CIA requested that the FBI locate De Mohrenschildt, {{in response to a}} letter De Mohrenschildt had written directly to his friend, CIA Director George H.W.

While similar to other prints which had been found among Oswald's effects on November 23, 1963, {{the existence of this}} particular print was previously unknown. On the back was written To my friend George from Lee Oswald, and the date “5/IV/63” (5 April 1963). along with the words “Copyright Geo de M”' and a Russian phrase translated as “'Hunter of fascists, ha-ha-ha!” Handwriting specialists later concluded that the words “To my friend George…” and Oswald's signature were written by Lee Harvey Oswald, but could not determine whether the rest was the writing of Lee Oswald, Mohrenschildt, or Marina Oswald. Mohrenschildt assumed that Marina had written it sarcastically.|$|E

5000|$|Following Will's eviction, the HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Mount HoH" [...] {{endurance}} portion of the final Head of Household competition.

50|$|Most {{homes in}} the {{district}} are set back between one and 15 ft from the sidewalks. The lots are relatively narrow (50-60 ft.) but deep (120-150 ft.) with ample <b>backyards</b> that often <b>hold</b> one-story frame or brick garages on an alley serving an entire block. Average density is five to seven houses per acre. This configuration — a single-family house sited close to the front lot line with a detached service building {{at the rear of}} a long backyard — is the basic lot layout of towns in central Pennsylvania. Most of the rear-lot service buildings are either small 19th century carriage barns converted to garages or 20th century auto garages, depending upon the age of the house. The carriage barns are generally wood frame while the garages tend to be brick, depending upon the building material of the house. The moderately sloping topography did little to impede local builders, who merely terraced the sites and erected stone retaining walls to hold the yards.|$|R
5000|$|Following Bunky's eviction, the HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Strange Bedfellows" [...] {{endurance}} Head of Household competition. The HouseGuests found {{a replica of the}} Head of Household room in the backyard, and had to sit on the water bed in the <b>backyard</b> while <b>holding</b> onto their key that was placed in the nomination box. The last HouseGuests remaining on the bed, without letting go of their key, would be the winner. The competition quickly proved to be dramatic when a banner overhead sent by Nicole's husband accused her of betraying him; this was a result of a rumor spread online that something had happened between Nicole and Will in the hot tub. The competition came down to Monica and Will, with Will dropping out of the competition in exchange for a prize; this made Monica the new Head of Household. Will's prize was revealed to be a large peanut butter jar used in an earlier competition. Hardy and Nicole were both upset with Will for throwing the competition, as Will and Monica had made a deal that Will would not be nominated. On Day 62, the group played in the [...] "Shop 'til You Drop" [...] food competition, which required the HouseGuests to grab food items and carry them through an obstacle course; the group kept whatever food they got across. On Day 63, Monica chose to nominate Hardy and Nicole for eviction. On Day 64, the backyard was transformed into a [...] "winter wonderland" [...] as part of the America's Choice poll. [...] On Day 65, Gervase Peterson and Susan Hawk, of Survivor: Borneo (2000), and Alicia Calaway and Jeff Varner of, Survivor: The Australian Outback (2001), entered the house to spend the night. The group played in the [...] "Fire and Ice" [...] luxury competition, which saw the Survivor cast compete against the HouseGuests. The groups were bound together at the wrists and had to find the letters to spell out the name of their respective show; they would build the letters into a tower, untie themselves, jump one at a time into the pool to retrieve their keys, and hang their keys on torches {{at the end of the}} pool. The first team to complete the challenge would win a $15,000 prize; the Survivor group won the competition. That same night, the HouseGuests paired up with a Survivor member to compete in the [...] "Crack the Code" [...] luxury competition. The competition saw the pairs receiving a coded message, describing a location in the house, and the first pair to decode the location and find a computer mouse would win the right to view a fan-site made in their honor. On Day 68, Will chose to evict Hardy from the house.|$|R
