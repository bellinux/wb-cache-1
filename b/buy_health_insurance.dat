5|$|Swiss {{citizens}} are universally required to <b>buy</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> from private insurance companies, {{which in turn}} are required to accept every applicant. While {{the cost of the}} system is among the highest, it compares well with other European countries in terms of health outcomes; patients who are citizens have been reported as being, in general, highly satisfied with it. In 2012, life expectancy at birth was 80.4 years for men and 84.7 years for women — the highest in the world. However, spending on health is particularly high at 11.4% of GDP (2010), on par with Germany and France (11.6%) and other European countries, but notably less than spending in the USA (17.6%). From 1990, a steady increase can be observed, reflecting the high costs of the services provided. With an ageing population and new healthcare technologies, health spending will likely continue to rise.|$|E

25|$|Many {{distinct}} organizations {{provide health}} care in the US. Facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses. Health insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the government. 60–65% of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Veterans Health Administration. Most of the population under 65 is insured by their or a family member's employer, some <b>buy</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> on their own, and the remainder are uninsured. On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health insurance.|$|E

25|$|During the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Hillary Clinton ran to {{the left}} of Barack Obama on {{economic}} issues. On the issue of health care, Clinton was willing to include an individual mandate to <b>buy</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> as part of a program for universal coverage. Obama was not willing to go so far, and came in for substantial criticism from liberals for it. Clinton proposed a Cabinet-level poverty czar position. Clinton secured more labor union backing than Obama, and Obama did better than Clinton at gaining primary votes from self-identified independents. However, on foreign policy issues, Hillary Clinton was more hawkish than Barack Obama. However, Hillary has opposed certain liberal aspects of Obamacare such as the cadillac tax.|$|E
500|$|However, {{following}} {{the adoption of}} an individual mandate, Republicans came to oppose the mandate and threatened to filibuster any bills that contained it. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, who led the Republican congressional strategy {{in responding to the}} bill, calculated that Republicans should not support the bill, and worked to prevent defections:Republican Senators, including those who had supported previous bills with a similar mandate, began to describe the mandate as [...] "unconstitutional". Journalist Ezra Klein wrote in The New Yorker that [...] "a policy that once enjoyed broad support within the Republican Party suddenly faced unified opposition." [...] Reporter Michael Cooper of The New York Times wrote that: [...] "the provision ... requiring all Americans to <b>buy</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> has its roots in conservative thinking." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 12, 2006, the {{governor}} signed the resulting Massachusetts health reform law, commonly called [...] "Romneycare", which requires nearly all Massachusetts residents to <b>buy</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage or face escalating tax penalties, {{such as the}} loss of their personal income tax exemption. The bill also established means-tested state subsidies for people who lacked adequate employer insurance and whose income was below a threshold, using funds that had covered the health costs of the uninsured. He vetoed eight sections of the health care legislation, including a controversial $295-per-employee assessment on businesses that do not offer health insurance and provisions guaranteeing dental benefits to Medicaid recipients. The legislature overrode all eight vetoes, but {{the governor}}'s office said the differences were not essential. The law was {{the first of its kind}} in the nation and became the signature achievement of Romney's term in office.|$|E
50|$|Launched in 1986, the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> {{industry}} has grown significantly mainly due to liberalization of economy and general awareness. According to the World Bank, by 2010, more than 25% of India’s population {{had access to}} some form of <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> There are standalone health insurers along with government sponsored <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> providers. Until recently, to improve the awareness and reduce the procrastination for <b>buying</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> the General Insurance Corporation of India and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority had launched an awareness campaign for all segments of the population.|$|R
50|$|The {{premise is}} simple. Insurance broker fees are already {{built into the}} premium that most people (living in Washington state) pay for their <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> whether they know it or not. These broker fees, {{included}} in Community Rated Insurance Plans, are approved by the state.

40|$|Abstract Consumers, when <b>buying</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> do {{not know}} the exact value of each {{treatment}} that they buy coverage for. This leads them to overvalue some treatments and undervalue others. We show that the insurance market cannot correct these mistakes. This causes research labs to overinvest in treatments that hardly add value compared to current best practice. The government can stimulate R&D in breakthrough treatments by excluding treatments with low value added from <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage. If the country is rich enough such a government intervention in a private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> market raises welfare. ...|$|R
500|$|The law faced several legal challenges, {{primarily}} {{based on}} the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to <b>buy</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that [...] "closely-held" [...] for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans [...] "established by the State", as the statute reads.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{legislative}} proposals under {{serious consideration}} propose fining larger employers {{who do not}} provide a minimum standard of healthcare insurance and mandating that people purchase private healthcare insurance. This {{is the first time}} that the Federal government has mandated people to buy insurance, although nearly all states in the union currently mandate the purchase of auto insurance. The legislation also taxes certain very high payout insurance policies (so-called [...] "Cadillac policies") to help finance subsidies for poorer citizens. These will be offered on a sliding scale to people earning less than four times the federal poverty level to enable them to <b>buy</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> if they are not otherwise covered by their employer.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, 47.6% {{of people}} were covered by private <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> The {{regulatory}} body for private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> is the <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Authority.

2500|$|In Massachusetts, {{a roughly}} $800million fund {{known as the}} [...] "uncompensated care pool" [...] was used to {{partially}} reimburse hospitals for expenses related to treating uninsured patients. The fund's revenue comes from an annual assessment on employers, insurance providers and hospitals, plus contributions {{of state and federal}} tax dollars. Governor Romney's plan redirects money from this fund to subsidize health insurance costs for low-income residents of Massachusetts. The Romney Administration consulted with Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Jonathan Gruber to study the state's population and health care needs. They determined that there was enough money in the [...] "free care pool" [...] to implement the Governor's plans, but that it would require more people to <b>buy</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> at full price in order to pay into the subsidized fund.|$|E
2500|$|One of Butler's {{reasons for}} his hunger strike was [...] "graduate {{students}} being robbed of their health insurance". In August 2015, the university had issued a statement to graduate students that said, [...] "The Affordable Care Act prevents employers from giving employees money specifically so they can <b>buy</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> on the individual market. Graduate teaching and research assistants are classified as employees by the IRS, so they fall under this ruling." [...] The university had known about the Affordable Care Act concerns since July 21, but put off communicating with graduate students until announcing on August 14 that subsidies would be cut, the day before graduate health insurance plans were set to expire. Conservatives criticized the protesters for blaming the loss of insurance on the university instead of on Obamacare.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the {{coverage}} of the debate has involved how the different sides are competing to express their views, rather than the specific reform proposals. The health care reform debate in the United States has been influenced by the Tea Party protest phenomenon, with reporters and politicians spending time reacting to it. Supporters of a greater government role in healthcare, such as former insurance PR executive Wendell Potter of the Center for Media and Democracy- whose funding comes from groups such as the Tides Foundation- argue that the hyperbole generated by this phenomenon is a form of corporate astroturfing, which he says that he used to write for CIGNA. Opponents of more government involvement, such as Phil Kerpen of Americans for Prosperity- whose funding comes mainly from the Koch Industries corporation- counter-argue that those corporations oppose a public-plan, but some try to push for government actions that will unfairly benefit them, such as forcing private companies to <b>buy</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> for their employees. Journalist Ben Smith has referred to mid-2009 as [...] "The Summer of Astroturf" [...] given the organizing and co-ordinating efforts made by various groups on both pro- and anti-reform sides.|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{modeling}} framework {{to think about}} selective contracting {{in the health care}} sector. Two health care providers differ in quality and costs. When <b>buying</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> consumers observe neither provider quality nor costs. We derive an equilibrium where health insurers signal provider quality through their choice of provider network. Selective contracting focuses on low cost providers. Contracting both providers signals high quality. Market power tends to lower quality and lead to inefficiency. In a dynamic extension of the model, providers under-invest in quality while there can be both over and under-investment in cost reductions if there is a monopoly insurer while an efficient investment equilibrium exists with insurer competition...|$|R

40|$|The Affordable Care Act is {{bringing}} dramatic {{changes to the}} health care industry. Previously uninsured individuals are <b>buying</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> and consuming <b>health</b> care services differently.

The first step in addressing these challenges is understanding the financial risk of new entrants into the marketplace. How do you predict the risk of a person without any historical cost information? What if all you know is the name and address?

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the mechanism described in this paper, markets may fail to exist altogether in certain situations involving quality uncertainty. Examples given in Akerlof's paper include the market for used cars, the dearth of formal credit markets in developing countries, and the difficulties that the elderly encounter in <b>buying</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> However, not all players in a given market will follow the same rules or have the same aptitude of assessing quality.

5000|$|In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act {{signed in}} 2010 imposed a <b>health</b> <b>{{insurance}}</b> mandate which took effect in 2014. Under this law {{insurance companies are}} restricted {{in their ability to}} alter insurance rates based on the [...] current health of the individual buying the insurance. In effect this means healthier individuals will pay a higher rate and less-healthy individuals will pay a lower rate than they would if rates were based on how healthy they are. Healthier individuals will tend to opt out of the system. They tend to make fewer claims and their premiums are used to pay the claims of the less-healthy. The insurance companies will have to raise rates on those remaining insured in order to make up the lost revenue. That will further increase the pressure on healthier individuals to opt out of <b>buying</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> which will further increase rates, until the market collapses. Mandated insurance is intended to prevent the downward spiral.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} waiting times in the Spanish public health system on the demand for private <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Expected utility maximization determines whether or not individuals <b>buy</b> a private <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> The decision depends not only on consumer's covariates such as income, socio-demographic characteristics and health status, {{but also on the}} quality of the treatment by the public provider. We interpret waiting time as a qualitative attribute of the health care provision. The empirical analysis uses the Spanish Health Survey of 1993. We cope with the absence of income data by using the Spanish Family Budget Survey of 1990 – 91 as a complementary data set, following the Arellano–Meghir method [4]. Results indicate that a reduction in the waiting time lowers the probability of <b>buying</b> private <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> This suggests the existence of a crowd-out in the health care provision market.

40|$|The {{increasing}} political {{significance of}} private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> can {{be located in}} an altered {{understanding of the role}} of individuals and the State in protecting citizens' welfare. In common with other Western societies, contemporary australia is marked by an expectation that people will fund their own needs and identify and manage their own risks throughout their life course. However, we lack information on how people come to make their decisions. In particular, there is no analysis of why people choose to invest in private <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> this paper reports on an exploratory study investigating the motivations for the uptake of private <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Taking a socio-cultural approach, the study indicates that while people's stated reasons for <b>buying</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> show some surface similarities with the reasoning expected of neo-liberal citizens, a closer reading of the data indicates they do not approach their decisions in a rational or calculative way. They rely less on weighing evidence (e. g. relevant statistics, the provisions of their contract with the insurance provider and their own experiences) than they do on trust in an impersonal system, i. e., they believe people and systems will not harm them in future situations (Gilson 2003) ...|$|R
