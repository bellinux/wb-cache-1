A plugged or malfunctioning PCV valve by itself cannot damage an engine; however the <b>blowby</b> will flow up in a reverse fashion up through the crankcase air inlet and if there isn't a separate catch can or oil separator at that inlet, then the <b>blowby</b> will contaminate the air intake manifold. On boosted engines this can be a real problem. A poorly maintained engine's PCV system will eventually contaminate the air intake manifold with oil sludge and if both the pcv valve and the crankcase air inlet are blocked then the crankcase pressure will build to a level that will damage seals and eventually the motor.|$|E

The diesel engineers have, so far, neglected investigations in this held and the literature available on <b>blowby</b> emissions investigation is very scarce. This paper deals with investigations on the control of <b>blowby</b> emissions in high power turbocharged diesel engine by installing positive crank case ventilation (PCV) system. The lubricating oil mist escaping with <b>blowby</b> gases is also quite significant. Feasibility of recovering this mist by installing in the PCV system a lubricating oil mist separator, designed and fabricated for the purpose has been established. The results obtained clearly show that the <b>blowby</b> emissions can be effectively controlled with the help of PCV system. However, the cross-section area of the PCV pipe has to be adjusted according to the amount of <b>blowby</b> gases and the inflow of ventilating air through the breather. It was possible to separate the lubricating oil mist in the <b>blowby</b> gases and return the lubricating oil back to sump {{with the use of a}} mist separator installed in the PCV system.

40|$|Engine oil {{consumption}} {{is an important}} source of hydrocarbon and particulate emissions in modem automobile engines. Great efforts have been made by automotive manufacturers to minimize the impact of {{oil consumption}} on engine emissions. Research engineers in the last decade have been trying to study the sources and driving mechanism of oil consumption. In contrast to oil consumption mechanisms in the piston-ring-liner system of the engine, the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) blowby-oil consumption mechanism has not yet been fully characterized. Studies have shown that the <b>blowby</b> contribution to oil consumption could be significant under certain conditions. In this study, an experimental approach was taken in order to study the sources and characteristics of oil in the PCV <b>blowby</b> gases at different speeds and loads. An extensive diagnostic system was successfully integrated in a production spark ignition engine, to measure total oil consumption, <b>blowby</b> oil consumption and flow and in-cylinder variables, such as inter-ring pressures, oil film thickness and liner temperatures. Results showed an increase in <b>blowby</b> oil consumption with load and speed. <b>Blowby</b> flow was mainly dependent on the load of the engine. Oil concentration in the <b>blowby</b> varied with engine operating conditions. A strong relationship was observed between oil consumption and sump oil level, showing that the oil in the crankcase is {{an important source of}} oil in the <b>blowby.</b> Moreover, extensive experiments were conducted to determine the <b>blowby</b> flow's oil characteristics, by varying the liner temperatures and analyzing the mass distribution of different oil particle size. It was found that the average oil droplet size decreased as the load and speed were increased. (cont.)

40|$|The {{interactions}} between hydrazine and <b>blowby</b> gases from pyrovalves was explored {{in this research}} project. Investigating the decomposition chemistry of hydrazine through detailed chemical kinetic modeling is a project started last summer while participating in the Summer Faculty Fellowship program. During the 1999 - 2000 academic year, the chemical kinetic mechanism for hydrazine decomposition developed while a SFF at NASA's White Sands Test Facility was further revised and validated against the limited experimental data in the literature. This mechanism was then used in assessing the effects of <b>blowby</b> gas species on hydrazine decomposition. The combustion products introduced into the fuel line by pyrovalve actuation consist primarily of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen is also {{a product of the}} decomposition of hydrazine. Additional gaseous chemical species are introduced into the fuel, as well as metals and metal salts that deposit onto the walls of the fuel line. The deposition process is undoubtedly very rapid, and exothermic. Therefore, the major focus of this summer's work was examining the effects of hydrogen presence on hydrazine decomposition, with some representative calculations including the remaining gaseous species found to exist in <b>blowby</b> gases. Since hydrogen is a product of hydrazine decomposition, all reactions necessary to evaluate its effect on hydrazine decomposition chemistry were in the original mechanism developed. However, the mechanism needed to be considerably expanded to include the reactions of the other gaseous <b>blowby</b> species with hydrazine, all the intermediate species formed in its decomposition, and each other. The expanded mechanism consists of 70 species interacting via a network of 452 reactions. Calculations with molecular hydrogen introduced into hydrazine gas in an inert bath gas indicate that H 2 presence as an initial reactant in substantial amounts can dramatically impact the decomposition process for hydrazine. The other gaseous <b>blowby</b> species (CO, CO 2, H 2 O, CH 4, O 2, and N 2) were found to have little effect compared to the inclusion of hydrogen itself as an initial reagent. This result is undoubtedly due, in part, {{to the fact that the}} <b>blowby</b> gas used in these calculations consisted of 94. 6 % H 2.

40|$|The {{compression}} curve of a DI (Direct Injection) diesel engine {{is affected by}} various parameters, such as heat loss, initial temperature and pressure, speed, compression ratio and <b>blowby.</b> Usually the engineer makes use of the measured motored pressure diagram and especially of the maximum compression pressure value to determine the engine condition (wear). However, {{in order to have}} an accurate indication of the engine condition, one must consider accurately all the previous mechanisms. This poses a very difficult task since, for example, not even the compression ratio is usually accurately known for an operating engine. Thus, a low maximum compression pressure value may not be caused by increased <b>blowby</b> rate, and so this may lead to a wrong indication of cylinder condition. The present work introduces a new method for determining cylinder condition (wear) and especially the <b>blowby</b> rate. The method is based on the determination of the position of the maximum compression pressure value relative to the TDC (Top Dead Centre) position. The maximum pressure position (before TDC) varies greatly with <b>blowby</b> rate, but is practically unaffected by heat losses, initial temperature and pressure and compression ratio. Experiments have been conducted on a Ricardo E- 6, DI diesel engine for various compression ratios, engine speeds and operating temperatures (cold and warm operation) under motoring conditions. Pressure has been measured using a time step equivalent to 0. 1 -degree-CA, while the TDC position has been determined using a magnetic pickup device. A mathematical simulation accounting for heat losses and <b>blowby</b> has been used to examine the effect of various parameters on maximum compression pressure and its position relative to TDC. The results from both experiments and simulation are found to be in good agreement concerning pressure curves, maximum pressure position and their variation with the parameters examined. The results are promising, showing a high potential for determining any cylinder condition by processing the corresponding measured pressure diagram...|$|E

The automotive industry is subject to increasing pressure to reduce the CO emissions and improve fuel efficiency in internal combustion engines. Improvements may be achieved {{in a number of}} ways. The parasitic losses throughout the engine cycle emanate from friction in all engine contact conjunctions in addition to pumping losses. In particular one main contributory conjunction is the piston ring pack assembly. At low engine speeds, the contribution of friction to the total losses within the engine is increased significantly compared with the thermodynamic losses. Additionally, the sealing capability of the ring is crucial in determining the power output of the engine with any loss of sealing contributing to power loss, as well as <b>blowby.</b> Most reported studies on compression ring-cylinder conjunction do not take into account complex ring in-plane and out-of-plane elastodynamics. Hitherto, {{there has not been a}} numerical methodology which integrates tribology of an elastic compression ring, subject to modal behaviour in a coupled solution. This paper discusses the inclusion of transient ring elastodynamics of the top compression ring, interacting with <b>blowby</b> effects within the ring pack. The ring dynamics methodology is briefly highlighted for both in-plane and out-of-plane motions. In addition, a one-dimensional gas flow model that captures <b>blowby</b> behaviour is included.

The copper rail deflected to a peak value of 0. 08 mm in compression and then oscillated at an amplitude of 0. 02 mm. Simultaneously the insulating side wall of glass fabric base, epoxy resin laminate (G- 1 o) was compressed to a peak value of 0. 13 mm and rebounded {{to a steady}} state in extension. Projectile pinch or <b>blowby</b> due to the rail extension or compression, respectively, can be identified by examining the time history of the rail displacement. The effect of <b>blowby</b> was most significant at the side wall characterized by mm size displacement in compression. Dynamic stress calculations indicate that the G- 10 supporting material behind the rail is subjected to over 21 MPa at which the G- 10 could fail if the laminate was not carefully oriented. Results for a polycarbonate resin (Lexan) side wall show much larger displacements and stresses than for G- 10.

The first series of simulations was run using the gas flow and ring motion model in which the friction force was calculated from the empirical equation. The second series was run with the use of the gas flow and ring motion model fully integrated with the ring lubrication model. In that case the friction force was derived from the hydrodynamic model of ring lubrication. Comparison of the results obtained in the first and second series of simulations indicated that despite the fact that the friction forces calculated with these two methods differed considerably, the method of friction force calculation had insignificant effect. This refers to the quantities determined in the simulations which are most important from practical point of view – i. e. displacements of the rings in the grooves, pressure courses in inter-ring regions and <b>blowby</b> rate.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} {{conducted to examine}} the effect of the main parameters influencing the compression stroke of a direct injection Diesel engine. The aim is to develop a methodology that {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool to determine the compression condition of DI Diesel engines. However, conclusions derived from the present investigation can be extrapolated to other types of reciprocating internal combustion engines. The compression stroke itself is an important index concerning engine operation since engine conditions at the end of the compression stroke have a major effect on its overall performance. Such information is especially important for large scale Diesel engines used for stationary or marine applications. In these engines, it is important to develop non-catastrophic methods for estimating the cylinder compression condition without dismantling the engine cylinder. The outcome could be a serious reduction of maintenance costs, since unnecessary labour required for inspection could be avoided. When using measurement techniques, what is usually available is the cylinder pressure trace during the compression stroke. However, it is widely recognized that the compression stroke and peak compression pressure is strongly affected, beyond heat losses, by the initial pressure at the inlet valve closure, the compression ratio and the <b>blowby</b> rate. The last three parameters can vary significantly during engine operation, while the heat losses vary mainly due to engine operating conditions and their effect on the compression stroke can be considered. Thus, the knowledge of the peak compression pressure resulting from the cylinder compression pressure diagram is not adequate to define the cylinder compression condition. For this reason, an experimental investigation is conducted to {{examine the effect of}} the inital presssure at the inlet valve closure, the compression ratio and the <b>blowby</b> on the cylinder pressure trace. From analysis of the measured data, it is revealed that each parameter has a different effect on the different parts of the compression pressure trace. As revealed, it is possible to determine the compression condition of an engine cylinder based on the measured cylinder pressure trace. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Piston ring {{friction}} losses account for approximately 20 % {{of the total}} mechanical losses in modern internal combustion engines. A reduction in piston ring friction would therefore result in higher efficiency, lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop low-friction piston ring designs to improve engine efficiency, without adversely affecting oil consumption, <b>blowby,</b> wear, or cost. These are desirable objectives for today's engine manufacturers as they strive to improve engine performance while trying to meet increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Using an existing piston ring friction and lubrication model, the main contributors to friction in modern internal combustion engines were identified as the top ring around top dead center of the compression/expansion strokes and the oil control ring throughout the engine cycle. Model predictions indicated that the top ring friction could be reduced by implementing a skewed barrel profile design or an upward piston groove tilt design, and oil control ring friction could be reduced by decreasing ring tension. An increase in groove wear was predicted to occur with the upward piston groove tilt design, which could be eliminated by the introduction of a positive static twist on the top ring. An increase in oil consumption was predicted to occur with the low-tension oil control ring design, which could be mitigated either by the introduction of a negative static twist on the second ring, or by the implementation of the skewed barrel top ring design. Model predictions indicated that by combining the low-friction designs, a reduction in piston ring pack friction of 30 - 35 % could be achieved, without an increase in <b>blowby,</b> wear, or oil consumption. (cont.) Experimental results conducted on a full-scale natural gas power generation engine supported the model predictions for the low-tension oil control ring design. The predicted reduction in piston ring friction would translate to a 0. 5 - 1 % increase in brake thermal efficiency, which would result in a significant improvement in fuel economy and a substantial reduction in emissions over the life of the engine. by Grant Smedley.

40|$|In {{piston ring}} pack design, {{there is a}} {{tradeoff}} between reducing friction and increasing oil consumption. While friction reduces engine efficiency, oil consumption can poison exhaust aftertreatment systems. The primary method in studying the balance between friction and oil consumption is by understanding and modeling oil transport. This study used Two-Dimensional Laser Induced Fluorescence (2 D LIF) on a one-cylinder spark ignition research engine to view real-time oil transport in the power cylinder. The Lower Region, comprised of the 3 ' Land, skirt chamfer, the oil control ring (OCR), and the OCR groove, {{was the focus of}} this study for a number of real-world engine operating conditions. Previous studies noted that the interaction between oil and <b>blowby</b> gas flow is complex and important. What this research study attempted was a characterization and decoupling of the mechanisms governing oil transport {{into and out of the}} groove. This was accomplished by testing multiple piston ring pack configurations, thereby analyzing the effects of OCR and groove design. Namely a piston with no drain holes, a "Multi-Enlarged Hole" piston, and a baseline/production piston were used in conjunction with a U-Flex and Two-Piece OCR. In carrying out this analysis, a gross scaling relationship was created, utilizing the obtained LIF videos as a connection between the scaling model and the experiments' results. Mechanisms were classified into three types of oil transport: supply, release, and leakage. The primary mechanism of oil supply to the groove occurred during the intake stroke due to OCR downscraping. Oil's release from the groove was via the drain holes due to viscous shearing by <b>blowby</b> gases during the expansion stroke. It was found necessary that the releasing mechanism properly utilize the gas flow as well as the drainage area. Oil leakage out the groove was shown to be caused by inertia forcing oil out through the OCR gap during the intake, compression, and exhaust strokes. It was revealed that this leakage supplied oil to the Upper Region under throttled conditions. Additionally, the leakage locally affected the oil patterns of the 3 rd Land and skirt. This study is the first to document many phenomena involved in oil transport within the Lower Region. The scaling relationships that resulted from such analysis created a framework that is an initial step towards a more complete model of oil transport in the Lower Region. by Eric B. SenzerThesis (Ph.

The computations of the thermodynamic functions, especially availability, {{have been developed}} to seek better energy utilization, analyze engine performance and optimize design of spark ignition (SI) engines fueled with compressed natural gas (CNG), by using both the first and the second law analyses. A single-zone heat release model with constant thermodynamic properties is built into the air cycle simulation, while a more comprehensive two-zone combustion model with burning rate as a sinusoidal function of crank angle is built into the fuel/air thermodynamic engine cycle simulation. The computations mainly include pressure, unburned and burned zone temperature, indicated work, heat loss, mass <b>blowby,</b> availability destruction due to combustion, fuel chemical availability, availability transfer with heat, availability transfer with work and availability exhaust to the environment. The validation of the simulation results with the experimental data is performed for a DaimlerChrysler 4. 7 Liter CNG fueled V 8 engine at wide open throttle (WOT), and 4000 rpm.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is, perhaps, {{and that is}} left open to debate, {{one of the most}} important engineering fields, and one which is increasingly influential on our everyday lives. Automotive engineering brings together all aspects of engineering knowledge to produce the one product that so many people have become dependent upon. The industry itself is vast and many tangents can be drawn from it, hence here we must define the area of interest to which this work relates. The initial concept for the work carried out stems from the passenger car industry; however, the work has more farreaching benefits and implications. As passenger vehicles become increasingly popular and increasingly advanced, so the need increases to understand more of the operation of all aspects of the vehicle. This work stems from a need to gain understanding of the flow of breather and <b>blowby</b> gases within an internal combustion engine (ICE) with the long-term aim of fully understanding the processes involved to enable improved engine design and reduced pollutant production. The latter is a significant driving force as legislation becomes more strict on the level of pollutants emitted from vehicles and engines. This work therefore not only reflects on passenger vehicles, but any other industry or product that uses ICEs. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceJaguar Cars Ltd. GBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The piston ring-pack {{exhibits}} a complex dynamic behaviour, {{which includes the}} dynamics of the rings and related gas flow and oil flows, twisting of the piston rings and its influence on ring-liner and ring-groove lubrication and contact, and unsteady oil supply to upper piston rings and its effects on ring-liner lubrication. These dynamic phenomena {{play a crucial role in}} the piston assembly response such as <b>blowby,</b> friction, wear and oil consumption and it is of both theoretical and practical interest to understand and model them. In fact, a significant share of the total power loss in a modern automotive engine is due to the ring pack/cylinder wall friction. On this basis, the lubrication of the piston ring has been an important research matter for many years, because it is generally accepted that the interaction at the ring-cylinder wall interface provides substantial effects on friction, wear, oil consumption and power loss in internal combustion engines. This chapter aims to illustrate the physics of the piston rings lubrication and friction characteristics involving the fundamentals of their role in the complex engine system, the main mathematical and computer models about the theoretical reported investigations. The chapter is completed by a looking into the future trends and opportunities of research on piston ring modelling and improvements to its frictional behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{piston rings}} {{are the most}} {{important}} part in engine which controls the lubricating oil consumption and <b>blowby</b> of the gases. The lubricating film of oil is provided to seal of gases towards crankcase and also to give smooth friction free translatory motion between rings and liner. Of the three rings present top ring is more crucial as it does the main work of restricting gases downwards the crankcase. Boundary lubrication is present at the Top dead centre (TDC) and Bottom dead centre (BDC) of the liner surface. In addition to this, top ring is exposed to high temperature gases which makes the oil present near the top ring to get evaporated and decreasing its viscosity, making metal-metal contact most of the time. Due to this at TDC, excess wear happens on the liner which is termed as Top ring reversal bore wear. The wear rate depends upon many parameters such as lubrication condition, viscosity index, contact type, normal forces acting on ring, geometry of ring face, surface roughness, material property. The present work explores the wear depth for different geometries of barrel ring using Finite Element model with the help of Archard wear law and the same is validated through experimentation. The study reveals that Asymmetric barrel rings have less contact pressure which in turn reduces the wear at Top dead centre...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} to the engine cylinder is essential for internal combustion, engine simulation, especially under motored conditions. If the heat loss rate is correctly estimated, it is then easy {{to determine if a}} low maximum compression pressure is due to increased <b>blowby</b> or not. This paper proposes a method to determine the heat flux rate to the combustion chamber walls of a motored DI diesel engine and evaluate the heat transfer model used. The method is based on processing the measured pressure diagram Li the engine cylinder using a time step equivalent to 0. 15 ° CA. The measured pressure diagram is a P-t diagram, and thus the TDC (top dead centre) of the engine must be determined precisely in order to be converted to a P-V diagram. The TDC is measured using a magnetic pickup device mounted on the engine flywheel and is also determined, in cases where this is impossible, using a modified version of a thermodynamic method developed by the author. The heat flux determination method is applied on a modified Ricardo E- 6 engine in the author's laboratory over a range of engine speeds under cold and warm conditions. There is very good coincidence between the measured and calculated heat flux rates at all speeds examined, revealing the validity of the heat transfer model used. The results are promising and compare very well with experimental results published in the literature...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} engine oil {{consumption}} (OC) was conducted both theoretically and experimentally. It {{was found that}} oil blowing into the combustion chamber through the top ring gap (termed ‘reversed oil’) and oil returning to the crankcase through the oil ring gap (termed ‘blowby oil’) are important factors affecting OC. It was also observed that depending on the ring gap clearance, enlarged because of ring wear (for example the radial ring wear of 50 pm corresponds to a gap enlargement of roughly 0. 31 mm) or non-optimal ring gap clearance and inter-ring volume, the 2 nd land pressure can exceed cylinder pressure-leading to increasing reversed oil and consequently higher OC. The deterioration of OC with increasing operation has been traced to lowered oil-scraping capability with ring wear. This is true. However, the above-mentioned phenomenon {{can be considered as}} another reason for such OC. This paper describes the relationship between reversed oil(b 1 owby oil ratio and OC, and presents a procedure for optimizing ring gap clearance and inter-ring volume for acceptable OC.

40|$|Three {{real gas}} {{isentropic}} exponents kTv, krv, kpT are introduced, which {{when used in}} place of the classical isentropic exponent k=cp/c in the ideal gas isentropic change equations, the latter may describe very accurately the isentropic change of real gases. The usual practice of employing exponent k may lead to considerably incorrect results even when the value of k corresponds to the correct local value of cp/cv of the real gas under examination. The numerical values of the new exponents are calculated in the case of real air for temperatures from 150 K to 450 K and pressures from 1 bar to 1000 bar. It is seen that at low temperatures and high pressures the values of the new exponents differ considerably from the values of the classical exponent k. Therefore, the error resulting by approximating, as is usually the case, the behaviour of real gases by the ideal gas isentropic change equations in a stepwise fashion with exponent k instead of the new exponents, is considerable. It follows that exponent k, which appears in various relations in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, gasdynamics, heat transfer etc., should be suitably replaced by combinations of the three exponents. Related numerical examples, made in the case of real air, showed that the use of k leads (in the temperature and pressure ranges examined) to a 5 % error in the calculation of <b>blowby</b> rate in internal combustion enginers, high pressure compressors or steam turbines and to a 50 % error in the calculation of the isentropic expansion or compression. © 1986 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|When {{measurements}} of indicator diagrams {{are made in}} an internal combustion engine, the serious problem arises of accurate phasing of pressure data to crank position. This work presents a novel thermodynamic method for such a phasing. A measuring assembly consisting of a piezoelectric transducer, a charge amplifier and a fast data acquisition board installed on a compatible PC computer, is used to obtain the indicator diagrams (i. e. pairs of pressure-time), dispensing thus {{with the use of}} a signal from the flywheel TDC marker. An advanced simulation thermodynamic model for the corresponding compression curve (i. e. before fuel injection) is proposed, which includes a detailed zero dimensional energy cascade turbulence submodel for predicting the heat transfer rate between cylinder gas and walls, a <b>blowby</b> rate submodel containing flow calculations in the piston ring pack assembly passages under rings motion conditions, and properties-relations pertaining to real gas (air) behaviour. The measured pressure data are corrected for drift and their exact period (from cycle to cycle) is determined. The theoretical compression curve is shifted (in time) to ""coincide"" to the compression part (before fuel injection) of the first measured cycle, so that its TDC is determined. The coincidence of the two compression curves is continuously (iteratively) improved by using a double iteration procedure, i. e. by firstly shifting the curves in time and secondly by varying the model's parameters and calibration constants. After this step, the phasing of pressure data to crank angle of the following cycles can be easily determined, since the corresponding time periods are already accurately calculated. The method is applied with success, under various speed and load conditions, for a fully instrumented single cylinder, LISTER LV 1, direct injection, naturally aspirated, Diesel engine installation at the authors' laboratory. © 1991 VDI Verlag GmbH...|$|E
