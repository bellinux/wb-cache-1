40|$|The old <b>booster</b> <b>control</b> {{system of}} SRRC is a turnkey project {{from a foreign}} vendor in 1992. Since then, {{differences}} in design philosophy, inconvenience to maintenance staffs, and other inherited aspects {{have led to the}} replacement of the old MULTIbus based local system with VMEbus based Intelligent Local Controllers (ILC). This change, it enables us to integrate the <b>booster</b> <b>control</b> system into the storage ring’s system. This means the two original heterogeneous and unrelated systems become a homogeneous and unified aggregate from both the machine researcher, and operators ’ points of view. The benefits from this project are a more versatile environments for machine research, a more open architecture for machine upgrading or modifying capacity, less effort for machine maintenance, and a more advanced methodology for machine performance enhancement. ...|$|E

The project was cancelled in favour of the Green Cheese missile but other project developments were incorporated into what became the Mark 2. It had improved low altitude performance and a limited anti-ship capability and entered service in 1965. The Mark2 utilized an improved beam-riding guidance system. It was powered by the Deerhound sustainer motor, with Retriever <b>boosters.</b> <b>Control</b> was by a modified Type 901M radar and it had an improved infra-red proximity fuze and a continuous-rod warhead with a smaller, 56 lb, explosive charge and large steel penetrator.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBecause {{blocking}} GABAergic neurotransmission {{in control}} tissue generates seizures and because GABA <b>boosters</b> <b>control</b> epilepsy in many patients, studies on epilepsies have {{been dominated by}} the axiom that seizures are generated by a failure of GABA-mediated inhibition. However, GABAergic interneurons and synapses are heterogeneous and have many roles that go beyond the straightforward concept of "inhibition of the target". Operation of such a diversified system cannot be ascribed to a single mechanism. In epileptic tissue, GABAergic networks undergo complex rewiring at the anatomical, physiological and functional levels; GABAergic synapses are still operative but show unique features, including excitatory effects. Therefore, inhibition is not a uniform notion {{and the concept of}} "failure" of inhibition in epilepsies must be reassessed. Seizures are not generated in a normal circuit in which GABA-mediated inhibition is simply impaired, but in a profoundly rewired network in which several properties of GABA function are altered. This review is part of the TINS Interneuron Diversity series...|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} investigation, {{parts of}} the Thor were {{recovered}} and examined. It was discovered that the yaw gyro was installed improperly and had missing alignment pins, apparently because a pad technician had mistakenly broken them off during installation. Without the pins, the gyro rotated out of position with {{the effect that the}} <b>booster</b> lost <b>control</b> almost as soon as the pitch and roll sequence started.|$|R

RESULTS: After 2 years of treatment, smoking rates in the treatment group (vs the control group) were lower for 30 -day, 7 -day, and 24 -hour smoking.

50|$|NASA's first X-43A test on June 2, 2001 {{failed because}} the Pegasus <b>booster</b> lost <b>control</b> about 13 seconds {{after it was}} {{released}} from the B-52 carrier. The rocket experienced a control oscillation as it went transonic, eventually leading to the failure of the rocket's starboard elevon. This caused the rocket to deviate significantly from the planned course, and was destroyed as a safety precaution. An investigation into the incident stated that imprecise information about the capabilities of the rocket as well as its flight environment contributed to the accident. Several inaccuracies in data modeling for this test led to an inadequate control system for the particular Pegasus rocket used, though no single factor could ultimately be blamed for the failure.|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} bucket {{position in}} the Fermilab <b>Booster</b> is <b>controlled</b> with a cogging process that involves the comparison of the Booster RF count and the Recycler Ring revolution marker. A one RF bucket jitter in the extraction bucket position results from the variability of the process that phase matches the Booster to the Recycler. However, the new slow phase lock process used to lock the frequency and phase of the Booster RF to the Recycler RF has been made digital and programmable and has been modified to correct the extraction notch position. The beam loss at the Recycler injection has been reduced by 20 %. Beam studies and the phase lock system {{will be discussed in}} this paper. Comment: 3 p...|$|R

Historically, the Linac/Booster system has served only as an injector for the relatively low repetition rate Main Ring synchrotron. With construction of an 8 GeV target station for the 5 Hz MiniBooNE neutrino beam and requirements for rapid multi-batch injection into the Main Injector for the NUMI/MINOS experiment, the demand for 8 GeV protons will increase more than {{an order of magnitude}} above recent high levels. To meet this challenge, enhanced ion source performance, better <b>Booster</b> orbit <b>control,</b> a beam loss collimation/localization system, and improved diagnostics are among the items being pursued.

40|$|Due to inadequacies in {{the user}} {{interface}} of the <b>booster</b> orbit <b>control</b> system, {{a number of}} new tools were developed. The first priority was an accurate calculation of the winding currents given specific displacements at each extraction septa. Next, the physical limits of the power supplies ({+-} 600 amps) needed to be taken into account. In light of this limit, a system is developed that indicates to the user what the allowed values of one bump parameter are once the other two have been specified. Finally, techniques are developed to account for the orbit behavior once power supplies are requested to exceed their {+-} 600 amp limit. This includes a recalculation of bump parameters and a calculation of the amplitude of the residuals. Following this, possible areas for further development are outlined. These techniques were computationally developed in Mathematica and tested in the Methodical Accelerator Design (MAD) program before they were implemented into the control system.
