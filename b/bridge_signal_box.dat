RETB was commissioned by British Rail between Mallaig Junction and Mallaig on 6 December 1987 and between Fort William Junction and [...] on 29 May 1988. As a consequence, Fort William Junction S.B. now works only to Banavie Signalling Centre, on both routes.|$|R

50|$|In {{the area}} of the western connection, the route Leipzig-Leutzsch-Leipzig-Plagwitz (as of fall 2010) along Leipzig-Probstzella railway was being {{expanded}} and remodeled. <b>Bridges,</b> <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> tracks and overhead lines as well as noise barriers had been erected. The current platforms in the station of Leipzig-Leutzsch and the stop Leipzig Industriegelände West were abandoned and new platforms directly under Georg-Schwarz-Straße replaced them. At a later point, the stops Leipzig-Lindenau and travel facilities of the station Leipzig-Plagwitz were completely redone and also finished by 2013. As part of this, the platforms in Leipzig-Plagwitz had been moved directly north to Karl-Heine-Straße and received new entrances. Renewal work was also undertaken on the route Leipzig-Leutzsch-Bad Dürrenberg along Leipzig-Großkorbetha railway.|$|R
5000|$|The RETB {{system was}} {{commissioned}} by British Rail between [...] and Fort William Junction on 29 May 1988. This resulted in the closure of <b>Bridge</b> of Orchy <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> (amongst others). The RETB is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station.|$|R
50|$|The Arbeitsgemeinschaft Mechanische Stellwerke e. V. (“working {{community}} for mechanical signal boxes”) {{was founded on}} 21 February 2010 in Limburg to prevent the demolition of the historical and protective <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> Bo. The working community has set itself the goal of rehabilitating the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and, in the longer term, preserving it as a monument of the railway history in the Lahn valley for posterity. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{is located at the}} northern exit of Balduinstein station just before the Lahn <b>bridge.</b> The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was inaugurated in 1913 and went out of service on 1 September 2003. During the active period, the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was constantly occupied by a signalman. A mechanical interlocking device of the Bruchsal J type was installed in 1929. Later, a system operated by push buttons was used to operate the electrically-actuated Dr S2 interlocking from Siemens. Since the decommissioning of the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> Bo during the 2015 modernisation, the dispatcher in the entrance building (Bf) has controlled all points and signals at the station.|$|R
50|$|Hebden <b>Bridge</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> is a Grade II listed former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway signal box, located {{close to}} Hebden Bridge railway station in West Yorkshire, England.|$|E
50|$|Blythe <b>Bridge</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{was opened}} by the NSR in 1884 on their Derby to Stoke line. The box {{was built to}} a {{standard}} McKenzie & Holland design and under the S.R.S. designation system {{is referred to as}} a MKH Type1.|$|E

50|$|The OS maps of 1895 shows only a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and <b>signals</b> at the location.. By the 1920s {{only minor}} {{infrastructure}} was present {{as might be}} expected at such a remote location with the double track main line, one siding running off to a loading dock to the west, a weighing machine, small buildings and an access off the B744 road to Crosshands with a road over <b>bridge.</b> The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> or cabin was situated on {{the eastern side of the}} main line with several semaphore signal posts and cross over points were present with runaway points located in the up line about 400yds towards Hurlford from the <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> In 1898 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was staffed day and night during the week but only from 7.30am to 8pm on Sundays. The G&SWR Permanent Way Department was responsible for the cleaning of the points and signals rather than staff from Mauchline railway station.|$|R
50|$|Severn <b>Bridge</b> Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> at {{the south}} end of the station and built by the LNWR, is the largest {{surviving}} mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> in the World, with a frame accommodating 180 levers, and is a listed building. Whilst the line beyond Abbey Foregate <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> to Wolverhampton has been updated to electronic signalling, Shrewsbury itself is set to remain lever operated for the foreseeable future. As a result of Shrewsbury's joint (GWR/LNWR) history, and having been transferred at different times between the Western and London Midland regions of BR and more recently Network Rail - it is now in the Great Western territory again - the signalling is a diverse mixture of lower-quadrant and upper-quadrant semaphore signals, with a few colour lights too. Crewe Junction, on the north end of the station, accommodates around 120 levers and is of the same design as Severn Bridge Junction.|$|R
50|$|Drem station {{consists}} of two platforms, with the main buildings being situated on the Up (eastbound) platform. At {{the west end of}} the station is an overbridge carrying a minor road to Athelstaneford. Both platforms originally extended further west through this <b>bridge.</b> The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was situated on the Down (westbound) side of the line immediately to the east of the station, opposite the original point of divergence of the North Berwick branch. There were trailing refuge sidings on the Up line west of the station and on the Down line to the east of it, whilst the station goods yard with a goods shed and five sidings was on the Up side east of the station.|$|R
50|$|Alterations in {{connection}} with the construction of the line to Fort Augustus saw the original Spean <b>Bridge</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> replaced by two new boxes in 1901. Spean Bridge Junction box was subsidiary to Spean Bridge Station box. The Junction box closed on 20 September 1921.|$|E
5000|$|Spean Bridge {{lost all}} its {{semaphore}} signals on 2 March 1986, {{in preparation for}} Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) signalling. The RETB system was commissioned by British Rail between [...] and Fort William Junction on 29 May 1988. This resulted in the closure of Spean <b>Bridge</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and others on {{that part of the}} line. The RETB is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station.|$|E

50|$|In {{connection}} {{with the introduction of}} colour light signalling on the branch the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was closed on 27 September 1975 and the signals are now controlled form London <b>Bridge</b> <b>Signalling</b> Centre.|$|R
50|$|The Bingerbrück Kreuzbach (Bkb) <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{is located}} {{to the north}} of Bingen Hbf near the former {{southern}} hump of the marshalling yard. It is a gantry <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> which increased the available room for operations by extending over the railway facilities. This <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was designed by the architect Hans Kleinschmidt as a steel skeleton and was designed and completed in 1936. The western end of the building is built of broken stone. The actual signal tower is 15 metres long and in addition it has operating rooms and a pedestrian bridge. The interlocking system, which it housed, was a 10-metre-long electro-mechanical interlocking system of class E 43 made by the Siemens company. At its peak, the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was staffed by five people who were particularly responsible for the marshalling and operation of trains at the freight yard. In 1996, after 60 years of operations, the <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> together with the other <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> was removed from service and replaced by the central interlocking Bf on the Nahe <b>bridge.</b> The gantry <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was listed as a historic landmark on 8 November 2005. In addition, it {{is now one of the}} cultural monuments listed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley. After an inspection of the bridge carried out in 2006 found structural defects, access to the bridge was blocked. In April 2009, Bingen town council requested that the federal and state governments allocate funds for the preservation of the World Heritage Site towards the restoration of the <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{continuing}} requirement to operate the swing bridge locally, Banavie {{was chosen as the}} location for the control centre for the West Highland Line's new radio signalling system. Banavie signalling centre opened on 14 June 1987 when it replaced the old Canal <b>Bridge</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> The Radio Electronic Token Block signalling was commissioned on 6 December 1987. The control centre covers train movements as far south as Helensburgh and Oban and Mallaig to the west. Local train movements in Fort William and the nearby freight yard at Inverlochy are controlled by the mechanical signal box at Fort William Junction.|$|E
5000|$|... 1168 {{yards away}} on the Manchester Lines (Up and Down Manchester) was Sydney <b>Bridge</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> As on the WCML, Track Circuit Block was {{operated}} on these lines. The train describer for these lines {{can be seen to}} the right. On 5 June 1959, Sydney Bridge was closed and replaced by Sandbach Power Signal Box (PSB) (4 miles 869 yards away). Crewe North Junction was unaffected by this change with the only difference being where the train describers were connected to. Sandbach box closed in March 2006, when the Manchester line was resignalled and control handed over to the new Manchester South SCC.|$|E
50|$|During 1974/75, {{the first}} section of the control panel in London Bridge ASC was commissioned, {{gradually}} replacing redundant signalling locations in the area and principally replacing the old 1923-built London <b>Bridge</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> Railway track layouts were altered to separate Cannon Street, Charing Cross and London Bridge (Central) traffic. Prior to the London Bridge ASC, Cannon Street and Charing Cross traffic arrived at London Bridge on all lines and was either signalled approaching or leaving London Bridge station to their respective destinations. With the development of London Bridge ASC, all this traffic was sorted out further outside London Bridge, mainly at Parks Bridge but occasionally in the New Cross area. The London Bridge central traffic was kept as a separate working railway from the eastern side.|$|E
50|$|Colour light {{signalling}} {{was introduced}} between Ladywell and New Beckenham on 4 April 1971 with signalling being {{controlled by the}} <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at New Beckenham. South of the station semaphore signalling remained until 28 September 1975 when {{the control of the}} signalling was transferred to London <b>Bridge</b> <b>signalling</b> centre and New Beckenham <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> (a two-storey structure located {{at the end of the}} down platform) was closed.|$|R
50|$|St Bees is a {{civil parish}} in the Borough of Copeland, Cumbria, England. It {{contains}} 38 buildings that are recorded in the National Heritage List for England. Of these, four are listed at Grade I, the highest of the three grades, two are at Grade II*, the middle grade, {{and the others are}} at Grade II, the lowest grade. The parish includes the village of St Bees and the surrounding coastline and countryside. In the 12th century a Benedictine priory was established in the parish. Most of this disappeared after the Dissolution of the Monasteries apart from the priory church, most of which became the Church of St Mary and St Bega, the parish church of the village, while most of the chancel was modified for other uses. Also in the village is St Bees School, an independent school. The church, the school, and a number of associated structures are listed. Most of the other listed buildings are houses and associated structures, and farmhouses and farm buildings. The other listed buildings include a <b>bridge,</b> a <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> and two war memorials.|$|R
50|$|The goods yard {{closed to}} general traffic on 28 December 1964 and to coal on 25 March 1968. Colour light {{signalling}} was introduced between Ladywell and New Beckenham on 4 April 1971 with signalling being {{controlled by the}} <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at New Beckenham. The small SER <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> which was located on the up platform was closed as a result. On 28 September 1975 {{the control of the}} signalling was transferred to London <b>Bridge</b> <b>signalling</b> centre.|$|R
5000|$|The nearby {{junction}} {{between the}} Crewe and Stoke routes {{is an important}} one on the West Coast Main Line, as such during the 1960s modernisation of the line, the junction and some of the surrounding main lines were placed under the control of a new power signal box built to a similar design to that still standing at Wolverhampton. The Norton <b>Bridge</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was notable for its use of an experimental Westinghouse solid-state interlocking system for some years, later being converted to a conventional relay-based interlocking; this signal box features briefly in the British Transport Films production [...] "Thirty Million Letters". It closed altogether in 2004, control passing instead to the signal control centre at Stoke, although the lower storey still remains in situ as a relay room.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{modification}} to the {{signalling arrangement}} came in 1976, when the multi-panel London <b>Bridge</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> became operational. [...] This allowed the reversible {{operation of the}} Down Chislehurst Loop. [...] The 1959-"power box" [...] remained the primary control point for these lines in this area until 12 June 1983. [...] This date saw the expansion of Victoria Signalling Centre's scope of control {{as far as the}} boundary of Rochester signal box. [...] Chislehurst Junction signal box retained control over the South Eastern Main Line until 1993, when it was taken over as part of the gradual implementation of Ashford Signalling Centre. [...] Meanwhile, in 1992/1993, the [...] "Up" [...] and [...] "Down" [...] Bickley Loops were doubled to accommodate Eurostar operations, which began in earnest on 14 November 1994. The new Down Slow Bickley Loop shares the same alignment as the Up Chislehurst where they pass under the South Eastern Main Line. This created a new junction named Hawkwood Junction.|$|E
50|$|Colour light {{signalling}} {{was introduced}} south of Ladywell (as far as New Beckenham) on 4 April 1971. The line was fully converted to colour light operation in September 1975 {{under the control}} of London <b>Bridge</b> <b>Signalling</b> Centre. The old mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> closed at this time.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} heavily bombed during the Hull Blitz, {{in part due}} to the docks and {{dockside}} industries being a primary target for Luftwaffe bombing raids. At Rustenberg Street bombing caused what are thought to be the first deaths in Hull in August 1940. Alexandra Dock was targeted on 15/16 April with bombs also falling on Hotham Street causing deaths. The Rustenberg Street area was hit by bombs again on 18 July 1941 resulting in several deaths. A raid on 1 August 1942 targeted Alexandra Dock, resulting in deaths in the surrounding area including Southcoates; an 1800 kg bomb fell on Grindell Street killing 23. A raid on 14 July 1943 targeted the railway system - both Southcoates Lane <b>bridge</b> and nearby <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> were hit, Both Estcourt Street School, and the Methodist Chapel (Hedon Road) were destroyed during the bombing. The Prison was also badly damaged by bombing.|$|R
50|$|Before 2015, Three <b>Bridges</b> <b>signalling</b> centre {{controlled}} the route between Keymer Junction and Plumpton and Brighton to Falmer where Lewes Power Box takes over until Southerham Junction, from which absolute block signalling takes over through to Hastings. <b>Signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were situated at Berwick, Polegate Crossing, Hampden Park, Eastbourne, Pevensey and Westham, Bexhill and Bo-Peep Junction. There were two crossing boxes at Plumpton and Normans Bay.|$|R
50|$|On 28 May 1975 all {{signalling}} {{came under}} the control of the London <b>Bridge</b> <b>Signalling</b> Centre and the 1882 <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was closed. The down bay was taken out of passenger use and became an engineer’s siding.Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: InterCity, operating principal express services; and London & South East (renamed Network SouthEast in 1986) who operated commuter services in the London area.|$|R
