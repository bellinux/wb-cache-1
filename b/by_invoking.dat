5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences <b>by</b> <b>invoking</b> Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius {{was elected}} to the office of Tribune of the Plebs in 133 BC. He {{immediately}} began pushing for a programme of land reform, partly <b>by</b> <b>invoking</b> the 240-year-old Sextian-Licinian law that limited the amount of land that could be owned by a single individual. Using the powers of Lex Hortensia, Tiberius established a commission to oversee the redistribution of land holdings from the rich to the unlanded urban poor. The commission consisted of himself, his father-in-law and his brother Gaius.|$|E

Medb, queen of Connacht, has mounted the {{invasion}} to steal the stud bull Donn Cúailnge, Cú Chulainn allows her to take Ulster by surprise because he was with a woman when {{he should have been}} watching the border. The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to suffer from labor pains. So it becomes Cu Chulainn's job to stop Medb's army from advancing further. He does this <b>by</b> <b>invoking</b> the right of single combat at fords. He defeats champion after champion in a stand-off that lasts for months.|$|E
5|$|In theory, the emperor's {{political}} power was absolute, but {{even during the}} Han dynasty, he shared executive powers with civilian officials and normally based his decisions on the advice and formal consensus of his ministers. During the Song dynasty, a national examination system (Civil Service Exam) managed by scholar-bureaucrats was used to recruit officials; those who passed the palace examination – the highest-level examination in the empire – were appointed directly by the emperor to the highest central government positions. Like commoners, these senior officials had to obey his edicts as law or be punished. However, senior officials not only challenged the emperor over policy, but restrained him <b>by</b> <b>invoking</b> the ideal Confucian mores {{and values of the}} literati gentry class from which they came.|$|E

40|$|Concurrency {{control in}} object based systems {{is a new}} area of {{research}} that has only just begun to be addressed. Recent work has proposed using object level locking but this may be unnecessarily restrictive. Data level locking within an object increases concurrency but also introduces substantial lock overhead that makes the approach impractical. This paper proposes using a new approach applying method level dependence analysis techniques to object bases using a nested transaction model. Three algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm uses static analysis of methods <b>invoked</b> <b>by</b> user transactions only. The second performs runtime analysis of the nested methods <b>invoked</b> <b>by</b> the methods <b>invoked</b> <b>by</b> user transactions. Finally, a third algorithm proposes a hybrid technique that is compatible with both of these techniques and determines if the acquisition of locks is necessary at runtime or if the method can be invoked {{without the possibility of}} conflict. This algorithm is efficient, simple, a [...] ...|$|R
