5|$|The most {{significant}} <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.|$|E

5|$|After the Congress of Vienna {{there was}} a degree of {{commercial}} cooperation between the various German states resulting {{in the setting of}} the German Customs Union (Zollverein). There were however still many <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856. As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the Zollpfund (Customs Pound) which was defined to be exactly 500g and which could be split into 30'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E
40|$|Roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) {{grown in}} {{stagnant}} de-oxygenated solution contain a 'tight' <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> radial oxygen loss (ROL) in basal zones, whereas roots of plants grown in aerated solution do not. It is generally accepted that the <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> ROL involves anatomical modifications in the apoplast of cell layers exterior to the aerenchyma. A possible drawback of this adaptation is a reduced capacity for nutrient uptake. Whether or not induction of a <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> ROL influences {{the capacity of}} adventitious roots of rice to take up NO 3 - was determined in the present study, using NO 3 [...] selective microelectrodes. When transferred into O- 2 -free root medium, ROL from positions at 30 - 50 mm behind the tip of adventitious roots of plants raised in stagnant solution was only 4 - 6 % of the rate from roots of plants raised in aerated solution, indicating the <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> ROL was induced by growth in stagnant solution. For plants transferred into aerobic nutrient solution containing 0. 1 mM NO 3 -, net NO 3 - uptake by these root zones, {{with or without a}} <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> ROL, was the same. It is concluded that induction of a <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> ROL had no effect on the capacity of adventitious roots of rice to take up NO 3 - from aerobic solution...|$|R

5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> quality sleep {{that can be}} addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E
5|$|Marie Thursby {{has used}} an {{extended}} {{version of the}} model to examine international trade in wheat, 60% of which is produced by the United States and Canada. Thursby includes marketing boards, possibility of a monopsony, {{and a variety of}} government policies in the analysis. She finds that while there are significant economies of scale in the industry, the <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> entry are not high and regardless of the extent of market power that US firms have in the industry, the optimal policy is actually an export tax, rather than a subsidy.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Union Carbide and Kellex {{had made}} {{researchers}} at the Bakelite Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Carbide, aware of Nix's unsuccessful efforts with powdered nickel <b>barriers.</b> <b>To</b> Frazier Groff and other researchers at Bakelite's laboratories in Bound Brook, New Jersey, it seemed that Nix was not {{taking advantage of the}} latest techniques, and they began their own development efforts. Both Bell and Bound Brook sent samples of their powdered nickel <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> Taylor for evaluation, but he was unimpressed; neither had come up with a practical barrier. At Kellogg's laboratory in Jersey City, New Jersey, Clarence A. Johnson, who was aware of the steps taken by the SAM laboratories to improve the Norris-Adler barrier, realized that they could also be taken with the Bakelite barrier. The result was a barrier better than either, although still short of what was required. At a meeting at Columbia with the Army in attendance on 20 October 1943, Keith proposed switching the development effort to the Johnson barrier. Urey balked at this, fearing that this would destroy morale at the SAM Laboratories. The issue was put to Groves at a meeting on 3 November 1943, and he decided to pursue development of both the Johnson and Norris-Adler barriers.|$|E

5|$|Species are reproductively {{isolated}} {{by strong}} <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> hybridisation, which include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization and others after it. Similar barriers exist in plants, with differences in flowering times, pollen vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility {{and the structure}} of the chromosomes. A few animal species and many plant species, however, are the result of hybrid speciation, including important crop plants such as wheat, where the number of chromosomes has been doubled.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis {{seized from}} the French {{thousands}} of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles {{of weapons and}} raw materials such as copper, tin, oil and nickel. Financial demands were levied on {{the governments of the}} occupied countries as well and payments for occupation costs were received from France, Belgium and Norway. <b>Barriers</b> <b>to</b> trade led to hoarding, black markets and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most areas of Europe, {{but not as much as}} during World War I. Greece experienced famine in the first year of occupation and the Netherlands in the last year of the war.|$|E

5|$|The first {{discussion}} {{of improving the}} intersection and grade crossing was a study in 1898, since which there have been about three dozen more. The most recent, a 2009 study of the downtown area, examined the possibility of depressing Route 126 under the grade crossing and intersection {{as well as several}} other alternatives including bypasses. The Route 126 depression was deemed to create <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> walkability downtown, and the recommended alternative was to depress Route 135 under the intersection to prevent it from being affected by trains passing through the grade crossing. Funds have not yet become available for final design and construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the stop lines and the {{anti-tank}} islands that followed was to hold up the enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route of an attack. The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too soft to support even tracked vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The renewed {{interest}} in residential schools in the early 1800s {{has been linked to}} the decline in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the War of 1812.

This perspective was further underscored by the transfer of affairs with Indigenous communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs and way of life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.|$|E
