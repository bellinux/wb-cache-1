5|$|At {{first it}} always bothers you {{even though you}} say it doesn't. But I think {{if you want to}} exceed limits, you have to suck that all in and be happy with what you have.

5|$|The {{story line}} took on many forms during production. His {{original}} idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he {{drew in a}} book as a child coming back to <b>bother</b> him as an adult.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} whether sexual harassment is related to mental and physical health of both men and women, and to explore the possible moderating effects of gender on the relation between sexual harassment and health. In addition, we investigated whether women were more often <b>bothered</b> by sexual harassment than men, and whether victims who report being <b>bothered</b> by the harassment experience more health problems compared to victims who did not feel <b>bothered.</b> A representative sample of 3, 001 policemen and 1, 295 policewomen in the Dutch police force filled out an Internet questionnaire. It appeared that women were more often <b>bothered</b> by sexual harassment than men, but gender did not moderate the relation between sexual harassment and mental and physical health. In addition. victims who felt <b>bothered</b> by the harassing behaviors reported more mental and physical health problems than victims who did not feel <b>bothered.</b> The distinction between <b>bothered</b> and nonbothered victims is important because appraisal is an essential aspect in the operationalization of sexual harassment...|$|R

5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did not <b>bother</b> to copyright it, resulting in the film falling into the public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal {{government}} {{is working on a}} new plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land, and where the enormous turbines won't <b>bother</b> the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.|$|E

30|$|Postoperatively, 5.5 % of our {{patients}} were still <b>bothered</b> by urgency, and 11 % were <b>bothered</b> by urge incontinence.

Nearly two thirds of the women who were still <b>bothered</b> by urge incontinence after the TVT operation had had a previous incontinence operation, were significantly older, and had a higher preoperative urge score.|$|R

Aria Kebonan, meanwhile, magically gains the king's appearance, ensuring {{that the people of}} Galuh are unaware that they have a new king.|$|E
5|$|In January 1957, Diefenbaker {{took his}} place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent {{informed}} him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10.

Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory that he did not even <b>bother</b> to make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Motley's knees {{continued}} to <b>bother</b> him in 1952.

Motley finished the year with 444 yards of rushing and 4.3 yards per carry, a career low. The Browns finished with an 8–4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game. Motley performed well in that matchup against the Detroit Lions, rushing for 95 yards. The Browns, however, lost 17–7.|$|E
5|$|Shelley wrote eleven poems for Jane {{during that}} time. She {{served as the}} primary {{inspiration}} for the last poems that he wrote before his death. This did not <b>bother</b> Edward; he was proud that his wife inspired such poetry. Some biographers of Shelley have maintained that Shelley's feelings for Jane were strictly platonic, although different scholars have observed themes of frustrated sexual desires in Shelley's poetry during this period. Other critics have noted that Shelley's poems during this period struggle to define his feelings.|$|E
5|$|Although Ibn Haukal {{reports the}} sack of Samandar by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader did not <b>bother</b> {{to occupy the}} Khazar heartlands north of the Caucasus Mountains permanently. On {{his way back to}} Kiev, Sviatoslav chose to strike against the Ossetians and force them into subservience. Therefore, Khazar {{successor}} statelets continued their precarious existence in the region. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E

5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist.

It did not seem to <b>bother</b> Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.|$|E

Archer demands that Daniels should never visit or <b>bother</b> Enterprise again. With their mission completed, Enterprise finally arrives back in its proper time period, where the crew are welcomed and escorted by an entire squadron of Starfleet and alien vessels.|$|E
5|$|Pemberton was {{boxed in}} {{with lots of}} munitions and little food. The poor diet was showing on the Confederate soldiers. By the end of June, half were out sick or hospitalized.

The constant shelling did not <b>bother</b> {{him as much as}} the loss of his food. As the siege wore on, fewer and fewer horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.|$|E
