[...] Nevertheless, Kirby also acknowledges [...] "(E)ach side accuses the other of being irrational, overzealous, blind to evidence they find inconvenient, and subject to professional, financial, or emotional conflicts of interest that cloud their judgment." [...] Ultimately, Kirby finds the evidence leveled against thimerosal inconclusive but suggestive, and calls urgently for further research.|$|E
