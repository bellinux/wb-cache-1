5|$|<b>Bowing</b> down {{to public}} pressure, the trade {{secretary}} Peter Mandelson referred {{the deal to}} the Mergers Commission in October 1998. The report, finalised in April 1999, found that BSkyB acted selfishly and blocked the broadcaster's bid.|$|E
5|$|Male masked shrikes sing from perches {{in their}} territories from early April, {{sometimes}} chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, {{starts with the}} bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and {{is followed by the}} shrike stepping down its branch and <b>bowing,</b> either on the move or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and <b>bowing</b> on the move appear to be confined to this species.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 FIG {{evolved into}} the European Women's Improvising Group (EWIG), <b>bowing</b> to {{pressure}} to tone down their name. FIG were influential on the second-generation improvisation scene and spawned a number of women-only improvising groups and events. FIG were also educational in that they exposed new audiences to improvisation and feminism.|$|E

50|$|Shorter <b>bow</b> designsbecame popular {{during the}} Ming dynasty (1368-1644 CE). Wubei Zhi (Chapter 102) {{describes}} several <b>bow</b> styles popular during the Mingdynasty: in the North, the short-siyah <b>bow,</b> grooved-siyah <b>bow,</b> grooved-bridge bow,and long-siyah bow; in the South, the Chenzhou <b>bow,</b> short-siyah <b>bow,</b> as well asbamboo composite <b>bows</b> finished with lacquer; the Kaiyuan <b>bow</b> {{was used in}} all parts of Ming China. The small-siyah <b>bow</b> (Chinese: 小稍弓) differed from earlier Chinesedesigns in that its siyahs were short and set at an angle forward ofthe string when at rest. Its design is possibly related to theKorean horn <b>bow.</b> The Kaiyuan <b>bow</b> (Chinese: 开元弓) was a small-to-medium size <b>bow</b> whichfeatured long siyahs, and it was the <b>bow</b> of choice for high-rankingofficers.|$|R
5|$|On 4 May 2012 Livingstone was {{defeated}} in the London 2012 Mayoral Elections by the incumbent Mayor, Boris Johnson. There was only a difference of 62,538 votes between the 2 candidates with Livingstone receiving 992,273 votes and Johnson receiving 1,054,811 votes. Livingstone criticised bias {{in the media and}} declared that he would be <b>bowing</b> out of politics.|$|E
5|$|Some {{paintings}} also {{depict the}} sacrifice of Aravan.

5|$|The early 1990s saw Bolton gain a giant-killing {{reputation}} in cup competitions. In 1993 Bolton beat FA Cup holders Liverpool 2–0 {{in a third}} round replay at Anfield, thanks to goals from super John McGinlay and Andy Walker. The club also defeated higher division opposition {{in the form of}} Wolverhampton Wanderers (2–1) that year before <b>bowing</b> out to Derby County. Bolton also secured promotion to the second tier {{for the first time since}} 1983. In 1994 Bolton again beat FA Cup holders, this time in the form of Arsenal, 3–1 after extra time in a fourth round replay, and went on to reach the quarter-finals, <b>bowing</b> out 1–0 at home to local rivals (and then Premiership) Oldham Athletic. Bolton also defeated top division opposition in the form of Everton (3–2) and Aston Villa (1–0) that year.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bow</b> frog is the {{end part}} of a {{stringed}} musical instrument's <b>bow</b> that encloses the mechanism responsible for tightening and holding the <b>bow</b> hair ribbon. Most of the <b>bow</b> frogs used in today's classical <b>bows</b> are made of ebony; some synthetic <b>bows</b> have frogs made with materials that imitate ebony, while Baroque <b>bows</b> use frogs made with various woods.|$|R
50|$|Multiple <b>bow</b> {{systems have}} a special system of pulling the sinew via several <b>bows</b> (which can be recurve <b>bows).</b> The {{workings}} {{can be compared to}} a modern compound <b>bow</b> system. The weapon uses several different <b>bows</b> instead of one <b>bow</b> with a tackle system to achieve a higher acceleration of the sinew via the multiplication with each <b>bow's</b> pulling effect.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Bows</b> {{are also}} made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre—stronger than wood—and {{fiberglass}} (often {{used to make}} inexpensive, lower-quality student <b>bows).</b> An average cello <b>bow</b> is [...] long (shorter than a violin or viola <b>bow)</b> [...] high (from the frog to the stick) and [...] wide. The frog of a cello <b>bow</b> typically has a rounded corner {{like that of a}} viola <b>bow,</b> but is wider.

5|$|To create 2,000 Hun {{soldiers}} {{during the}} Huns' attack sequence, the production team developed crowd simulation software called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A {{variant of the}} program called Dynasty {{was used in the}} final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar's photorealistic open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane, which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are <b>bowing</b> to Mulan, the crowd is a panoramic film of real people <b>bowing.</b> It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.|$|E
5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius {{found that men}} were often {{directed}} to go on pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate Christ and the saints by <b>bowing</b> before images and relics. Claudius, coming from an educated background, was not greatly exposed to such provincial modes of worship. He made attacks {{on the use of}} images, relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain absolution, and he had little regard for the authority of the pope due to his belief that all bishops were equal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no <b>bowing,</b> nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bows</b> {{are also}} made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre—stronger than wood—and {{fiberglass}} (often {{used to make}} inexpensive, lower-quality student <b>bows).</b> An average cello <b>bow</b> is 73 cm long (shorter than a violin or viola <b>bow)</b> 3 cm high (from the frog to the stick) and 1.5 cm wide. The frog of a cello <b>bow</b> typically has a rounded corner {{like that of a}} viola <b>bow,</b> but is wider. A cello <b>bow</b> is roughly 10 g heavier than a viola <b>bow,</b> which in turn is roughly 10 g heavier than a violin <b>bow.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} {{traditional}} use of a special kind of wood in <b>bow</b> construction in Eurasia and North America. This special kind of wood, called compression wood and coming from coniferous trees, has unique qualities that makes it suitable for <b>bow</b> construction. <b>Bows</b> made using this special wood have been referred to as Finno-Ugric <b>bows,</b> Sámi <b>bows,</b> Two-Wood <b>bows</b> and Eurasia laminated <b>bows.</b> These <b>bows</b> appear to have developed from archaic forms of compression wood self <b>bows</b> that were made from a single piece of wood. Recently features similar to the Eurasian compression wood <b>bows</b> have been discovered in <b>bows</b> originating from Alaska, and the use of compression wood for <b>bow</b> manufacture has been known to some Canadian Inuit groups. This paper addresses the origin and possible diffusion pattern of this innovation in <b>bow</b> technology in Eurasia and suggests a timeframe and a possible source for the transfer of this knowledge to North America. This paper also discusses the role of the Asiatic composite <b>bow</b> in the development of <b>bows</b> in Eurasia. </p...|$|R

5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while <b>bowing,</b> jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was also}} quiet after lunch, and after one {{long period of}} defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, {{eliciting}} a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and <b>bowing</b> to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, <b>bowing,</b> strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 2013–14 Big East season, Dunham was named to the All-Big East Second Team. Despite his improvements, Butler had a lackluster season, finishing with a 14–17 overall record and <b>bowing</b> out to Seton Hall in the Big East Tournament. Dunham finished the season seventh in the Big East in scoring with a 16.4 points per game average to go along with 4 rebounds per game. Dunham shot 39 percent from the field and 35.5 from 3-point range. He hit a 3-pointer in 29 of the team's 31 games. After the season, he teamed up with several college players to participate in Athletes in Action's summer trip to the Philippines.

5|$|Led by Kent Nilsson's 49-goal, 131-point season, the Flames {{qualified}} for the playoffs in their first season in Calgary with a 39–27–14 record, good for third in the Patrick Division. The team found much greater playoff success in Calgary {{than it did in}} Atlanta, winning their first two playoff series over the Chicago Black Hawks and Philadelphia Flyers before <b>bowing</b> out to the Minnesota North Stars in the semi-finals. This early success was not soon repeated. After a losing record in 1981–82, Fletcher jettisoned several holdovers from the Atlanta days who could not adjust to the higher-pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster. Over the next three seasons, he put together a core of players that would remain together through the early 1990s.|$|E
