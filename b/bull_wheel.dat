2500|$|Hells Gate Airtram {{starts at}} {{the parking lot of}} the Trans-Canada Highway and descends to its lower {{terminal}} on the opposite side of Fraser River next to the pedestrian suspension bridge, where there is an observation deck, a restaurant, a gift shop and other tourist attractions. It was built in 1970 by the Swiss manufacturer Habegger Engineering Works and opened on 21 July 1971. Its two cabins can carry 25 people each, plus the cabin attendant. Each cabin travels up and down along its own track rope at a maximum speed of 5m/s (18km/h, 984ft/min) over an inclined length of 341m (1118ft). The horizontal distance between the terminals is 303m (994ft) and their difference in altitude is 157m (515ft). The mean inclination between the terminals is 51%. The track ropes have a diameter of 40mm, the haul rope connecting the two cabins via the drive <b>bull</b> <b>wheel</b> in the [...] upper terminal has a diameter of 19mm and its counter rope 15mm. The track ropes are anchored in the upper terminal and are tensioned by two concrete blocks of 42 tons each suspended inside the lower terminal where the blocks have a leeway of 7.9m to move up and down. The haul rope and its counter rope are tensioned by a counterweight of 3.5 tons, also in the lower terminal. The max output of the motor is 140 HP (104kW). The total carrying capacity of the aerial tramway is 530 passengers per hour (one way).|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it was not}} funny, {{and there}} was no sense in those gawks making {{themselves}} so facetious over it. I tell you I was angry in earnest for awhile. I should have shot that long gangly lubber they called Hank, if I could have done it without crippling six or seven other people--but of course I couldn't, the old 'Allen's' so confounded comprehensive. I wish those loafers had been up in the tree; they wouldn't have wanted to laugh so. If I had had a horse worth a cent--but no, the minute he saw that buffalo <b>bull</b> <b>wheel</b> on him and give a bellow, he raised straight {{up in the air and}} stood on his heels. The saddle began to slip, and I took him round the neck and laid close to him, and began to pray. Then he came down and stood up on the other end awhile, and the bull actually stopped pawing sand and bellowing to contemplate the inhuman spectacle.|$|E

50|$|The lifts {{built by}} Doppelmayr are the Big Easy, Canyon Express, Comet Express, Dipper Express, Gondola, Gunbarrel Express, Mott Canyon, Powderbowl Express, Sky Express, Stagecoach Express, and Tamarack Express. The lifts built by Yan are Boulder, First Ride, Groove, Patsy's, and The Ridge. SLI built the Galaxy, Olympic, and World Cup. The oldest is the World Cup, {{being built in}} 1969. Mott Canyon and Galaxy also close {{relatively}} early, thus their trails are closed too. Mainly high-speed quads make up the resort. The longest is the Gondola by a longshot. Only two six-packs are present, the Tamarack and Powderbowl. Each lift closes at 4:00 PM except Mott and Galaxy, which close at 3:30 PM. The Yan and SLI double lifts have a very similar appearance in chairs to lines, to terminals, to <b>bull</b> <b>wheels</b> but only the <b>bull</b> <b>wheels</b> are different.|$|R
50|$|Once there, {{the chair}} lift was {{upgraded}} and erected by experienced contractors. The drive unit required a new motor, the sheave assemblies (which were {{the cause of}} most of the derailing problems of the original lift) were redesigned, the cable was replaced and new chairs built around the frames of the originals. The remainder of the chairlift, including the towers and <b>bull</b> <b>wheels,</b> was in good order and was erected without modification.|$|R

50|$|A bullwheel or <b>bull</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is a large}} wheel {{on which}} a rope turns, such as in a chairlift. In that application, the bullwheel that is {{attached}} to the prime mover is called the drive bullwheel, and the other is the return bullwheel.|$|E
50|$|Early binders were horse-drawn and {{powered by}} a <b>bull</b> <b>wheel.</b> Later models were tractor-drawn. The {{implement}} had a reel and a sickle bar, like a modern grain head for a combine harvester, or combine. The cut stems would fall onto a canvas, which conveyed the crop to the binding mechanism. This mechanism bundled the stems of grain and tied a piece of twine around the bundle. Once tied, it was discharged {{from the back of}} the binder.|$|E
50|$|The Southern California region {{had nearly}} record {{breaking}} precipitation {{the winter of}} 2004-05. Los Angeles almost broke its highest record for precipitation. In February 2005 there was 3 to 6 ft snowpack, and then another 10 to 12 ft of powder fell. This information {{was obtained from the}} caretaker at Mount Waterman via mobile phone. The first snowfall was before Halloween 2004 and averaged 3.5 ft; in early May 2005 there was still a snowpack of about 2 ft. This snowpack rivaled the record El Niño years of 1982-83 and 1997-98, but in 2004-05 the area was still not open to the public. Stories of long hikes up the closed Angeles Crest Highway to Cloudburst Summit, then onto the buried lodge, are remembered by a select few. One snowfall that year reached the <b>bull</b> <b>wheel</b> at the base of chair one. The top of one was merely a mound of snow with a channel cut through, while the lodge was completely buried.|$|E
50|$|CPT is {{different}} from conventional Transport Vehicles as {{it does not have}} engine or motor on board. Cabins are propelled by off-board motor that moves the cable connected to a Bullwheel. Cabins are gripped with the cable. So, as the cable moves so does the cabin. The detachable types (MDG, BDG or 3S) can be detached at the station. There are usually two <b>bull</b> <b>wheels,</b> the bigger one is rotated by the motor, also called drive wheel, and the freely spinning small one at the other end. Deflection wheels can be incorporated that could alter the direction of cable.|$|R
6000|$|Having got {{the child}} on his back, the animal gave a {{leap into the}} air, and came down so like a feather that Europa did not know when his hoofs touched the ground. He then began a race {{to that part of}} the flowery plain where her three {{brothers}} were, and where they had just caught their splendid butterfly. Europa screamed with delight; and Phoenix, Cilix, and Cadmus stood gaping at the spectacle of their sister mounted on a white bull, not knowing whether to be frightened or to wish the same good luck for themselves. The gentle and innocent creature (for who could possibly doubt that he was so?) pranced round among the children as sportively as a kitten. Europa all the while looked down upon her brothers, nodding and laughing, but yet with a sort of stateliness in her rosy little face. As the <b>bull</b> <b>wheeled</b> about to take another gallop across the meadow, the child waved her hand, and said, [...] "Good-by," [...] playfully pretending that she was now bound on a distant journey, and might not see her brothers again for nobody could tell how long.|$|R

5000|$|The {{scene is}} {{interrupted}} when Panchito and José suddenly spice things {{up for the}} finale of the movie, and Donald ends up battling the same toy <b>bull</b> with <b>wheels</b> on its legs the day before from earlier. The catch {{is that it is}} again loaded with firecrackers and other explosives, following with a fireworks finale with the words [...] "The End" [...] exploding from the fireworks, first in Mexican Spanish (Fin), in the colors of the flag of Mexico, then in Brazilian Portuguese (Fim), in the colors of the flag of Brazil, and finally in English, in the colors of the flag of the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Ichnai {{is called}} a polis in the urban sense in Herodotus 7.123.3 and in the {{political}} sense in a fragmentary and undated treaty between the city and Dicaea. Coins of Ichnaeans, dated to 520-480 BC, carry a <b>bull</b> and <b>wheel</b> with crescentic lateral bars and are categorized to the Thraco-Macedonian type. According to Mogens Herman Hansen, Ichnae {{may have been an}} originally South Paeonian settlement, which already in Archaic times received an influx of Southern Greek colonists. After the Macedonian conquest, settlers from the Old kingdom were added and Ichnaeans may have participated in the Macedonian colonization of Amphipolis. Two 3rd century BC reported Ichnaeans are: Antigonos son of Asandros, Delphian proxenos [...] Dies son of Alketas, Pythian theorodokos. [...] There is also an undated epitaph in Athens of Eurydike daughter of Dadas, Ichnaian.|$|R
50|$|It was {{equipped}} {{with a range of}} amenities as standard such as air-conditioning, anti-lock brakes (ABS), SRS airbag (driver's side), electric front windows, electric door mirrors and keyless entry. A small selection of optional extras were available such as six-spoked aluminium <b>wheels,</b> <b>bull</b> bars, roof rails and privacy glass. The functional interior design included cup holders, quarter pockets, and split rear seats which fold completely flat providing a surprisingly large carrying capacity for such a small vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|The various Kings of the Nagas of Narwar issued coins of ¼, ½ and 1 kakini, from 5-15 mm in {{size and}} all issued in bronze. Designs were humped <b>bull</b> facing left, <b>wheel</b> peacock, trident and various other designs. The Nagas of Narwar {{occupied}} the region of Padmavati, Kantipuri, Mathura and Vidisha around the period of 200-340 AD. In this period there was substantial trade between India and Rome in spices, fabric and gold. Text used was in the Brahmi script [...] of an Early Prakrit language.|$|R
50|$|Quilalí celebrates all the Nicaraguan {{holidays}} {{as well as}} some uniquely Quilalí events. As {{with all}} Nicaraguan cities, they celebrate their Patron Saint. In Quilalí, the Patron Saint is Saint Joseph, and his corresponding saint day is March 19. For the week before the 19th and the weekend afterwards, the town celebrates with pilgrimages to communities within Quilalí as well as the traditional hípica, or horse parade, which is traditionally held the Sunday after the 19th. <b>Bull</b> rings, Ferris <b>wheels,</b> and makeshift bars are all common sights at the Quilalí fairgrounds around the 19th.|$|R
50|$|Period IB: Early Harappan Culture:The entire {{site was}} {{occupied}} during this period. The settlement {{was an open}} air one with no fortification. The houses were built of mud bricks of buff colour in the ratio of 3:2:1. The pottery of this period shows all the six fabrics of Kalibangan - I along {{with many of the}} Hakra Wares of the earlier period. The artifacts of this period include a seal of quarter-foil shape made of shell, arrowheads, bangles and rings of copper, beads of carnelian, jasper, lapis lazuli, steatite, shell and terracotta, pendents, <b>bull</b> figurines, rattles, <b>wheels,</b> gamesmen, and marbles of terracotta, bangles of terracotta and faience, bone objects, sling balls, marbles and pounders of sandstone.|$|R
5000|$|Nagbhid {{is among}} the few places where Mahashivratri is celebrated on a large scale. In the morning hours people in the town go to the Shiva Temple which {{is located on the}} hills on the {{outskirt}} for worship. At {{the bottom of the hill}} there is a fair. In the evening a procession of [...] "Nandi" [...] (10-12 feet tall effigy of a <b>bull</b> on <b>wheeled</b> chariot) also called Nadi Rath, who is worshiped as carrier of Lord Shiva starts from the house of late 'Shri Gajananrao Kamunwar' to the base of Shiva hills (Mahadeo chi tekdi, called locally) and kept there for display for two weeks, during these two weeks the weekly bazaar is held at the base of the hill.There are some festivals called 'Jivti' which might have lost relevance in today's world but is still celebrated in Nagbhid.Dushera festival is a typical celebration where GOLD is distributed by the people, surprised, The leaves of tree called SHAMI, or 'shamipatras' are exchanged as gold on the occasion of Dushera after burning effigy of Ravana or Ravan Dahan, as a symbol of conquer over capital of Ravana Shri Lanka, supposed to be made of gold, by Shri Rama a Hindu deity. The other part of the story is that when Pandavas in Mahabaharta went for Vanvas they hid their weapons on the tree called shami hence shami patras.|$|R
60|$|One or two shouts are heard, {{a murmur}} {{passes through the}} people, and the bull emerges--shining, black, with massive {{shoulders}} and fine horns. It advances a little, a splendid beast conscious of its strength, and suddenly stops dead, looking round. The toreros wave their capes and the picadors flourish their lances, long wooden spikes with an iron point. The bull catches sight of a horse, and lowering his head, bears down swiftly upon it. The picador takes firmer hold of his lance, and when the brute reaches him plants the pointed end between its shoulders; {{at the same moment}} the senior matador dashes forward and with his cloak distracts the <b>bull's</b> attention. It <b>wheels</b> round and charges; he makes a pass; it goes by almost under his arm, but quickly turns and again attacks. This time the skilful fighter receives it backwards, looking over his shoulder, and again it passes. There are shouts of enthusiasm from the public. The bull's glossy coat is stained with red.|$|R
50|$|Writing in 1831, Priestley said:The {{main line}} of this railway commences at the {{extensive}} tin {{works on the}} east side of the town of Redruth, whence it takes a south-easterly course round the mountain of Cam Marth; thence north-easterly by Carrarath to Twelve Heads, whence it takes a south-eastward course by Nangiles and Carnon Gate to Point Quay, situate on an estuary branching out of Carreg Road. Its length is nine miles, two furlongs and four chains; in the first mile and seven chains of which, to Wheel sic Beauchamp, there is a rise of 103 feet; from thence to its termination it is one gradual inclination with a fall of 555 feet to high-water-mark. From Carnon Gate there is a branch to Narrabo of one mile one furlong; another branch from Nangiles to Wheel Fortune of three furlongs and five chains; another from Twelve Heads to Wheel Bissey, two miles, two furlongs and five chains in length; and another from Wheel Beauchamp to <b>Wheel</b> <b>Buller,</b> of two furlongs four chains in length. The total length of main line and branches is thirteen miles, three furlongs and eight chains.|$|R
40|$|Invention {{of oxygen}} {{cylinder}} {{was one of}} the most important developments in the field of medical practice. Oxygen and other gases were compressed and stored at high pressure in seamless containers constructed from hand-forged steel in 1880. Materials technology has continued to evolve and now medical gas cylinders are generally made of steel alloys or aluminum. The filling pressure as well as capacity has increased considerably while at the same time the weight of cylinders has reduced. Today oxygen cylinder of equivalent size holds a third more oxygen but weighs about 20 kg less. The cylinders are of varying sizes and are color coded. They are tested at regular intervals by the manufacturer using hydraulic, impact, and tensile tests. The top end of the cylinder is fitted with a valve with a variety of number and markings stamped on it. Common valve types include: Pin index valve, <b>bull</b> nose, hand <b>wheel</b> and integral valve. The type of valve varies with cylinder size. Small cylinders have a pin index valve while large have a bull nose type. Safety features in the cylinder are: Color coding, pin index, pressure relief device, Bodok seal, and label attached etc., Safety rules and guidelines must be followed during storage, installation and use of cylinders to ensure safety of patients, hospital personnel and the environment...|$|R
