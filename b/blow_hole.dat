5|$|Sounds and {{gestures}} help {{keep track of}} other dolphins in the group, and alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food. Lacking vocal cords, they produce sounds using six air sacs near their <b>blow</b> <b>hole.</b> Each animal has a uniquely identifying, frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature whistle).|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the air forced through the phonic lips is the right nasal passage. While the left nasal passage opens to the <b>blow</b> <b>hole,</b> the right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips. It is thought that the {{nostrils}} of the land-based ancestor of the sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions, the left nostril becoming the blowhole and the right nostril becoming the phonic lips.|$|E
25|$|Pilot whale hunt is an {{integral}} part of Faroese social culture. As the attenders of a grindadráp usually are men, women do usually not actively take part in it, but are bystanders or onlookers. This is part of the traditional division of labor concerning pilot whaling which is centuries old, and has only changed little over time, though the method has changed quite a lot, considering that the boats nowadays have engines and most of the original weapons used to slaughter the whales are now forbidden. It is not allowed to hurt the whales in any way, and the killing must be done as fast as possible and can according to the new grind law only be done by using a new kind of weapon which in Faroese is called mønustingari. Another tool which is allowed and must be used is a round hook, which is put into the <b>blow</b> <b>hole</b> of the whale in order to drag the whale ashore. The whale must be ashore or at least be stuck on the seabed before it can be put down.|$|E

5000|$|Karapeeti <b>blow</b> <b>hole</b> is an {{escaping}} {{volume of}} superheated steam with a pressure of 180 lbs. {{to the square}} inch coming through an aperture two feet by one foot. The guide lit a sack sprinkled with kerosene so that the visitors could see the escaping steam in the darkness and after the sack had partly burnt away {{he picked it up}} on a stick and shook the burning pieces down into the <b>blow</b> <b>hole.</b> These were immediately carried up in the jet of steam and presented a very weird fireworks effect, the sparks remaining alight, proving that it was super-heated or dry steam. This <b>blow</b> <b>hole,</b> according to Maori tradition, has been constant for the last 200 years and the Maoris of the early days of New Zealand used this column of steam as a beacon to guide them with their canoes across Lake Taupo which is six miles distant.” ...|$|E

Different operating parameters combinations, including different oxygen lance locations, oxygen pressures and oxygen flows, different arrangements of bottom <b>blowing</b> <b>holes,</b> hole sizes, nitrogen pressures and nitrogen flows were studied. It is shown that the relative optimum value of the distance from top-blow gun to the molten iron surface is 1500 mm, and bottom <b>blowing</b> <b>hole</b> diameter is 20 mm, {{there is no significant}} difference of the blowing effects found when comparing single ring arrangement with double rings arrangement of 8 bottom <b>blowing</b> <b>holes</b> with only bottom-blow, and the bottom-blow of inner ring is disturbed by top-blow when top and bottom combined blow. Optimized design results have been applied to the design and manufacture of the actual converter, the converter has been successfully used in plant. The actual production results indicate that the desiliconization precision can reach 0. 05 %, the content of Cr 2 O 3 in the slag after reduction can be less than 2 %, better than the technical requirements of 3 %, and improve the recovery rate of the chromium. Compared with traditional desiliconization method by iron gutter and iron ladle, desiliconization by converter does not use compression residue agents and reduce the amount of desiliconization agents and slag, and improve the desiliconization efficiency and productivity...|$|R

50|$|The hun is a Korean ocarina-like flute made {{of baked}} clay or other ceramics. It has a {{globular}} shape, with a <b>blowing</b> <b>hole</b> {{on top and}} several finger holes.

The first <b>hole</b> after the <b>blowing</b> <b>hole</b> is 12 centimeters away, while the other holes continue at a distance of 1 centimeter apart. At {{the other end of the}} flute, there is a non-covering hole called definite pitch hole, making it easier for the listener to discern pitch. The simple construction of the holes allow for very complex techniques in playing the instrument such as the use of breath with changes in the blowing angle for great or minute changes in sound quality, or partial-holding of finger holes to make delicate pitch changes.|$|R
