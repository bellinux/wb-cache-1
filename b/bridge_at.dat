5|$|After {{the closure}} of Dunston Staithes in 1980, the Swing Bridge {{downstream}} of the stations seldom had to be opened.

5|$|Although {{the bridge}} {{remained}} in service for another 21 {{years as a}} free crossing, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission constructed a brand new <b>bridge</b> <b>at</b> the Portland-Columbia. The new toll bridge was constructed in 1953 for $4 million (1953 USD, equal to $ today), but the toll was only one quarter (equal to $ today), like the former price of the Darlington's Bridge. Darlington, who had retired from his job in Orange in 1950, was alive and was in disbelief. The next April, the Toll Bridge Commission went ahead and dismantled the bridge made useful by Darlington, which was fought by several legal actions. The bridge ceased operations on April 3, 1954, being demolished soon after. The covered <b>bridge</b> <b>at</b> Columbia was destroyed during Hurricane Diane the next August. Just before the demolishing of the Darlington's Bridge, the approach on the New Jersey side had been renumbered to State Highway Route 163, which remains in condition from when the bridge was in use.|$|E

5|$|The close {{distance}} between Mill Point and Point Lewis {{at the foot}} of Mount Eliza meant the site was suggested as a suitable location for a bridge as early as 1849. A bridge was proposed for the site in 1899, but its expected cost of £13,000 was deemed too high. Preliminary planning for a <b>bridge</b> <b>at</b> the site finally began in 1947, but was suspended so that a replacement, The Causeway, could be built at Heirisson Island, at the city's eastern end. The new Causeway bridges were opened in 1952, and by 1954 traffic using them to enter the city had doubled, renewing calls for a <b>bridge</b> <b>at</b> The Narrows.|$|E
