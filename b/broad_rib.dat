5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a <b>broad</b> <b>rib</b> (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E
50|$|This {{sword is}} almost {{identical}} to Niabor, but with a hilt resembling that of Mandau. The blade has a convex edge and concave back. On both sides a <b>broad</b> <b>rib</b> runs from the finger guard to the tip. The finger guard is smaller than of the Niabor and is further removed from the hilt. Unlike the finger guard of the Niabor, the Langgai Tinggang has a finger guard that is similar of the Mandau's. Another feature that separates the Langgai Tinggang from Niabor is the pommel of the Langgai Tinggang is always decorated with animal hair.|$|E

50|$|Chlamys swifti has a shell {{reaching}} a size of 65 - 90 mm, {{with a maximum}} of 120 mm. The shell is fan-shaped and it is composed of two valves, {{each of which is}} convex and has a few <b>broad</b> <b>ribs.</b> These radiate from the umbone, the rounded protuberance near the hinge. Beside the hinge are two irregular shell flaps or auricles with the anterior one normally being much larger than the other. This provides an attachment for the single strong adductor muscle that closes the shell. The background colour varies from pale brown to pale purple. These scallops can live up to 13 years. They are filter feeders, sieving microscopic algae from water that passes though its gills.|$|R
50|$|The 1960 Cadillacs {{exhibited}} smoother styling, {{more subtle}} {{rendition of the}} styling theme introduced one year earlier. General changes included a full-width grille; the elimination of pointed front bumper guards; increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim; lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles which encased stacked taillights and back up lamps and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. The long wheelbase sedan and limousine had auxiliary jump seats, high-headroom formal six-window styling, <b>broad</b> <b>ribbed</b> edge beauty panels and trim generally similar to Series 6200 Cadillacs in other respects. The limousine passenger compartment was trimmed in either bradford cloth or Bedford cloth, both in combinations with wool. Florentine leather upholstery was used in the chauffeur's compartment.

50|$|The {{fruit is}} 6-15 cm long and 3-8 cm broad, with five <b>broad</b> {{longitudinal}} <b>ribs</b> from base to apex; it is green, maturing yellow to orange. The fruit pulp is edible, similar to papaya, {{and is usually}} cooked as a vegetable. It is also eaten raw.|$|R
50|$|Rhapis excelsa {{grows up}} to 4 m in height and 30 mm in {{diameter}} in multi-stemmed clumps with glossy, palmate leaves divided into <b>broad,</b> <b>ribbed</b> segments. Leaf segments are single or few in young plants and increase {{to a dozen}} or more in mature plants; segments are divided to the petiole. Leaf-ends are saw-toothed unlike most other palms, occurring on slender petioles ranging from 20 to 60 cm in length. New foliage emerges from a fibrous sheath which remains attached to the base. As the plants age, the sheaths fall, revealing the bamboo-like trunks. This usually dioecious palm species produces a small inflorescence {{at the top of the}} plant with spirally-arranged, fleshy flowers containing three petals fused at the base. Ripe fruit are fleshy and white, though R. excelsa more readily propagates via underground rhizome offshoots.|$|R
50|$|Chlamys australis has a shell {{which can}} reach an adult size of 70 - 100 mm. Like almost all scallops, the shell is fan-shaped and {{composed}} of two valves, {{each of which is}} convex and has <b>broad</b> <b>ribs.</b> The ribs radiate from the umbone, the rounded protuberance near the hinge. Again, like all scallops, beside the hinge are two irregular shelly flaps or auricles; the anterior one is normally much larger than the posterior one. Like all scallops the interior of each valve shows a central round scar which is the attachment area for the single strong adductor muscle which closes the two valves of the shell. The background color of the exterior of the shell in this species varies from yellow to light purple. Like almost all bivalve species, this one is a filter feeder, sieving microscopic algae from water that passes though its gills.|$|R
50|$|Gigantoproductus giganteus {{was a large}} brachiopod that superficially {{resembled a}} cockle. Fossils of this species have been found with widths of over 30 cm. It {{had a pair of}} thick {{dome-shaped}} valves joined together by a hinge. The valves had a small number of <b>broad</b> <b>ribs</b> that radiated from a thick umbo and there were large wing-shaped ears of calcareous material on either side. The valves were held together by a central strong adductor muscle which left a scar {{on the inside of the}} valves. The ventral valve, also known as the pedicle, was covered with spines on the outside. The inside of this valve was rough, being covered by numerous cone-shaped protrusions. These are visible in an internal mould of the brachiopod, a cast fossil which has been formed when a hole in sediment left by the soft tissues of the dead organism was later infiltrated by mineral matter.|$|R

The color of the shell varies from deep brown to purple with a broad brown band, interrupted over the ribs.|$|R
5000|$|Based on body fossils, {{the first}} proto-turtles are {{believed}} to have existed in the late Triassic Period of the Mesozoic era, about 220 million years ago, and their shell, which has remained a remarkably stable body plan, is thought to have evolved from bony extensions of their backbones and <b>broad</b> <b>ribs</b> that expanded and grew together to form a complete shell that offered protection at every stage of its evolution, even when the bony component of the shell was not complete. This is supported by fossils of the freshwater Odontochelys semitestacea or [...] "half-shelled turtle with teeth", from the late Triassic, which have been found near Guangling in southwest China. Odontochelys displays a complete bony plastron and an incomplete carapace, similar to an early stage of turtle embryonic development. Prior to this discovery, the earliest-known fossil turtle ancestors, like Proganochelys, were terrestrial and had a complete shell, offering no clue to the evolution of this remarkable anatomical feature. By the late Jurassic, turtles had radiated widely, and their fossil history becomes easier to read.|$|R
5000|$|Ohioceras is {{characterized}} by a slightly curved longiconic shell with a circular to slightly depressed cross section. The surface is lined with <b>broad,</b> low, longitudinal <b>ribs</b> separated by distinct shallow grooves. The siphuncle is subcentral, apparently orthochoanitic.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the shell varies between 75 mm and 430 mm. This quite rare shell is the largest known in Bursidae species. It is thick and heavy, with a deeply notched siphonal canal {{at the end of}} a wide whitish or {{slightly}} yellowish or pinkish aperture. The outer lip is relatively thin, with a wavy edge. The surface color may be almost white or pale brown and shows <b>broad,</b> prominent <b>ribs,</b> closely adjacent to each other.|$|R

50|$|Cibolaites is {{a moderate}}-sized, {{somewhat}} involute genus, with a moderate umbilicus, that bears <b>broad</b> rounded <b>ribs</b> on the flanks which bifurcate from the umbilical shoulder on larger specimens. Whorl section is broadest though the umbilical shoulders, flanks converge moderately on a broadly rounded venter. which bears three rows of distinct, commonly elongate, nodes. (Plate 2, figs 1-9, Cobban and Hook, 1983). The suture is ammonitic but relatively simple with generally rounded, cauliform, elements. (Fig 14, p.17, Cobban and Hook, 1983). Cibolaites {{is similar to}} the Coniacian Barroisiceras which differ in having smaller umbilici and crenulate keels.|$|R
40|$|The turtle {{shell is}} a complex {{structure}} that currently serves a largely protective function in this iconically slow-moving group [1]. Developmental [2, 3] and fossil [4 - 7] data indicate {{that one of the}} first steps toward the shelled body plan was broadening of the ribs (approximately 50 my before the completed shell [5]). Broadened ribs alone provide little protection [8] and confer significant locomotory [9, 10] and respiratory [9, 11] costs. They increase thoracic rigidity [8], which decreases speed of locomotion due to shortened stride length [10], and they inhibit effective costal ventilation [9, 11]. New fossil material of the oldest hypothesized stem turtle, Eunotosaurus africanus [12] (260 mya) [13, 14] from the Karoo Basin of South Africa, indicates the initiation of rib broadening was an adaptive response to fossoriality. Similar to extant fossorial taxa [8], the <b>broad</b> <b>ribs</b> of Eunotosaurus provide an intrinsically stable base on which to operate a powerful forelimb digging mechanism. Numerous fossorial correlates [15 - 17] are expressed throughout Eunotosaurus' skeleton. Most of these features are widely distributed along the turtle stem and into the crown clade, indicating the common ancestor of Eunotosaurus and modern turtles possessed a body plan significantly influenced by digging. The adaptations related to fossoriality likely facilitated movement of stem turtles into aquatic environments early in the groups' evolutionary history, and this ecology may have {{played an important role in}} stem turtles surviving the Permian/Triassic extinction event...|$|R

40|$|Thoracic form {{in humans}} is often {{described}} as “barrel-shaped” with a <b>broad</b> upper <b>rib</b> cage, a condition different from great apes, who have a “cone-shaped” thorax and narrower upper rib cage. The earliest Australopithecus has been described as “cone shaped,” but fossil evidence for thoracic shape is limited. Still, this inference has been used to infer important aspects of early hominin biology, such as gut size and locomotor capacity. In June 2010, a new skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis (KSD-VP 1 / 1) from Korsi Dora, Ethiopia, was announced that it preserves a nearly complete second rib.
