2500|$|On {{the morning}} of December 29, Sherman ordered an {{artillery}} bombardment of the Confederate defenses to weaken them before a general Federal advance. For almost four hours, an artillery duel took place all {{along the line of}} battle, but did little damage. At 11 a.m., the duel ceased, and the infantry deployed into their lines of battle. Understanding the formidable nature of the Confederate fortifications, Sherman remarked, [...] "We will lose 5,000 men <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> Vicksburg, and may as well lose them here as anywhere else." ...|$|E
2500|$|The September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001 {{was a turning}} point in {{administration}} policy, as Wolfowitz later explained: [...] "9/11 really was a wake up call and that if we take proper advantage of this opportunity to prevent the future terrorist use {{of weapons of mass destruction}} that it will have been an extremely valuable wake up call," [...] adding: [...] "if we say our only problem was to respond to 9/11, and we wait until somebody hits us with nuclear weapons <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> that kind of threat seriously, we will have made a very big mistake." ...|$|E

Putting aside all personal predilection in his favour, all affection and friendship...is he [...] to be shaken off from his connection with sound constitutional men, and forced into the arms of the Tookes and the Paines? We must be sure that the Colossus is theirs <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> a step to make him so. ... I am one of those who feel that one country has a self-interest in the events of another, and therefore for its own sake it is entitled to watch over them. ... France ought to be watched, not altogether on account of the spirit of universal interference and conquest which she manifests but on account of the weapons she uses...; it is not the red-hot balls of her cannon that are to be dreaded, but the red-hot principles with which she charges them. An invasion from these is what you and I dread, and if we feel that an universal junction is necessary in order to repel them, the foundation of that junction must be founded in exclusion.|$|E
5000|$|... "And I don't know {{if anybody}} {{explained}} to her we've got to spend {{three nights a week}} in Columbus. So, how does that work out for you? I waited until I was 48 and my kids were raised, and at least adults, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> the opportunity to try." ...|$|R

2500|$|Kipling {{referred}} to such conflicts, for example: [...] "In the afternoon [...] <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> our sleep, she (the Portuguese ayah, or nanny) or Meeta (the Hindu bearer, or male attendant) {{would tell us}} stories and Indian nursery songs all unforgotten, and we were sent into the dining-room after we had been dressed, with the caution 'Speak English now to Papa and Mamma.' So one spoke 'English', haltingly translated out of the vernacular idiom that one thought and dreamed in".|$|R

5000|$|On its creation, Jagger said in 1994, [...] "'I Go Wild', I suppose, {{is the one}} I play (guitar) on most. I mean, I just {{created it}} on guitar with Charlie Watts, as a groove.

60|$|We United States' men {{reported}} ourselves, {{the next}} day to Captain Evans, the commandment of the Brooklyn Yard, and, after giving in our names, we were advised to go on board the Epervier, which was then fitting out for the Mediterranean, under the command of Captain Downes. To this we objected, however, as we wanted a cruise ashore, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> to the water again. This was a lucky decision of ours, though scarcely to be defended as to our views: the Epervier being lost, and all hands perishing, a few months later, on her return passage from the Straits.|$|R
60|$|For that reason, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> {{from our}} {{establishment}} the natural, human means of estimation, {{and give it}} up to contempt, as you have done, and in doing it have incurred the penalties you well deserve to suffer, we desire that some other may be presented {{to us in the}} place of it.

6000|$|... "Let me go in {{against those}} knights, Sir châtelain," [...] asked Hereward, who felt the lust of battle {{tingling}} in him {{from head to}} heel; [...] "and try if I cannot do somewhat towards deciding all this.

6000|$|There was {{a general}} assent.

5000|$|Seventeen tour dates were {{initially}} announced by various news sources in December 2004. Tickets {{went on sale}} on 10 December 2004. Extra shows were added at the Manchester Apollo and London's Hammersmith Apollo respectively, due to the high demand. Three more dates for Ireland and Northern Ireland were added, one at Belfast's Waterfront Hall and two at Dublin's Olympia Theatre. [...] "We've been itching {{to do this for}} a long time", Kimberley Walsh told press.

60|$|D. Arcos.

60|$|Jill and I {{had never}} seen Aunt Tommy <b>before,</b> but <b>we</b> <b>took</b> {{to her from the}} start because she was so pretty and because she talked to us just as if we were grown up. She called Jill Elizabeth, and Jill would adore a Hottentot who called her Elizabeth.|$|R
60|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> had <b>taken</b> three steps, the Count's quick eye {{discovered}} the lost mouse {{under the seat}} {{that we had been}} occupying.
