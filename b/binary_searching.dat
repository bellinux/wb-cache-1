Cartesian trees also {{arise in the}} definition of the treap and randomized binary search tree {{data structure}}s for <b>binary</b> <b>searching.</b> The Cartesian tree of a sequence of values has a node for each value. The root of the tree is the minimum value of the sequence; for every other node, the parent of the node is either its closest previous smaller value or its closest following smaller value (whichever of the two exists and is larger). Thus, Cartesian trees may be constructed in linear time based on an all nearest smaller values algorithm.|$|E
50|$|For a given table, columns {{fall into}} one of two categories: those which either occur exactly once in each of the records, with {{possibly}} a few NULL values; and those which occur rarely, or which may have multiple occurrences in a single record. Fixed and variable columns belong to the former category, while tagged columns belong to the latter. The internal representation of the two column categories is different, and {{it is important to understand}} the trade offs between the column categories. Fixed and variable columns are typically represented in every record, even when the occurrence has a NULL value. These columns can be quickly addressed via an offset table. Tagged column occurrences are preceded by a column identifier and the column is located by <b>binary</b> <b>searching</b> the set of tagged columns.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose we wish {{to perform}} a query in this structure, for q = 50. We first do a {{standard}} binary search for q in M1, finding the value 641,5. The [...] "1" [...] in 641,5, {{tells us that the}} search for q in L1 should return L11 = 64. The [...] "5" [...] in 641,5 tells us that the approximate location of q in M2 is position 5. More precisely, <b>binary</b> <b>searching</b> for q in M2 would return either the value 793,5 at position 5, or the value 623,3 one place earlier. By comparing q to 62, and observing that it is smaller, we determine that the correct search result in M2 is 623,3. The first [...] "3" [...] in 623,3 tells us that the search for q in L2 should return L23, a flag value meaning that q is past the end of list L2. The second [...] "3" [...] in 623,3 tells us that the approximate location of q in M3 is position 3. More precisely, <b>binary</b> <b>searching</b> for q in M3 would return either the value 622,3 at position 3, or the value 441,2 one place earlier. A comparison of q with the smaller value 44 shows us that the correct search result in M3 is 622,3. The [...] "2" [...] in 622,3 tells us that the search for q in L3 should return L32 = 62, and the [...] "3" [...] in 622,3 tells us that the result of searching for q in M4 is either M43 = 793,0 or M42 = 462,0; comparing q with 46 shows that the correct result is 793,0 and that the result of searching for q in L4 is L43 = 79. Thus, we have found q in each of our four lists, by doing a binary search in the single list M1 followed by a single comparison in each of the successive lists.|$|E

INTRODUCTION: THE GOOD ‘OL <b>BINARY</b> <b>SEARCH</b> TREE The <b>Binary</b> <b>Search</b> Tree has been familiar and useful to programmers and Computer Scientists since it was discovered independently by several people in the 1950 ’s [14].

50|$|Because a Cartesian tree is {{a binary}} tree, {{it is natural}} {{to use it as}} a binary search tree for an ordered {{sequence}} of values. However, defining a Cartesian tree based on the same values that form the search keys of a binary search tree does not work well: the Cartesian tree of a sorted sequence is just a path, rooted at its leftmost endpoint, and <b>binary</b> <b>searching</b> in this tree degenerates to sequential search in the path. However, it is possible to generate more-balanced search trees by generating priority values for each search key that are different than the key itself, sorting the inputs by their key values, and using the corresponding sequence of priorities to generate a Cartesian tree. This construction may equivalently be viewed in the geometric framework described above, in which the x-coordinates of a set of points are the search keys and the y-coordinates are the priorities.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{application}} of fractional cascading in geometric data structures concerns point location in a monotone subdivision, that is, a partition {{of the plane}} into polygons such that any vertical line intersects any polygon in at most two points. As [...] showed, this problem can be solved by finding a sequence of polygonal paths that stretch {{from left to right}} across the subdivision, and <b>binary</b> <b>searching</b> for the lowest of these paths that is above the query point. Testing whether the query point is above or below one of the paths can itself be solved as a binary search problem, searching for the x coordinate of the points among the x coordinates of the path vertices to determine which path edge might be above or below the query point. Thus, each point location query can be solved as an outer layer of binary search among the paths, each step of which itself performs a binary search among x coordinates of vertices. Fractional cascading can be used to speed up the time for the inner binary searches, reducing the total time per query to O(log n) using a data structure with space O(n). In this application the catalog graph is a tree representing the possible search sequences of the outer binary search.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{discusses}} the recent Supreme Court decision Illinois v.

It argues that the Caballes case paves the way for widespread and indiscriminant use of a new type of surveillance known as a <b>binary</b> <b>search.</b> A <b>binary</b> <b>search</b> is defined as a search which provides the law enforcement official with no information about the subject other than whether or not illegal activity is present. Drug-detection dogs are one example of a <b>binary</b> <b>search,</b> but there are many others which are being developed, such as portable gun detectors or software protocols that sift through all e-mails passing through an internet service provider looking for child pornography. Since the Caballes case did very little in the way of defining <b>binary</b> <b>searches</b> and discussing the appropriate limitations (if any) on their use, the Article seeks provide some guidance to courts in evaluating the constitutionality of <b>binary</b> <b>searches</b> in the future. The Article begins by discussing the history of the <b>binary</b> <b>search</b> doctrine, focusing on its application to drug-detection dogs, which up until now have been the most common form of <b>binary</b> <b>search</b> in use. The Article then analyzes the Caballes decision itself, examining what it does and does not resolve about the constitutionality of <b>binary</b> <b>searches.</b> Finally, the Article attempt to resolve the important unanswered questions in Caballes: first, how accurate does a surveillance technique have to be in order to be considered a <b>binary</b> <b>search,</b> and second, how does the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable seizures limit or prevent the widespread use of <b>binary</b> <b>searches...</b>|$|R
