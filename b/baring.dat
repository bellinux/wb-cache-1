5|$|Juárez Celman's {{administration}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in the ratio of debt to GDP {{toward the end of his}} tenure and an increasing weakness in the fiscal situation. The <b>Baring</b> Brothers merchant bank had developed a close and profitable association with Argentina, and when Celman's government was unable to meet its payments to the House of <b>Baring,</b> a financial crisis ensued. Argentina defaulted and suffered bank runs as the <b>Baring</b> Brothers faced failure. The crisis was caused by the lack of co-ordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which ultimately led to the collapse of the banking system. The financial crisis of 1890 left the government with no funds for its immigration subsidies programme, and it was abolished in 1891. Loans to Argentina were severely curtailed, and imports had to be cut sharply. Exports were less affected, but the value of Argentine exports did not surpass the 1889 peak until 1898.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the {{government}} borrowed heavily to finance new projects {{and to pay}} off war debts. These loans were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, {{the government}} received credit for £570,000 from the <b>Baring</b> Brothers {{in exchange for a}} debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which was linked to the price of gold. In 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794, French {{soldiers}} invaded the Netherlands and captured Amsterdam. After the Stadtholder, William of Orange, fled to Britain, the Dutch Republic was reconstituted as the Batavian Republic by the revolutionaries In Britain, William issued the Kew Letters instructing his colonial governors to cooperate with British occupation forces. At the urging of Sir Francis <b>Baring,</b> the Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas authorised a mission to ensure control of the Cape Colony and eliminate the potential threat it posed to the East Indian trade. The Admiralty sent two battle squadrons to the cape on 3 April, 1795, one under Vice-Admiral Sir George Keith Elphinstone and the other under Commodore John Blankett, carrying a small expeditionary force of 515 soldiers from the 78th Regiment of Foot under Major-General Sir James Henry Craig. A larger force under General Alured Clarke was instructed to follow these squadrons on 15 May with troops and supplies for a longer campaign, with orders to hold at Salvador until requested.|$|E

5|$|London finance {{industry}} {{is based in}} the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major Central Business Districts in London. London {{is one of the}} pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance. London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, <b>Baring),</b> this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on both the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) and The Global Cities Index.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine–Chilean naval {{arms race}} was {{extremely}} expensive for both countries. The Argentine government {{was able to}} purchase £4,534,800 worth of ships between 1890 and 1898 with large foreign loans, which were given to them despite the country's role in the <b>Baring</b> crisis of 1890. The government's total foreign debt reached 421million gold pesos by 1896. As for Chile, it was forced {{to take out a}} £2million pound loan in order to purchase Krupp weaponry, and this combined with its other loans led the banking industry to suspend loans to Chile until the diplomatic crisis with Argentina was solved. Both the Argentine President Julio Argentino Roca and American ambassador to Argentina William Paine Lord ascribed the ending of the arms race to the diminished credit of Argentina and Chile.|$|E

High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down {{with an air of}} trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly <b>baring</b> his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.|$|E
50|$|Under modern rules, {{a player}} with a <b>bare</b> king does not {{automatically}} lose and may continue playing. A <b>bare</b> king can never give check, however, and can therefore never deliver a checkmate. (A <b>bare</b> king can in some situations play to a stalemate.) Therefore, a <b>bare</b> king can never win. For example, if the opponent of a <b>bare</b> king oversteps the time limit, the game is drawn. If both players are left with a <b>bare</b> king, the game is immediately drawn. Similarly, if one player has only a king and bishop or knight while the opponent has a <b>bare</b> king, the game is immediately drawn.|$|R

40|$|What is the <b>Bare</b> Particular Theory? Is it committed, {{like the}} Bundle Theory, to a {{constituent}} ontology: {{according to which}} a substance’s qualities—and according to the <b>Bare</b> Particular Theory, its substratum also—are proper parts of the substance? I argue that <b>Bare</b> Particularists need not, should not, and—if a recent objection to ‘the <b>Bare</b> Particular Theory’ (Andrew Bailey’s ‘New Objection’) succeeds—cannot endorse a constituent ontology. There is nothing, I show, in the motivations for <b>Bare</b> Particularism or the principles that distinguish <b>Bare</b> Particularism from rival views that entails a constituent ontology. I outline a version of <b>Bare</b> Particularism that in rejecting a constituent ontology avoids the New Objection. I argue against Theodore Sider that this really is a distinct theory to the version of <b>Bare</b> Particularism that endorses a constituent ontology, and not a mere terminological variant. I show that this, the best version of the <b>Bare</b> Particular Theory, is also defensible against the old objections...|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Britain, and later {{continental}} Europe and the United States, experienced the Industrial Revolution. This was the first time during which production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global lead production, and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting—lead paints were in regular use. At this time, more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. Lead poisoning and gout were linked; British physician Alfred <b>Baring</b> Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas have {{a complex}} set of postures in communication. When afraid, the ears are folded flat, and are often {{combined}} with <b>baring</b> of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. When attacked by other hyenas or by wild dogs, the hyena lowers its hindquarters. Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the hindquarters high. The tail usually hangs down when neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. When a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or when excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as it has also been observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there is a slight tendency to flee. When approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on the knees of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other's anogenital area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females.|$|E
