5|$|Hunter Gordon Walker (Brown), who {{believes}} that Sam Winchester (Padalecki) will one day turn evil and become involved in a demonic war against humanity, escapes from prison. He tracks down Bela Talbot (Cohan)—a thief and frequent thorn in the Winchesters' sides—and threatens to kill her unless she reveals {{the location of the}} brothers. She refuses at first, but eventually acquiesces in exchange for a priceless mojo bag. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean (Ackles) capture the vampire Lucy (McNab), who has previously taken two victims. They interrogate her, and discover that another vampire named Dixon spiked her drink with his own <b>blood</b> <b>at</b> a club, transforming her. Dixon had taken her back to his home, but she escaped to feed. Lucy, still believing that she has only been drugged, is then killed by Dean, as there is no known cure for vampirism.|$|E
5|$|On the May 24 {{episode of}} Raw, Bischoff lifted Michaels' suspension, after Triple H pleaded that Michaels be reinstated. On the same night, Michaels confronted Bischoff {{wanting to know}} if he was {{scheduled}} in a match with Triple H at Bad Blood. Bischoff assured Michaels, but Triple H attacked Michaels from behind, after Michaels attacked Triple H outside the arena's parking lot. Bischoff gave orders to Raw superstars to attack Triple H and Michaels, if seen fighting. The roster tried breaking the fight up, but were unsuccessful in doing so. The result of the fight gave Bischoff the authority to schedule a Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and Michaels at Bad <b>Blood.</b> <b>At</b> Bad Blood, Triple H defeated Michaels by pinfall after executing two Pedigrees.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} value of {{repeated}} blood pressure screening during childhood, and exercise testing in adolescence, for predicting resting <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> eighteen years. Method: Regular measures of blood pressure and other variables in a birth cohort from 7 to 18 years. Cardiovascular responses to exercise testing at 15 and 18 years. Results: The best predictors of resting <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> 18 years were body size at 18 years and resting <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> 15 years. Neither exercise and recovery <b>blood</b> pressures <b>at</b> 15 years, nor the way blood pressure had tracked through childhood, added importantly to the prediction. Conclusions: We question {{the value of}} screening for hypertension during childhood, either by regular resting measures or by exercise testing in adolescence. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|A month later, Jennifer is {{beginning}} to look pale, so she accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in <b>blood.</b> <b>At</b> home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her {{into the woods and}} offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into the woods and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own <b>blood</b> <b>at</b> the site of the leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E
5|$|A year later, {{the band}} decided {{to enter into}} a battle of bands contest, which {{included}} over 250 musical ensembles. The music competition's prize was $3,000 and two days in a recording studio. The band then decided it was time for another guitarist, to fill in some of that empty sounds during guitar solo's and to add to the band for a more full sound live. Through friends, Barrales contacted guitarist Juan Juarez and asked him to join Bonded by Blood. Juarez accepted and he then met the rest of the members and they all liked him as well. After winning round after round, Bonded by Blood finally won first place. The band then recorded the demo Four Pints of <b>Blood</b> <b>at</b> Love Juice Labs in the Californian city of Riverside. With this demo, Bonded by Blood gave people something to listen to and it gave the band an audience.|$|E

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) is {{depressed}} {{because it}} is the first Valentine's Day since he and Holly broke up. Michael donates <b>blood</b> <b>at</b> a mobile blood drive being held in the business park's parking lot and has a nice conversation with a female donor (Kathryn Aselton) sitting next to him. When they both finish at the same time, Michael passes out because he did not eat much before giving blood, and when he wakes up she is gone. A disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it, hoping she will come back for it. When Michael goes back into the office, he decides to gather all the single employees into the conference room to discuss their own personal romantic dilemmas. After becoming further depressed by their sad dating stories, Michael decides to try lifting their spirits by holding a singles mixer. He puts up flyers which also advertise the finding of a missing glove, and Michael hopes his mystery woman will come to the party as a result.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine whether}} {{reactions}} of blood pressure to psychological stress predict future blood pressure. DESIGN [...] Blood pressure was recorded at a medical screening examination after which pressor reactions to a psychological stress task were determined. Follow up measurement of {{blood pressure was}} undertaken, on average, 4. 9 years later. SETTING [...] 20 civil service departments in London. SUBJECTS [...] 1003 male civil servants aged between 35 and 55 years at entry to the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] <b>Blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> follow up screening. RESULTS [...] Reactions of systolic blood pressure to stress correlated positively with systolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> follow up screening (r = 0. 22, P < 0. 01). The dominant correlate of follow up blood pressure was <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> initial screening (r = 0. 60; P < 0. 01 between initial and follow up systolic blood pressure; r = 0. 59, P < 0. 01 between initial and follow up diastolic blood pressure). Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that reactions to the stressor provided minimal prediction of follow up blood pressure over and above that afforded by <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> initial screening. In the case of follow up systolic blood pressure, systolic reactions to stress accounted for only 1 % of follow up variance; systolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> initial screening accounted for 34 %. With regard to diastolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> follow up, the independent contribution from diastolic reactions to stress was less than 1 %. CONCLUSION [...] Pressor reactions to psychological stress provide minimal independent prediction of <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> follow up. Measurement of reactivity is not a useful clinical index of the course of future blood pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} normal values of blood {{pressure}} after exercise {{taking into account}} the <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> the end of the exercise test is discussed. Hypertensives showed a lower working capacity than normotensives. In normotensives, however, systolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> the end of an exercise correlated well with the working capacity. After the endurance cure submaximal blood pressure was markedly lower in hypertensives with a striking dependence on the level of initial values. Systolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>at</b> the end of an exercise test was not changed significantly. Most probably {{it is not possible to}} overcome this malregulation in hypertensives by endurance training alone...|$|R
25|$|Dave Bartlett and Vanessa Hunt, the two paramedics {{who were}} called {{to the scene of}} Kelly's death, have since gone public with their opinion that there was not enough <b>blood</b> <b>at</b> the {{location}} to justify the belief that he had died from blood loss. Bartlett and Hunt told The Guardian that they had seen a small amount of blood on plants near Kelly's body and a patch of blood the size of a coin on his trousers. They said they would expect to find several pints of <b>blood</b> <b>at</b> the scene of a suicide involving an arterial cut. Two forensic pathologists, Chris Milroy of Sheffield University and Guy Rutty of Leicester University, dismissed the paramedics' claims, saying it is hard to judge blood loss from the scene of a death, as some blood may have seeped into the ground. Milroy also told The Guardian that Kelly's heart condition may have made it hard for him to sustain any significant degree of blood loss.|$|E
