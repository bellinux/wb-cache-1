In vitro released studies showed that controlled release of α-lipoic acid was achieved through its encapsulation into chitosan microparticles. The results of in vitro antioxidative activity assays of released α-lipoic acid indicated that antioxidant activity was preserved at a satisfactory level.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{clinical}} {{application of}} stem cell therapy for myocardial infarction will require the development of methods to monitor treatment and pre-clinical assessment in a large animal model, to determine its effectiveness and the optimum cell population, route of delivery, timing, and flow milieu. Objectives To establish a model for a) in vivo tracking to monitor cell engraftment after autologous transplantation and b) concurrent measurement of infarct evolution and remodeling. Methods We evaluated 22 dogs (8 sham controls, 7 treated with autologous bone marrow monocytes, and 7 with stromal cells) using both imaging of 111 Indium-tropolone labeled cells and late gadolinium enhancement CMR for up to 12 weeks after a 3 hour coronary occlusion. Hearts were also examined using immunohistochemistry for capillary density and presence of PKH 26 labeled cells. Results In vivo Indium imaging demonstrated an effective <b>biological</b> clearance <b>half-life</b> from the injection site of ~ 5 days. CMR demonstrated a pattern of progressive infarct shrinkage over 12 weeks, ranging from 67 – 88 % of baseline values with monocytes producing a significant treatment effect. Relative infarct shrinkage was similar through to 6 weeks in all groups, following which the treatment effect was manifest. There was a trend towards an increase in capillary density with cell treatment. Conclusion This multi-modality approach will allow determination of the success and persistence of engraftment, and a correlation of this with infarct size shrinkage, regional function, and left ventricular remodeling. There were overall no major treatment effects with this particular model of transplantation immediately post-infarct. </p...|$|R
5|$|Rubidium, like {{sodium and}} potassium, almost always has +1 {{oxidation}} state when dissolved in water, even in biological contexts. The human body tends to treat Rb+ ions {{as if they}} were potassium ions, and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body's intracellular fluid (i.e., inside cells). The ions are not particularly toxic; a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. The <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> of rubidium in humans measures 31–46days.

5|$|The median {{lethal dose}} (LD50) for acute {{radiation}} exposure is about 4.5Sv. The committed effective dose equivalent 210Po is 0.51µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5µSv/Bq if inhaled.

The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks (the <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a {{median lethal dose}} of 210Po is , or 0.089 micrograms, still an extremely small amount. For comparison, one grain of table salt is about 0.06mg = 60 μg.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{its high}} radioactivity, curium and its {{compounds}} must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas curium itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection. If consumed, curium is excreted {{within a few days}} and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, about 45% goes to the liver, 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, curium accumulates {{on the inside of the}} interfaces to the bone marrow and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys bone marrow and thus stops red blood cell creation. The <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> of curium is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones. Curium is absorbed in the body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of 244Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μC.

Concentrations in serum and urine were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography and bioassay. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated {{on the basis}} of an open one-compartment model. The mean maximum concentration in serum on day 1 was 11. 5 +/- 2. 6 mg/liter, and the time to reach maximum concentration was 122. 3 +/- 30 min after administration. Bioavailability parameters (area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity, maximum concentration of the drug in serum, and urinary recovery) indicated an excellent absorption. No accumulation over the 8 -day period was registered. Cefprozil had a short <b>biological</b> elimination <b>half-life</b> of 58 +/- 10 min and a renal clearance of 210 +/- 51 ml/min, indicating high rates of renal excretion and tubular secretion. Analysis of the fecal flora showed an ecological impact of cefprozil on the intestinal microflora, such as a moderate decrease in enterobacteria and a slight increase in enterococci, staphylococci, and bacteroides during the study. The number of all bacterial species was already normalized 4 days after the administration period. The tolerance of cefprozil proved to be excellent; only a slight and reversible increase of liver enzymes (in two volunteers), mild cephalalgia, tiredness, and soft stool were registered during the 8 -day period.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of metals (especially copper) in oysters {{has led to}} green-color now being found in Chinese estuaries. In the present study, the authors quantified the depuration of 8 metals (Ag, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in green-colored oysters (Crassostrea sikamea) collected from an estuary that is heavily contaminated by metals {{as a result of}} industrial effluent releases. The oysters were depurated under laboratory conditions for 4 mo; the accumulated concentrations and the subcellular distribution of metals were measured at different time intervals. Results showed that the green color of oysters faded to light yellow (nearly normal) after 4 mo of depuration. Depuration of metals could be described by a first-order kinetic process. The calculated overall depuration rate constants of metals were in the range of 0. 008 d- 1 to 0. 024 d- 1, with a <b>biological</b> retention <b>half-life</b> of 30 d to 70 d. The depuration rates of green-colored contaminated oysters were significantly higher for Cd, Cu, Cr, and Ni than the rates of oysters from a less contaminated site, whereas the depuration rates of Ag, Co, Pb, and Zn were comparable between the 2 populations. When corrected for the change of oyster tissue weight, the actual efflux rate constants of the metals (0. 0708 - 0. 1014 d- 1) were much higher than the overall depuration rate constants. Cellular debris and metallothionein-like proteins were the important fractions binding with the metals in the oysters. Significant changes in metal subcellular distribution were observed during the 4 -mo depuration for Ag, Cd, Cu, and Zn. Metallothionein-like protein became more important in sequestering the metals during the depuration period, with a concomitant decrease in metals associated with the cellular debris fraction. ? 2014 SETAC...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of the biopharmaceutical industry represented a major revolution for modern medicine, {{through the development of}} recombinant therapeutic proteins that brought new hope for many patients with previously untreatable diseases. The ever-growing demand for these therapeutics forces a constant technological evolution to increase product yields while simultaneously reducing costs. However, the process changes made for this purpose may also affect the quality of the product, a factor that was initially overlooked but which is now a major focus of concern.

40|$|Sialic acid {{can improve}} qualities of {{therapeutic}} glycoproteins, such as circulatory <b>half-life,</b> <b>biological</b> activity, and solubility. In production of therapeutic glycoproteins, a high-throughput method (HTM) {{is required for}} process monitoring and optimization to ensure consistent and optimal sialic acid content. The HTM is also required for cell clone screening in cell line development. Current methods for quantifying sialic acid, however, require chromatographic separation that is time consuming and cannot rapidly analyze many samples in parallel. Here we develop a novel HTM for quantifying glycoprotein sialylation. Using chemical reduction, enzymatic release of sialic acid, and chemical derivatization, the HTM can accurately, rapidly (15 min), and specifically analyze many samples in parallel. It requires only 45 piL of sample and has a quantitation limit of 2 ptM sialic acid. We validated the HTM for monitoring sialylation of recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-y) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture. The HTM was accurate in monitoring sialylation of IFN-y in batch CHO cell cultures. Furthermore, we used the HTM to {{study the effects of}} feeding ManNAc, Cu 2 +, and Mn 2 + on sialylation of glycoproteins produced in CHO-IFN-y cell cultures. We found that feeding these chemicals increased sialylation from 20 to 36 mg sialic acid/g protein in batch CHO cell cultures. Moreover, a quadratic least square model predicts that the feeding 2 mM ManNAc and 100 pM Cu 2 + will increase the sialylation to 41 +/- 4 mg sialic acid/g protein, close to the experimental value of 35 ± 5 mg sialic acid/g protein. We also used the HTM to study intraclonal variability in glycoprotein sialylation. We found that there was significant variability in sialic acid content and productivity. The sialic acid content varied from 1 to 70 mg sialic acid/g protein, and was negatively correlated with the productivity. Overall, we have developed a novel HTM and demonstrated its versatility for various applications in bioprocesses. The HTM can measure sialic acid content of hundreds of samples in 15 minutes, while conventional methods require more than one day per sample. Thus, the HTM is an important analytical tool for producing therapeutic proteins with consistent and optimum sialylation. by Lam Raga Anggara Markely. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Doctoral {{dissertation}} for PhD {{degree in}} Biomedical EngineeringThe advent of therapeutic recombinant proteins has revolutionized modern medicine. Since {{the approval of}} recombinant insulin in 1982 to treat diabetes, many other recombinant proteins have emerged for a diversity of previously incurable conditions. In these years, the manufacturing processes have greatly evolved, but have also often disregarded product quality, an issue only recently addressed and currently a major challenge in biopharmaceutical industry. Regulatory agencies require now a tight control of product quality during production, which typically involves characterization of the protein’s glycosylation, known to affect properties like serum <b>half-life,</b> <b>biological</b> activity and immunogenicity. However, control of this property is not simple due to its intrinsic high variability and its high sensitivity to small changes in the manufacturing process, {{in ways that are}} far from being understood. Therefore, the development of products of consistent high-quality requires a deeper understanding on the effect of the production parameters/ processes on glycosylation. In this context, the work described in this thesis intended to contribute to this field of knowledge by evaluating changes on glycosylation of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) produced by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells during different stages of process development, namely cell line transfection, serum-free media adaptation and culture. To accomplish the main goal, a mAb-producing CHO-K 1 cell line was initially established, through a novel expression system (OSCARTM), potentially more expeditious than the traditional methods. OSCARTM was indeed considerably faster, requiring about two months to obtain producer cells compared to the minimum six months usually required. OSCARTM did not affect cell growth and reached high levels of productivity (10 pg/cell/day) without requiring the typical processes of amplification. The levels of productivity were initially difficult to stabilize, with a 10 - fold decay observed in the first weeks of culture, but remained stable thereafter for at least two years. Furthermore, minigene selection was critical and seemed to be cell/product-specific. This work also evaluated two methods for the initial selection of the highest producer clones obtained after transfection, based on: absorbance values of supernatants; or mAb productivity calculated using mAb yield determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell concentration obtained from cell counting with a haemocytometer. It was shown that the methodology chosen is highly influential on the product yield achievable in the final process of production, and that the productivity-based method, albeit more laborious, is much more reliable than the commonly used absorbance method. Additionally, the highest-producer clones were evaluated for mAb glycosylation by high-performance liquid chromatography, with no differences detected. Glycosylation was also assessed during the adaptation of mAb-producing cells to serum-free medium using a gradual methodology and supplementation with trace elements. This process was long and highlighted the importance of using proper media supplements, avoiding aggressive procedures (centrifugation, enzymes), and giving cells enough time to adapt at each stage. More importantly, it was shown that adaptation alters glycosylation: in the middle stages, fucosylation decreased and galactosylation, sialylation and glycoform heterogeneity increased, with the first two being positive and the last two undesirable for efficacy; in the final stages and after full adaptation, fucosylation returned to the initial (serum-supplemented) levels, while galactosylation, fucosylation and heterogeneity decreased, with the last two being positive. Divergences between the stages were related to lower cell concentrations and viabilities in the middle stages of adaptation, and to a shift of the growth mode of cells from adherent to suspended. The impact of a microporous microcarrier culture on mAb glycosylation was evaluated and compared to common T-flask cultures. The influence of several culture conditions was assessed, including initial culture volume and cell concentration, rocking mechanism and speed, and culture vessel. The microcarrier cultures led to a different mAb glycosylation compared to that obtained in the T-flask culture, attributed to different mAb productivities, {{as well as to the}} use of rocking and the generation of microenvironments (pH, accumulation of extracellular enzymes) in the microcarrier cultures. Specifically, higher galactosylation and decreased fucosylation, both beneficial changes, and a variable sialylation were found in the microcarrier cultures. Sialylation was more sensitive to the culture parameters, particularly the type of culture vessel, being almost absent in shake flask cultures. In addition to this advantageous modification, shake flasks also led to a more homogeneous glycosylation, potentially due to improved cell densities. In summary, the work described in this thesis contributes to a better understanding of how glycosylation is affected by technologies used in process development, highlighting the need to implement quality control at early stages. By increasing knowledge on this subject, it will be possible to control and improve the quality and efficacy of therapeutic proteins, which will ultimately lead to their administration at lower doses and frequenc...|$|R

25|$|Although {{in theory}} all 18F-FDG is metabolized as above with a {{radioactivity}} elimination half-life of 110 minutes (the {{same as that}} of fluorine-18), clinical {{studies have shown that the}} radioactivity of 18F-FDG partitions into two major fractions. About 75% of the fluorine-18 activity remains in tissues and is eliminated with a half-life of 110 minutes, presumably by decaying in place to O-18 to form 18O-glucose-6-phosphate, which is non-radioactive (this molecule can soon be metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, after nuclear transmutation of the fluorine to oxygen ceases to prevent metabolism). Another fraction of 18F-FDG, representing about 20% of the total fluorine-18 activity of an injection, is eliminated renally by two hours after a dose of 18F-FDG, with a rapid half-life of about 16 minutes (this portion makes the renal-collecting system and bladder prominent in a normal PET scan). This short <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> indicates that this 20% portion of the total fluorine-18 tracer activity is eliminated pharmacokinetically (through the renal system) much more quickly than the isotope itself can decay. The rapidity also suggests that some of this 18F is no longer attached to glucose, since low concentrations of glucose in the blood are retained by the normal kidney and not passed into the urine. Because of this rapidly excreted urine 18F, the urine of a patient undergoing a PET scan may therefore be especially radioactive for several hours after administration of the isotope.|$|E

500|$|... {{deposits}} in the bones, about 15% {{goes to the}} liver, 2% to the kidneys, and the rest leaves the body. The <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> of protactinium is about 50 years in the bones, whereas in other organs the kinetics has a fast and slow component. So in the liver 70% of protactinium have a half-life of 10 days and 30% remain for 60 days. The corresponding values for kidneys are 20% (10 days) and 80% (60 days). In all these organs, protactinium promotes cancer via its radioactivity. The maximum safe dose of Pa {{in the human body}} is , which corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of 231Pa. This isotope is 2.5 times more toxic than hydrocyanic acid. The maximum allowed concentrations of 231Pa in the air in Germany is [...]|$|E
2500|$|In {{livestock}} farming, {{an important}} countermeasure against 137Cs is to feed to animals a little prussian blue. This iron potassium cyanide compound {{acts as an}} ion-exchanger. [...] The cyanide is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to eat several grams of prussian blue per day. [...] The prussian blue reduces the <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> (not {{to be confused with}} the nuclear half-life) of the caesium). [...] The physical or nuclear half-life of 137Cs is about 30 years, which is a constant and can not be changed; however, the <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> will change according to the nature and habits of the organism for which it is expressed. Caesium in humans normally has a <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> of between one and four months. [...] An added advantage of the prussian blue is that the caesium which is stripped from the animal in the droppings is in a form which is not available to plants. [...] Hence, it prevents the caesium from being recycled. [...] The form of prussian blue required for the treatment of humans or animals is a special grade. [...] Attempts to use the pigment grade used in paints have not been successful.|$|E
2500|$|In humans, {{the major}} route of {{excretion}} of most arsenic compounds is via the urine. The <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> of inorganic arsenic is about 4 days, but is slightly shorter following exposure to arsenate than to arsenite. [...] The main metabolites excreted {{in the urine}} of humans exposed to inorganic arsenic are mono- and dimethylated arsenic acids, together with some unmetabolized inorganic arsenic.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> or {{elimination}} half-life is {{the time}} it takes for a substance (drug, radioactive nuclide, or other) to lose one-half of its pharmacologic, physiologic, or radiological activity. In a medical context, the half-life may also describe the time that it takes for the concentration of a substance in blood plasma to reach one-half of its steady-state value (the [...] "plasma half-life").|$|E
2500|$|Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) – a misnomer; it is {{secreted}} by ventricular myocytes – {{is similar}} to ANP in its effect. It acts via atrial natriuretic peptide receptors but with 10-fold lower affinity than ANP. The <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> of BNP, however, is {{twice as long as}} that of [...] ANP, and that of NT-proBNP is even longer, making these peptides better choices than ANP for diagnostic blood testing.|$|E
2500|$|Tritium is a {{radioactive}} form {{of hydrogen}} (H-3), with a half-life of 12.3 years. It {{is produced in}} small amounts in nature (about 4kg/year globally), by cosmic ray interactions in the upper atmosphere. Tritium is considered a weak radionuclide because of its low-energy radioactive emissions (beta particle energy up to 18.6 keV). The beta particles travel 6mm in air and only penetrate skin up to 6 micrometers. [...] The <b>biological</b> <b>half-life</b> of inhaled, ingested, or absorbed tritium is 10–12 days.|$|E
