Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars.

5|$|Academics {{estimate}} that the Court of Chancery formally split from and became independent of the curia regis in the mid-14th century, at which time it consisted of the Lord Chancellor and his personal staff, the Chancery. Initially an administrative body with some judicial duties, the Chancery experienced an explosive growth in its work during the 15th century, particularly under the House of York, which academics attribute to its becoming an almost entirely judicial body. From the time of Elizabeth I onwards the Court was severely criticised for its slow pace, large <b>backlogs,</b> and high costs. Those problems persisted until its dissolution, despite being mitigated somewhat by reforms, particularly during the 19th century. Attempts at fusing the Chancery with the common law courts began in the 1850s, and finally succeeded with the 1873 and 1875 Supreme Court of Judicature Acts, which dissolved the Chancery and created a new unified High Court of Justice, with the Chancery Division – one of three divisions of the High Court – succeeding the Court of Chancery as an equitable body.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court <b>backlogs,</b> it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of its}} {{existence}} the Court was formally led by the Lord Chancellor, assisted by the judges of the common law courts. The staff of the court included {{a large number of}} clerks, led by the Master of the Rolls, who regularly heard cases on his own. In 1813 a Vice-Chancellor was appointed to deal with the Chancery's increasing <b>backlogs,</b> and two more were appointed in 1841. Offices of the Chancery were sold by the Lord Chancellor for much of its history, raising large amounts of money. Many of the clerks and other officials were sinecures who, in lieu of wages, charged increasingly exorbitant fees to process cases, {{one of the main reasons}} why the cost of bringing a case to the Chancery was so high. The 19th century saw the abolition of many sinecure offices and the institution of a wage and pension for the Lord Chancellor to curb the sale of offices, and later the right to appoint officials was transferred from the Chancellor to the Crown.|$|E

He established a pilot program for a drug court under Quincy District Court, which would provide an alternative sentencing pathway for nonviolent drug offenders, {{in an effort to}} reduce court <b>backlogs</b> and lower recidivism rates. He also expanded his office's juvenile crime unit. In late 2000 he laid the groundwork for the Norfolk Country Children's Advocacy Center, based on similar programs in Middlesex and Suffolk counties, and it was fully established the following year.

Differential <b>Backlog</b> routing is a novel routing algorithm where packets are routed through multiple paths to their destinations based on queue <b>backlog</b> information. It is known that Differential <b>Backlog</b> routing maximizes the throughput capacity of the network; however little is known about practical implementations of Differential <b>Backlog</b> routing; and its delay performance. We compare Differential <b>Backlog</b> to Shortest Path and show that Differential <b>Backlog</b> routing outperforms Shortest Path when the network is heavily loaded and when the failure rate is high. Moreover, a hybrid routing algorithm that combines principles of both Shortest Path and Differential <b>Backlog</b> routing is presented, and is shown to outperform both. Finally, we demonstrate further improvements in delay performance of the aforementioned hybrid routing algorithm through the use of Digital Fountains. by Wajahat Faheem Khan. Thesis (M. Eng.)

The challenges in development management are, e. g., that a <b>backlog</b> does not provide a view to dependencies such as a feature requiring another feature or consequences of changes are not visible. We describe an approach towards managing development by analyzing the integration of a <b>backlog</b> and feature model. The integration is based on a correspondence between Kumbang feature modeling and Agilefant <b>backlog</b> meta-models. We describe the analyses that the integration conceptually enables i. e. analyses of development status, feature properties, and <b>backlog</b> order. The utility of the analyses is discussed in the context of change of a feature model and <b>backlog.</b> ...|$|R
