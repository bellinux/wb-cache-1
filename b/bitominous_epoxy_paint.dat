To further evaluate the association of workplace exposure to <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints</b> and respiratory dysfunction, the cross workshift changes in pulmonary function and symptoms of 32 shipyard painters exposed to <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints</b> were compared with 28 shipyard painters not exposed to <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints.</b> The prevalence of lower respiratory tract symptoms was significantly higher among painters exposed to <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints</b> compared with controls. Among exposed painters the mean cross workshift change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) (- 3. 4 %) was greater than the decrement in the non-exposed group (- 1. 4 %). A significant linear relation was seen between % decrement in FEV 1 and hours of exposure to <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints.</b> This study suggests that epoxy resin coatings as used by shipyard painters are associated with increased lower respiratory tract symptoms and acute decrements in FEV 1. Adequate respiratory protection and medical surveillance programmes should be established in workplaces where exposure to epoxy resin systems occurs...|$|R

Sixty test specimens were fabricated from a CoCr alloy. The specimens were separated into three groups (n  =  20) according to surface treatment: Group 1 (Pol) - polished with abrasive stone and rubbers; Group 2 (Pol+Epo) - polished and coated with epoxy paint; Group 3 (Epo) - air-abraded with aluminum oxide particles and coated with <b>epoxy</b> <b>paint.</b> The surface roughness was evaluated {{before and after}} 1000 thermal cycles (5 °C and 50 °C). The surface micromor-phology was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences among surface treatments (p <  0. 0001), but no difference was found before and after thermal cycling (p  =  0. 6638).

In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} of the pavement delamination or slip caused by the failures of waterproof adhesive layer or anti-corrosion coating, the <b>epoxy</b> zinc-rich <b>paint,</b> the <b>epoxy</b> clear water <b>paint</b> and <b>epoxy</b> asphalt adhesive material with good performance was selected for the roughness-adhesive force test, tensile test under different temperatures and corrosion resistance test. The optimal anti-corrosion layer and adhesive layer were selected to increase the service life of the steel deck pavement. The test results show that: When the steel roughness is 60 µm, the anti-corrosion material has the highest adhesive strength with the steel plate. Both the <b>epoxy</b> zinc-rich <b>paint</b> and the <b>epoxy</b> water <b>paint</b> have high adhesive strengths with the steel plate at room temperature. But at low temperature, the adhesion performance of the <b>epoxy</b> water <b>paint</b> is significantly better than that of the <b>epoxy</b> zinc-rich <b>paint.</b> At 70 °C, the adhesive strengths of both the <b>epoxy</b> water <b>paint</b> and <b>epoxy</b> zinc-rich <b>paint</b> adhesive system greatly decrease.

40|$|The {{recent years}} have {{witnessed}} some serious attempts to use wood and vegetable fibers, such as reed fibers, in concrete as reinforcement or as light weight aggregate due to its low cost and relatively high tensile strength. Unfortunately the durability of these materials in concrete media is very low due to the high PH value of concrete. The effect of some coatings on the tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and absorption of reed exposed to media of high PH value is investigated. The effects of these coatings on the modulus of rupture of cement mortar prisms reinforced with reed are also investigated. Many coatings, namely, <b>epoxy</b> <b>paint,</b> styrene –butadiene rubber (SBR), polyvinyl acetate (PVA), and liquid mastic were used.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the case}} of a {{hypothetical}} severe accident in a nuclear power plant, interactions of gaseous RuO 4 with reactor containment building surfaces (stainless steel and <b>epoxy</b> <b>paint)</b> could possibly lead to a black Ru-containing deposit on these surfaces. Some scenarios include the possibility of formation of highly radiotoxic RuO 4 (g) by the interactions of these deposits with the oxidising medium induced by air radiolysis, in the reactor containment building, and consequently dispersion of this species. Therefore, the accurate determination of the chemical nature of ruthenium in the deposits is of the high importance for safety studies. An experiment was designed to model the interactions of RuO 4 (g) with samples of stainless steel and of steel covered with <b>epoxy</b> <b>paint.</b> Then, these deposits have been carefully characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The analysis by XPS of Ru deposits formed by interaction of RuO 4 (g), revealed that the ruthenium is likely to be in the IV oxidation state, as the shapes of the Ru 3 d core levels are very similar with those observed on the RuO 2,xH 2 O reference powder sample. The analysis of O 1 s peaks indicates a large component attributed to the hydroxyl functional groups. From these results, it was concluded that Ru was present {{on the surface of the}} deposits as an oxyhydroxide of Ru(IV). It has also to be pointed out that the presence of “pure” RuO 2, or of a thin layer of RuO 3 or Ru 2 O 5, coming from the decomposition of RuO 4 on the surface of samples of stainless steel and <b>epoxy</b> <b>paint,</b> could be ruled out. These findings will be used for further investigations of the possible revolatilisation phenomena induced by ozone...|$|R
40|$|During {{a severe}} {{accident}} different fission products {{will be released}} from the nuclear fuel {{and some of them}} may eventually reach the containment building. Ruthenium is considered to be an important fission product due to the possible formation of volatile oxides. Radiotoxicity and chemical toxicity of the volatile ruthenium compounds present a considerable hazard during the severe nuclear accident. In this work experiments regarding behavior of ruthenium tetroxide in the reactor containment were performed. Interaction of ruthenium tetroxide with zinc, copper, aluminium and <b>epoxy</b> <b>paint</b> in dry and humid atmosphere was examined. Several spectroscopic techniques were used to identify the chemical composition of the deposits formed after the interaction of RuO 4 with different materials. Examination of the possible re-oxidation of ruthenium deposits to the volatile form by gamma radiation was also studied. Interaction of RuO 4 with zinc, copper and aluminium had lead to different amounts of the deposited ruthenium among the metals. Most extensive deposition of RuO 4 was observed on the aluminium metal. In dry atmosphere conditions preference of aluminium metal was very obvious. Deposits of ruthenium were identified to be a ruthenium dioxide on all metals. Speciation of the deposits formed on <b>epoxy</b> <b>paint</b> showed at least two different ruthenium species. One of them was identified to be probably a ruthenium dioxide, composition of the other one was not fully revealed. Experiments with the radiolytical re-vaporization of the ruthenium deposits from the <b>epoxy</b> <b>paint</b> indicated the release of ruthenium from the samples under the humid atmosphere. In the dry atmosphere re-vaporization of ruthenium wasn’t observed. The results showed how is ruthenium distributed between different materials in the containment. The chemical composition of the deposits was identified with use of different spectroscopic techniques. Dependence of re- vaporized ruthenium fraction on the received dose in the humid atmosphere was estimated...|$|R

40|$|Volatile iodine and {{ruthenium}} {{species are}} likely to be released from the fuel during a severe nuclear accident. Both iodine and ruthenium are expected to deposit on the surfaces in the containment building of the nuclear power plant. It is assumed that, due to the different release times from the fuel, ruthenium will reach the containment at the time when surfaces are already deposited with iodine species. The influence of ruthenium tetroxide on elemental iodine-covered surfaces in the containment of nuclear power plants was studied in this work. The ability of ruthenium tetroxide to oxidize iodine deposits on zinc, aluminum, copper and <b>epoxy</b> <b>paint</b> at high humidity conditions was evaluated. Quantification of both iodine and ruthenium deposits was done by the means of gamma spectroscopy. The chemical speciation of deposited elements was observed with SEM, XPS and EDX techniques. Experiments showed that ruthenium tetroxide oxidized iodine deposits into the volatile forms of iodine on zinc and aluminum samples and higher iodine oxides in the case of copper and <b>epoxy</b> <b>paint</b> samples.

40|$|Nowadays, it is consensual {{that the}} biggest {{degradation}} of concrete happens from outside to inside actions, due to the penetration of moisture, active gases and aggressive ions, by mechanical, physical and chemical causes that frequently act together. A low porosity, permeability and concrete penetration to moisture and gases are the first lines of defence against several deterioration mechanisms.
