50|$|In microeconomics, <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effect</b> {{describes}} {{interactions of}} demand and preference. The <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effect</b> arises when people's {{preference for a}} commodity increases {{as the number of}} people buying it increases. This interaction potentially disturbs the normal results of the theory of supply and demand, which assumes that consumers make buying decisions solely based on price and their own personal preference.|$|E
40|$|The term “bandwagon effect” denotes a {{phenomenon}} of public opinion impinging upon itself: In their political preferences and positions people tend to join what they perceive to be existing or expected majorities or dominant positions in society. It has been most intensely discussed with regard to elections and issue attitudes. Only {{in recent years have}} carefully designed studies succeeded in demonstrating that <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects</b> really exist. However, the observed <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects</b> have usually been rather weak, and contingent on specific conditions...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} voting {{behavior}} {{provide evidence of}} <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects.</b> Some voters, believing that a particular candidate will win, vote for this candidate even though they prefer the alternative.

50|$|Additionally, British {{polls have}} shown an {{increase}} to public exposure. Sixty-eight {{percent of voters}} {{had heard of the}} general election campaign results of the opinion poll in 1979. In 1987, this number of voters aware of the results increased to 74%. According to British studies, there is a consistent pattern of apparent <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects</b> for the leading party.|$|R
5000|$|The {{opposite}} of the <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effect</b> is the underdog effect. It is often mentioned in the media. This occurs when people vote, out of sympathy, for the party perceived to be [...] "losing" [...] the elections.

5000|$|The <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effect</b> is a {{phenomenon}} whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases the more that they have already been adopted by others. In other words, the <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effect</b> {{is characterized by the}} probability of individual adoption increasing with respect to the proportion who have already done so. As more people come to believe in something, others also [...] "hop on the bandwagon" [...] regardless of the underlying evidence.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{question}} of technology choice between two competing IT innovations, research suggests <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects</b> to explain adoption and diffusion of a single dominant technology. However, when neither direct nor indirect network effects exert an infrastructure-specific influence on the diffusion process – {{as in the case of}} German broadband competition between DSL and Cable infrastructures – <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects</b> cannot explain the emergence of a single technology standard. Due to digital convergence and non-proprietary IP-infrastructures network effects work comprehensively for both technologies. Hence adoption patters should converge, when the two competing technologies are relatively similar in terms of performance and pricing. The quest is therefore to identify and measure consumer adoption mechanisms responsible for the continuous asymmetries in DSL and Cable adoption patterns In Germany. By identifying positive feedback mechanisms arising from information cascades, individual and collective switching costs are measured leading to path-dependent outcomes. Results are empirically derived via conducting buying simulations and measuring individual adoption probabilities...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{consistency}} {{property in the}} exchange rate expectation formation process, which all rational forecasts have, but which itself does not require rationality. An alternative test procedure recommended by Pesaran (1989) is applied. Survey data helps avoid the risk premium issue altogether. The exponential forecasting framework provides evidence of <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects</b> in the expectation formation process. Consistency is upheld at the shorter forecast horizon, but breaks down conclusively for the longer forecast periods. These results are supported by Froot and Ito (1989). ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In Gary Becker’s (1991) {{theory of}} <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects,</b> {{a portion of}} market demand is {{positively}} sloped. In this, he ignores Harvey Leibenstein’s (1950) hypothesis that market demands for bandwagon goods are everywhere negatively sloped (stemming from scarcity imposed constraints). A substantial literature now invokes Becker’s bandwagon, also ignoring Leibenstein.

5000|$|The <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effect</b> {{occurs in}} voting: some people vote for those {{candidates}} or parties {{who are likely}} to succeed (or are proclaimed as such by the media), hoping to be on the [...] "winner's side" [...] in the end.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} logical overview of the literature which exploits survey data to examine issues of expectations formation and risk aversion in financial markets. Our survey suggests that: short term expectations are excessively volatile and exhibit <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects,</b> while longer term expectations appear to be regressive and therefore stabilising; in bond and foreign exchange markets the standard result of forward rate biasedness {{is due in part}} to time-varying premia; recent research using disaggregate foreign exchange survey data demonstrates the importance of heterogeneous expectations...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{thirty years}} ago, a classic shoestring, garage-based partnership, {{comprising}} a quiet genius from UC Berkeley (Stephen Wozniak) and an offbeat, charismatic visionary artist (Steven Jobs), introduced their first product to challenge IBM: the Apple I motherboard for the bantering price of $ 666. 66. Three years later, their partnership was worth over $ 1 billion, {{and for many}} of the years following, their platforms held a significant share of the personal computer market. Apple seemed to be doing everything right, and companies, including Bill Gates’ Microsoft Corporation, were extremely eager just to be blessed as a partnering company of Apple. Enter <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects,</b> and fast forward seven years later; Bill Gates is the $ 36 billion dollar man and is buying a significant amount of Apple Computer shares. It is possible that the young readers, who will have never experienced a non-Microsoft world, or ever knew that at one point Bill Gates had only $ 36 billion, will question how this dethroning event could have ever occurred. How can it be that a market-dominant high-tech company with exceptionally superior products and employees could ever lose? The answer will be painfully clear at the conclusion of this paper: the trump card of the high-tech industries is <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effect</b> {{occurs when}} the poll prompts voters to back the {{candidate}} shown to be winning in the poll. The idea that voters are susceptible to such effects is old, stemming at least from 1884; William Safire reported that the term was first used in a political cartoon in the magazine Puck in that year. It has also remained persistent {{in spite of a}} lack of empirical corroboration until the late 20th century. George Gallup spent much effort in vain trying to discredit this theory in his time by presenting empirical research. A recent meta-study of scientific research on this topic indicates that from the 1980s onward the <b>Bandwagon</b> <b>effect</b> is found more often by researchers.|$|E

40|$|In {{this letter}} {{we examine the}} {{consistency}} property of the exchange rate expectation formation process, a precondition to rational expectations and efficient markets. Two major survey data sets over multiple forecast horizons are examined using the recently available null of cointegration test. Experts expectations are consistent (inconsistent) over the short (long) forecast horizon. These results are supported by the current literature and upholds the theory of <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects</b> in expectation formation. As an aside, this also indirectly supports the concept of long run convergence towards fundamentals determined equilibrium exchange rates, i. e., it supports Dornbusch's overshooting hypothesis. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{study by}} Albert Mehrabian, {{reported}} in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology (1998), tested {{the relative importance of}} the bandwagon (rally around the winner) effect versus the underdog (empathic support for those trailing) effect. Bogus poll results presented to voters prior to the 1996 Republican primary clearly showed the <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effect</b> to predominate on balance. Indeed, approximately 6% {{of the variance in the}} vote was explained in terms of the bogus polls, showing that poll results (whether accurate or inaccurate) can significantly influence election results in closely contested elections. In particular, assuming that one candidate [...] "is an initial favorite by a slim margin, reports of polls showing that candidate as the leader in the race will increase his or her favorable margin". Thus, as poll results are repeatedly reported, the <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effect</b> will tend to snowball and become a powerful aid to leading candidates.|$|E
40|$|SummaryWhat {{determines how}} much foreign aid donors provide? Existing {{answers to this}} {{question}} point to a complex range of influences. However, the tasks of distinguishing between long- and short-run factors, as well as differences between donors, have not been adequately addressed. Taking advantage of data spanning nearly 50 years, this paper uses panel cointegration techniques to consider these issues. The analysis provides clear evidence for heterogeneity both between donors and over time, <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects,</b> and a growing influence of security considerations in aid provision. Domestic macroeconomic shocks have a moderate but delayed effect on aid disbursements...|$|R
40|$|The term “underdog effect” denotes a {{phenomenon}} of public opinion impinging upon itself: When at an election or referendum or with regard to opinions on issues citizens perceive a particular party, candidate, or political position to be the likely winner, {{or at least to}} be dominant, they support an alternative that is expected to lose. It has most intensely been discussed with regard to elections, and usually alongside the corresponding phenomenon of <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects.</b> Supportive empirical evidence is rather weak. A plausible theoretical interpretation has been developed only recently. The utility of the concept for more complex choice situations, especially multiparty systems, appears doubtful...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{market capacity}} {{expansion in the}} presence of inter-temporal consumption externalities such as consumer learning, networks and <b>bandwagon</b> <b>effects.</b> An externality leads to an endogenous shift of market demand that responds to past market capacity. Whereas market capacity grows in waves, its magnitude depends on the degree of market concentration. The competitive environment contributes to S-shaped time patterns of market capacity expansion. On the other hand, using a low introductory price, a monopolist plans an initially larger amount of market cultivation than a competitive market capacity expansion. Copyright 2010 The Author.
