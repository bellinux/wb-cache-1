5|$|The {{policy of}} attacking London after the {{successful}} 7 September raid quickly became counter-productive, {{and in this}} matter the Luftwaffe suffered from serious misjudgement resulting from their intelligence service. The crews had been told the RAF was down to its last reserves and that one more assault would clinch victory. This was incorrect which meant bomber crews would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> shock on 15 September. The RAF had been given much needed rest after intense operations by the shift in German strategy. British radar, having been virtually untouched, {{was still able to}} follow the slow German build ups over France long before the first German aircraft reached British airspace. It would give the rested Fighter Command units plenty of warning. Moreover, by choosing to attack London, it exposed the bombers to greater danger by forcing them to fly greater distances in hostile air space. German crews would be forced to fight all the way to London and back. As it happened, all the German bomber units were at least intercepted on 15 September, and were then scattered as they withdrew.|$|E

[...] Reiher cited Goodwin's [...] "wonderful, captivating" [...] performance and the parallels between the Storybrooke and Enchanted Forest stories as particular highlights. In a review from TV Fanatic, writer Christine Orlando stated that the episode [...] "had me {{on the edge of my}} seat and enjoying the ride," [...] giving particular praise to Snow and Charming's chemistry-filled early relationship. Orlando concluded, [...] "Snow White, the character I had the least interest in two weeks ago, held her own and then some. Heck, I was so enthralled by her story that, for the first time ever, I can't wait to learn more." [...] Sound on Sights Ricky D thought it wise that the episode focused on Snow and Charming, [...] "without feeling the need to include multiple stories."

500|$|Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{described}} the album as [...] "their most underrated, {{and on this}} set, its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record". KNAC.coms Peter Atkinson was also positive, saying the album has a [...] "grandiosity and imposing presence" [...] which makes the record [...] "so magnificent". Grave's Ola Lindgren and Bolt Thrower's Karl Willetts both rate South of Heaven as amongst the top five albums of all time, while Max Kolesne of Brazilian death metal group Krisiun remembers hearing the song [...] "Silent Scream" [...] for the first time: [...] "It just blew me away. It was like fast double-bass, fast kicks during the whole song. That was very inspiring for me." [...] When discussing Slayer in an October 2007 interview, Evile frontman Matt Drake stated that while Reign in Blood [...] "was just speed", South of Heaven proved that the group could write [...] "slow material as well". Metal Forces reviewer gives [...] "the band credit for at least {{making an effort to}} try something new and not being afraid to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career", creating [...] "one of the more original sounding thrash / speed metal albums he heard in a long while".

[...] A number of reviewers made some comparisons to the members previous bands with PopMatters reviewer David Powell stating that [...] "Contraband {{is a pretty good}} record of unpretentious rock and roll that suffers from inevitable comparison with the best efforts of its parent bands." [...] He went on to state that while Velvet Revolver's [...] "heritage is evident on most of the songs", Contraband [...] "improves with repeat listening, which is encouraging." [...] Velvet Revolver's second album Libertad saw the band's style change with the presence of producer Brendan O'Brien, noted by Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine. Erlewine also stated that [...] "too often, there are concessions between Weiland and the others {{during the course of a}} song." [...] Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that Libertad [...] "feels both comfortingly familiar and vaguely exotic." [...] Songs such as [...] "Let it Roll" [...] and [...] "She Mine" [...] have seen some comparisons to The Doors, The Rolling Stones and The Stooges, as noted by San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Jaan Uhelszki.

[...] He noted the stylistic similarities of the album to the band's previous work and wrote [...] "There is nothing here to shock or bewilder unless you are expecting Birds of Tokyo to return to their alt-rock origins with a hardened edge. If that's the case, you will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> jolt of disappointment, as beneath Kenny's words there is an astounding sense of positivity - as though one can climb that mountain, fix that bridge or restore faith."

He tells readers to devote two hours a day focusing on how to generate money. The book talks about the importance of concentration on the task at hand, writing, [...] "Focus is a tricky thing.

[...] Trump describes his expectations of loyalty from his employees, writing, [...] "I try to hire people who are honest and loyal. I value loyalty very much. I put the people who are loyal to me on a high pedestal and take care of them very well. I go out of my way for the people who were loyal to me in bad times." [...] Trump cites Hillary Clinton as an example of an individual with [...] "the ability to think big", calling her [...] "a fantastic person" [...] and a [...] "very good person".
