Two floodings were applied, at 15 days after planting and at 45 days.

The five sites located in central Chile belong to one of the following soil orders: Inceptisol, Alfisol, and Vertisol; they were cropped in field conditions with 'Zafiro-INIA' rice fertilized with 0, 80, and 160 kg N ha- 1.

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} using {{the results of}} 82 experiments (78 publications, 266 treatments) to investigate the importance of dietary C 18 fatty acids (FA) and feeding regime for milk C 18 FA profile and <b>apparent</b> <b>recovery</b> of selected FA relative to intake of these FA or their precursors. Feeding treatments based on lipid-supplemented diets were excluded. Feeding regimes were defined as grazing (including partial and full-time grazing, at dietary concentrate proportions from 0 to 44 % dry matter (DM)), forage-based indoor feeding (> 65 % forage of total DM intake, DMI) and concentrate-based indoor feeding (forage DMI ‚â§ 65 % of DMI). Linoleic acid (LA), Œ±-linolenic acid (ALA) and total C 18 FA proportions in milk fat increased linearly with the respective dietary FA content in all feeding regimes tested. This effect was highest in the forage-based indoor feeding. Slopes were lowest for the grazing regimes, especially regarding ALA and {{the sum of all}} C 18 FA while the intercepts of the prediction equations of milk ALA and total C 18 FA proportions were highest for grazing regimes. This indicates that in grazing cows factors other than dietary FA contents determine the C 18 FA composition of the milk fat. At equal dietary LA contents, the type of feeding regime showed no significant effect on LA proportion in milk fat. Milk fat proportions of rumenic acid (RA) and vaccenic acid (VA) were positively related to the sum of dietary ALA and LA contents. Grazing regimes led to the strongest enrichment of RA and VA in milk fat. The <b>apparent</b> <b>recovery</b> of ALA, LA and total C 18 FA (secreted, % of intake), an estimate for transfer efficiency, decreased with increasing dietary content. This relationship followed a nonlinear decay function. When the dietary content of these FA exceeded a certain threshold (about 0. 2, 0. 8 and 2. 8 % of DM for ALA, LA and total C 18 FA, respectively) the recovery in milk remained constant at about 5, 10 and 82 % of the ingested ALA, LA and total C 18 FA, respectively. At dietary proportions below 0. 01 % ALA and 1. 5 % total C 18 FA of DM their <b>apparent</b> <b>recovery</b> in milk fat exceeded 100 %. In conclusion, a general inverse relationship between dietary C 18 FA and the corresponding <b>apparent</b> <b>recovery</b> in milk fat seems to exist. Within this frame, the impact of different types of feeding regimes to alter the eventual milk C 18 FA profile varies. Among them, grazing appears to provide the most variable properties...|$|R

40|$|Improving {{fertilizer}} nitrogen (N) use {{efficiency is}} central to sustainable and profitable grassland agriculture. A plot experiment with a control and fertilizer N (calcium ammonium nitrate, 25 ‚Äì 50 kg/ha N) applied on nine occasions from February to September 2002 was conducted at two sites in southwest Ireland to assess N uptake and <b>apparent</b> <b>recovery</b> of fertilizer N (ARFN). <b>Apparent</b> <b>recovery</b> of fertilizer N after eight weeks varied from low in February (21 %) and March (46 %) to high from April to August (69 ‚Äì 98 %), indicating that high N use efficiency can be achieved in Irish grasslands at these times. Low recovery in spring suggested that N was applied in excess of immediate crop requirements. Note that N uptake and ARFN values from this study {{are likely to be}} somewhat conservative, particularly for spring applications. Over the 8 weeks during which growth was monitored, most (70 %) of the grass yield and N uptake response to fertilizer N were in weeks 1 to 4 after application; however, a significant (30 %) response occurred in weeks 5 ‚Äì 8. This suggested that residual N availability following grazing at 4 weeks can be significant and that there may be scope to decrease N application rates in a grazing rotation. This can potentially improve N use efficiency and decrease N surpluses, with associated economic and environmental benefits. <b>Apparent</b> <b>recovery</b> of fertilizer N was closely related to soil temperature, with a 5. 8 % increase in ARFN with a 1 ¬∞C increase in temperature. Background (non-fertilizer) N supply contributed an average of 164 kg/ha per year (49 %) taken up by the fertilized sward, highlighting the potential importance of soil N mineralisation to grassland productivity.

Additionally, 60 kg P ha and 1 1 90 kg K ha were broadcast. The mean total dry matter ranged from 23. 1 to 29. 5 t ha, mean fresh root yield 1 1 ranged from 35. 3 to 39. 2 t ha, the mean accumulated nitrogen ranged from 168. 1 to 201. 1 kg ha and mean <b>apparent</b> fertilizer-nitrogen <b>recovery</b> ranged from 39. 1 to 40. 3 % for the spot, banding and broadcasting methods of fertilizer-nitrogen application.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} quantitate {{the course of}} {{specific}} cytokine mRNA expression in tissues that exhibit increasing histopathological changes in time in an animal model for the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The development of treatment protocols for MODS requires elucidation of the mechanisms and mediators involved. To devise logical interventions, {{it is necessary to}} collect data on cytokine expression at tissue level during the development of MODS. METHODS: Ninety-four C 57 BL/ 6 mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 40 microg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by zymosan at a dose of 0. 8 mg/g body weight 6 days later (day 0). Six additional animals did not receive zymosan and acted as controls. At several time points after zymosan injection, 6 randomly assigned, zymosan-treated animals were killed, and their livers, lungs, spleens, and kidneys were collected. mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, IL- 6, macrophage migration inhibiting factor, IL- 12, interferon-gamma, and IL- 10 was measured using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: The injection of zymosan induced an acute peritonitis, followed by an <b>apparent</b> <b>recovery.</b> From approximately day 6 onwards, animals started to display MODS-like symptoms. During the peritonitis phase, up-regulation of cytokine mRNA was limited. During the period of <b>apparent</b> <b>recovery,</b> cytokine mRNA expression strongly increased, mostly reaching its maximum at day 9 when deterioration of the clinical condition had already set in. The up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA was most pronounced, especially in the lungs and liver.
