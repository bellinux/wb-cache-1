5|$|The {{synthesis}} of the heavy isotopes 294Lv and 295Lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope curium-250 with calcium-48. The cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about 1picobarn, {{though it is not}} yet possible to produce 250Cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture. After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of beta stability. Additionally, electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, 295Lv would alpha decay to 291Fl, which would undergo successive electron capture to 291Nh and then 291Cn which is expected to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. A drawback is that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.|$|E

25|$|A {{new star}} will {{sit at a}} {{specific}} point on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, with the main-sequence spectral type depending upon {{the mass of the}} star.

A mid-sized yellow dwarf star, like the Sun, will remain on the main sequence for about 10 billion years.

25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E

500|$|Moscovium is {{expected}} to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of an island of stability centered on copernicium (element 112) and flerovium (element 114): {{the reasons for the}} presence of this island, however, are still not well understood. [...] Due to the expected high fission barriers, any nucleus within this island of stability exclusively decays by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and beta decay. Although the known isotopes of moscovium do not actually have enough neutrons to be on the island of stability, they can be seen to approach the island as in general, the heavier isotopes are the longer-lived ones.|$|E

Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice described the song as a spare, suspenseful, violent torch song with a literal title.

500|$|The {{hypothetical}} isotope 291Mc is {{an especially}} interesting case as it has only one neutron more than the heaviest known moscovium isotope, 290Mc. It could plausibly be synthesized {{as the daughter of}} 295Ts, which in turn could be made from the reaction [...] Calculations show that it may have a significant electron capture or positron emission decay mode in addition to alpha decaying and also have a relatively long half-life of several seconds. This would produce 291Fl, 291Nh, and finally 291Cn which is expected to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. Possible drawbacks are that the cross section of the production reaction of 295Ts is expected to be low and the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.|$|E
