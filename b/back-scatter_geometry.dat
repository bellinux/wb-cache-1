Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) transmission measurements were made using a diamond attenuated total reflection (ATR) stage mounted on an FTIR spectrometer. The rather fragile aerogels could only be subjected to a modest mounting pressure in the ATR stage, and so the comparison of the relative strength of a given band from sample to sample was not reliable (relative peak intensities within a single spectrum are of course still meaningful). For this reason, ATR-FTIR did not provide the best means to measure any type of particle concentration; we expect that measurements of diffuse reflectance or even bulk transmission in the IR may be more appropriate, and this work is in progress.|$|R

The diffuse scattering slows down photon propagation through turbid samples enabling higher depth resolution than would be obtained for a given instrumental time resolution in an optically transparent medium. Two types of experiments on two-layer systems demonstrate the ability to differentiate between surface and sub-surface Raman signals. A Raman spectrum was obtained of stilbene powder buried beneath a 1 mm over-layer of PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) powder. The signal contrasts of the lower stilbene layer and upper PMMA layer were improved by factors &# 62;or= 5 and &# 62;or= 180, respectively, by rejecting the Raman component of the counterpart layer. The ability to select the Raman signal of a thin top surface layer in preference to those from an underlying diffusely scattering substrate was demonstrated using a 100 mum thick optically transparent film of PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate)) on top of stilbene powder. The gating resulted in the suppression of the underlying stilbene Raman signal by a factor of 1200.

Non-linear optical parametric amplification gate (NLOPG) {{has been used}} to detect back-scattered images of objects hidden in diluted Intralipid solutions. To directly detect objects hidden in highly scattering media, the diffusive component of light needs to be sorted out from early arrived ballistic and snake photons. In an optical imaging system, images are collected in transmission or <b>back-scattered</b> <b>geometry.</b> The early arrival photons in the transmission approach, always carry the direct information of the hidden object embedded in the turbid medium. In the back-scattered approach, the result is not so forth coming. In the presence of a scattering host, the first arrival photons in back-scattered approach will be directly photons from the host material. In the presentation, NLOPG was applied to acquire time resolved back-scattered images under the phase matching condition. A time-gated amplified signal was obtained through this NLOPG process. The system's gain was approximately 100 times. The time-gate was achieved through phase matching condition where only coherent photons retain their phase. As a result, the diffusive photons, which were the primary contributor to the background, were removed. With a large dynamic range and high resolution, time-gated early light imaging has the potential for improving rocket/aircraft design by determining jets shape and particle sizes. Refinements to these techniques may enable drop size measurements in the highly scattering, optically dense region of multi-element rocket injectors. These types of measurements should greatly enhance the design of stable, and higher performing rocket engines...|$|R

High degrees of structural homogeneity and unidirectional orientation were confirmed for both the A and B form fibers, as judged by comparison of the observed Raman markers and intensity anisotropies with measurements reported previously for oligonucleotide single crystals of known three-dimensional structures. The fiber Raman anisotropies have been combined with solution Raman depolarization ratios to evaluate the local tensors corresponding to key conformation-sensitive Raman bands of the DNA bases and sugar-phosphate backbone. The present study yields novel vibrational assignments for both A DNA and BDNA conformers and also confirms many previously proposed Raman vibrational assignments. Among the significant new findings are the demonstration of complex patterns of A form and B form indicator bands in the spectral intervals 750 - 900 and 1050 - 1100 cm- 1, the identification of highly anisotropic tensors corresponding to vibrations of base, deoxyribose, and phosphate moieties, and the determination of relatively isotropic Raman tensors for the symmetrical stretching mode of phosphodioxy groups in A and B DNA.

40|$|A compact object {{moving in}} curved spacetime interacts {{with its own}} {{gravitational}} field. This leads to both dissipative and conservative corrections to the motion, which {{can be interpreted as}} a self-force acting on the object. The original formalism describing this self-force relied heavily on the Green function of the linear differential operator that governs gravitational perturbations. However, because the global calculation of Green functions in non-trivial black hole spacetimes has been an open problem until recently, alternative methods were established to calculate self-force effects using sophisticated regularization techniques that avoid the computation of the global Green function. We present a method for calculating the self-force that employs the global Green function and is therefore closely modeled after the original self-force expressions. Our quantitative method involves two stages: (i) numerical approximation of the retarded Green function in the background spacetime; (ii) evaluation of convolution integrals along the worldline of the object. This novel approach can be used along arbitrary worldlines, including those currently inaccessible to more established computational techniques. Furthermore, it yields geometrical insight into the contributions to self-interaction from curved <b>geometry</b> (<b>back-scattering)</b> and trapping of null geodesics. We demonstrate the method on the motion of a scalar charge in Schwarzschild spacetime. This toy model retains the physical history-dependence of the self-force but avoids gauge issues and allows us to focus on basic principles. We compute the self-field and self-force for many worldlines including accelerated circular orbits, eccentric orbits at the separatrix, and radial infall. This method, closely modeled after the original formalism, provides a promising complementary approach to the self-force problem. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

We defined various problems that deserved our attention. All of them concerned the enhancement of the possibilities of the PFM, either by applying the PFM to new fields or by making it more powerful. These are the main results: 1. 	Brownian motion in an nonhomegeneous force field and Photonic Torque Microscope We reported how to expand the PFM technique to deal with force fields varying on the scale of the Brownian motion. We also proposed a concrete analysis workflow to reconstruct the force field from the experimental time series of the probe position.

We showed that the force at resonance conditions resulted enhanced 40 times compared to nonresonant illumination. We also reported a quantitative analysis of 20 surface-plasmon-based optical tweezers at a patterned metal surface. 4. 	Characterization of microscopic flows We suggested an approach to microrheology based on optical traps capable of measuring fluid fluxes around singular points.
