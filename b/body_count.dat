5|$|Finally, General Conway {{proposed}} {{what was}} a workable compromise in his opinion: the Fallujah Brigade. Led by former Iraqi Sunni Ba'athists, such as Jasim Mohammed Saleh and Muhammed Latif, and made up largely of insurgents who had been fighting the Marines, the brigade was supposed to maintain order in the city while allowing the US to withdraw and save face. On 10 May, General Mattis formally turned the city over and withdrew the following day. The First Battle for Fallujah had resulted in 51 US servicemen killed and 476 wounded. Iraqi losses were much higher. The Marines estimated that about 800 Iraqis were killed. Reports differed on how many were civilians: the Marines counted 300, whereas the independent organization Iraq <b>Body</b> <b>Count</b> argued that 600 civilians had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{with the}} Phuoc Tuy {{province}} coming progressively under control throughout 1967, the Australians increasingly spent a significant {{period of time}} conducting operations further afield. 1 ATF was subsequently deployed astride infiltration routes leading to Saigon to interdict communist movement against the capital as part of Operation Coburg during the 1968 Tet Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968. At Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength {{for the first time}} in near conventional warfare, ultimately fighting their largest, most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war. During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded, while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by <b>body</b> <b>count,</b> 60 possibly killed, 7 wounded and 11 captured. Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969, Hat Dich in late-December 1968 and early 1969 and Long Khanh in June 1971. At the height of the Australian commitment, 1 ATF numbered 8,500 troops, including three infantry battalions, armour, artillery, engineers, logistics and aviation units in support. A third RAAF unit, No. 2 Squadron RAAF, flying Canberra bombers, was sent in 1967, and four RAN destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|Background Organ immaturities in preterm infants {{may result}} in {{perinatal}} death. One of the diseases is respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) which is caused by lung immaturity. Dexamethasone {{is often used to}} accelerate maturity of infant lungs. Objective To determine the efficacy of dexamethasone on lung maturity measured by lamellar <b>bodies</b> <b>count.</b> Methods A quasi experimental study was done at Perinatology Division, Department of Child Health, Medical School, Udayana University, Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar. We recruited 72 subjects; 36 subjects were given four times intramuscular dexamethasone 5 mg every twelve hours before delivery. Thirty six subjects who did not receive dexamethasone belonged to control group. Infants’ lungs maturity assessment was performed using lamellar <b>bodies</b> <b>count</b> taken from amniontic fluid. Results The gestational age ranged between 28 to 36 weeks, with the mean gestational age in dexamethasone group was 32. 2 (SD 1. 76) weeks and that in control group was 31. 7 (SD 2. 65) weeks. The efficacy of dexamethasone therapy on lung maturity was significant with Fisher’s exact test P< 0. 0001, 95 %CI 2. 546; 11. 173. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, there was significant correlation between dexamethasone and lung maturity measured by lamellar <b>bodies</b> <b>count</b> [OR= 239. 39; P< 0. 0001, 95 %CI 22. 12; 526. 53]. Conclusion Administration of dexamethasone in pregnant women during preterm delivery significantly improves lung maturity measured by lamellar <b>bodies</b> <b>count...</b>|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Bodies</b> <b>count.</b> In epidemiology, this {{statement}} {{would appear to}} be a core proposition, for it is by counting people—in varying states of health, disease, and disability, the alive and the dead—that we derive our estimates of population rates and risks of morbidity and mortality. But <b>bodies</b> <b>count</b> for more than this, for, in their manifest form—in height, weight, physique, and overall appearance (including posture and disfigurement) —they provide vivid evidence of how we literally embody {{the world in which we}} live, thereby producing population patterns of health, disease, disability, and death (1 – 5). Readily identifiable to the naked eye, these aspects of our being not only are predictive of future health outcomes but also tell of our conjoined social and biologic origins and trajectories...|$|R
