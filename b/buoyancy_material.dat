The pressure hull is built of carbon fiber with an aluminum dome at the back end and a fused quartz dome at the front. The fused quartz is a man-made ingot that has taken over three years to machine from a 2800 lb ingot to a 550 lb hemisphere. The dome offers an unprecedented view - {{no one on the}} seafloor has ever had a view like this. The rest of the sub is “flooded” - water is around the components.

Resolving or parameterizing these effects is important for model-ing the oceanic general circulation and climate. Near the bottom and near the surface, however, microscale boundary-layer turbulence overcomes the adiabatic, isopycnal constraints for the mesoscale transport. In this paper we present a formalism for representing this transition from adiabatic, isopycnally-oriented mesoscale fluxes in the interior to the diabatic, along-boundary mesoscale fluxes near the boundaries. We propose a simple parameterization form and illus-trate its consequences in an idealized flow. We emphasize that the transition {{is not confined to}} the turbulent boundary layers, but extends into the partially diabatic transition layers on their interiorward edge. A transition layer occurs because of the mesoscale variability in the boundary layer and the associated mesoscale-microscale dynamical coupling.

We consider here a simple fluid dynamical model which illustrates some of the general principles of subduction dynamics, and suggest an explanation for the observed subduction angle (the angle between the subducting slab and the Earth's surface).

40|$|Theoretical {{predictions}} for the core helium burning phase of stellar evolution are highly {{sensitive to the}} uncertain treatment of mixing at convective boundaries. In the last few years, interest in constraining the uncertain structure of their deep interiors has been renewed by insights from asteroseismology. Recently, Spruit (2015) proposed a limit for {{the rate of growth}} of helium-burning convective cores based on the higher <b>buoyancy</b> of <b>material</b> ingested from outside the convective core. In this paper we test the implications of such a limit for stellar models with a range of initial mass and metallicity. We find that the constraint on mixing beyond the Schwarzschild boundary has a significant effect on the evolution late in core helium burning, when core breathing pulses occur and the ingestion rate of helium is fastest. Ordinarily, core breathing pulses prolong the core helium burning lifetime {{to such an extent that}} models are at odds with observations of globular cluster populations. Across a wide range of initial stellar masses (0. 83 ≤ M/M_≤ 5), applying the Spruit constraint reduces the core helium burning lifetime because core breathing pulses are either avoided or their number and severity reduced. The constraint suggested by Spruit therefore helps to resolve significant discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions. Specifically, we find improved agreement for R_ 2, the observed ratio of asymptotic giant branch to horizontal branch stars in globular clusters; the luminosity difference between these two groups; and in asteroseismology, the mixed-mode period spacing detected in red clump stars in the Kepler field.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{comprehensive}} seismic data coverage, the size, composition and physical state of the lunar core are still debated. It {{has been suggested that}} a dense ilmenite-rich layer, which originally crystallised {{near the top of the}} lunar magma ocean, may have sunk to the centre of the Moon to form either an outer core, surrounding a small metallic inner core, or a complete core if the lunar metallic iron content is insignificant. Here we study the formation, gravitational stability and thermal evolution of both an ilmenite-rich outer core and a full ilmenite-rich core, using a two-dimensional cylindrical thermo-chemical convection model. Gravity acceleration in the lunar mantle decreases quickly with depth. Since the gravity acceleration directly influences the <b>buoyancy</b> of <b>materials,</b> the low gravity acceleration near the centre was explicitly taken into account. Core formation and evolution were investigated by assessing the effects of varying two parameters, the Mg# (density) and the internal heat production of the ilmenite-rich layer. Varying these parameters changes the compositional and thermal buoyancy of the dense layer. Models show that a stable ilmenite-rich (outer) core may indeed have formed in the lunar interior and that its density depends on the internal heating in and the Mg# of the ilmenite-rich layer. Furthermore, the sharpness of the core-mantle boundary is shown to depend on the internal heat production in the ilmenite-rich material. Surprisingly, a higher internal heat production results in a sharper core-mantle boundary and a higher ilmenite content in the core. This is caused by lower viscosities as a result of higher temperatures. Although maximum core temperatures vary between different models by 700 - 1000 K around 2 Gyr after the start of the models, present-day estimates vary by only about 350 - 500 K. Further narrowing of the range of internal heating values is essential for a better determination of both the present day lunar core temperature and its physical state. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

It has stayed in the faint state since. Here we present 4. 7 um CO rovibrational spectra of AA Tau over eight epochs, covering an eleven-year time span, that reveal enhanced 12 CO and 13 CO absorption features in the J_ low≤ 13 transitions after the dimming.

The Hawaiian Ridge {{provides}} a 50 million year {{record of the}} interaction between a plume of hot rock rising through the mantle and the westward motion of the Pacific plate. One feature related to the plume-lithosphere interaction, known as the ‘swell’, is a broad region of elevated bathymetry dynamically supported by the thermal <b>buoyancy</b> of plume <b>material</b> accumulating beneath the lithosphere. Prior studies have examined changes in swell dimensions to estimate fluctuations in the rate at which hot mantle material flows through the Hawaiian plume (buoyancy flux) {{to the base of the}} lithosphere. To improve upon these estimates, we developed a method to constrain fluctuations in Hawaiian plume buoyancy flux from swell size, using a model of the deforming plume head that assumes non-Newtonian rheology, while accounting for changes in the velocity of the Pacific plate and subsidence of the swell attributed to heat loss. To analyze the isolated signal of the swell we sampled cross sections of the swell from modern bathymetric datasets, corrected for ocean sediment thicknesses and lithospheric subsidence. By comparing these observations with model predictions of swell shape, we constrain the plume buoyancy flux over time. Our results show that the buoyancy flux of the Hawaiian plume has more than doubled between ~ 50 Ma and the present, and suggest that these apparent changes in flux are not associated with plume motion. Our method shows promise for understanding the time-history of plume dynamics at other hotspot ridges. Such constraints should improve our understanding of the dynamics of mantle plumes as well as the heat flow and geochemical structure of the mantle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of melting in the Hawaiian plume using a 3 D variable-viscosity convection model outfitted with a melting parameterization that permits calculation of the local melting rate {{and the distribution of}} buoyant depleted residual material. From a suite of 45 steady-state numerical experiments, we derive complete scaling laws for the total rate of melting M and the height H and width W of the topographic swell as functions of the lithospheric thickness zl and the plume's maximum potential temperature θi, thermal buoyancy flux B, and minimum viscosity ηp. Assuming 1500 °C<θi< 1600 °C, the observed values of M, H and W can only be matched if zl≤ 89 km, 2200 kg s− 1 ≤B≤ 3500 kg s− 1, and ηp≥ 5 × 1017 Pas. We study a reference Hawaiian model satisfying these constraints. The depletion anomaly is narrower than the thermal anomaly, and carries 24 % of the total (thermal plus depletion) buoyancy flux. Its buoyancy contributes 350 m of the uplift along the swell axis, and reduces the geoid/topography ratio by 16 % relative to a model without depletion <b>buoyancy.</b> All the <b>material</b> that melts comes from the hottest central part of the plume, and no direct melting of the asthenosphere or lithosphere occurs. Melting occurs both in a primary melting zone above the plume stem and in a weaker secondary melting zone 300 – 500 km downstream, separated by an interval where no melting occurs. We propose that the preshield-, shield-, and postshield stages of Hawaiian volcanism are generated by the primary melting zone, and the rejuvenated stage by the secondary melting zone...|$|R

We {{explore the}} model space of thermochemical convection that can maintain reservoirs of dense {{material for a}} long period of time, by using similar analysis in 3 -D spherical geometry. In this study, we focus on the parameters thought to be important in controlling the stability and structure of primordial dense reservoirs in the lower mantle, including the chemical density contrast between the primordial dense material and the regular mantle <b>material</b> (<b>buoyancy</b> ratio), thermal and chemical viscosity contrasts, volume fraction of primordial dense material and the Clapeyron slope of the phase transition at 660 [*]km depth. We find that most of the findings from the 3 -D Cartesian study still apply to 3 -D spherical cases after slight modifications. Varying buoyancy ratio leads to different flow patterns, from rapid upwelling to stable layering; and large thermal viscosity contrasts are required to generate long wavelength chemical structures in the lower mantle. Chemical viscosity contrasts in a reasonable range have a second-order role in modifying the stability of the dense anomalies. The volume fraction of the initial primordial dense material does not effect the results with large thermal viscosity contrasts, but has significant effects on calculations with intermediate and small thermal viscosity contrasts. The volume fraction of dense material at which the flow pattern changes from unstable to stable depends on buoyancy ratio and thermal viscosity contrast. An endothermic phase transition at 660 [*]km depth acts as a ‘filter' allowing cold slabs to penetrate while blocking most of the dense material from penetrating to the upper mantl...|$|R
40|$|The bottom {{boundary}} layer is an unstratified thin layer above the sea floor, {{separated from the}} more strongly stratified interior. Formation of a thin bottom {{boundary layer}} {{in the presence of}} stratification and a sloping bottom is common, and well characterized by theory. This thin layer is an important source of mixing over the continental shelf, and it plays a fundamental role in several continental shelf physical and biogeochemical processes, such as <b>buoyancy</b> advection, bottom <b>material</b> transport and hypoxia formation. In this research, Both observations and numerical models are used to study models' ability of reproducing observed stratification and bottom boundary layer dynamics over the Texas-Louisiana shelf. Simulated vertical stratification, which is also representing the vertical density structure, was first evaluated since it directly controls the bottom boundary layer structure itself and is important for other bottom boundary layer dynamics. A new metric, the histogram of vertical stratification, is introduced in this research to evaluate the models' ability of reproducing observed stratification in a bulk sense. The improvement in model performance is attributed to the finer horizontal and temporal resolutions of a model, while factors like open boundary conditions and vertical resolutions are modified without any improvement in the ability of the model to simulate observed stratification. Towed, undulating CTD profiles collected during Mechanisms Controlling Hypoxia (MCH) program also detected mid-water oxygen minima in many transects. These intrusions are connected with the bottom boundary layer and follows the pycnocline seaward as a mid-water column tongue of low oxygen. We calculate convergence within the bottom boundary layer relative to density surfaces using the simulated results; there is a convergence in the bottom boundary layer at the location where the pycnocline intercepts the bottom, creating an injection of bottom boundary layer water into the pycnocline. Convergent flow at the bottom, relative to isopycnal surfaces, is strongest in the density classes associated with the oxygen minimum layer. We believe these mid-water oxygen minima are actually intrusions of low oxygen protruding from the bottom boundary layer via buoyancy advection driven convergence, following the main pycnocline...|$|R
40|$|A unique new way {{to study}} low gravity flames in normal gravity has been developed. To study flame {{structure}} and extinction characteristics in low stretch environments, a normal gravity low-stretch diffusion flame is generated using a cylindrical PMMA sample of varying large radii. Foutch and T'ien used the radiative loss {{as well as a}} densimetric Froude number to characterize the blowoff (small Da) and quenching extinction (large Da) boundaries in stagnation-point diffusion flames under various convective conditions. An important conclusion of this study was that the shape and location of the extinction boundary, {{as well as a number}} of important flame characteristics, were almost identical for the buoyant, forced, and mixed convective environments they modeled. This theory indicates it should be possible to understand a material's burning characteristics in the low stretch environment of spacecraft (induced by fans and crew movements) by understanding its burning characteristics in an equivalent Earth-based stretch environment (induced by normal gravity <b>buoyancy).</b> Similarly, the <b>material's</b> burning characteristics in Lunar or Martian stretch environments (induced by partial gravity buoyancy) can be assessed. Equivalent stretch rates can be determined as a function of gravity, imposed flow, and geometry. A generalized expression for stretch rate which captures mixed convection includes both buoyant and forced stretch is defined as a = a(sub f) ((1 + (a(sub b)) exp 2 /(a(sub b)) exp 2)) exp 1 / 2. For purely buoyant flow, the equivalent stretch rate is a(sub b) = [(rho(exp e) -rho(exp *) /rho(sub e) ][g/R](exp 1 / 2). For purely forced flow, the equivalent stretch rate is characterized by either a(sub f) = 2 U(sub infinity) /R for a cylinder, or a(sub f) =U(sub jet) /d(sub jet) for a jet impinging on a planar surface. In these experiments, the buoyant stretch is varied through R, the radius of curvature, but the buoyant stretch could also be varied through g, the gravity level. In this way the effect of partial gravity, such as those found on the Moon (1 / 6 g) or Mars (1 / 3 g) can be captured in the definition of flame stretch...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{continental}} {{crust is}} primarily produced in subduction zone settings, where slab dehydration induces melting of the peridotitic mantle wedge. Mantle melting produces Mg-rich basalt (~ 50 wt. % SiO 2, ~ 8 wt. % MgO). The average {{composition of the}} continents is far too Si-rich and Mg-poor (55 – 65 wt. % SiO 2, 2 – 5 wt. % MgO) to have been derived from peridotite melting directly. Continental crust production therefore requires an additional differentiation stage to generate andesite from a basaltic source. This thesis investigates two processes by which density sorting can evolve more felsic compositions in the upper plate of subduction zones: delamination and relamination. Garnet pyroxenite xenoliths from central Arizona indicate significant fractionation occurs in the lower crust of continental arcs. Crystallization of mafic minerals from primary basalt drives the derivative liquids toward felsic compositions, resulting in the accumulation of dense, mafic cumulate minerals in the lower crust. On average 8 % denser than the underlying mantle, this layer is expected to delaminate {{from the base of}} the crust and recycle back into the mantle. Preferential removal of mafic material will drive continental crust toward more felsic compositions, providing a simple explanation to the continental crust paradox. Comparisons with seismic profiles indicate that lower crustal delamination has occurred in the Basin and Range Province and along the edges of the Colorado Plateau of western North America. A second explanation for the andesitic composition of the continents arises when considering density sorting of subducted material. During subduction, material of all compositions enters the trench, however <b>buoyancy</b> controls what <b>material</b> is subducted and what returns to the surface. A compilation of high pressure–low temperature metamorphic terranes reveals that material exhumes in subduction zones in a predictable way. Oceanic-type terranes exhume from pressures less than 2. 8 GPa, to be exposed near the subduction trench, whereas continental-type terranes return from greater pressures, and are exposed far inland of the trench. These observations suggest oceanic-type terranes exhume via channel flow within an inclined subduction channel and continental-type terranes exhume vertically through the mantle wedge via diapirism. Modeling of buoyancy-driven flow helps to predict where the transition from channel flow to diapirism occurs along the slab-mantle interface. Additionally, heat diffusion calculations predict that diapirs will undergo partial melting, suggesting they may buoyantly rise to relaminate to the base of the crust. Preferential sequestration of buoyant, felsic materials in the upper plate via relamination may drive continental crust toward more felsic compositions...|$|R

Perpendicular to the strike of the Hikurangi margin, this interface increases in depth from 16 - 33 km {{with an increase in}} dip of 5. 4 ° beneath Featherston to 19 ° beneath central Wanganui Basin. P-wave velocities range between 5. 8 - 6. 5 kms-¹ in the upper ~ 18 km of the crust within Wanganui Basin. These are interpreted to represent mid and lower-crustal rocks that have been emplaced in the upper crust by exhumation during the Miocene. In the lower crust P-wave velocities are inferred as 6. 5 - 6. 85 kms- 1 sub-parallel and 6. 5 - 6. 65 kms-¹ perpendicular to Hikurangi margin, suggesting a lower crustal P-wave anisotropy of up to ~ 3 % This may reflect the preferential alignment of mineral fabrics in the direction of relative transpressive plate motion during the Neogene and/or structural anisotropy parallel to the strike of the Taranaki Fault Zone and Kapiti-Manawatu Fault System. The structure of the Pacific plate crust is resolved as two layers. The top layer is inferred as a low-velocity sediment sheet with a P-wave velocity of 5. 00 - 5. 20 kms-¹ and thickness of 1. 5 - 3. 5 km. The second layer is interpreted as 9. 5 - 10 km thick oceanic crust with P-wave velocities between 6. 7 and 7. 2 kms-¹. This confirms that anomalously thick (up to 13. 5 km) Hikurangi Plateau crust has subducted at least as far east as the Tararua Ranges. Subducted sediment appears to be pooling beneath the western side of North Island between Featherston and Kapiti Island, reaching a maximum thickness of 3. 5 km. Rock uplift driven by the relative <b>buoyancy</b> of this <b>material</b> is capable of explaining the average elevation of the Tararua Ranges and coupled with previous studies from the Raukumara Basin in the north, suggest accretion of subducted sediment to the overlying plate may be characteristic of the entire Hikurangi margin...|$|R
