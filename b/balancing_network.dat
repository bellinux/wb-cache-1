40|$|Abstract. <b>Balancing</b> <b>networks</b> {{are highly}} {{distributed}} data structures used to solve multiprocessor synchronization problems. Typically, <b>balancing</b> <b>networks</b> are accessed by tokens, {{and the distribution}} of the tokens on the network’s output specify the property of the network. However, tokens represent increment operations only, and tokens alone are not adequate for synchronization problems that require decrement operations. For such kinds of problems, antitokens have been used to represent decrement operations. It has been shown that several kinds of <b>balancing</b> <b>networks</b> which satisfy the step property, smoothing property, and the threshold property for tokens alone, preserve their properties even when antitokens are introduced. A fundamental question that was left open was to characterize all the properties of <b>balancing</b> <b>networks</b> which are preserved under the introduction of antitokens. In this work, we provide such a simple combinatorial characterization for all the properties which are preserved when antitokens are introduced. ...|$|R

While mean-field theories of spatially homogeneous <b>balanced</b> <b>networks</b> are well understood, a mean-field analysis of spatially heterogeneous <b>balanced</b> <b>networks</b> {{has not been}} fully developed. We extend the analysis of <b>balanced</b> <b>networks</b> to include a connection probability {{that depends on the}} spatial separation between neurons. In the continuum limit, we derive that stable, balanced firing rate solutions require that the spatial spread of external inputs be broader than that of recurrent excitation, which in turn must be broader than or equal to that of recurrent inhibition. Notably, this implies that network models with broad recurrent inhibition are inconsistent with the balanced state. For finite size networks, we investigate the pattern-forming dynamics arising when balanced conditions are not satisfied. Our study highlights the new challenges that <b>balanced</b> <b>networks</b> pose for the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex systems...|$|R
50|$|Good {{cancellation}} {{depends upon}} the <b>balancing</b> <b>network</b> having a frequency-vs.-impedance characteristic that accurately matches the line. Since telephone line impedances vary depending upon many factors and the relationship is not always smooth, analog hybrids are able to achieve only a few dB of guaranteed isolation. For this reason, modern hybrids use digital signal processing to implement an adaptive least mean squares filter that automatically detects the line's impedance across the voice frequency range and adjusts to it. These may reach greater than 30 dB trans-hybrid loss, measured with white noise as the send signal.|$|E

To evaluate the impact of both input and output noise, we determine the robustness of single-neuron stimulus selective responses, {{as well as the}} robustness of attractor states of networks of neurons performing memory tasks.
