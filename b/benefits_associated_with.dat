5|$|Mainstream opinion {{reflects}} {{the function of}} identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many <b>benefits</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to {{the players and the}} team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health <b>benefits</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
40|$|When used in {{conjunction}} with surface water for irrigation, groundwater serves two roles: to increase water supply; and to mitigate fluctuations in the supply of water. The later is the buffer role. This paper identifies and evaluates the economic <b>benefit</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the buffer role of ground water. Implications for the development of groundwater resources are investigated. An estimate is given of the buffer benefit to wheat growers of the fossil water aquifer underlying the Israeli Negev.

5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other <b>benefits</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E

25|$|Low solids (wet) digesters can {{transport}} material {{through the}} system using standard pumps that require significantly lower energy input. Low solids digesters require a larger amount of land than high solids due to the increased volumes associated with the increased liquid-to-feedstock ratio of the digesters. There are <b>benefits</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> operation in a liquid environment, as it enables more thorough circulation of materials and contact between the bacteria and their food.

25|$|Circular {{migration}} or repeat {{migration is}} the temporary and usually repetitive movement of a migrant worker {{between home and}} host areas, typically {{for the purpose of}} employment. It represents an established pattern of population mobility, whether cross-country or rural-urban. There are several <b>benefits</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> this migration pattern, including gains in financial capital, human capital, and social capital. There also costs associated with circular migration, such as brain drain, poor working conditions, forced labor, and the inability to transfer acquired skills to home economies. Socially, there are strong connections to gender, health outcomes, development, poverty, and global immigration policy.|$|E
25|$|Most of the <b>benefits</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> lees contact {{deals with}} the {{influence}} on the wine of the mannoproteins released during the autolysis of the yeast cells.

Not only does the release of mannoproteins impart sensory changes in the wine but they can contribute to tartrate and protein stability, help enhance the body and mouthfeel of the wine as well as decrease the perception of bitterness and astringency of tannins.|$|E

25|$|Females {{are capable}} of {{producing}} alarm pheromones to avoid multiple mating, but they generally do not do so. Two reasons are proposed as to why females do not release alarm pheromones to protect themselves. First, alarm pheromone production is costly. Due to egg production, females may refrain from spending additional energy on alarm pheromones. The second proposed reason is that releasing the alarm pheromone reduces the <b>benefits</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> multiple mating. Benefits of multiple mating include material benefits, better quality nourishment or more nourishment, genetic benefits including increased fitness of offspring, and finally, the cost of resistance may be higher than the benefit of consent—which appears the case in C. lectularius.|$|E
25|$|Grapefruit seed extract {{has been}} {{advocated}} to {{be a powerful}} antimicrobial with proven activity against bacteria and fungi.

Although citrus seed extract is claimed to be a highly effective plant-based preservative by some natural personal care manufacturers, studies asserted that the universal antimicrobial <b>benefits</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> GSE are merely from the presence of synthetic preservatives. Natural GSE has no antimicrobial properties. Newer studies found many commercial grapefruit seed extracts contaminated with synthetic preservatives.

In a 2008 study synthetic disinfectants such as benzethonium or benzalkonium chloride were identified in most of the commercial GSE products. In a 2008 study suspected counterfeit products were determined to contain benzethonium chloride in grapefruit seed extract samples.|$|E
25|$|Many controversies {{surround}} {{the development and}} release of genetically modified foods, ranging from human safety and environmental impacts to ethical concerns such as corporate control of the food supply and intellectual property rights. The brinjal is an important food crop for India, and the potential commercialization of a genetically modified variety has drawn support and criticism. Although {{it is a major}} food crop in India, brinjal production is relatively low with fruit and shoot borer infestation a major constraint to yield. Proponents of the technology believe the Bt brinjal will have positive effects for the Indian economy and the health of the farmers. Field trials conducted on research-managed farms carried out by Mahyco and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research suggested a 42% pesticide reduction and a doubling of the yield was possible.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{untreated}} roughages on digestibility and rumen fill of the gut was reviewed as physical mechanism influencing {{the regulation of}} roughage intake.
