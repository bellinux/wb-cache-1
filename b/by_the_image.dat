Hergé used his brother, Paul Remi, as the model for Sponsz, although he was also influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the Austrian American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim.|$|E
5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs {{her to keep}} her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side}} of the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, under the {{influence}} of the United States where photography had become an academic discipline, exhibitions such as New American Photography in Copenhagen's Bella Center presented top artistic photographers of the 1950s and 1960s including Harry Callahan, Jerry Uelsmann and Diane Arbus. This was followed in 1973 by the opening of Galleriet for Creativ Fotografi (Gallery for Creative Photography) in Copenhagen, to be followed in 1977 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMAGE</b> gallery in Aarhus which encouraged experimental photography. Subsequent exhibitions involved the landscape photographer Kirsten Klein, the pioneers of staged photography Nanna Bisp Büchert and Lis Steincke, as well as the magic realist Per Bak Jensen.|$|E

5|$|It {{should be}} born {{in mind that the}} {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections. It is usual to provide half half-sections at the ends of the filter with m = 0.6 as this value gives the flattest Zi in the passband and hence the best match in to a resistive termination.|$|E

5|$|The {{characterization}} of Neville Sinclair {{was inspired by}} movie star Errol Flynn, or rather <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous process of writing and re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|E

5|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} two films. The first would become The Cat Returns and the second was an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Howl's Moving Castle. A rumor persists that Miyazaki had an idea to do Howl's Moving Castle {{during a visit to}} Strasbourg Christmas market. Toshio Suzuki, who produced Howl's Moving Castle, stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of a castle moving around the countryside. The novel does not explain how the castle moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the castle might move, which led to the image of a castle on chicken legs. The complex moving castle changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to Howl's eccentricity and the various situations. The basic structure of the castle consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.|$|E
5|$|William and Peter safely land in Jacksonville, and Peter directs them to {{find the}} home among the {{military}} housing where Olivia stayed at as a child, marked by a red-painted door by her birth-father. Once there, Peter finds the adult Olivia waiting for him, but realizes by her eyes {{that this is not}} her. A younger Olivia reveals herself as Olivia's true ego; assured of Peter's identity, she willingly goes with him and Bell. However, they are attacked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of her step-father and several military personnel. Peter sacrifices himself to protect her, waking back up in the real world. Olivia is able to stand up against her past fears and stops their advance. William explains that she will be able to return to possession of her body as Walter, in the real world, attempts to extract William's mind.|$|E
