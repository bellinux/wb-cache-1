5|$|Municipalities in Rhode Island can {{incorporate}} as a town or city {{by a special}} act of the state legislature {{and there is no}} minimum population requirement. Eight municipalities were reincorporated as cities operating under a charter, while the other thirtyone remain as towns which perform similar services. Since Rhode Island has no county level of government, cities and towns provide services commonly performed by county governments in other states. Rhode Island's cities and towns may adopt one of four different forms of government: councilmanager, mayorcouncil, town counciltown meeting, or administratorcouncil. The primary difference between these forms of government is how the chief executive is selected. The Councilmanager system involves an elected council who exercise overall control of the local government and a chief executive termed city or town manager who is generally appointed by and responsible to the council for the administration of local policies. Councilmanager systems may elect a mayor <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> formal administrative functions with the potential exception of a degree of veto power. Mayorcouncil systems have a similarly elected council however the mayor is elected and yields administrative power. In the town counciltown meeting system, there is no fulltime chief executive. There are no towns or cities in Rhode Island that use the administratorcouncil form of government.|$|E

25|$|Gold rounds {{look exactly}} like gold coins <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{currency}} value. They range in similar sizes as gold coins {{and come in}} 0.05 troy ounce {{all the way up}} to 1 troy ounce. Unlike gold coins, gold rounds have no additional metals added to them for durability purposes and do not have to be made by a government mint, which allows the gold rounds to have a lower overhead price as compared to gold coins. On the other hand, gold rounds are not as collectible as gold coins.|$|E
25|$|A person's mental {{content is}} in fact {{isolated}} from others'. This isolation can be represented by a wheel-shaped compound, each wedge-shaped sector of which is an environment (a brain) bounded by two spokes {{and part of the}} circumference (right). They all contain differing amounts and types of plants, rocks, water, etc. (repertoire members). The wheel's hub has machinery that can deliver sheets of paper between sectors (communication). People use it to exchange crude blueprints (signals) for making tools, shelters, foods, etc., <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other contact whatsoever, and know of others' existence by inferences based on these blueprints.|$|E
25|$|For a 6to4 host to have {{fast and}} {{reliable}} connectivity {{with a host}} natively using the IPv6 Internet, both the 6to4 host and the native IPv6 host must have a route to a fast, reliable and correctly configured relay server. The 6to4 host's ISP can ensure that outgoing packets go to such a relay, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> control over the relay used for the responses from the native IPv6 host. A variant called IPv6 rapid deployment ("6rd") uses the same basic principles as 6to4 but uses a relay operated by the 6rd user's ISP for traffic in both directions. To achieve this an address block allocated by the user's ISP is used instead of 2002::/16.|$|E

25|$|The QAPF diagram {{has four}} {{minerals}} or mineral groups chosen as important cornerstones of the classification. These are quartz (Q), Alkali feldspars (A), plagioclase feldspars (P), and feldspathoids (F). F and Q for chemical reasons {{can not exist}} together in one plutonic rock. Other minerals may and almost certainly occur in these rocks as well <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> significance in this classification scheme. So, the whole diagram is actually composed of two ternary plots (QAP and FAP). To use the classification, the concentration (the mode) of these minerals must be known and recalculated to make their sum 100%. For example: a plutonic rock that contains no alkali feldspar and no feldspathoids but contains lots of pyroxenes (neglected in this diagram), plagioclase feldspar and few quartz grains is probably gabbro (located at the right edge of the diagram, near P). This diagram does not determine whether a rock is gabbro, diorite, or anorthosite. There are another criteria used to decide that. Note that this diagram is not used for all plutonic rocks. Ultramafic rocks {{are the most important}} plutonic rocks that have separate classification diagrams.|$|E

2500|$|A {{range of}} further medieval bronze doors {{followed}} the Bernward Doors, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> clear connection with Hildesheim. The idea of casting the whole door {{from a single}} mold did not catch on - the most important metal doors are composed of a wooden frame with bronze panels inserted. One of the Gniezno Doors, made for Poland in about 1175, is also a single piece casting, but artistically much less sophisticated. [...] This apparently proved too difficult, and for the other door 24 cast panels were soldered together. For the western doors of St. Paulus in Worms, in 1881, the sculptor [...] created a detailed replica of the Bernward Doors; unlike the original, these were made of cast iron and for reasons of space, the two highest images (the creation of Adam and the Ascension of Christ!) were not included. [...] The Renaissance Florence Baptistery doors are the most famous doors in the tradition Bernward {{played an important role}} in reviving.|$|E
2500|$|Shanties are work {{songs and}} were {{originally}} sung only for work. However, sailors also sang for {{pleasure in the}} fo'c's'le (forecastle) where they slept or, in fine weather, gathered near the fore bitts (large posts on the foredeck). While songs with maritime themes were sung, all manner of popular songs and ballads on any subject might be sung off watch. The leisure songs associated with sailors are labeled simply as [...] "sea songs," [...] <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> consistent formal characteristics. They are also popularly known among enthusiasts, especially when distinguishing them from shanties, as fo'c's'le songs or forebitters.

2500|$|In summer 1965, {{the first}} {{close-up}} pictures from Mars showed a cratered desert with {{no signs of}} water. However, over the decades, as more parts of the planet were imaged with better cameras on more sophisticated satellites, Mars showed evidence of past river valleys, lakes, and ice in glaciers and in the ground. It was discovered that the climate of Mars displays huge changes over geologic time because its axis is not stabilized by a large moon, as Earth's is. cycles: [...] A general circulation model study with simplified volatile schemes. J. Geophys. Res. 108. (E6). 5062. Also, some researchers maintain that water could exist for periods of time due to geothermal effects or asteroid impacts. One study found 205 possible closed-basin lakes in craters on Mars. The basins have an inlet valley that cuts the crater rim and flows into the basin, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> visible outlet valley. The total volume of the basins is equivalent {{to a depth of}} 1.2 meters spread evenly over the Martian surface. However, this amount is {{a small fraction of the}} current water ice stores on Mars. Another study found 210 open-basin lakes. These were lakes with both an inlet and an outlet; hence water must have entered the basin, and reached the height of the outlet. Some of these lakes had volumes similar to Earth's Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and Lake Baikal.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2013, it was {{revealed}} that due to the success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, Millennium Films began planning a sequel film to be called Texas Chainsaw 4 which was expected to begin filming later in 2013 in the state of Louisiana. Millennium Films Chairman Avi Lerner stated that the project was brought to him by Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman and that Millennium had signed on to produce, with Lionsgate distributing the finished product. Executive producer Mark Burg clarified that the sequel was prematurely announced and had not been authorised, [...] "The rights are controlled by Carl [...] and Main Line Pictures, no matter what Millennium says. Millennium simply sold the foreign rights and they will not tell us when a sequel is ready to be made. The script was developed by Carl, myself and writer/director John Luessenhop. Maybe they're looking for something to sell at Berlin, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> right to announce this sequel." [...] The idea for a prequel came when Seth M. Sherwood was given the chance to pitch the film to the studio. Dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of the franchise's continuity, he opted to make a Chainsaw film that wasn't just another sequel to the original: [...] "My pitch was always about doing it completely out of left field and making it different. The first thing I said to Millennium was 'I bet I can tell you what everybody else is pitching you and it’s X-Y-Z, but I want to do 1-2-3', and luckily, that's the direction they were interested in going as well." [...] The script was approached as a story of identity, based on the statements given by Tobe Hooper and Gunnar Hansen on how the character Leatherface is entirely devoid of personality beyond the masks he wears and what his family commands him to do. Sherwood chose not to have Leatherface be born as intellectually disabled, finding the story of a functional person that has their mental capabilities reduced to be more fascinating. Producer Les Whedon detailed the reasoning behind accepting Sherwood's pitch: [...] "What interested and enticed us about this production was {{the fact that we were}} presented with an opportunity to re-invent the franchise. It was the opportunity to almost go behind-the-scenes into the beginning of how Leatherface was created. What happened? Who is Leatherface and how did the whole character come to be?" [...] Despite the film's explanatory premise, co-director Julien Maury found it important to maintain some of the lead character's mystique, referring the project simply as [...] "moments from his young years." ...|$|E
