5|$|The {{main event}} at Backlash was a triple threat match, a match {{involving}} three wrestlers, for the WWE Championship between John Cena, Triple H, and Edge. The buildup to the match began when Triple H lost the Royal Rumble match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner but {{participated in the}} 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament, where the winner would become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Triple H won the tournament. Cena defeated Triple H at WrestleMania to retain the title after forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. The next night on Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Triple H demanded another shot at the WWE Championship, but Edge and Lita (Edge's girlfriend) interrupted Triple H's segment. Edge said that he became WWE Champion at New Year's Revolution when he cashed in his Money in the Bank title shot, that he won at WrestleMania 21, and defeating Cena at the event, after Cena had defeated five other men in an Elimination Chamber, a match featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. Cena, however, reclaimed the Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble, when he defeated Edge. Edge claimed {{that it was time for}} a new opponent for the WWE Championship, after stating that at WrestleMania, Triple H lost his opportunity when he lost to Cena. All three men had a series of Handicap matches, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two, or two against one leading up to Backlash with Triple H pinning Cena after tucking Cena's head <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and jumping up to slam his head to the mat, a move that Triple H calls the Pedigree, Cena forcing Edge to submit to the STFU, and Edge executing a shoulder block takedown on Triple H and pinning him. It was then announced that Cena would defend the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Edge at Backlash.|$|E
25|$|Boris Ermolaev, a Russian psychic, {{was known}} for levitating small objects. His methods were exposed on the World of Discovery {{documentary}} Secrets of the Russian Psychics (1992). Ermolaev would sit on a chair and allegedly move the objects <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> but due to the lighting conditions a fine thread fixed <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> suspending the objects was observed by the camera crew.|$|E
25|$|Haneef is {{believed}} to have been moved from the Brisbane watchhouse to a nearby remand centre on the morning of 18 7 July. Just after 9:30a.m. an armoured police van left the Brisbane City Watchhouse with a prisoner inside. The man was hunched over, hiding his face <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{initially}} {{only the}} players on the field could see the extent of the damage to Theismann's leg, the reverse-angle instant replay (shown multiple times) provided a clearer view of what had actually happened—Theismann's lower leg bones were broken midway <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> and <b>his</b> ankle, such that his leg from his foot to his mid-shin was lying flat against the ground while the upper part of his shin up to <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> was at a 45-degree angle to the lower part of his leg.|$|R

6000|$|For {{one long}} sickening second Lancelot watched {{the blue sky}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> own <b>knees.</b> Then a crash as if a shell had burst in his face--a horrible grind--a sheet of flame--and the {{blackness}} of night. Did you ever feel it, reader? ...|$|R
25|$|At his best, the Welshman {{was also}} a superb if unorthodox shot-stopper, once saving a full blooded drive from only six yards out by {{clamping}} the ball <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b> He was extremely athletic and was reputed, by the football spectators of the day, to have the mysterious ability to change his direction while diving full length.|$|E
500|$|In each panel, Dyer {{is framed}} by a doorway, and set against a flat, {{anonymous}} foreground coloured with black and brown hues. In the left frame, he is seated on a toilet with his head crouched <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> as if in pain. Although his arched back, thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic Colm Tóibín, [...] "lovingly painted", Dyer is by now clearly a broken man. The central panel shows Dyer sitting on the toilet bowl in a more contemplative pose, his head and upper body writhing beneath a hanging lightbulb which throws a large bat-like shadow formed {{in the shape of}} a demon or Eumenide. The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer's flesh, [...] "life seems to visibly drain... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him". Dyer's posture suggests he is seated on a lavatory bowl, though the object is not described. Schmied has proposed that in this frame the blackness of the background has enveloped the subject, and it [...] "seems to be advancing forward over the threshold, threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 28 May 1999: Sudanese {{national}} Aamir Ageeb died of asphyxia {{during his}} forced deportation from Frankfurt. Prior to departure, Ageeb was forcibly restrained by tape and rope.

60|$|The painter {{found him}} {{sitting on the}} old hair-cloth sofa, with <b>his</b> stick <b>between</b> <b>his</b> hands and <b>knees,</b> confronting <b>his</b> mother, who was rocking excitedly to and fro in the old hair-cloth easy-chair.|$|R
60|$|The {{answer was}} hardly audible. The little boy was already almost asleep, worn out with {{all he had}} undergone. Norman began to clear the sofa, that they might lay him down, but his father would not hear of {{disturbing}} him, and, sending Norman away, sat still {{for more than an}} hour, until the child slowly awoke, and scarcely recalling what had happened, stood up <b>between</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>knees,</b> rubbing <b>his</b> eyes, and looking bewildered.|$|R
6000|$|Joy ineffable! There {{were three}} letters--for Master Philip Archfield, for Mistress Anne Jacobina Woodford, and for Sir Philip himself. The old gentleman glanced over it, caught the words 'better,' and 'coming home,' then failed to read through {{tears of joy}} as before through tears of sorrow, and was fain to hand the sheet to his old friend to be read aloud, while little Philip, {{handling}} as a treasure the first letter he had ever received, though as yet {{he was unable to}} decipher it, stood <b>between</b> <b>his</b> grandfather's <b>knees</b> listening as Dr. Woodford read-- ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob's sight had dimmed with age, so Joseph brought his sons near, and Jacob kissed them and embraced them. Jacob told Joseph {{that he had}} not thought to see his face, and now God had let him see his children, as well. Joseph took them from <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> bowed deeply, and brought them to Jacob, with Ephraim in his right hand toward Jacob's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Jacob's right hand. But Jacob laid his right hand on Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh, the firstborn, and prayed that God bless the lads, let Jacob's name be named in them, and let them grow into a multitude. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

60|$|Early in {{the cool}} hush of a June morning in the seventies, a curious vehicle left Farmer Councill's door, loaded with a merry group of young people. It was a huge omnibus, {{constructed}} out of a heavy farm wagon and a hay rack, and was drawn by six horses. The driver was Councill's hired man, Bradley Talcott. Councill himself held <b>between</b> <b>his</b> vast <b>knees</b> the staff of a mighty flag in which they all took immense pride. The girls of the grange had made it for the day.|$|R
60|$|Much {{relieved}} that the storm-center had passed over him, Mr. Wrenn {{sat on the}} front edge of a cane-seated chair, with the magazines <b>between</b> <b>his</b> hands, and <b>his</b> hands pressed <b>between</b> <b>his</b> forward-cocked <b>knees.</b> Always, in the hundreds of times he went over the scene in that room afterward, he remembered how cool and smooth the magazine covers felt to the palms of his flattened hands. For he associated the papery surfaces with the apprehension he then had that Istra might give him up to the jag-toothed grin of Carson Haggerty, who would laugh him {{out of the room and}} out of Istra's world.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Mr. Traddles,' replied Uriah, {{resuming}} {{his official}} seat, and squeezing his bony hands, laid palm to palm <b>between</b> <b>his</b> bony <b>knees.</b> 'Not {{so much so}} as I could wish. But lawyers, sharks, and leeches, are not easily satisfied, you know! Not but what myself and Micawber have our hands pretty full, in general, on account of Mr. Wickfield's being hardly fit for any occupation, sir. But it's a pleasure {{as well as a}} duty, I am sure, to work for him. You've not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield, I think, Mr. Traddles? I believe I've only had the honour of seeing you once myself?' ...|$|R
60|$|The spaniel John's head rose <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> {{turning up}} {{eyes with a}} crimson touch beneath.|$|E

60|$|He {{approached}} Willems, {{who sat on}} the skylight, {{his body}} bent down, his head low, and his hands hanging listlessly <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Louey," [...] {{he said at}} last, {{addressing}} the child who had sat for an hour gazing through the window without stirring a limb or uttering a sound; [...] "Louey, my boy, {{would you like to}} go back to mamma?" [...] The child turned round on the floor, and fixed his eyes on his father's face, but made no immediate reply. [...] "Louey, dear, come to papa and tell him. Would it be nice to go back to mamma?" [...] And he stretched out his hand to the boy. Louey got up, and approached slowly and stood <b>between</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>knees.</b> [...] "Tell me, darling;--you understand what papa says?" ...|$|R

No, there wasn't {{anything}} in the least horrible, only--only--Oh, George, that poor shiny stick of <b>his</b> <b>between</b> <b>his</b> poor, thin <b>knees!</b> I couldn't have borne it if Scottie had howled. I didn't know the vicar was so--so sensitive. He said he was afraid it was ra--rather a shock. Mrs. Betts {{told me to go}} home, and I wanted to collapse on her floor. But I didn't disgrace myself. I--I couldn't have left him--could I?" ...|$|R
60|$|Haldin had a subdued, heartbroken attitude. He {{bowed his}} head; his hands hung <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b> His {{voice was low}} and pained but calm.|$|E

60|$|So Jonas {{sat down}} on the feed-box, and {{carefully}} taking little Pat, he held him horizontally, firmly pressed <b>between</b> <b>his</b> hands and <b>knees,</b> with <b>his</b> feet stuck out toward me, while I knelt down before him and tried to put on the little socks. But the socks were knit or worked very loosely, and {{there seemed to be a}} good many small holes in them, so that Pat's funny little toes, which he kept curling up and uncurling, were continually making their appearance in unexpected places through the sock. But, after a great deal of trouble, I got them both on, with the heels in about the right places.|$|R
60|$|His voice, though sunk {{now almost}} to a whisper, was {{vibrating}} with passion. He half dropped on <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> took {{the edge of her}} skirt <b>between</b> <b>his</b> fingers and raised it to his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{a man or}} a hyena?" [...] I {{answered}} sternly, and {{set about}} the job, Scowl holding the poor woman's head <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{made not}} the {{slightest}} movement, but sat with his hands dropped <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> watching her, the cigarette wavering up its blue thread of smoke.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat with}} the bucket <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> his hands at the cow's udder, about to begin to milk. He looked up a {{question}} at me.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{seemed to}} have {{reached the end of}} his story, or at least to have exhausted the interest it had for him, and he smoked on, holding <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>between</b> <b>his</b> hands and looking thoughtfully into the fire.|$|R
60|$|Lord Shoreby {{snatched}} the {{paper from the}} arrow, read it, crumpled it <b>between</b> <b>his</b> hands, and, overcoming the reluctance which had hitherto withheld him from approaching, threw himself on <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> beside the body and eagerly groped in the wallet.|$|R
