40|$|Abstract. The {{undiluted}} erythrocyte lysing {{technique was}} evaluated {{to see if}} it provides more accurate total leukocyte counts and differential leukocyte counts of severely leukopenic blood samples, in order to detect the onset of hematopoietic recovery after stem cell transplantation. Leukocyte counts using the conventional automated cell counting technique were found to be inaccurate, especially in blood samples with total leukocyte counts 100 /µl, a positive correlation was found between the difference value and the <b>blood</b> <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> (r = 0. 39, p = 0. 002). Hematopoietic recovery after stem cell transplantation in a group of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was different from that of non-CML groups. In the CML group, the initial leukocyte counts were higher and the number of days until neutrophil recovery was higher than in the non-CML groups. Also, the day on which the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) exceeds 100 /µl could serve as an indicator of neutrophil recovery. This study shows that the undiluted erythrocyte lysing technique can be used to count leukocytes accurately, especially in severely leukopenic samples. This new method can detect neutrophil recovery at ANC> 100 /µl, as well as at an earlier date than the conventional method...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on benzene hematotoxicity in rats. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out on rats exposed for 2, 4 and 8 weeks to benzene vapour at a conentration of 1. 5 or 4. 5 mmol/m 3 of air (5 days per week, 6 hours per day) alone or together with ASA at the doses of 5, 150 or 300 mg/kg body weight (per os). Results: Benzene at a concentration of 4. 5 mmol/m 3 caused a slight lymphopenia, granulocytosis and reticulocytosis in blood. In bone marrow traits of megaloblastic renewal, presence of undifferentiated cells and giant forms of granulocytes as well as an increase in myeloperoxidase and decrease in chloroacetate esterase activity and lipids content were noted. ASA (150 and 300 mg/kg b. w.) influenced some of hematological parameters, altered by benzene intoxication. ASA limited the solvent-induced alteration in <b>blood</b> <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> and in the case of bone marrow in the erythroblasts count. Traits of megaloblastic renewal in bone marrow were less pronounced. Besides, higher activity of myeloperoxidase and the decrease in the level of lipids in granulocytes were noted.

40|$|Background: Glucose- 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD) deficiency {{can cause}} hemolytic anemia and neonatal jaundice. Screening of newborns {{by examining the}} cord blood for enzyme activity has been proposed for prevention of its complications. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the incidence of G 6 PD deficiency in newborns in Vali-e-Asr hospital, Tehran. The relation between G 6 PD deficiency and the variables of sex, gestational age, jaundice, hemolysis, and anemia was also examined. Methods: 450 newborns during a 9 -month period were examined for G 6 PD activity by Fluorescent Spot Test of specimens of cord blood and for other variables. Findings: 9 neonates (8 males and 1 female) were G 6 PD deficient. The incidence of G 6 PD deficiency was 2 % (3. 3 % for boys and 0. 5 % for girls). Six (66. 7 %) cases of G 6 PD deficiency developed jaundice. None of the G 6 PD-deficient neonates developed anemia. Only one case had a high cord <b>blood</b> <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count.</b> G 6 PD deficiency was correlated with sex and neonatal jaundice. There was no correlation between G 6 PD deficiency and gestational age, hematocrit and reticulocyte count of the cord blood.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} the efficiency of serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) for assessing body iron status {{at different stages of}} iron deficiency. Among 72 patients with advanced iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), the sensitivity and specificity of sTfR (at a diagnostic cutoff of 3. 24 mg/L) were 70. 8 % and 90. 6 %, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 85. 0 %. Sensitivities of sTfR in patients at the earliest stage of iron deficiency (n = 41) and the intermediate stage of iron-deficient erythropoiesis (n = 15) were 21. 9 % and 26. 7 %, respectively, at the same cutoff value of sTfR. Serum ferritin concentrations averaged 6. 7 ± 1. 9 µg/L in IDA patients with sTfR < 3. 24 mg/L, which were significantly above the values in IDA patients with sTfR ≥ 3. 24 mg/L (4. 8 ± 1. 2 µg/L, p < 0. 05). In healthy controls, <b>blood</b> <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> were significantly higher in subjects with sTfR ≥ 3. 24 mg/L than in those with sTfR < 3. 24 mg/L (0. 045 ± 0. 013 (1012 /L) vs 0. 034 ± 0. 011 (1012 /L), p < 0. 05]. In conclusion, sTfR level is not a sensitive indicator for the early or intermediate stages of iron deficiency, although sTfR assay can be a useful aid in the diagnosis of advanced IDA. Serum sTfR concentration has significant relationships with <b>blood</b> <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> in healthy subjects and with serum ferritin levels in IDA patients...|$|R

40|$|Paraquat {{a widely}} used {{herbicide}} causes {{a variety of}} toxic effects on humans and animals. The present study {{is focused on the}} interaction of paraquat with the mouse erythroid system. Administration of paraquat (10 mg/kg body weight i. p. on alternate days in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice) induced a significant fall in blood erythrocyte count on 7, 14, and 21 day time points but the erythrocyte count reverted back to normal by 28 th day indicating the emergence of refractoriness to paraquat. A marked surge in the <b>blood</b> <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> was observed in paraquat treated mice that also subsided by 28 th day. Young erythrocytes in circulation were randomly eliminated from blood circulation in paraquat treated mice and a significant elevation in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also observed maximally the erythrocytes of this age group. Cells representing various stages of erythroid differentiation in bone marrow and spleen were identified and enumerated flow cytometrically based on their expression of Ter 119 and transferrin (CD 71) receptor. Proliferative activity of erythroid cells, their relative proportion as well as their absolute numbers fell significantly in bone marrow of paraquat treated mice but all these parameters were significantly elevated in spleens of paraquat treated mice. These changes were essentially restricted to the cells belonging to the two earliest stages of erythroid differentiation. Taken together our results indicate that paraquat treatment causes a transient anemia in mice resulting from random elimination of young circulating erythrocytes as well as depressed erythropoietic activity in bone marrow.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} changes in blood morphology caused by participation of record-seeking swimmers in a high altitude training camp at 2, 300 m above sea level and to assess their performance during major competitions before and after the camp. Eight swimmers (two females and six males) - record-holders and medallists of the Polish National Championships, as well as finalists and medallists of the European and World Championships and the Olympic Games (including a two-time holder of the world record) - were recruited. During the 2006 / 2007 season the athletes attended a training camp organized according to the principle “live high and train high”. The camp lasted 23 days and consisted of three micro-cycles of training, each of them with specific training objectives. Before and after participation in the training camp erythrocyte (red blood cells; RBC) count, haemoglobin (Hb) concentration and haematocrit (Hct) were estimated at a hospital laboratory. Scores amassed by the examined athletes during major competitions were presented after their transformation into points based on the FINA (International Swimming Federation) tables for years 2005 - 2008. The best results (time for a distance) achieved during competitions organized before and after participation in the camp were regarded as reference points. Additionally, liquid balance of the body was monitored during 30 selected training units (15 in the morning and 15 in the evening). The response of the examined swimmers from the Polish Olympic Team to the high altitude training (at 2, 300 m above sea level) was represented by an almost three-fold increase in <b>blood</b> <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> during the first micro-cycle of training as well as by an elevated erythrocyte count (by 14. 4 % and haemoglobin (by 13. 5 % and haematocrit (by 14. 8 % levels estimated after completion of the training, as compared to the results obtained before the camp.

40|$|Estudou-se 77 pacientes adultos portadores de linfoma não Hodgkin (LNH) ao diagnóstico, atendidos no Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade Estadual de Campinas. Classificou-se os LNH histologicamente segundo Kiel. Clinicamente avaliou-se os pacientes através da história e do exame fisico e laboratorialmente pela análise do sangue periférico (hemo grama e contagem de reticulócitos), dosagem de bilirrubinas, urobilinogênio urinário e demais exames necessários ao estadiamento clínico. Estadiou-se os linfomas de acordo com os critérios propostos em Ann Arbor e as leucemias linfocíticas crônicas segundo Rai. Estudou-se os perfis imunohematológicos dos pacientes através dos seguintes testes: determinação de grupo sanguíneo ABO/Rh, teste direto da antiglobulina com soros poliespecífico (anti-IgG, anti-C 3 b e allti-C 3 d) e monoespecíficos (anti-IgG, anti-IgM, anti-C 3, anti-C 3 d e anti-C 4), pesquisa e identificação de anticorpos séricos pelas técnicas em tubo com polietilenoglicol, meio de baixa força iônica (LISS) e hemácias pré tratadas com enzimas e pela técnica de gel-centrifugação. Os resultados da avaliação imunohematológica dos pacientes portadores de LNH foram: 1. A freqüência de autoanticorpos anti-eritrocitários foi de 29, 9 % (provável auto anti-I e auto-IgG sem especificidade definida); 2. O quadro de hemólise clínica e laboratorial ocorreu em 1, 3 % dos pacientes; 3. Houve uma tendência dos linfomas de baixo grau de malignidade serem assocíados à presença de autoanticorpos anti-eritrocitários; 4. Não houve associação entre o tipo imunológico dos LNH (B e T) e do estadiamento clínico dos linfomas com a presença dos autoanticorpos. Conclui-se que a alta incidência de autoanticorpos anti-eritrocitários encontrada em nossa casuística provavelmente esteja relacionada com as alterações imunes próprias dos LNH. Seventy-seven adult {{patients}} with non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were {{studied at the}} time of diagnosis at University Hospital of State University of Campinas from March 1992 to November 1993. Histological subgrouping of NHL was performed according to the Kiel criteria. All patients were characterized by clinical and laboratorial examination, which included cytology of peripheral <b>blood,</b> <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count,</b> bilirubin, urinary urobilinogen, haptoglobin, exams for staging of lymphoma and immunohematologic evaluation. The patients were staged according to the principIes of the Ann Arbor classification and the cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia according to Ray clinical staging system. Immunohematology investigation screenings were: determination of blood groups ABO/Rh, direct antiglobulin reaction with polyspecific antiglobulin reagents (anti-IgG, anti-Cb anti-C 3 d) and monospecific reagents (anti-IgG, anti-IgM, anti-C 3, anti-C 3 d, anti-C 4), detection ofblood groups antibodies in serum by indirect antiglobulin test (polyethylene glycol, low ionic strength solution and enzyme-treated ceUs). Whenever an antibody was found on screening, its specificity was determined using a suitable panel of red cells. 1. Our results of the immunohematological evaluation of the {{patients with}} NHL showed that: 1 -There were 29. 87 % of the patients 'with autoantibodies against erythrocytes (IgM with probable specificity of auto anti-I and IgG with specificity serologically indlstinguishable), without clinical disorders; 2.

A weak correlation existed between the low grade lymphomas and erythrocyte autoantibodies; 4. No correlation existed between the type immunologic of lymphoma (B e T) and staging of NHL with erythrocyte auto antibodies.

There are no population-based studies addressing the risk of sickle cell retinopathy in this group. We performed a study to clarify the relation between sickle cell trait and retinopathy in healthy subjects. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 100 children with sickle cell disease who attended the Sickle Cell Clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. We then contacted 200 parents with sickle cell trait, of whom 32 {{agreed to participate in the}} study. All participants were proven to have hemoglobin AS status with prior hemoglobin electrophoresis. An ophthalmologic history was obtained, and a complete ophthalmologic examination was performed. We defined sickle cell retinopathy as any salmon patch hemorrhages, iridescent spots, black sunbursts, retinal neovascularization or retinal detachment. The evaluation also included attempts to identify the more subtle signs of sickle cell retinopathy, such as optic nerve head vascular changes, vascular tortuosity, macular changes (e. g., microaneurysms and vascular loops) and peripheral arteriovenous anastamoses.

Although rosetting occurs in all causes of human malaria, most data on this subject has been derived from Plasmodium falciparum. Here, we investigate the function and factors affecting rosette formation in Plasmodium vivax. To achieve this, we used a range of novel ex vivo protocols to study fresh and cryopreserved P vivax (n = 135) and P falciparum (n = 77) isolates from Thailand. Rosetting is more common in vivax than falciparum malaria, both in terms of incidence in patient samples and percentage of infected erythrocytes forming rosettes. Rosetting to P vivax asexual and sexual stages was evident 20 hours postreticulocyte invasion, reaching a plateau after 30 hours. Host ABO <b>blood</b> group, <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count,</b> and parasitemia were not correlated with P vivax rosetting. Importantly, mature erythrocytes (normocytes), rather than reticulocytes, preferentially form rosetting complexes, indicating that this process is unlikely to directly facilitate merozoite invasion. Although antibodies against host erythrocyte receptors CD 235 a and CD 35 had no effect, Ag-binding fragment against the BRIC 4 region of CD 236 R significantly inhibited rosette formation.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the etiology and frequency of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital. One hundred cases of microcytic hypochromic anemia were included. Relevant clinical history, hemogram, <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count,</b> iron pro les were documented in a proforma. Bone marrow aspiration and hemoglobin electrophoresis was conducted when required. Data was analysed by Microsoft SPSS 16 windows. Result: Iron de ciency was the commonest etiology (49 %). Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (20. 8 %) was the commonest cause of iron de ciency, malignancy (24. 3 %) was the commonest cause of anemia of chronic disease. Mean value of Mean Corpuscular Volume was lowest in hemolytic anemia (71. 0). Mean Red cell Distribution Width was normal (14. 0 %) in hemolytic anemia but was raised in other types. Mean serum iron was reduced in iron de ciency anemia (32. 2 μg/dl) and chronic disease (34. 8 μg/dl), normal in hemolytic anemia (83 μg/dl) and raised in sideroblastic anemia (295 μg/dl). Mean serum ferritin was reduced in iron de ciency anemia (7. 6 ng/ml), raised in chronic disease (158. 6 ng/ml) and normal in hemolytic anemia (99. 2 ng/ml).

40|$|Introduction. Papular-purpuric {{gloves and}} socks {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} manifestation associated with acute seronegative arthritis and skin lesions. It is triggered by a viral infection, most commonly by Human parvovirus B 19 or Coxsackie group of viruses, but precise viral diagnosis is not obtained in all cases. Case report. A 54 -year old male patient experienced sudden, intense pain and swelling in the carpal area of his left hand. He also presented with unusual skin lesions, and grouped small purpuric-papules on the dorsal side of the left hand. During the next few days, both feet were similarly affected. In the next four weeks, a transient liver damage occurred, with a moderate increase in liver enzymes. Apart from elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen levels, other findings were within normal limits (complete <b>blood</b> and <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count,</b> parameters of rheumatic and autoimmune diseases, abdominal ultrasound scan, radiographs of the chest and of affected hand and feet joints, urethral smears for isolation of trichomonas, yeasts and chlamydia trachomatis, and Syphilis, Borrelia, Toxoplasmosis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae serology). Apart from positive tests for HPvB 19, other viral serology tests were all negative (Coxsackievirus, Adenovirus, Influenza, Hepatitis B and C virus, HIV). The skin lesions resolved in about three weeks: the intensity of joint pain decreased, but lasted for the next 6 months. Conclusion. The diagnosis of papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome was {{made on the basis}} of the characteristic clinical picture, and confirmed by virus serology. ...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the etiology in neonates admitted with prolonged jaundice. Materials and Method: Neonates with prolonged jaundice were included to this prospective study designed between January 2007 and December 2007. Prolonged jaundice was defined as total bilirubin level > 5 mg/dL in newborns older than 14 days of age. After detailed history and physical examination, blood tests including blood groups of baby and mother, total, direct and indirect bilirubin, complete blood <b>count</b> (CBC), <b>blood</b> smear, <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count,</b> Coombs test, serum aspartat transaminase (AST) level, serum alanin transaminase (ALT) level, viral markers, thyroid function tests, and glucose- 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 PD) level and routine urine analysis with urine culture were performed in all newborns. Results: A total of 154 neonates were enrolled to the study. The most frequent cause of prolonged jaundice was breast milk jaundice (53 %). It was followed by urinary tract infections and clinical sepsis (29 %), hemolytic causes due to blood group incompetency (10 %) and congenital hypothyroidism (8 %). However,there were no significant differences between etiology and mean bilirubin levels. Conclusion: It is important to determine the etiology and to plan therapy according to etiology is important in newborns with prolonged jaundice. Breast milk jaundice, urinary tract infection and sepsis, hypothyroidism and hemolytic causes must be considered as the main etiology in newborns with prolonged jaundice.

40|$|Abstract- Glucose- 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD) deficiency is {{the most}} important disease of the hexose monophosphate pathway. Deficiency of this enzym can lead to hemolysis of red blood cells. Our aim was to study the prevalence of G 6 PD deficiency in relation to neonatal jaundice. We studied 456 clinically icteric neonates Laboratory investigations included determination of direct and indirect serum bilirubin concentrations, blood group typing, direct coomb's test, hemoglobin, <b>blood</b> smear, <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> and G 6 PD level. We divided these neonates to 3 groups based on total serum bilirubin level (TSB) : TSB 25 mg%. In only 35 (7. 6 %) of cases G 6 PD deficiency was diagnosed. All of these babies were male. From 456 icteric neonates, 213 cases belong to group 1 (TSB 25 mg%). 16 neonates from 213 neonates of group 1, 6 neonates from 158 neonates of group 2 and 13 neonates from 85 neonates of group 3 had G 6 PD deficiency. There was statistically significant difference of prevalence of G 6 PD deficiency between group 2 and 3 (15. 3 % vs 3. 8 %) (P = 0. 001). Between groups 1 vs 2 and 1 vs 3 no statistically significant difference was found. Early detection of this enzymopathy regardless of sex and close surveillance of the affected newborns may be important in reducing the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia. This emphasizes the necessity of neonatal screening on cord blood samples for G 6 PD deficiency...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} spleen {{function in}} 193 children with {{sickle cell anemia}} 8 to 18 months of age by 99 mTc sulfur-colloid liver-spleen scan and correlated results with clinical and laboratory parameters, including 2 splenic biomarkers: pitted cell counts (PIT) and quantitative Howell-Jolly bodies (HJB) enumerated by flow cytometry. Loss of splenic function began before 12 months of age in 86 % of infants in association with lower total or fetal hemoglobin and higher white <b>blood</b> cell or <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts,</b> reinforcing the need for early diagnosis and diligent preventive care. PIT and HJB correlated well {{with each other and}} liver-spleen scan results. Previously described biomarker threshold values did define patients with abnormal splenic function, but our data suggest that normal spleen function is better predicted by PIT of ≤ 1. 2 % or HJB ≤ 55 / 106 red blood cells and absent function by PIT ≥ 4. 5 % or HJB ≥ 665 / 106. HJB is methodologically advantageous compared with PIT, but both are valid biomarkers of splenic function. This trial was registered at www. clinicaltrials. gov as #NCT 00006400...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with a rare but potential threat of devastating acute bilirubin encephalopathy. G 6 PD deficiency was observed in 4 – 14 % of hospitalized icteric neonates in Pakistan. G 6 PD c. 563 C > T is the most frequently reported variant in this population. The present study was aimed at evaluating the time to onset of hyperbilirubinemia and the postnatal bilirubin trajectory in infants having G 6 PD c. 563 C > T. Methods This was a case–control study conducted at The Aga Khan University, Pakistan during the year 2008. We studied 216 icteric male neonates who were re-admitted for phototherapy during the study period. No selection was exercised. Medical records showed that 32 were G 6 PD deficient while 184 were G 6 PD normal. Each infant was studied for birth weight, gestational age, age at the time of presentation, presence of cephalhematoma, sepsis and neurological signs, peak bilirubin level, age at peak bilirubin level, days of hospitalization, whether phototherapy or exchange blood transfusion was initiated, and the outcome. During hospital stay, each baby was tested for complete <b>blood</b> <b>count,</b> <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count,</b> ABO and Rh blood type, direct antiglobulin test and quantitative G 6 PD estimation [by kinetic determination of G 6 PDH]. G 6 PDgenotype was analyzed in 32 deficient infants through PCR-RFLP analysis and gene sequencing. Results G 6 PD variants c. 563 C > T and c. 131 C > G were observed in 21 (65 %) and three (9 %) of the 32 G 6 PD deficient infants, respectively. DNA of eight (25 %) newborns remained uncharacterized. In contrast to G 6 PD normal neonates, infants with c. 563 C > T variant had significantly lower enzyme activity (mean ± 1 SD; 0. 3 [*]±[*] 0. 2 U/gHb vs. 14. 0 [*]±[*] 4. 5 U/gHb, p [*] p[*]= [*] 0. 008) which peaked earlier after birth (mean ± 1 SD 2. 9 [*]±[*] 1. 6 vs. 4. 3 [*]±[*] 2. 3 days, p[*]= [*] 0. 007). No statistically significant difference was observed in mean weight, age at presentation, hemoglobin, <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count,</b> TSH level, hospital stay or in the frequency of initiation of phototherapy or blood exchange between the two groups. Conclusions We concluded that infants with G 6 PD c. 563 C > T variant developed jaundice earlier than infants with normal G 6 PD enzyme levels. Compared to G 6 PD normal infants, G 6 PD c. 563 C > T carrying infants had significantly low G 6 PD activity. </p...|$|R

Fever started seven days before, reached 38. 5 oC, often peaking twice daily; there were also chills, sweating, and sometimes dry cough. The administration of ampicillin initially and cefuroxime afterwards had no effect. His past medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination on admission revealed only pallor without any sign of infection. There were no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy.

In a randomized trial, we studied the biologic effects and the clinical benefit of HU in {{children and young adults}} with severe SCA. Twenty-five patients (median age, 9 years) were randomized to receive either HU (at the initial dosage of 20 mg/kg/d) or a placebo for 6 months and were then switched to the other arm for the next 6 months. Among the 22 evaluable patients (median age, 8 years), significant increases in HbF and mean corpuscular volume occurred during the HU treatment period. The white <b>blood</b> cell and <b>reticulocytes</b> <b>counts</b> decreased significantly, but these changes were not clinically relevant. Sixteen of 22 patients (73 %) experienced a complete disappearance of events requiring hospitalization. The number of days of hospitalization as well as the number of hospitalizations for patients on HU, as compared with those for the patients receiving placebo, were significantly reduced. We conclude that treatment with HU in children and young adults is feasible, well-tolerated, and improves the clinical course of SCA. The long-term effects of HU require further investigation.

40|$|Background: Macrocytosis is {{a common}} finding {{encountered}} in automated coulters and evaluation of clinical, biochemical and haematological parameters in macrocytic anemias will provide a clue to diagnosis. This study was done to evaluate the clinical and laboratory parameters in macrocytic anemias and their utility in differentiating megaloblastic and non-megaloblastic anemia. Methods: 100 patients presenting with macrocytosis were taken in to study. A detailed clinical history and physical examination was done in all cases. CBC, biochemical investigations, peripheral <b>blood</b> examination and <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> was done in all cases and Vitamin B 12 and folate levels, bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy in some cases. After evaluation, a provisional diagnosis was made and patients with megaloblastic anaemia was given vitamin B 12 and folic acid treatment and followed up after 2 weeks and 1 month. Results: Primary bone marrow disorders were {{the most common cause}} of macrocytosis (46 %). The other causes in decreasing order of frequency were megaloblastic anaemia (38 %), hemolytic anemia (6 %), drug induced (5 %), alcoholism and liver disease (4 %) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (1 %). There was a significant difference in the mean values of MCV and serum LDH between megaloblastic and non and ndash; megaloblastic macrocytosis. When serum LDH > 1345. 2 IU/L or MCV> 121 fl (criterion values of ROC curve) with <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> < 2 % was taken as criteria, the sensitivity was 92. 1 % and specificity was 93. 5 % for diagnosing megaloblastic anemia. Conclusions: Systematic evaluation of macrocytosis will help us to distinguish megaloblastic and non and ndash; megaloblastic macrocytosis. The blood and biochemical parameters especially CBC, RC, and serum LDH along with supporting clinical features help us in diagnosing megaloblastic anemia in a setup where vitamin and metabolite levels are difficult to obtain.
