50|$|The {{inner cover}} {{provides}} a barrier between the telescoping cover and the bees. In more temperate climates, a plastic foil {{may be used}} as an inner cover. Plastic foil should not be used to winter bees under, as trapped condensation would cause the hive to become wet, and bees can be lost due to freezing when temperatures fall during the night. In areas with a hot summer, a solid inner cover with a communication hole provides dead-air space for insulation against both heat and cold. This prevents the <b>bees</b> from <b>gluing</b> the top cover to the top bars of the super under it. When an inner cover is used, the top cover is more easily removed from the hive. Notches in the frame of the solid inner cover and telescoping cover can serve as an upper entrance for the bees. A communication hole in the middle allows bees to reach emergency food placed above by the beekeeper if it becomes required.|$|R
50|$|Propolis or <b>bee</b> <b>glue</b> is a {{resinous}} mixture that {{honey bees}} produce by mixing saliva and beeswax with exudate gathered from tree buds, sap flows, or other botanical sources.

Its color varies depending on its botanical source, the most common being dark brown. Propolis is sticky at, and above, room temperature (20 C). At lower temperatures, it becomes hard and very brittle.|$|E
5000|$|Lorenzo Langstroth, {{known as}} the “Father of Beekeeping,” had a unique way of {{capturing}} the essence of his bees through writing letters; these letters revealed his devoted connection to bees. Through his interpretations of bees, he studied the behavior and the equipment used to house them.After discovering many unanswered questions with the current equipment, Langstroth knew he could provide a solution. Langstroth originally was trying to improve the Bevan bar hive because {{he found that the}} combs could not be removed and this gave him a huge advantage to create a better hive. Langstroth discovered that the bees kept filling holes necessary to take the hive out with propolis, <b>bee</b> <b>glue,</b> so he came up with a new solution.On his journey to create the perfect frame, Lorenzo found it helpful to write a manual of his findings. His book, Langstroth on the Hive and the Honeybee: A Beekeeper’s Manual, became a fundamental teaching mechanism for students of beekeeping. His book is considered a basic text on the skill of beekeeping because it is more of a “how to” explanation of beekeeping. The book states information related to bees, honey, and beekeeping. Langstroth sees beekeeping “in the present state of public opinion, it requires no little courage to venture upon the introduction of a new hive and system of management; but I feel confident that a new era in bee-keeping has arrived.” Langstroth viewed bees as holy creatures: [...] "Tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in 'bees,' and 'God' in every thing".With Langstroth’s love of bees inevitably came his invention of the moveable bee-frame. The moveable beehives solved the problem by providing a space between the frames and the hive walls, bottom, and top cover. The moveable-frame beehive was patented in 1852, No 9300.This invention of the beehive marks the new era of the beehive. Three advantages Langstroth states of the moveable frame are: 1. “The scientific beekeeper could examine every comb quickly and easily. The Langstroth hive would be cheap, and the combs could be removed with safety to the bees.” 2. “The practical beekeeper, who wished an income from his bees, could propagate queens, make artificial swarms, supply destitute hives with honey or brood, and produce honey ready for the market in boxes or in glass tumblers, and he could protect his hives against the bee moth. In short, he could do almost anything he wanted to do with his bees.” 3. “The farmer could easily procure honey for his own use”.|$|E

50|$|Bucket orchids are an {{excellent}} example of coevolution and mutualism, as the orchids have evolved along with orchid bees (the tribe Euglossini of the family Apidae) and both depend on each other for reproduction. One to three flowers are borne on a pendant stem that comes {{from the base of the}} pseudobulbs. The flower secretes a fluid (see Coryanthes alborosea picture) into the flower lip, which is shaped like a bucket. The male orchid bees (not the females) are attracted to the flower by a strong scent from aromatic oils, which they store in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent in their courtship dances in order to attract females. The bees, trying to get the waxy substance containing the scent, sometimes fall to the fluid-filled bucket. As they are trying to escape, they find that there are some small knobs on which they can climb on, while the rest of the lip is lined with smooth, downward-pointing hairs, upon which their claws cannot find a grip. The knobs lead to a spout (see the Coryanthes leucocorys picture), but as the bee is trying to escape, the spout constricts. At that same moment, the small packets containing the pollen of the orchid get pressed against the thorax of the <b>bee.</b> However, the <b>glue</b> on the pollen packets does not set immediately, so the orchid keeps the bee trapped until the glue has set. Once the glue has set, the bee is let free and he can now dry his wings and fly off. His ordeal may have taken as long as forty-five minutes. Hopefully, the bee will go to another flower, where, if the flower is to be successful at reproducing, the bee falls once again into the bucket of the same species. This time the pollen packets get stuck to the stigma as the bee is escaping, and after a while the orchid will produce a seed pod.|$|R

Several indomethacin capsule formulations (F 1 - F 18) containing varying amounts of chloroform (0. 75 - 75 mg) and ethanol extracts (30 - 75 mg) of propolis were prepared. The dissolution rate of the formulations was evaluated by USP dissolution (rotating basket) method I and the release data subjected to various kinetic models. Probable interaction between the drug and propolis extracts was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Results: The results show that, although the release rate of formulations F 1 - F 7 did not show any significant difference (p < 0. 05) compared to F 18 as blank, the other formulations did. DSC results indicate that incorporation of propolis extract in the formulations lowered indomethacin melting point by between 5 and 30 ºC, indicating interaction between the drug and the waxy extract.

Bees gather propolis from diverse resinous plant parts and in different phytogeographic regions its chemical composition might vary significantly. In this article we report the results of the first study on the chemical profiles of propolis from Oman, its plant origin and antibacterial activity. Results: The chemical profiles of Omani propolis extracts were obtained by GC-MS analysis after silylation. Over 50 individual compounds were identified in the samples, belonging to different compound types: sugars, polyols, hydroxy acids, fatty acids, cardanols and cardols, anacardic acids, flavan derivatives, triterpenes, prenylated flavanones and chalcones. The profiles were dissimilar from other known propolis types. They demonstrate that although Oman is not a large country, the plant sources of propolis vary significantly, even in the same apiary and the same season.

QSI activity was also observed in the second group US propolis samples which contained the flavonoid pinocembrin in addition to other flavonoid compounds. The discovery of compounds that are involved in QSI activity has the potential to facilitate studies that may lead to the development of antivirulence therapies that can be complementary and/or alternative treatments against antibioti...|$|E
