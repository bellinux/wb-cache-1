50|$|In law, a <b>base</b> <b>fee</b> is a {{freehold}} {{estate of inheritance}} which is limited or qualified by the existence of certain conditions. In modern property law the commonest example of a <b>base</b> <b>fee</b> is an estate created by a tenant in tail, not in possession, who bars the entail without the consent of the protector of the settlement. Any attempt to bar the entail without the consent of the Protector would only be partially successful. Though he bars his own issue (the rights of the future tenants in tail), he cannot bar any remainder or reversion, and the estate (i.e. the <b>base</b> <b>fee)</b> thus created is determinable on the failure of his issue in tail. The <b>base</b> <b>fee</b> can be defined as rights that would last {{for as long as the}} fee tail would have lasted, but which will end when the line of descent stipulated in the fee tail ran out.|$|E

40|$|With aging {{infrastructure}} and declining {{purchasing power of}} tax receipts new mechanisms of financing transportation alternatives are gaining increasing interest. Fuel taxes are and have been for some time {{the primary source of}} transportation finance in United States. Fuel taxes are fixed amounts that rarely change and which lose purchasing power over time as prices escalate. In addition, improvements in fuel economy can further erode the revenue stream from the gas tax. This study explores the public’s attitude about user <b>based</b> <b>fees</b> collected through tolls that are directed at specific infrastructure projects using the Inland Empire region of California as a case study. The premise of this research is that tolls can complement existing funding sources for improving infrastructure. Public perception of such directed user <b>based</b> <b>fees</b> as tolls has traditionally been considered a barrier in the wide scale implementation of these financing mechanisms. However, according to a recent publication from National Cooperative Highway Research Program, public perception of user <b>based</b> <b>fees</b> may not be as negative as once thought (Zmud, 2008). This study identified and addressed the research need for a framework to assess the general public’s perception of user-based fees and tolls as instruments of transportation finance...|$|R

5000|$|A fee tail {{can still}} exist in England and Wales as an {{equitable}} interest, behind a strict settlement; the legal estate is vested {{in the current}} 'tenant for life' or other person immediately entitled to the income, but {{on the basis that}} any capital money arising must be paid to the settlement trustees. A tenant in tail in possession can bar his fee tail by a simple disentailing deed, which does not now have to be enrolled. A tenant in tail in reversion (i.e. a future interest where the property is subject to prior life interest) needs the consent of the life tenant and any 'special protectors' to vest a reversionary fee simple in himself. Otherwise he can only create a base fee; a <b>base</b> <b>fee</b> only confers a right to the property on its owner, when its creator would have become entitled to it; if its creator dies before he would have received it, the owner of the <b>base</b> <b>fee</b> gets nothing.

40|$|AbstractThe Harbor Maintenance Tax is a {{fundamentally}} flawed maintenance funding {{mechanism for the}} critical US port system. Three alternatives were analyzed. User fee rates were estimated for either a national or regional tonnage <b>based</b> <b>fee.</b> Our results indicate that maintenance cost recovering regional fees could vary widely from about 10 cents per tonne to nearly 80 cents per tonne. A national rate would be about 30 cents per tonne. The large regional differences and affects on bulk shippers are likely to make implementing and maintaining cost recovering tonnage <b>based</b> <b>fees</b> infeasible. Two other mechanisms are considered. One possibility is to abolish the HMT without a replacement mechanism. The obvious strength {{of this approach is}} its simplicity, the weaknesses {{is that it is not}} budget neutral. Another possibility is to increase the federal diesel tax rate. One strength of the approach is the reasonable rate increase required to recover port maintenance costs (estimated between 0. 278 and 0. 315 cents per liter). An additional strength is that relatively inefficient fuel users will either make the largest share of the additional payments or the freight will shift modes to one that is more efficient. One weakness is that the rate has been unchanged since 1997, this points to the political difficulty involved in passing such a rate increase...|$|R
