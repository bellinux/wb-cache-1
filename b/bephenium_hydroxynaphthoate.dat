50|$|<b>Bephenium</b> <b>hydroxynaphthoate</b> (INN, {{trade names}} Alcopara, Alcopar, Befenium, Debefenium, Francin, Nemex) is an {{anthelmintic}} agent formerly {{used in the}} treatment of hookworm infections and ascariasis.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydrochloride}} salt of benzylamine, C6H5CH2NH3Cl or C6H5CH2NH2&middot;HCl, {{is prepared}} by reacting benzylamine with hydrochloric acid, {{and can be}} used in treating motion sickness. NASA astronaut John Glenn was issued with benzylamine hydrochloride for this purpose for the Mercury-Atlas 6 mission. The cation in this salt is called benzylammonium and is a moiety found in pharmaceuticals such as the anthelmintic agent <b>bephenium</b> <b>hydroxynaphthoate,</b> used in treating ascariasis.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in rural areas in Nagasaki {{prefecture}} to investigate anthelmintic efficacy of <b>Bephenium</b> <b>Hydroxynaphthoate</b> (Alcopar) against hookworm infection. The result obtained were summarized as follows; 1) a) In the case of the treatment with 5. 0 g. Alcopar, 4 (75 %) of 5 treated (student) and 64 (36. 4 %) of 176 treated (adult) were negative for ova three weeks after administration. b) In the case of the treatment with 2. 5 g. Alcopar, 26 (76. 5 %) of 34 treated (student) and 7 (33. 3 %) of 21 treated (adult) were negative. 2) In general, Alcopar showed a promising efficacy (80 ～ 100 %) against Anchylostoma duodenale infection and a rather low efficacy (27. 8 ～ 75 %) in the percentage of negativity for ova in the treatment of Necator americanus infection. 3) Toxic signs due to this drug were headache, nausea, diarrohae etc. which were slight in intensity...|$|E
40|$|Recently we {{reported}} that bephenium chloride, {{a member of}} a series of new quaternary am monium compounds, showed promising activity against hookworm infections (Necator amen canus) in mental patients. 1 About the same time Goodwin et at. using different bephenium salts reported similar results from Ceylon. @ They foundthehydroxynaphthoatesaltto be more suitable than the bromide or embonate salts. In both of these studies the reduction in egg density was far greater than the cure rate. The above studies, together with that of Nagaty and Rifaat, ' indicated that very few side effects resulted from the use of the bephen ium salts. Rogers reported that bephenium is poorly absorbed from the gut in man. 4 The present study was undertaken to deter mine the efficacy of the hydroxynaphthoate salt of bephenium against worm infections, usually of high intensity, in mental patients. Tetrachloro ethylene, a commonly used anthelmintic, was used for comparison. MATERIALSAND METHODS The patients were white and Negro female residents of a mental hospital. The bephenium was given usually 1 to 2 hours after meals. The single daily doses were given after the morning meal, twice daily doses after the morning and evening meals, and thrice daily doses after each of the three meals. There were no pretreatment or post-treatment procedures, such as purges or fasting. The drug was given in a fine granular form (AlcoparaÂ®) @suspended in fruit juice, milk, or, occasionally, in water. The dosages of <b>bephenium</b> <b>hydroxynaphthoate</b> are shown in terms of grams of the base...|$|E
