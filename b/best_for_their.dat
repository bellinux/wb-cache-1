The only other grapes worthy of his consideration were Greek varieties, including the Graecula grape used to make Chian wine. He remarked that the Eugenia had promise, but only if planted in the Colli Albani region.

25|$|In June 1940 {{the entire}} {{population}} of Alderney, about 1,500 residents, were evacuated. Most went on the official evacuation boats sent from mainland Britain. Some, however, decided to make their own way, mostly via Guernsey, but due to the impending occupation many found themselves unable to leave and were forced to stay on Guernsey {{for the duration of the}} war. A few Alderney people elected not to leave Alderney with the general evacuation. However, boats from Guernsey came and collected them before the German Army arrived, on the basis that it was <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> personal safety. During the Second World War, the Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles that was occupied by Germany, although other parts of the Empire were occupied by the Axis powers.|$|E

25|$|Just {{prior to}} the Canucks' 23-man roster being set {{following}} the end of preseason, they claimed defenceman Ryan Stanton off waivers. Stanton had played only one NHL game but was brought in as a possible replacement for Alberts in order to keep a balance between right and left handed defencemen. The youth movement failed to take hold. Guance was sent back to the Belleville Bulls. Despite having a good camp, he was outplayed by fellow prospects, Horvat and Shinkaruk. Tortorella felt Gaunce needed to improve the tempo and the pace of his game and he would benefit from playing more minutes. Due to the injuries and suspensions, it appeared that Horvat and Shinkaruk would start the season with the Canucks. However, just days before the roster was set, Vancouver acquired forwards Zac Dalpe and Jeremy Welsh from the Carolina Hurricanes. Following the trade Horvat was sent back to the London Knights, Shinkaruk remained with the team, but was returned to the Medicine Hat Tigers to make room for Stanton. As {{with the rest of the}} prospects, Vancouver was pleased with their play, but wanted to do what was <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> development. Helping to make the decision to return the prospects to their junior teams was the emergence of Mike Santorelli who had a strong camp, where he was one of Vancouver's best forwards. He earned Tortorella's trust and was played in all situations helping him to make the team.|$|E

500|$|Vigilantism in pre-{{territorial}} {{and territorial}} Montana {{has been written}} about, romanticized and chronicled in personal memoirs, biographies, documentary and scholarly works, film and fiction {{for well over a}} century. The first book published in Montana was Thomas J. Dimsdale's 1866 first edition of The Vigilantes of Montana, [...] which was compiled from a series of newspaper articles he wrote for the Montana Post in 1865. [...] Historical analysis of the period ranges from disrepute to heroism, with debates over whether the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time meant the vigilantes acted in a way they thought was <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> communities or if modern standards of due process should govern analysis of their actions.|$|E

500|$|Another account, not {{published}} until 1982, {{is that of}} former Montana Supreme Court Justice (1922–1935) Lew L. Callaway. [...] Edited by his son Lew Callaway Jr., Montana's Righteous Hangmen:The Vigilantes in Action stems from Callaway's association with vigilante Captain James William in the late 1800s. [...] Lew Callaway wrote extensively about the vigilantes and his stories which add more intimate details about how the vigilantes operated are captured in this volume. Although some vigilante activities during this period were criticized by citizens and civic leaders, {{there was a general}} affirmation of their purpose and contribution to law and order in a growing territory. [...] Mark C. Dillon's Montana Vigilantes 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows (2013) concludes that given the lawless environment and criminal activity in Alder Gulch and Helena at the time, the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time, the vigilantes acted in a way they thought was <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> communities. [...] He contends that judging the vigilantes by today's understanding and standards of due process is problematic.|$|E

Later Dora studied with Adam Friedrich Oeser and (perhaps) Anton Graff, both painters. After {{the death of her}} father in 1773, Dora was able to help keep the family afloat, along with her older half-brother, by continuing the family's business relationship with Breitkopf.|$|E
2500|$|Between 2003 and 2004 Massow was {{director}} of another financial adviser firm, this time a tied agent of the Zurich Advice Network (previously Allied Dunbar). Massow had previously campaigned against {{what he saw as}} Allied Dunbar's anti-gay underwriting practices, but he claimed that [...] "they've moved on and, for the sake of my customers, so must I [...] if other gay financial advisers think they're doing the <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> customers by blackballing all the companies that were once out of line (there were about eight of them) when it came to gay issues – then their priorities are very strange. Financial advice is about getting the best product – not petty grudge bearing." [...] Massow accepted a transitional loan of £330,000 to enable office relocation and staff training. However the arrangement was short-lived and ironically ended after a dispute between Massow and Zurich over Zurich's approach to insuring the gay clients in which the firm specialised. A long £13m legal case followed which, ultimately, Massow lost.|$|E
