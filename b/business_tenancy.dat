50|$|The {{new kind}} of tenancy {{introduced}} in the 1995 Act is called a Farm <b>Business</b> <b>Tenancy</b> ("FBT") and since 1995, almost all new agricultural lettings have used this framework. However, tenancies created under the 1986 Act remain in force and unchanged by the subsequent legislation. The 1995 Act has been amended somewhat in the Regulatory Reform Order 2006. This has, in a modest way, streamlined, simplified and deregulated Farm Business Tenancies to an even greater extent.|$|E
50|$|The current regime {{under the}} 1995 Act for {{regulating}} tenancies, {{commonly known as}} Farm Business Tenancies, permits {{the creation of a}} clearly and easily terminable interest, whether by a periodic tenancy or a fixed term. In the cycle of animal husbandry and land use and improvement, the long-term effect of the Farm <b>Business</b> <b>Tenancy</b> on the landscape of Britain is not yet proven. It was predicted by landowners and other industry spokesmen that the 1995 Act would create opportunities for new tenants by allowing large areas of new lettings but this has not happened in practice as most landowners have continued to favour share farming or management agreements over formal tenancies and the majority of new lettings under the Act have been to existing farmers, often owner-occupiers taking on extra land at significantly higher rents than could be afforded by a traditional tenant.|$|E

It assesses the distinction between waiver by election and estoppel in this context. It also considers how it may be possible for a tenant to serve a request for a new tenancy in the knowledge of the facts undermining the validity of the landlord's notice and still preserve the right to object...|$|E

40|$|The report {{presents}} {{a repeat of}} a 1989 - 90 postal survey to explore the land tenurial changes in England and Wales that have resulted from legislative and structural change. Clearly, since 1990, the introduction of Farm <b>Business</b> <b>Tenancies</b> means that {{the two sets of}} results, while not directly comparable, allows the occupancy of land under unconventional forms of tenancy to be explored and contrasted. Furthermore, many factors influence the occupancy of land including taxation, inheritance laws, the profitability of farming, and structural and policy changes within the industry. Therefore, the occupancy of agricultural land in 2007 should be set against this backcloth of socio-political changes that impact upon the industry. Finally, this report is split into two sections, the first focuses on the occupation of land in England and Wales using weighted sample data, while the second explores some of the dynamics behind land tenure using the unweighted sample data. Land Tenure, Farm <b>Business</b> <b>Tenancies,</b> Agricultural Occupancy, Informal Tenure Agreements, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

With property prices rising and most <b>business</b> <b>tenancies</b> taken for set periods of 10 or 15 years, Hyams could afford to keep it empty and wait for his single tenant at the asking price of £1,250,000; he was challenged to allow tenants to rent single floors but consistently refused. At that point, skyscrapers were rare in London, and Centre Point's prominence led to its becoming a rallying symbol for opponents.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} over 60 years since the {{enactment}} of Pt II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. Since then, {{there have been two}} revisions of the legislation – one in 1969, which made limited amendments including the introduction of interim rents (see, the Law of Property Act 1969) and, more recently, under the Regulatory Reform (<b>Business</b> <b>Tenancies)</b> (England and Wales) Order 2003, which introduced more radical changes, particularly in relation to contracting out, notices and interim rents. To what extent, however, have these changes improved the mechanics of the statutory code governing commercial lease renewals? This article seeks to answer this question by presenting the finding of the writers’ study into practical workings of Pt. II. In this part, the writers present their findings in relation to the possible repeal of Pt II and, alternatively, reform of the contracting out procedures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the UK market for energy service contracts in 2014 and highlights the growing role of intermediaries. Using information from secondary literature and interviews, it identifies the businesses offering energy service contracts, the sectors and organisations that are purchasing those contracts, the types of contract that are available, the areas of market growth and the reasons for that growth. The paper finds that the UK market is relatively large, highly diverse, concentrated in particular sectors and types of site and overwhelmingly focused upon established technologies with high rates of return. A major driver is the emergence of procurement frameworks for energy service contracts in the public sector. These act as intermediaries between clients and contractors, thereby lowering transaction costs and facilitating learning. The market is struggling to become established in commercial offices, {{largely as a result of}} split incentives, and is unlikely to develop further in this sector without different <b>business</b> models, <b>tenancy</b> arrangements and policy initiatives. Overall, the paper concludes that energy service contracts can play an important role in the transition to a low-carbon economy, especially when supported by intermediaries, but their potential is still limited by high transaction costs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the commercial leases policy {{issue of how}} to deal with small business tenants. The UK has adopted a voluntary solution to commercial lease reform by using Codes of Practice which is in contrast to the legislative approach adopted by Australia to attempt to solve its perceived problems with small <b>business</b> retail <b>tenancies.</b> The aim of the research was to examine the perceptions of the effectiveness of the legislation in Australia and discuss any implications for the UK policy debate. The research used a combination of literature and legislation review and a semi structured interview survey to investigate the policy aims and objectives of Australian Federal and State Governments, identify the nature and scope of the Australian legislation and examine perceptions of effectiveness of the legislation in informing small business tenants. The situation is complicated in Australia due to leases being a State rather than Federal responsibility therefore the main fieldwork was carried out in one case study State, Victoria. The paper concludes that some aspects of the Australian system can inform the UK policy debate including mandatory information provision at the commencement of negotiations and the use of lease registrars/commissioners. However, {{there are a number of}} issues that the Australian legislation does not appear to have successfully addressed including the difficulties of legislating across partial segments of the commercial property market and the collection of data for enforcement purposes. ...|$|R
