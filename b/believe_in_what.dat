In 2003, Take-Two CEO Jeffrey Lapin reported that the game would not be out that year. He further said the company was writing off $5.5million from its earnings due to Duke Nukem Forevers lengthy development time. Broussard shot back that [...] "Take-Two needs to ...

500|$|When Homer {{is chosen}} by the Republicans to pick their {{candidate}} for the next presidential election, his {{lack of interest in}} the current candidates leads him to choose Ted Nugent. He invites Nugent for a visit to the Simpsons' home, where Lisa complains that Homer has made the wrong pick since Nugent is [...] "out of his mind". Later that day, Homer has a dream in which James Madison shows him how ashamed past American presidents are of Homer. When he wakes up, he tells Lisa he will not be supporting Nugent for president anymore. He then sees a brochure on her dresser with a man posing as a president and offering help with fake dreams. Homer realizes the family faked his dream to convince him not to endorse Nugent. As a result, he angrily decides to go on television and express his support for Nugent. However, when he tries to bring out his ability to cry every time he discusses anything on television, he finds he cannot bring up those emotions because he does not truly <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> he is saying. Homer [...] announces on television that he [...] "is full of crap" [...] and [...] reconciles with Lisa. As a result, Nugent is stripped of his position as the Republican presidential candidate. The episode ends as he sings a song about what his presidency would have been like.|$|E

2500|$|But here's {{where the}} real {{question}} lies. Did God create the world, or not? Is it God's handiwork? Many {{of the people who}} accept evolution, even many scientists, <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> is called [...] "theistic evolution," [...] that is, that behind the billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution, there is room for belief in a creator, God, who set everything into motion, and who stands outside the universe as the cause and reason for life. The difference between that and [...] "intelligent design" [...] is subtle yet significant. Believing scientists claim that belief in God is not incompatible with studying evolution since science looks only for the natural explanations for phenomena. The proponents of intelligent design, on the other hand, deny the ability to explain life on earth through solely natural explanations. That difference, while subtle, is determinative.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cultural}} {{attack is}} broader than the political one, {{and it may}} underlie the whole. Pope attacks, over and over again, those who write for pay. While Samuel Johnson would say, half a century later, that no man but a blockhead ever wrote but for money, Pope's attack is not on those who get paid, but those who will write on cue for the highest bid. Pope himself {{was one of the}} earliest poets to make his living solely by writing, and so it is not the professional author, but the mercenary author that Pope derides. He attacks hired pens, the authors who perform poetry or religious writing for the greatest pay alone, who do not <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> they are doing. As he puts it in book II, [...] "He (a patron) chinks his purse, and takes his seat of state... And (among the poets) instant, fancy feels th' imputed sense" [...] (II 189–91). He objects not to professional writers, but to hackney writers. His dunce booksellers will trick and counterfeit their way to wealth, and his dunce poets will wheedle and flatter anyone for enough money to keep the bills paid.|$|E
2500|$|Fatimah's burial {{place is}} a disputed issue among Muslims from {{different}} sects. It is famous that Ali ibn Abi Taleb buried his wife in an unknown location, because it was Fatimah's decision [...] According to Madelung in The Succession to Muhammad, the secret burial {{was done with the}} aim of avoiding the presence of caliph (Abu Bakr). Different locations have been mentioned as the possible burial places of Fatimah some of which are said to be nearer to fact. Al-Baqi', her house and between the Prophet's tomb and his minbar are the possible places of her grave. One of the important reasons that Fatima’s grave was concealed is because of her protest against what happened regarding to the caliphate of the Holy prophet. [...] Hence, as long as the Muslims don’t <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> Fatima believes relating to the Holy prophet’s succession, the reason for the concealment of her grave will remain. One of the historians in this filed says: [...] "… In any case, concealment of the prophet’s daughter indicates that she was dejected about some people and it’s clear that she wanted to declare her dissatisfaction and unhappiness".|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Kidman won {{critical}} {{praise for}} her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry's The Hours, which stars Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that {{were applied to}} her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. The New York Times wrote that, [...] "Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain". Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first BAFTA, third Golden Globe, and the Academy Award for Best Actress. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech {{about the importance of}} art, even during times of war, saying, [...] "Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil?

She comments, [...] "This isn't a closed chapter. At the end of the day, she's been outed off the Square and with the character she is, she doesn't even know what's going on in her own head.

[...] After one last [...] "huge row" [...] with Bradley and realising that she had no friends in Walford, Clare decided to leave, making her exit in an hour-long episode that aired on 7 August 2008.
