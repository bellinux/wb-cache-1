5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet,</b> Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E
5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful <b>bar</b> <b>magnet,</b> with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
25|$|The Maxwell–Faraday {{version of}} Faraday's law of {{induction}} describes how a time varying magnetic field creates ("induces") an electric field. This dynamically induced electric field has closed field lines {{similar to a}} magnetic field, unless superposed by a static (charge induced) electric field. This aspect of electromagnetic induction is the operating principle behind many electric generators: for example, a rotating <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> creates a changing magnetic field, which in turn generates an electric field in a nearby wire.|$|E

25|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} SSB is in ferromagnetic materials. Microscopically, the material consists of atoms with a non-vanishing spin, {{each of which}} acts like a tiny <b>bar</b> <b>magnet,</b> i.e., a magnetic dipole. The Hamiltonian of the material, describing the interaction of neighbouring dipoles, is invariant under rotations. At high temperature, there is no magnetization of a large sample of the material. Then one says that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian is realized by the system. However, at low temperature, there could be an overall magnetization. This magnetization has a preferred direction, since one can tell the north magnetic pole of the sample from the south magnetic pole. In this case, there is spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian.|$|E
25|$|This {{primitive}} telephone {{was rapidly}} improved. The double electromagnet {{was replaced by}} a single permanently magnetized <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> having a small coil or bobbin of fine wire surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the magnetic field of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct.|$|E
2500|$|Since a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> {{gets its}} {{ferromagnetism}} from electrons distributed evenly throughout the bar, when a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> is cut in half, {{each of the}} resulting pieces is a smaller <b>bar</b> <b>magnet.</b> Even though a magnet {{is said to have}} a north pole and a south pole, these two poles cannot be separated from each other. A monopole—if such a thing exists—would be a new and fundamentally different kind of magnetic object. It would act as an isolated north pole, not attached to a south pole, or vice versa. Monopoles would carry [...] "magnetic charge" [...] analogous to electric charge. Despite systematic searches since 1931, , they have never been observed, and could very well not exist.|$|E

2500|$|In Faraday's first {{experimental}} demonstration (August 29, 1831), {{he wrapped}} two wires around {{opposite sides of}} an iron ring or [...] "torus" [...] (an arrangement similar to a modern toroidal transformer). Based on his understanding of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a [...] "wave of electricity", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it. This induction {{was due to the}} change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> {{in and out of a}} coil of wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> with a sliding electrical lead ("Faraday's disk").|$|E
2500|$|Churchland's {{luminous}} room:"Consider a {{dark room}} containing a man holding a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> or charged object. If the man pumps the magnet up and down, then, according to Maxwell's theory of artificial luminance (AL), it will initiate a spreading circle of electromagnetic waves and will thus be luminous. But as {{all of us who}} have toyed with magnets or charged balls well know, their forces (or any other forces for that matter), even when set in motion produce no luminance at all. It is inconceivable that you might constitute real luminance just by moving forces around!" [...] The problem is {{that he would have to}} wave the magnet up and down something like 450 trillion times per second in order to see anything.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetism in <b>bar</b> <b>magnets</b> and {{electromagnets}} {{does not}} arise from magnetic monopoles, but from electric charges (i.e. electric monopoles) carrying intrinsic angular momentum (i.e. spin) and/or [...] angular momentum, yielding magnetic dipoles.

50|$|The SMOT {{consists}} of a non-magnetic inclined plane, a series of permanent magnets, a steel ball and a non-magnetic track (e.g. aluminium).

6000|$|... 245. A thick {{copper plate}} (85.) was {{therefore}} fixed on a vertical axis, a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> was suspended by a plaited silk cord, {{so that its}} marked pole hung {{over the edge of}} the plate, and a sheet of paper being interposed, the plate was revolved; immediately the magnetic pole obeyed its motion and passed off in the same direction. A second magnet of equal size and strength was then attached to the first, so that its marked pole should hang beneath the edge of the copper plate in a corresponding position to that above, and at an equal distance (fig. 37.). Then a paper sheath or screen being interposed as before, and the plate revolved, the poles were found entirely indifferent to its motion, although either of them alone would have followed the course of rotation.|$|E
6000|$|... 1711. I {{arranged}} two magneto-electric helices {{with iron}} cores end to end, {{but with an}} interval of an inch and three quarters between them, in which interval was placed the end or pole of a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet.</b> It is evident, that on moving the magnetic pole from one core towards the other, a current would tend to form in both helices, in the one because of the lowering, {{and in the other}} because of the strengthening of the magnetism induced in the respective soft iron cores. The helices were connected together, and also with a galvanometer, so that these two currents should coincide in direction, and tend by their joint force to deflect the needle of the instrument. The whole arrangement was so effective and delicate, that moving the magnetic pole about the eighth of an inch to and fro two or three times, in periods equal to those required for the vibrations of the galvanometer needle, was sufficient to cause considerable vibration in the latter; thus showing readily the consequence of strengthening the influence of the magnet on the one core and helix, and diminishing it on the other.|$|E
6000|$|... 248. Then, {{with regard}} to the {{production}} of electricity in these cases:--whenever motion was communicated by the plate to the magnets, currents existed; when it was not communicated, they ceased. A marked pole of a large <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> was put under the edge of the plate; collectors (86.) applied at the axis and edge of the plate as on former occasions (fig. 38.), and these connected with the galvanometer; when the plate was revolved, abundance of electricity passed to the instrument. The unmarked pole of a similar magnet was then put over the place of the former pole, so that contrary poles were above and below; on revolving the plate, the electricity was more powerful than before. The latter magnet was then turned end for end, so that marked poles were both above and below the plate, and then, upon revolving it, scarcely any electricity was procured. By adjusting the distance of the poles so as to correspond with their relative force, they at last were brought so perfectly to neutralize each other's inductive action upon the plate, that no electricity could be obtained with the most rapid motion.|$|E

50|$|All known {{magnetic}} sources give dipole fields. However, to make {{a magnetic}} quadrupole {{it is possible to}} place four identical <b>bar</b> <b>magnets</b> perpendicular to each other such that the north pole of one is next to the south of the other.

5000|$|A {{permanent}} magnet, {{such as a}} <b>bar</b> <b>magnet,</b> {{owes its}} magnetism to the intrinsic magnetic dipole moment of the electron. The two ends of a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> {{are referred to as}} poles (not to be confused with monopoles), and may be labeled [...] "north" [...] and [...] "south". In terms of the Earth's magnetic field, they are respectively [...] "north-seeking" [...] and [...] "south-seeking" [...] poles: if the magnet were freely suspended in the Earth's magnetic field, the north-seeking pole would point towards the north and the south-seeking pole would point towards the south. The dipole moment of the <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> points from its magnetic south to its magnetic north pole. The north pole of a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> in a compass points north. However, that means that Earth's geomagnetic north pole is the south pole (south-seeking pole) of its dipole moment and vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of a {{voice coil}} driving a speaker cone, a magnetostatic speaker uses an array of metal strips bonded to a large film membrane. The {{magnetic}} field produced by signal current flowing through the strips interacts with the field of permanent <b>bar</b> <b>magnets</b> mounted behind them. The force produced moves the membrane and so the air in front of it. [...] Typically, these designs are less efficient than conventional moving-coil speakers.|$|R
50|$|When {{selecting}} a magnetic level gauge {{it is important}} {{to take into account the}} strength of the magnetic field. The magnetic field is the heart of the magnetic level gauge - the stronger the field, the more reliable the instrument will function. Some manufacturers rely on a single magnet for their magnetic level gauges which causes the strength of the north field to be identical to, and as weak as, the south field. It is apparent that at the location of the indicators, switches and transmitters, the field would not be as intense. Some manufacturers use a single annular ring magnet, others use a series of single <b>bar</b> <b>magnets</b> in a circular array in their float design. In this design the relative field strength of the north and south poles will be equal to one another and less than that of a dual magnet design. Moreover, the field strength as you travel around the circumference will have high and low spots as you pass between the individual <b>bar</b> <b>magnets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Under normal circumstances, even polar {{materials}} do not {{display a}} net dipole moment. As a consequence {{there are no}} electric dipole equivalents of <b>bar</b> <b>magnets</b> because the intrinsic dipole moment is neutralized by [...] "free" [...] electric charge that builds up on the surface by internal conduction or from the ambient atmosphere. Polar crystals only reveal their nature when perturbed in some fashion that momentarily upsets the balance with the compensating surface charge.|$|R
50|$|Early EMG pickup {{designs were}} made with a <b>bar</b> <b>magnet</b> inside for two reasons.
