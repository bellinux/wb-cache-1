25|$|Even {{though many}} studies have been {{undertaken}} in this area, neither position has yet claimed a consensus view in the academic literature. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} direct rebound effects are significant (about 30% for energy), but that there is not enough information about indirect effects to know whether or how often <b>back-fire</b> occurs. Economists tend to the first position, but most governments, businesses, and environmental groups adhere to the second. Governments and environmental groups often advocate further research into fuel efficiency and radical increases in the efficient use of energy as the primary means for reducing energy use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (to alleviate the impacts of climate change). However, if the first position more accurately reflects economic reality, current efforts to invent fuel-efficient technologies may not much reduce energy use, and may in fact paradoxically increase oil and coal consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, over the long run.|$|E

40|$|A burner for {{firing of}} grain was {{investigated}} for function, safety and emissions. Fuel, ash, particulates, gas and condensed flue {{gas from the}} inner surface of the chimney were analysed, and the stainless steel chimney were analysed with SEM/EDX. Three security systems should give a high safety against <b>back-firing,</b> provided the sensors are correctly placed and in function. Frequent cleaning of the boiler/burner was needed and some sintering noted. Emissions of CO and OGC were low, but of par-ticulates, NOx, SO 2 and HCl higher compared with pellet. The condensed moisture was very sour and had high content of chlorine. After 800 cycles, the chimney was ruined by corrosion. Establishing of a list of near-accidents and fires in cooperation with insurance companies and an inventory and closer study of suitable materials for chimneys is recommended. If grain firing expands, techniques for re-duction of particulates, nitrogen oxides and acidifying substances should be developed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Anti-patterns are motifs {{that are}} usually thought to be good {{solutions}} to some design or implementation problems, but <b>back-fires</b> badly when applied. Pre-vious studies have reported that anti-patterns make object oriented systems hard to maintain. Anti-patterns motifs usually have dependencies with other classes in the system. In this paper, we propose to analyse these dependencies (with in particu-lar design patterns) {{in order to understand}} how developers can maintain programs containing anti-patterns. To the best of our knowledge, no substantial investigation of anti-pattern dependencies with design patterns has been done before. This paper presents the results of a study that we performed on three different systems, Ar-goUML, JFreeChart, and XercesJ, written in Java, and of size ranges from 1; 191 to 3; 325 classes, to analyse the static relationships between anti-patterns and de-sign patterns. We found that these relationships (1) exist, but (2) are temporary and (3) classes participating in such relationships are more change-prone but less fault-prone than other anti-pattern classes...|$|R

60|$|When {{we speak}} of the courage {{and power of the}} Free States, we do not wish to be {{understood}} as descending to the vulgar level of meeting brag with brag. We speak of them only as among the elements to be gravely considered by the fanatics who may render it necessary for those who value the continued existence of this Confederacy as it deserves to be valued to kindle a <b>back-fire,</b> and to use the desperate means which God has put into their hands to be employed in the last extremity of free institutions. And when we use the term coercion, nothing is farther from our thoughts than the carrying of blood and fire among those whom we still consider our brethren of South Carolina. These civilized communities of ours have interests too serious to be risked on a childish wager of courage,--a quality that can always be bought cheaper than day-labor on a railway-embankment. We wish to see the Government strong enough for the maintenance of law, and for the protection, if need be, of the unfortunate Governor Pickens from the anarchy he has allowed himself to be made a tool of by evoking. Let the power of the Union be used for any other purpose than that of shutting and barring the door against the return of misguided men to their allegiance. At the same time we think legitimate and responsible force prudently exerted safer than the submission, without a struggle, to unlawful and irresponsible violence.|$|E

5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Graves enlisted almost immediately, taking a commission in the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers as a second lieutenant (on probation) on 12 August. He was confirmed in his rank on 10 March 1915, and received rapid promotion, being promoted to lieutenant on 5 May 1915 and to captain on 26 October. He published his first volume of poems, Over the Brazier, in 1916. He developed an early reputation as a war poet {{and was one of the}} first to write realistic poems about the experience of frontline conflict. In later years, he omitted his war poems from his collections, on the grounds that they were too obviously [...] "part of the war poetry boom." [...] At the Battle of the Somme, he was so badly wounded by a shell-fragment through the lung that he was expected to die and was officially reported as having died of wounds. He gradually recovered and, apart from a brief spell back in France, spent the remainder of the war in England.One of Graves's friends at this time was the poet Siegfried Sassoon, a fellow officer in his regiment. In 1917, Sassoon rebelled against the conduct of the war by making a public antiwar statement. Graves feared Sassoon could face a court martial and intervened with the military authorities, persuading them that Sassoon was suffering from shell shock and that they should treat him accordingly. As a result, Sassoon was sent to Craiglockhart, a military hospital in Edinburgh, where he was treated by Dr. W. H. R. Rivers and met fellow patient Wilfred Owen. Graves also suffered from shell shock, or neurasthenia as it was then called, but he was never hospitalised for it:I thought of going back to France, but realised the absurdity of the notion. Since 1916, the fear of gas obsessed me: any unusual smell, even a sudden strong smell of flowers in a garden, was enough to send me trembling. And I couldn't face the sound of heavy shelling now; the noise of a car <b>back-firing</b> would send me flat on my face, or running for cover.|$|R
40|$|Compliance {{is central}} to {{international}} law’s role in regulating the interactions of states. The rule of law requires compliance {{in order to be}} effective and makes compliance matter of international concern. State compliance {{is one of the most}} central questions in international law but despite the both practical and fundamental importance of the question, legal scholarship is still missing a satisfactory theory why and when states comply or do not comply with international law. International law like most laws is often obeyed but not enforced. It would be a fair assumption that parties’ interests are served by entering into the treaty and the existence of legally binding obligation translates into a presumption of compliance. However, the reasons for state compliance vary. Maybe surprisingly, the fear of official sanctions is rarely the reason for compliance. International law unlike domestic laws often lacks an official enforcement mechanism. This naturally creates a question, how binding is a law without enforcement? International health law has been viewed as ineffective in many senses of the word. In a legal sense when states failure to comply with their legal obligations and in a behavioral sense when states failure to change their own behavior as a result of a treaty, and also in a practical sense due to a treaty’s failure to accomplish its objectives. However the importance on human health shouldn’t need highlighting and in a global world public health is no longer just a domestic issue. If states choose to disobey their international health obligations, we are not talking about just a breach of agreement, but a health emergency that can affect millions of human lives. The International Health Regulations was renewed in 2005, but states are still showing reluctance to make global health governance less limited, more effective, and the World Health Organization is experiencing difficulties in enforcing the IHR in each contented area. Although the member states are legally bound to the IHR and the new IHR contains binding limits on the types of health measures states parties can take against public health risks, WHO still has no power to force states to comply with their IHR obligations. If WHO estimates that there is a poor cause to justify state’s actions, it can publicly comment state’s actions. The 2009 H 1 N 1 -pandemic was the first pandemic for forty years and the first true test for the revised Regulations, and the strengths and weaknesses of the Regulations are demonstrated in national responses to the 2009 pandemic. A major issue is whether effectiveness of the agreement depends upon enforcement mechanism and if an agreement can be effective without an enforcements mechanism, and if there is one, how will it work and is there a risk for <b>back-firing?</b> The new IHR is a binding treaty, but without an effective enforcement mechanism it is not a very strong one. Can a weak treaty have a strong future...|$|R
