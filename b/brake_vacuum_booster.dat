50|$|The first Boss Hosses offered {{included}} a one-speed manual transmission {{with a standard}} motorcycle hand clutch assisted by a Datsun B210 <b>brake</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster.</b> The bikes used a standard ten-spline 12 in disc clutch plate hooked to a Curtis spiral bevel gear box with a Chevrolet input shaft and a -inch output shaft that had an attached sprocket. The first bikes were chain driven but changed to 1.5 in Dayton belts in the early 1990s. The ratio of the gear box used was 1.53:1. In 1999, a one-speed semi-automatic transmission was available for the motorcycles that utilized a torque converter and a pump {{with a set of}} clutch plates and steels basically added to the previous design gearbox, which worked very well. In 2001, a two-speed semi-automatic transmission with overdrive became standard with a heel-toe shifter and a reverse gear. Boss Hoss trikes have always offered a three-speed semi-automatic transmission with a real reverse gear.|$|E

50|$|The most {{ubiquitous}} vacuum-powered accessory is the booster for {{the power}} <b>brake</b> system. The <b>vacuum</b> is only an assist and the brakes can still function, requiring greater force, if the <b>booster</b> <b>vacuum</b> is used up.|$|R
50|$|The master {{cylinder}} is located behind the driver’s side dashboard {{mounted on the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster.</b> The pressure inside of the {{master cylinder}} is created by a primary and secondary piston. These are pushed by the output rod of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> to compress fluid within its primary and secondary chambers (hydraulic pressure). The hydraulic pressure is translated through the brake lines to the brake calipers. When the brake fluid is pushed through the brake lines, the master cylinder chambers are replenished by the reservoir (attached {{to the top of}} the master cylinder).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{measures}} the performance parameter {{of the automobile}} braking system with Electronic <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Booster</b> (EVB) through real vehicle experiment. According to the data collected from the experiment, the performance parameters of EVBs in different cars are not the same. The performance parameters of the EVB in both test cars can be separated into three parts. For example, when the desired braking intension, in other words the input signal of electronic <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster,</b> is less than 7, the braking effect is not obvious; when the desired braking intension is between 7 ∼ 40, {{the relationship between the}} desired braking intension and the acceleration is found to be linear variation; when the desired braking intension is greater than 40, the wheels will be locked and the acceleration is constant. Then we get the performance parameter of automobile braking system with electronic <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> through linear regression. The results can be used for automatic brake control...|$|R
50|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> {{was invented}} in 1927 {{in order to provide}} a shorter {{stopping}} distance. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>boosters</b> provide <b>brake</b> assist for the driver by multiplying the force out of the booster creating more than the force that was used to push on the brake pedal. The booster works by pulling the air out of the booster chamber with a pump creating a low pressure system inside. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, the input rod on the booster is pushed in which lets atmospheric pressure into the booster. This, in turn, pushes the diaphragm toward the master cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Many older {{vehicles}} used vacuum-powered windshield wipers. Loss of {{manifold vacuum}} when {{the engine was}} working hard, or at wide open throttle, necessitated using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> pump which was usually part of the fuel pump.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> or <b>vacuum</b> servo {{is used in}} {{most modern}} {{hydraulic}} brake systems which contain four wheels. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> is attached between the master cylinder and the brake pedal and assists the braking force applied by the driver. These units consist of a hollow housing with a movable rubber diaphragm across the center, creating two chambers. When attached to the intake manifold of the engine or the vacuum pump, the pressure in both chambers of the unit is lowered. The equilibrium created by the low pressure in both chambers keeps the diaphragm from moving until the brake pedal is depressed. A return spring keeps the diaphragm in the starting position until the brake pedal is applied.|$|R

50|$|As an {{improvement}} to Pars, the 16V utilizes solid disc brakes on rear wheels, {{but unlike the}} ELX which is equipped with an advanced ABS/EBD, the 16V model uses the same <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster,</b> master cylinder, distributor, and hydraulic lines as the standard Pars.|$|R

50|$|On steam {{locomotives}} {{without a}} second independent brake system (like e.g. a compressed-air <b>brake,</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> or steam brake) for the engine, {{in addition to the}} usual counterweight or fixed brake, the countersteam brake was used as a braking system. Today, steam locomotives generally have to have two independent brake systems in order to be licensed, so that the countersteam brake is not viewed as a braking system, but is nevertheless still used.|$|R
50|$|When new, the {{locomotive}} had Westinghouse air brakes, and dual air and <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> were {{provided for the}} train. For operations in the Netherlands, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> equipment was disconnected.

5000|$|While the {{locomotive}} itself used air brakes, {{it was only}} equipped to operate trains with <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes.</b> While hauling a train, {{the locomotive}}'s air brake system would be made subordinate to the train's <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> system and would come into operation as the <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> were being applied, gradually building up to its maximum of [...] While working a train downgrade, the locomotive's regenerative braking system would also work {{in conjunction with the}} train's <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> is an {{important}} assembly part of the auto brake system.

The virtual instrument based on LabVIEW is a kind of advanced technique with powerful analytical ability, flexible configure and rich tool modules providing many advantages for engineering test in virtue of computer and digital signal processing. The thesis based on its advantage to teat the performance of <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> in a simulated work conditions, which is based on the National Standard of GB 12676 - 1999, QC/T 307 - 1999 and QC/T 308 - 1999. The test system has been designed with the integration of hydraulic pressure control technology, data acquirisition technology, electro mechanics and virtual apparatus. The result indicated that the test system was reliable and the data acquirisition was accurate. Especially, the system could simulate the instance of auto in the state of long slope braking or frequent braking and has certain superiority compared with existing equipment...|$|R

50|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> is a {{braking system}} {{employed}} on trains and {{introduced in the}} mid-1860s. A variant, the automatic <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> system, became almost universal in British train equipment and in countries influenced by British practice. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> also enjoyed {{a brief period of}} adoption in the United States, primarily on narrow-gauge railroads.

5|$|When the GWR {{was opened}} no trains in the United Kingdom were fitted with <b>vacuum</b> <b>brakes,</b> instead handbrakes were fitted to {{individual}} wagons and trains also conveyed brake vans where a guard had {{control of a}} screw-operated brake.

50|$|Vehicles can {{be fitted}} with dual <b>brakes,</b> <b>vacuum</b> and air, {{provided}} {{that there is}} room to fit the duplicated equipment.
