5000|$|Lower <b>bainite</b> forms between 250 and 400 °C {{and takes}} a more plate-like form than upper <b>bainite.</b> There {{are not nearly as}} many low angle {{boundaries}} between laths in lower <b>bainite.</b> In lower <b>bainite,</b> the habit plane in ferrite will also shift from <111> towards <110> as transformation temperature decreases. [...] In lower <b>bainite,</b> cementite nucleates on the interface between ferrite and austenite.|$|E
50|$|A fine non-lamellar structure, <b>bainite</b> {{commonly}} {{consists of}} cementite and dislocation-rich ferrite. The {{high concentration of}} dislocations in the ferrite present in <b>bainite</b> makes this ferrite harder than it normally would be.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s Davenport and Bain {{discovered}} a new steel microstructure which they provisionally called martensite-troostite, due to it being intermediate between the already known low-temperature martensite phase and what was then known as troostite (now fine-pearlite). This microstructure was subsequently named <b>bainite</b> by Bain's colleagues at the United States Steel Corporation [...] although {{it took some time}} for the name to be taken up by the scientific community with books as late as 1947 failing to mention <b>bainite</b> by name. Bain and Davenport also noted the existence of two distinct forms: 'upper-range' <b>bainite</b> which formed at higher temperatures and 'lower-range' <b>bainite</b> which formed near the martensite start temperature (these forms are now known as upper- and lower-bainite respectively). The early terminology was further confused by the overlap, in some alloys, of the lower-range of the pearlite reaction and the upper-range of the <b>bainite</b> with the additional possibility of proeutectoid ferrite.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} range for transformation of austenite to <b>bainite</b> (250-550 °C) is between those for pearlite and martensite. When formed during continuous cooling, the cooling rate to form <b>bainite</b> is more rapid than that required to form pearlite, but less rapid than {{is required to}} form martensite (in steels of the same composition). Most alloying elements will lower the temperature required for the maximum rate of formation of <b>bainite,</b> though carbon {{is the most effective}} in doing so.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bainite</b> is {{a similar}} {{structure}} with lamellae {{much smaller than the}} wavelength of visible light and thus lacks this pearlescent appearance. It is prepared by more rapid cooling. Unlike pearlite, whose formation involves the diffusion of all atoms, <b>bainite</b> grows by a displacive transformation mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Composition {{control of}} weld metal is often {{performed}} to maximise the volume fraction of acicular ferrite {{due to the}} toughness it imparts. During continuous cooling, higher alloy contents or faster cooling generally delay transformation, which will then take place at lower temperatures, below the <b>bainite</b> start temperature, and lead to higher hardness. The efficacy of inclusions as nucleation sites in modern low alloy steel weld metals is such that fine-scale intragranular <b>bainite</b> can nucleate on them, both by continuous cooling and by isothermal transformation below the <b>bainite</b> start temperature. Some confusion has arisen in the literature, as this fine-scale intragranular <b>bainite,</b> which can resemble acicular ferrite in appearance in the optical microscope, has been called acicular ferrite by some researchers. See, for example.|$|E
50|$|No {{tempering}} {{is required}} after austempering if the part is through hardened and fully transformed to either <b>Bainite</b> or ausferrite. Tempering adds another stage and thus {{cost to the}} process; it does not provide the same property modification and stress relief in <b>Bainite</b> or ausferrite that it does for virgin Martensite.|$|E
50|$|Early {{research}} on <b>bainite</b> found {{that at a}} given temperature only a certain volume fraction of the austenite would transform to <b>bainite</b> with the remainder decomposing to pearlite after an extended delay. This was the case {{despite the fact that}} a complete austenite to pearlite transformation could be achieved at higher temperatures where the austenite was more stable. The fraction of <b>bainite</b> that could form increased as the temperature decreased. This was ultimately explained by accounting for the fact that when the bainitic ferrite formed the supersaturated carbon would be expelled to the surrounding austenite thus thermodynamically stabilising it against further transformation.|$|E
50|$|The microstructures of {{martensite}} and <b>bainite</b> {{at first}} seem quite similar. This {{is a consequence}} of the two microstructures sharing many aspects of their transformation mechanisms. However, morphological differences do exist that require a transmission electron microscope to see. Under a light microscope, the microstructure of <b>bainite</b> appears darker than martensite due to its low reflectivity.|$|E
50|$|When the cut ends of TMT {{bars are}} etched in Nital (a mixture of nitric acid and methanol), three {{distinct}} rings appear: 1. A tempered outer ring of martensite, 2. A semi-tempered middle ring of martensite and <b>bainite,</b> and 3. a mild circular core of <b>bainite,</b> ferrite and pearlite. This is the desired micro structure for quality construction rebar.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the holding-temperature, {{austempering}} {{can produce}} either upper or lower <b>bainite.</b> Upper <b>bainite</b> is a laminate structure formed at temperatures typically above 350 C {{and is a}} much tougher microstructure. Lower <b>bainite</b> is a needle-like structure, produced at temperatures below 350 °C, and is stronger but much more brittle. In either case, austempering produces greater strength and toughness for a given hardness, which is determined mostly by composition rather than cooling speed, and reduced internal stresses {{which could lead to}} breakage. This produces steel with superior impact resistance. Modern punches and chisels are often austempered. Because austempering does not produce martensite, the steel does not require further tempering.|$|E
50|$|Austempering is a {{technique}} used to form pure <b>bainite,</b> a transitional microstructure found between pearlite and martensite. In normalizing, both upper and lower <b>bainite</b> are usually found mixed with pearlite. To avoid the formation of pearlite or martensite, the steel is quenched in a bath of molten metals or salts. This quickly cools the steel past the point where pearlite can form, and into the bainite-forming range. The steel is then held at the bainite-forming temperature, beyond {{the point where the}} temperature reaches an equilibrium, until the <b>bainite</b> fully forms. The steel is then removed from the bath and allowed to air-cool, without the formation of either pearlite or martensite.|$|E
50|$|However, greater {{undercooling}} by rapid quenching {{results in}} {{formation of martensite}} or <b>bainite</b> instead of pearlite. This is possible provided the cooling rate is such that the cooling curve intersects the martensite start temperature or the <b>bainite</b> start curve before intersecting the Ps curve. The martensite transformation being a diffusionless shear transformation is represented by a straight line to signify the martensite start temperature.|$|E
50|$|Since 1983, Xu was {{a member}} and honorable member of International Advisory Committee of Martensitic Transformations and later {{became a member of}} International Committee of <b>Bainite.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Bainite</b> {{occupies}} a region {{between these two}} process in a temperature range where iron self-diffusion is limited but there is insufficient driving force to form martensite. In contrast to pearlite, where the ferrite and cementite grow cooperatively, <b>bainite</b> forms by the transformation of carbon-supersaturated ferrite with the subsequent diffusion of carbon and the precipitation of carbides. A further distinction is often made between so-called lower-bainite, which forms at temperatures closer to the martensite start temperature, and upper-bainite which forms at higher temperatures. This distinction arises from the diffusion rates of carbon at the temperature at which the <b>bainite</b> is forming. If the temperature is high then the carbon will diffuse rapidly away from the newly formed ferrite and form carbides in the carbon-enriched residual austenite between the ferritic plates leaving them carbide-free. At low temperatures the carbon will diffuse more sluggishly and may precipitate before it can leave the bainitic ferrite. There is some controversy over the specifics of bainite's transformation mechanism; both theories are represented below.|$|E
50|$|Examples of symplectites {{formed in}} Earth {{materials}} include dolomite + calcite, aragonite + calcite, and magnetite + clinopyroxene. Symplectite formation {{is important in}} metallurgy: <b>bainite</b> or pearlite formation from the decomposition of austenite, for example.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Time-Temperature-Transformation diagram for two steels: {{one with}} 0.4% wt. C (red line) {{and one with}} 0.4% wt. C and 2% weight Mn (green line). P = pearlite, B = <b>bainite</b> and M = martensite.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{theories}} on the specific formation mechanism for <b>bainite</b> is that it occurs by a shear transformation, as in martensite. The transformation is said to cause a stress-relieving effect, which is confirmed by the orientation relationships present in bainitic microstructures. [...] There are, however, similar stress-relief effects seen in transformations that are {{not considered to be}} martensitic in nature, but the term 'similar' does not imply identical. The relief associated with <b>bainite</b> is an invariant—plane strain with a large shear component. The only diffusion that occurs by this theory is during the formation of the carbide phase (usually cementite) between the ferrite plates.|$|E
50|$|These bars {{therefore}} {{exhibit a}} variation in microstructure in their cross section, having strong, tough, tempered martensite {{in the surface}} layer of the bar, an intermediate layer of martensite and <b>bainite,</b> and a refined, tough and ductile ferrite and pearlite core.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Time-temperature {{transformation}} (TTT) diagram for steel. The red curves represent different cooling rates (velocity) when cooled {{from the}} upper critical (A3) temperature. V1 produces martensite. V2 has pearlite mixed with martensite, V3 produces <b>bainite,</b> along with pearlite and matensite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bainite</b> is an {{intermediate}} of pearlite and martensite {{in terms of}} hardness. For this reason, the bainitic microstructure becomes useful in that no additional heat treatments are required after initial cooling to achieve a hardness value between that of pearlitic and martensitic steels.|$|E
50|$|Tempering {{may also}} be {{performed}} on normalized steels. Other methods of tempering consist of quenching to a specific temperature, which is above the martensite start temperature, and then holding it there until pure <b>bainite</b> can form or internal stresses can be relieved. These include austempering and martempering.|$|E
50|$|TRIP steel has a {{microstructure}} {{consisting of}} retained austenite in a ferrite matrix. Apart from retained austenite it also contains hard phases like <b>bainite</b> and martensite. The higher silicon and carbon content of TRIP steels results in significant volume fractions of retained austenite {{in the final}} microstructure.|$|E
50|$|TRIP steels use higher {{quantities}} of carbon than dual-phase steels to obtain sufficient carbon content for stabilizing the retained austenite phase to below ambient temperature. Higher contents of silicon and/or aluminium accelerate the ferrite/bainite formation. They are also added to avoid formation of carbide in the <b>bainite</b> region.|$|E
50|$|Austempering is heat {{treatment}} that {{is applied to}} ferrous metals, most notably steel and ductile iron. In steel it produces a <b>bainite</b> microstructure whereas in cast irons it produces a structure of acicular ferrite and high carbon, stabilized austenite known as ausferrite. It is primarily used to improve mechanical properties or reduce / eliminate distortion. Austempering is defined by both {{the process and the}} resultant microstructure. Typical austempering process parameters applied to an unsuitable material will not result in the formation of <b>bainite</b> or ausferrite and thus the final product will not be called austempered. Both microstructures may also be produced via other methods. For example, they may be produced as-cast or air cooled with the proper alloy content. These materials are also not referred to as austempered.|$|E
5000|$|Edgar Collins Bain (September 14, 1891 [...] - [...] November 27, 1971) was an American {{metallurgist}} {{and member}} of the National Academy of Sciences, who worked for the US Steel Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He worked on the alloying and heat treatment of steel; <b>Bainite</b> is named in his honor.|$|E
5000|$|Isothermal {{transformation}} (IT) diagram or the C-curve {{is associated}} with mechanical properties, microconstituents/microstructures, and heat treatments in carbon steels. Diffusional transformations like austenite transforming to a cementite and ferrite mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; For example the beginning of pearlitic transformation {{is represented by the}} pearlite start (Ps) curve. This transformation is complete at Pf curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of microconstituent growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in free energy. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, Pearlite and <b>Bainite,</b> form; Pearlite [...] forms at higher temperatures and <b>bainite</b> at lower.|$|E
50|$|When the {{solution}} above the transformation point is solid, rather than liquid, an analogous eutectoid transformation can occur. For instance, in the iron-carbon system, the austenite phase can undergo a eutectoid transformation to produce ferrite and cementite, often in lamellar {{structures such as}} pearlite and <b>bainite.</b> This eutectoid point occurs at 727 C and about 0.76% carbon.|$|E
50|$|Normalizing is a {{technique}} used to provide uniformity in grain size and composition (equiaxing) throughout an alloy. The term is often used for ferrous alloys that have been austenitized and then cooled in open air. Normalizing not only produces pearlite, but also martensite and sometimes <b>bainite,</b> which gives harder and stronger steel, but with less ductility for the same composition than full annealing.|$|E
50|$|Ledeburite-II (at ambient temperature) is {{composed}} of cementite-I with recrystallized secondary cementite (which separates from austenite as the metal cools) and (with slow cooling) of pearlite. The pearlite results from the eutectoidal decay of the austenite {{that comes from the}} ledeburite-I at 723 °C. During more rapid cooling, <b>bainite</b> can develop instead of pearlite, and with very rapid cooling martensite can develop.|$|E
5000|$|Typically <b>bainite</b> manifests as aggregates, termed sheaves, of ferrite plates (sub-units) {{separated}} by retained austenite, martensite or cementite. While the sub-units appear separate when viewed on a 2-dimensional section {{they are in}} fact interconnected in 3-dimensions and usually take on a lenticular plate or lath morphology. The sheaves themselves are wedge-shaped with the thicker end associated with the nucleation site.|$|E
50|$|Martempering {{is similar}} to austempering, in that the steel is {{quenched}} in a bath of molten metal or salts to quickly cool it past the pearlite-forming range. However, in martempering, {{the goal is to}} create martensite rather than <b>bainite.</b> The steel is quenched to a much lower temperature than is used for austempering; to just above the martensite start temperature. The metal is then held at this temperature until the temperature of the steel reaches an equilibrium. The steel is then removed from the bath before any <b>bainite</b> can form, and then is allowed to air-cool, turning it into martensite. The interruption in cooling allows much of the internal stresses to relax before the martensite forms, decreasing the brittleness of the steel. However, the martempered steel will usually need to undergo further tempering to adjust the hardness and toughness, except in rare cases where maximum hardness is needed but the accompanying brittleness is not. Modern files are often martempered.|$|E
50|$|Austempering is a {{hardening}} {{process that is}} used on iron-based metals to promote better mechanical properties. The metal is heated into the austenite region of the iron-cementite phase diagram and then quenched in a salt bath or other heat extraction medium that is between temperatures of 300 - 375 C. The metal is annealed in this temperature range until the austenite turns to <b>bainite</b> or ausferrite (bainitic ferrite + high-carbon austenite).|$|E
50|$|Mild steel (carbon steel with up {{to about}} 0.2 wt% C) consist mostly of ferrite and {{increasing}} amounts of cementite (iron carbide) in a laminar structure called pearlite. Since <b>bainite</b> and pearlite each have ferrite as a component, any iron-carbon alloy will contain some amount of ferrite if it is allowed to reach equilibrium at room temperature. The exact amount of ferrite {{will depend on the}} cooling process the iron-carbon alloy undergoes as it cools.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bainite</b> is a plate-like {{microstructure}} {{that forms}} in steels at temperatures of 250-550 °C (depending on alloy content). First described by E. S. Davenport and Edgar Bain, {{it is one}} of the products that may form when austenite (the face centered cubic crystal structure of iron) is cooled past a critical temperature. This critical temperature is 1000 K (727 °C, 1340 °F) in plain carbon steels. Davenport and Bain originally described the microstructure as being similar in appearance to tempered martensite.|$|E
50|$|Interrupted {{quenching}} {{methods are}} {{often referred to}} as tempering, although the processes are very different from traditional tempering. These methods consist of quenching to a specific temperature that is above the martensite start (Ms) temperature, and then holding at that temperature for extended amounts of time. Depending on the temperature and the amount of time, this allows either pure <b>bainite</b> to form, or holds-off forming the martensite until much of the internal stresses relax. These methods are known as austempering and martempering.|$|E
