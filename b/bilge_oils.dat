40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{bacterial}} strains, i. e. Pseudomonas mendocina and Ochrobactrum sp. {{were isolated}} from <b>bilge</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated water of Mormugao harbour, Goa, India and grown {{in a culture}} medium with hexadecane as the sole carbon source. Pseudomonas mendocina was used in further studies {{as it was the}} dominant strain. This strain effectively degraded tetradecane, hexadecane and octadecane leaving a residual concentration of about 73 %, 54 % and 40 % respectively in 120 h. Sequence analysis of the dominant bands from the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles revealed the differences between the genera of <b>bilge</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated sea water and its enrichment culture on hexadecane indicating a shift in community structure based on the type of substrate available. Pseudomonas mendocina amplified for the following catabolic genes namely C 23 O, nid and ndo. Based on the catabolic gene study the potential of the bacterial strain isolated, i. e. Pseudomonas mendocina seems to be interesting as {{it will be able to}} degrade polyaromatic hydrocarbons as well. Physicochemical properties of Pseudomonas mendocina indicates production of exopolysaccharides based on the value of its isoelectric point...|$|R

40|$|The 1996 Northern {{fur seal}} harvest went well this year. The harvest started on 26 June and ended on 8 August. A total of 1591 (1588 subadult males and 3 young adult females) seals were killed. This year's harvest went fairly well and animals were handled {{and killed in}} a humane fashion. The only major problem that {{occurred}} this year was at Zapadni on 1 July when approximately 10 seals {{were said to have}} died due to hyperthermia. I do not know any of the details on this incident and was given the number 10 by Darlene Melovidov. Some of the activites that could have gone wrong was that the animals were driven to fast on a relative warm day without much wind. The drive on Zapadni {{is one of the more}} difficult drives from the haulout areas to the killing field, Northeast Point, being the longest. The harvest was stopped three times this year, twice due to the weather being to hot (1 July- Zapadni and 26 July " Kitovia) and once to heavy rain (28 July-Zapadni). Four animals were found with oil contamination on the fur of the abdomen this year. These animals were found on Polovina (one animal- 28 July) and Lukanin (two animals- 2 August and one animal- 6 August). The oiled skins were identical to what has been observed for the last two years and is suggestive of contamination with <b>bilge</b> <b>oil.</b> In 1994, 23 animals were found with oil and in 1995 three animals were found.

40|$|Two key {{maritime}} surveillance applications for RADARSAT- 2 are ship detection and oil slick detection. Ship detection applications primarily focuses on illegal <b>bilge</b> dumping and <b>oil</b> slick detection {{focuses on the}} detection of natural oil seeps and the accidental discharge of oil from offshore drilling platforms. Ship detection depends on three main parameters: wind, ship properties, and radar characteristics. Ship detection improves with decreasing wind speed and increasing ship length. The use of cross-polarized data in the near-range and co-polarized data in the far-range provide good ship detection performance across {{a wide range of}} incidence angles. Oil slick detection depends primarily on wind speed. Radar polarization also plays a role in oil slick detection. Co-polarized (HH or VV) images provide similar results, but cross-polarized return is generally not used due to weak scattering from oil. Case studies that outline the application of RADARSAT- 2 data for oil spill monitoring, oil seep mapping, and illegal bilge dumping are discussed. End user needs are discussed as either a requirement for data or information products. To be of the greatest value both data and information products are usually needed in a timely manner, and must be interpretable and interoperable, allowing for end users to use the information in any manner.

40|$|Oil slicks {{caused by}} oil tanker {{accidents}} compose {{a major source}} of hydrocarbon pollution for the marine and coastal environment and can jeopardize its functional integrity. However, the deliberate discharge of oil and oily residues associated with routine tanker operations (<b>bilges</b> residues, tank <b>oil</b> sediments) and from illegal activities, highlights a far-reaching source of pollution perhaps more important than the one caused by accidents (EEA, 2002). The Adriatic Sea with an annual oil transport of 70 MT (million tons) is probably highly affected by operational pollution. Estimates give about 15 000 mt (metric tons) of such residues deliberately discharged every year denoting a major hazard for the marine and coastal environment of Adriatic region (Bilardo et al, 2004)). Risk mapping appears as the most appropriate way to approach the management of oil pollution in marine areas and in order to assess the ecosystem health state. Modern risk mapping should, tackle the intrinsic variability of the marine environment and the lack of knowledge regarding the cause-effects relationships on vulnerability of resources, in other words should consider the inherent uncertainty of the system. Thus risk management requires products that are time-dependent and that allow the continuous assessment of the system space and time variability. Modern operational oceanography gives the appropriate time and space resolution for the ocean hydrodynamics (Pinardi et al., 2003) so that time dependent risk mapping can be developed...|$|R
40|$|Man live in two worlds, the {{biosphere}} and the techno sphere world over the years, time needs, growth, speed, and knowledge and competition have created demand that necessitated man to build complex institution. Ship design is not {{left out in}} this process. Inland water, are under treat from untreated waste that can feed bacteria and algae, which in turn exhaust the oxygen. The ocean cover 70 % of the globe, many think that everything that run into it is infinite, the ocean is providing the source of freshening winds and current that are far more vulnerable to polluting activities that have run off into them too many poisons, that the ocean may cease to serve more purpose if care is not taking to prevent pollution. This issue of environment becomes so sensitive in recently and most are linked to infrastructure development work. Most especially in maritime industry polluting activities from <b>oil</b> <b>bilge</b> to ballast pumping that has turned into poison has advert effect on water resources. Some have choked too much estuarine water where there is fish spawn. In a nutshell, the two worlds we live are currently out of balance and in potential conflict. Man {{is in the middle}}, and since the treat are mostly water related, ship is in the middle too. Historical records of number of calamity that has resulted to heavy lost and pollution call for environmentally sound ship. This has led to a number of regulations today that will subsequently affect policies change and procedures interaction with the system. The current situation has affected the design of new ships and modification of existing ships.

40|$|Lithuania {{is one of}} the {{countries}} that have ratified the Marpol 73 / 78 Convention which foresees the tools of reduction and prevention of sea pollution with bilge water and other substances. The Directive of the European Parliament and Council 2000 / 59 /EB is addressed to the reduction of waste on board of ships and its wash overboard [...] Analysis of the ships entering Klaipėda Sea Port has estimated that oil waste comprises about 74 % of the whole collected waste amount. The analysis of technological flows and documents has indicated problematic points in the following processes: 1. collection of oily and engine bilge water from ships; 2. collection of spilled overboard oil products; 3. exploitation of intermediate accumulative reservoirs in the port; 4. regular transportation of accumulated oily water engine bilge water to the oil-polluted water treatment station; 5. distribution, storage, treatment (mechanical, physical, sorption) of pumped engine <b>bilge</b> water. Among <b>oil</b> polluted waste, its specific kind - oily water emerges in ports and it is called "engine bilge water" in the Waste Management Regulations. Engine bilge water is specific and hazardous to the environment as it is a liquid compound of water and oil products capable of making steady emulsions. It also acquires specific properties during various technological processes. Equipment, technological processes, specificity of the control related to combustibility and inflammability, as well as conformity to the requirements of the International and EU Rights, technological processes management and documents are needed for the management of this specific waste. For this reason, separation of this oily water from the common oil-polluted waste and analysis of these streams of waste treatment are of great importance in enhancement of the effectiveness of environmental protection during the management process of this oily waste. Applying a system approach to the oily waste in the port, a waste management system algorithm based on the life cycle has been set up. The system of port waste management is a set of technological processes, each of them performing a certain function and demanding for stock, electric energy, fuel, transport, heat, technological equipment, etc. Having completed the analysis, the algorithm assessing the supervision of technological processes and documents of engine bilge water management and a schematic diagram of the life cycle have been set up which make it possible:- to assess the supervision of formation, collection and utilization of oily and engine bilge water;- to effectively control energy and stock quantities supplied to each stage of a technological process;- to identify and assess the sources of the environmental pollution (ambient air, water, waste);- to foresee and evaluate the priority regions of optimization of engine bilge water management. Having made the environmental assessment, it was suggested to convert the waste resulting from the engine bilge water treatment into the energy and to use it in a technological process when closing (finishing) the life-cycle. While exploiting ships and their mechanisms a particular type of waste is made – water which contains oil and its products. Such water is called oily-bilge water otherwise ballast waters, because of the accidental spillage during carrying out various technological processes sea water is polluted and thus a danger is caused to the environment. Oily-bilge water is particular water which contains different carbohydrates, fuel oil, lubricating oil, light benzene fractions etc. thus the cleaning of such water to a certain degree is hardly possible using traditional technologies. According to the previous scientific researches it was determined that oily water cleaning needs absorbing substances. There comes up a purpose to choose available sorbents, which are applicable widely in different technological processes. In the article investigation results were received with five absorbing substances (granular absorbent carbon, friable absorbent carbon, wood dust, wood sawdust and clay). The object of the research comprises the determinant of oily water cleaning degree and sorption effectiveness by using chosen methods.  ...|$|R
