5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped the generals would relent <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington.

5|$|Oryzomys from Costa Rica have {{historically}} been referred to O.c.couesi, but Hanson and colleagues found that two specimens from Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre Mixto Maquenque, northeastern Costa Rica, differed as much from other O.couesi (11.93% Cytb sequence divergence) as O.couesi differed from the marsh rice rat (11.30%). They suggested that these animals represented a species distinct from O.couesi, but were unable to resolve the correct name for the species <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> examine samples of dimidiatus or richmondi.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound varies with {{temperature}}. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. In the 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.|$|E

40|$|SummarySynesthesia is {{a benign}} {{neurological}} condition in humans characterized by involuntary cross-activation of the senses, and estimated to affect at least 1 % {{of the population}} [1]. Multiple forms of synesthesia exist, including distinct visual, tactile or gustatory perceptions which are automatically triggered by a stimulus with different sensory properties [1 – 6], such as seeing colors when hearing music. Surprisingly, {{there has been no}} previous report of synesthetic sound perception. Here we report that auditory synesthesia does indeed exist with evidence from four healthy adults for whom seeing visual flashes or visual motion automatically causes the perception of sound. As an objective test, we show that ‘hearing-motion synesthetes’ outperformed normal control subjects on an otherwise difficult visual task involving rhythmic temporal patterns similar to Morse code. Synesthetes had an advantage <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> only see, but also hear the rhythmic visual patterns.

Six islanders died in each of the World Wars; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island's war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the {{population}} was on war service. Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred additional expenses for their parents.|$|E

No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but some individual members were deported for working illegally.|$|E
5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|The Union {{military}} command in the West {{suffered from a}} lack of unified command, and were organized into three separate departments: the Department of Kansas, under Maj. Gen. David Hunter; the Department of Missouri, under Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck; and the Department of the Ohio, under Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell. By January 1862, the disunity was apparent <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> agree on a strategy for operations in the Western Theater. Buell, under political pressure to invade and hold pro-Union eastern Tennessee, moved slowly in the direction of Nashville. In Halleck's department, Grant moved up the Tennessee River to divert attention from Buell's intended advance, which did not occur. Halleck and the other generals in the West were coming under political pressure from President Abraham Lincoln to participate in a general offensive by Washington's birthday (February 22). Despite his tradition of caution, Halleck eventually reacted positively to Grant's proposal to move against Fort Henry. Halleck hoped that this would improve his standing in relation to his rival, Buell. Halleck and Grant were also concerned about rumors that Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard would soon arrive with 15 Confederate regiments. On January 30, 1862, Halleck authorized Grant to take Fort Henry.|$|E
50|$|It is {{suggested}} by Leo Rosten, in his book The Joys of Yiddish, {{that as soon as}} they left the boat, they were subject to racism from the port immigration authorities.

5|$|Oryzomys {{is rare in}} Panama. Panamanian Oryzomys {{were first}} {{described}} by Goldman in 1912, who introduced the name Oryzomys gatunensis for a specimen from Gatún in the Canal Zone. In 1918, Goldman kept the animal as a separate species, remarking that it was similar to richmondi, but distinctive in the well-developed ridges along {{the margins of the}} interorbital region, the short interparietal bone (part of the roof of the braincase), and the long nasal bones. In 1937, Bole described another species of Panamanian Oryzomys, Oryzomys azuerensis from Paracoté, Veraguas Province. It is a brown form, lacking the reddish tones of nearby populations, and has a broad skull with a short rostrum (front part) and ridges on the interorbital region like those of gatunensis. Although Goldman recommended to him that gatunensis and azuerensis both be treated as subspecies of couesi, Bole described azuerensis as a species because it did not seem intermediate between the geographically closest forms, gatunensis and couesi, and was separated by a large gap from the nearest known populations of O.couesi in northwestern Costa Rica and southeastern Nicaragua. In a 1966 review of Panamanian mammals, Charles Handley reduced both gatunensis and azuerensis to subspecies of the marsh rice rat (in which O.couesi was included at the time), and when O.couesi was reinstated as a separate species these forms went with it. Specimens from near the type locality of azuerensis differ by about 7% in their Cytb sequences from other O.couesi, which suggests that they may represent a separate species. However, Hanson and colleagues did not reinstate azuerensis as a species, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> examine samples of gatunensis.|$|E

The club used to swim in the River Medway, and would hold races, diving competitions and water polo matches. The South East Gazette July 1844 reported an aquatic breakfast party: coffee and biscuits were served on a floating raft in the river.
