40|$|The saprophagous larvae of bibionid flies harbor {{bacteria}} in their alkaline intestinal tracts, but {{little is known}} about the contribution of the gut microbiota to the digestion of their recalcitrant diet. In this study, we measured oxygen and hydrogen partial pressure, redox potential and pH in the midgut, gastric caeca and hindgut of larvae of the <b>bibionid</b> <b>fly</b> Penthetria holosericea with Clark-type O 2 and H 2 microsensors, platinum redox microelectrodes, and LIX-type pH microelectrodes. The center of the midgut lumen was anoxic, whereas gastric caeca and hindgut were hypoxic. However, redox potential profiles indicated oxidizing conditions throughout the gut, with lowest values in the midgut (+ 20 to + 60 mV). Hydrogen production was not detected. The midgut was extremely alkaline (pH around 11), whereas hindgut and gastric caeca were neutral to slightly alkaline. While HPLC analysis showed high concentrations of glucose in the midgut (15 mM) and gastric caeca (27 mM), the concentrations of microbial fermentation products such as lactate (2 - 4 mM), acetate (< 1 mM) and succinate (< 0. 5 mM) were low in all gut regions, suggesting that the contribution of microorganisms to the digestive process, particularly in the alkaline midgut, is only of minor importance. We conclude that the digestive strategy of the saprophytic larva of P. holosericea, which feeds selectively on decomposed leaves and its own microbe-rich faeces, differs fundamentally from those of detritivorous and humivorous insects, which host a highly active, fermentative microbiota in their alkaline midgut or hindgut compartments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
50|$|Bibionids {{have the}} most {{extensive}} fossil record of any dipteran family. Fossil bibionids are known questionably from the Jurassic, while some forms from {{the early part of}} the Upper Cretaceous look quite similar to modern species. <b>Bibionid</b> <b>flies</b> are very abundant among insect fossils from the Tertiary period, and a large number of species have been described, although often based on highly fragmentary material.Most fossil species are easily identified with extant genera. In particular, the genera Plecia and Bibio are abundant among Tertiary fossils. Fossils from Europe include a large number of specimens of the mainly tropical genus Plecia which is today entirely absent from Europe, demonstrating a warmer climate during the Tertiary.|$|R
40|$|Background Seventeen {{distinct}} pollination {{systems are}} known for genera of sub-Saharan African Iridaceae and recurrent shifts in pollination system have evolved in those with ten or more species. Pollination by long-tongued anthophorine bees foraging for nectar and coincidentally acquiring pollen on some part of their bodies is the inferred ancestral pollination strategy for most genera of the large subfamilies Iridoideae and Crocoideae and may be ancestral for the latter. Derived strategies include pollination by long-proboscid flies, large butterflies, night-flying hovering and settling moths, hopliine beetles and sunbirds. Bee pollination is diverse, with active pollen collection by female bees occurring in several genera, vibratile systems {{in a few and}} non-volatile oil as a reward in one species. Long-proboscid fly pollination, which is apparently restricted to southern Africa, includes four separate syndromes using different sets of flies and plant species {{in different parts of the}} subcontinent. Small numbers of species use <b>bibionid</b> <b>flies,</b> short-proboscid flies or wasps for their pollination; only about 2 % of species use multiple pollinators and can be described as generalists. Scope Using pollination observations for 375 species and based on repeated patterns of floral attractants and rewards, we infer pollination mechanisms for an additional 610 species. Matching pollination system to phylogeny or what is known about species relationships based on shared derived features, we infer repeated shifts in pollination system in some genera, as frequently as one shift for every five or six species of southern Africa...|$|R
40|$|Novel, {{specialized}} systems exploiting <b>bibionid</b> <b>flies,</b> oil-collecting bees, wasps, or crepuscular settling moths as pollen vectors {{are added}} to the range of recorded pollination mechanisms in sub-Saharan Africa Iridaceae, while knowledge of the pollination of previously understudied genera such as Aristea, Bahiana, Ferraria, Hesperantha, and Tritoniopsis is expanded. The pollination of 357 species of the sub-Saharan African Iridaceae now includes 17 discrete systems. Based on repetitive interlinked suites of floral attractants and rewards we now infer pollination mechanisms for an additional 883 species. Many pollination systems recur in genera containing 3 ̆e 10 species. The ancestral pollination in African Iridaceae, and also the most common one, involves large, long-tongued bees that contact anthers or stigmas passively while foraging for nectar. Some 182 species (in 11 genera) lack nectar or oil and pollinators forage preferentially for pollen. Our earlier hypothesis that the diversity of pollination mechanisms within a lineage increases via adaptive radiation and/or character displacement involving simple shifts in floral presentation is expanded to include the role of phylogenetic constraint. Specifically, possession of the meranthium flower in Moraea (ca. 195 spp.) and Ferraria (ca. 14 spp.) of subfamily Iridoideae limits the number of pollination shifts in these genera. More pollination shifts occur in subfamily Crocoideae (ca. 1000 spp.) because the ancestral flower includes tepals united basally into a floral tube and bilateral symmetry. With 16 derived pollination mechanisms described for this family in sub-Saharan Africa it is obvious that phylogenetic constraint is sufficiently flexible to explain the shifts in pollination mode...|$|R
5000|$|At a {{functional}} level, increased aperture area and longer rhabdomere length both serve to increase photon capture efficiency {{in the male}} dorsal eye. [...] Also, the smaller ommatidial angles and different rhabdomere arrangement observed in dorsal eyes {{are central to the}} function of the dorsal eye because they are neural superposition eyes, meaning that neural pooling of information from neighboring ommatidia is used to enhance sensitivity. [...] Using a model that takes longer rhabdomeres, larger facet diameters, smaller ommatidial angles, and neural superposition into account, Zeil shows that the dorsal eye of males is able to detect small objects against a homogeneous background at a much greater distance than ventral or female eyes. The optical properties of longer rhabdomeres, increased facet diameter, and smaller ommatidial angles also aid in detection of small objects by increasing the resolution up to six times that of ventral or female eyes when neural pooling resulting from superposition is taken into account. Greater sensitivity to small light changes due to longer rhabdomeres and increased facet diameter, in combination with the ability to detect females at farther distances with higher resolution, allows male <b>Bibionid</b> <b>flies</b> to search for females at lower light levels (greater portion of the day) and to respond quickly to the presence of a female in order to catch her and initiate the [...] "marriage by capture" [...] that occurs in this family of flies. Unlike other fly families, the extreme dimorphism seen in Bibionids may be particularly relevant because these species do not swarm under a landmark, causing the course of females to be relatively unpredictable. As in the olfactory example above, the functional consequences of sex differences in Bibionids are linked to sex-specific behavior for which these sex differences play a key adaptive role.|$|R
40|$|Milkweeds (Asclepiadoideae, Apocynaceae) {{possess a}} complex floral {{morphology}} {{that has made}} them prime candidates for investigating the evolution of plant-pollinator relationships. In South Africa, the pollination ecology of this diverse group has largely been focused in the summer rainfall region. This study focused on Western Cape species {{in the winter and}} summer-winter rainfall transition zones. The aim was to determine the pollinators of the study species and assess, describe and quantify their floral attractants. Thus offering a basis of comparison with the previously studied summer rainfall species. The pollination systems of seven milkweed species occurring in the Western Cape were investigated by determining floral visitors and several floral traits that may act as attractants of these visitors. For each study species an attempt at pollinator observations was carried out in several sites across the Cape; floral scent samples were collected through headspace sampling and analysed using GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry); floral colour was analysed using spectral reflectance measurements; and nectar was measured to quantify floral rewards. Some Cape milkweeds displayed a more generalized pollination system compared to their summer rainfall congeners. A diverse range of visitors were observed on two Gomphocarpus species, Gomphocarpus cancellatus and G. filiformis in the Fynbos and Succulent Karoo biomes respectively, in contrast to their summer rainfall congeners, which are exclusively wasp pollinated or much less generalized. These two Gomphocarpus species offered floral visitors nectar as a reward with a concentration of 53 % in G. cancellatus and a lower 15 % in G. filiformis. The species emitted very different scents, G. cancellatus produced a scent dominated by irregular terpenes while G. filiformis scent largely consisted of benzenoid compounds. Although visited by a variety of different insect families and lesser-double collared sunbirds, honeybees and Balbyter ants were found to be the most efficient at removing pollinaria from G. cancellatus and G. filiformis respectively. Eustegia minuta, a Cape endemic, is almost exclusively pollinated by <b>bibionid</b> <b>flies.</b> This is the first record of the pollinators for this monotypic genus, as well as the first for the tribe Eustegieae. Additionally, this study is the first record of a milkweed-bibionid pollination system. The flowers produced very low nectar volumes, displayed minimal visual cues but produced a strong pungent odour dominated by an unidentified compound. This strong scent is thought {{to play an important role}} in attracting bibionids while also deterring other potential visitors. The scent profiles of four other previously unstudied Cape milkweeds, namely Cynanchum obtusifolium, C. zeyheri, Fockea capensis and Secamone alpinii were also analysed and shown to be mainly dominated by monoterpenes and benzenoids. Their scent profiles differed markedly from each other as well as to their congeners. The presence of skatole in S. alpinii suggests that it may attract coprophagic flies, small Nematoceran flies were observed drinking nectar from its flowers. While F. capensis produced scent associated with moths. Further observations are needed to confirm true pollinators for both species. The two Cynanchum species produced scent that was very different to each other as well as their congeners. Cynanchum obtusifolium is known to be bee pollinated however its scent profile did not align with this. While C. zeyheri produced a benzenoid-dominated scent with compounds associated with moths. Scent appears to be the most prominent pollinator attractant in the study species compared to floral colour. The concentration and volume of nectar rewards may also be significant. The structural complexity of the flowers is suggestive of a strong floral filter in some species (e. g. Eustegia minuta). Morphologically similar species were found to employ vastly different floral chemical strategies to attract but possibly also deter and filter out floral visitors. The Cape milkweeds therefore offer many opportunities for further pollination studies...|$|R
