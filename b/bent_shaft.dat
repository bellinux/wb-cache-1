50|$|Putters are {{a special}} class of clubs with a loft not {{exceeding}} ten degrees, designed primarily {{to roll the}} ball along the grass, generally from a point on the putting green toward the hole. Contrary to popular belief, putters do have a loft (often 5° from truly perpendicular at impact) that helps to lift the ball from any indentation it has made. Newer putters also include grooves on the face to promote roll rather than a skid off the impact. This increases rolling distance and reduces bouncing over the turf. Putters are the only class of club allowed to have certain features, such as two striking faces, non-circular grip cross-sections, <b>bent</b> <b>shafts</b> or hosels, and appendages designed primarily to aid players' aim.|$|R
50|$|Paddlers use single bladed paddles, {{usually with}} single or double <b>bent</b> <b>shafts.</b> The {{paddling}} stroke {{is similar to}} that of most other racing canoe paddling strokes, involving primarily core and lat strength. Generally, each paddler paddles on the opposite side from the paddler in directly front (for example, in an OC6, paddlers in seats 1, 3, and 5 paddle on one side, while paddlers in seats 2 and 4 paddle on the other side). All paddlers switch sides simultaneously on a call from one who is the designated caller. The steerer may paddle either side or switch sides as needed for steering purposes.

5000|$|In a canoe the paddler kneels on {{one knee}} with the other leg forward and foot {{flat on the floor}} of the boat, and paddles a single-bladed paddle on one side only with what is known as a 'J-stroke' to control the boat's direction. In Canada, a racing class exists for the C-15 or WC or [...] "War Canoe", as well as a {{similarly}} designed C-4 (which is much shorter and more squat than an 'International' C-4). An antiquated boat class is the C-7, resembling a large C4 which was debuted by the ICF with little success. For racing canoes, the blade is typically short and broad, with a 'power face' on one side that is either flat or scalloped out. The shaft will typically be longer than a tripping canoe paddle, because the kneeling position puts the paddler higher above the surface of the water. More recent designs of canoe racing paddles often have a slight <b>bent</b> <b>shaft,</b> commonly 12-14 degrees. (a concept of canoe designer Eugene Jensen in the 1960s).

40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} new {{computational}} algorithm for analyzing Morton Effect using a Successive Iterative Synchronous Response Algorithm (SISRA). Previous {{studies on the}} Morton Effect were based on Eigen or Nyquist analysis for stability studies and predicted only an onset speed of instability. The outcome of SISRA is the convergence of response to a steady state orbit in {{a finite number of}} iterations. A progressive increase in the response with increasing running speed indicates the former instability. SISRA predicts both the synchronous response for the speed range of concern plus the speed where the response becomes divergent. SISRA is implemented in a Timochenko-beam-based finite-element rotordynamics software suite. SISRA analyzes the Morton Effect as a synchronous response problem with excitations from: (1) mechanical imbalance, (2) induced thermal <b>bent</b> <b>shaft</b> moments, and (3) mechanical imbalance that is induced by thermal bow. A general elliptical orbit can be decomposed into the sum of forward and backward circular orbits. As input, SISRA requires that, at a specified speed, equilibrium position, and orbit: (1) the predicted maximum differential temperature, and (2) the angle between hot spot (position of maximum temperature) and position of minimum film thickness. Two examples from the published literature are considered. SISRA predicted higher vibration levels, even before the motion diverges due to Morton Effect. In some cases, the synchronous response of the system due to Morton Effect is orders of magnitude greater than the response due only to mechanical imbalance. The combined effects of: (1) mechanical imbalance with induced thermal <b>bent</b> <b>shaft</b> moments, and (2) mechanical imbalance with thermally induced mechanical imbalance are also studied. The impact of induced thermal <b>bent</b> <b>shaft</b> moments is found to be greater than the mechanical imbalance induced by thermal bow. A parametric investigation on the impact of the changes of (1) bearing length to diameter ratio, (2) reduced viscosity of the lubricant, (3) bearing radial clearance to radius ratio and (4) overhung mass magnitude is performed to consider their respective impacts on synchronous response. Based on the available input data and the cases considered, reducing viscosity and reducing the overhung mass are found to be the best remedies to alleviate problems arising from the Morton Effect...|$|E

Specifically, the research is concentrated {{on the influence of}} rotor eccentricity on increased frequency EMF E 2 value, that is induced it stator’s secondary winding. To clarify this question the simulations by using the finite element method implemented in QuickField software, are applied. There are many reasons why does eccentricity occur:  unbalance – an uneven distribution of a rotor’s mass;  <b>bent</b> <b>shaft</b> – damaged or curved shaft produces unequal air gap;  bearing – a bearing that for some reason has lost it’s lubrication, wear out fast (may also fail and damage remaining components; loose foundation – the improper mounting of the machine without holding it rigidly to the ground causes the machine to vibrate and eventually leads to air gap’s inequality. Eccentricity is considered because of the influence of the air gap variance on the electromagnetic field distribution. Both the voltage and current sine waves can be altered, and when viewed in a fast Fourier-transform, they appear as harmonic sidebands of main eccentricity frequency...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{simulation}} of expected vibration signal of a faulted gearbox. The main mechanical components simulated are ball bearings and ordinary gears. In a previous work [1] the authors presented a step-by-step algorithm for the simulation of faulted bearings. In this paper the model has been extended to include ordinary gears and their most common faults, such as pitting or crack on a tooth, the presence of backlash or <b>bent</b> <b>shafts.</b> Regarding the ball bearings model, the simulation {{takes into account the}} selection of the location of the fault's type, the stage of the fault, cyclostationarity of the signal, random contributions, deterministic contributions, eects of resonances in the machine and working conditions. Although several detailed models are available in literature, the scientic papers just outline the theoretical foundations of assumptions and features of the model - as supposed - leaving to the reader the task of converting all the procedure in lines of code. This is in contrast with the idea of "reproducible research", which posits the possibility of being able to reproduce the proposed procedure and verifying the conclusions of the paper. As soon as the model is veried by scientic community, it could be used as preliminary test-bench, for the validation of new diagnostics techniques that the reader could develop in the future.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a study of}} the biomechanical load when working with manually handled shaft tools. The tools studied are shovels, rakes and push hoes. The most comprehensive measurements study the effects of varying shovel design. Especially the load on the muscles in the back and the compression and shear forces directly on the spine are studied. The mounting angle and length of the shovel shaft are varied. The effects of using a tool with a higher and <b>bent</b> <b>shaft</b> are also studied, just as the effects of varying operator anthropometry. One conclusion of the results is that the spine forces can be decreased if an alternatively designed shovel is used. Another conclusion is that the anthropometry of the operator has major effects on the load levels. The method used for the analysis of the biomechanical load uses optoelectronic measurement data of body positions as input to an computerized biomechanical analysis model. The external forces acting on each hand are simultaneously measured. The measurement procedure is standardized and the transfer of data from the optoelectronic measurements to the biomechanical model is computerized in order to increase the accuracy and also to enable analysis of measurement time series with reasonable time consumption...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{methodology for}} gearbox health assessment and fault classification is developed and evaluated for 560 data sets of gearbox vibration {{data provided by}} the Prognostics and Health Management Society for the 2009 data challenge competition. A comprehensive set of signal processing and feature extraction methods are used to extract over 200 features, including features extracted from the raw time signal, time synchronous signal, wavelet decomposition signal, frequency domain spectrum, envelope spectrum, among others. A regime segmentation approach using the tachometer signal, a spectrum similarity metric, and gear mesh frequency peak information are used to segment the data by gear type, input shaft speed, and braking torque load. A health assessment method that finds the minimum feature vector sum in each regime is used to classify and find the 80 baseline healthy data sets. A fault diagnosis method based on a distance calculation from normal along with specific features correlated to different fault signatures is used to diagnosis specific faults. The fault diagnosis method is evaluated for the diagnosis of a gear tooth breakage, input shaft imbalance, <b>bent</b> <b>shaft,</b> bearing inner race defect, and bad key, and the method could be further extended for other faults {{as long as a}} set of features can be correlated with a known fault signature.

40|$|The {{vibration}} {{analysis of}} rotating machinery can give {{an indication of}} the condition of potential faults such as unbalance, <b>bent</b> <b>shaft,</b> shaft crack, bearing clearance, rotor rub, misalignment, looseness, oil whirl and whip and other malfunctions. The diagnostics of rotor faults has gained importance in recent years. Many papers in the literature have dealt with single faults but normally, more than one fault can occur in a rotor. This paper describes the application of artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Wavelet Transform (WT) for the prediction of the effect of combined faults of unbalance and shaft bow on the frequency components of vibration signature of the rotating machinery. The characteristic features of frequency domain vibration signals have been used as inputs to the ANN consisting of one input, one hidden and one-output layers. The ANN is trained using multiplayer feed forward back propagation marquardt algorithm. It is found that marquardt algorithm is much more efficient than the other techniques. The ANN used for diagnosis and quantifying of faults. The success 160 H. K. Srinivas, K. S. Srinivasan and K. N. Umesh rates based upon each fault have been reported. In particular, an over all success rates of unbalance 99. 78 %, shaft bow 99. 81 % and combined faults of unbalance and shaft bow 99. 45 % has been achieved. The wavelet transform approach enables instant to instant observation of different frequency components over the full spectrum.
