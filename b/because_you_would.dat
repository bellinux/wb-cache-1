25|$|The {{main feature}} change was support for Microsoft's 64-bit {{operating}} system, however support for Banyan VINES was also dropped from {{this version of}} MDAC. There were several known issues: MDAC 2.7 continued causing connectivity problems on clustered servers running Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or SQL Server 7.0, with no workaround provided by Microsoft. When creating or configuring ODBC data source names (DSNs) using the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver the network library protocol might unexpectedly switch to TCP/IP, even if the DSN was configured to use named pipes. This issue was found by InfoWorld reporter Randall C. Kennedy, who identified that the change was actually made in MDAC 2.6 but was never documented. It was discovered when testing client/server database workloads on a Windows XP computer; InfoWorld claims that although overall server CPU utilization rose by only 8 percent using TCP/IP, context switches per second dropped by more than 150 percent (which is of course impossible <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> then have a negative context switch rate - the drop is either 33% or 60% depending on which planet the author was on {{at the time of}} writing) for a 10-user workload. They were unimpressed that a fundamental functional change to the default behaviour of Net-Lib occurred without more than a passing mention in an unrelated document. Windows XP users also sometimes experienced problems connecting to SQL Server because SQL Server attempts to use certificates it finds on the local computer, however if {{there is more than one}} certificate available it did not know which one to use. When attempting to use Microsoft Analysis Services 2000 RTM, an error would sometimes appear when trying to browse cubes. Microsoft also discovered a problem in Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me's setup program which prevented the MDAC installation program from rolling back when it encountered an installation error.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} both films outside of October, usually the month when studios {{released}} their quality horror films {{to capitalize on}} Halloween's approach, has actually led studios to rethink that approach and release horror films at other times of year. During the 2000s October, and the weekend before Halloween, {{had come to be}} dominated by the Saw and Paranormal Activity franchises. [...] "You would never come up against them <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be killed," [...] recalls Rock Alvarez, producer of A Haunted House 2.|$|E
500|$|Zicree {{explained}} {{that he did not}} consider [...] "World Enough and Time" [...] to be a fan-film, comparing it to the episodes of Sliders he was a producer on. He said that they sought to do it the same way as a network show, but added that [...] "the level of production is way beyond what any network show would be, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never have 700 visual effects shots in a single hour on any network show." [...] However, Cawley said that Zicree treated many of the New Voyages crew poorly, and he was removed from the set after they faced a staff walkout. He {{explained that}} after he spoke to Zicree, the director had a [...] "meltdown" [...] and was unable to complete the shoot. So Cawley asked his friend Carlos Pedraza to complete the episode uncredited.|$|E

500|$|Swift {{was very}} fond of Caillat's 2007 debut album, Coco. Swift explained, [...] "When it came out, I {{fell in love with}} the way that she makes music." [...] Swift later {{contacted}} her management and asked if she could write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E
2500|$|The {{illustration}} to {{the right}} exemplifies kanbun. These eight words comprise the well-known first line in the Han Feizi story (chap. 36, 難一 [...] "Collection of Difficulties, No. 1") that first coined the term máodùn (Japanese mujun, [...] 'contradiction, inconsistency', lit. [...] "spear-shield"), illustrating the irresistible force paradox. Debating with a Confucianist about the legendary Chinese sage rulers Yao and Shun, legalist Han Fei argues that you cannot praise them both <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be making a [...] "spear-shield" [...] contradiction.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to [...] "Facing Facts About Race", the American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates accused Hanson {{of racism and}} stupidity. Referring to Hanson's [...] "Talk", Coates wrote: [...] "Let us be direct—in any other context we would automatically recognize this [...] "talk" [...] as stupid advice. If I were {{to tell you that}} I only employ Asian-Americans to do my taxes because [...] "Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT," [...] you would not simply question my sensitivity, but my mental faculties. That is <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> understand that in making an individual decision, employing an ancestral class of millions is not very intelligent. Moreover, were I to tell you I wanted my son to marry a Jewish woman because [...] "Jews are really successful," [...] you would understand that statement for the stupidity which it is...There is no difference between my argument above and the notion that black boys should be avoided because they are overrepresented in the violent crime stats. But one of the effects of racism is its tendency to justify stupidity." ...|$|E

"We’re {{challenging}} ourselves {{now more}} than we ever have in the weirdest ways possible, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> think writing the craziest solo or riffs would be the challenging part. But the challenging part is trying to stick to a theme and not go {{all over the place}} like we would normally do." [...] The album is expected later this year through Epitaph Records. On December 19, the band officially released the first single [...] "Coming Home" [...] from the untitled album. In January 2017, Radke began performing guitar for the band. On January 20, 2017, the band announced their next album Coming Home, which was released on April 7. Around the time of its release, it was rumored that drummer Ryan Seaman parted ways with the band, and now has a new band with Dallon Weekes of Panic! at the Disco entitled I Don't Know How But They Found Me. This was confirmed when the band performed on May 8, without Seaman with Chris Kamrada playing drums as a touring member.|$|E
