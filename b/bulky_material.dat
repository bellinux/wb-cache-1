50|$|The pits were {{a source}} of gault, an {{impervious}} clay used to maintain river banks in the low-lying regions of the South Level of the Fens. Following the re-routing of the rivers in the region by Cornelius Vermuyden and his Adventurers in the 1650s, to more effectively drain the Fens, the peaty soils began to dry out and shrink. As the land surface sunk below the levels of the rivers, it became important to maintain the banks with something impervious to water, to prevent seepage into the newly drained agricultural land, and to prevent collapse of the banks and flooding {{of the land in}} times of heavy rainfall. Roswell Pits were an ideal source of this material, as they were located adjacent to the River Great Ouse, and boats could take the <b>bulky</b> <b>material</b> directly to the banks being maintained.|$|E

This method is unique in that it incorporates the inelastically scattered electrons into the imaging process. Using this technique, bright and sharp images of dislocations in crystalline silicon specimens as thick as 10 µm were obtained. A calibration curve to determine foil thickness of such a thick specimen was also derived. This method simply extends the observable thickness range in TEM.

40|$|How arborists {{view the}} issue of “waste wood ” is changing. The number of {{landfills}} has been steadily shrinking, while tipping fees at the remaining facilities are rising continually. Disposing of waste wood was once merely a time and labor factor, but now carries with it considerably more expense. Many arborists have adjusted to the higher cost of handling waste wood by looking for value-added markets for this material.

40|$|Approximately 5 billion lbs of carpet will {{be removed}} from {{buildings}} in the US each year for the foreseeable future. This carpet is potentially a valuable resource because it contains plastic {{in the face of}} the carpet that can be re-used. However, there are many different types of carpet, and at least four major different plastics used to make the face. The face is woven through a backing fabric and held in place by a “glue” that is in most cases a latex cross-linked polymer which is heavily loaded with chalk (calcium carbonate). This backing has almost no value as a recycled material. In addition, carpet is a <b>bulky</b> <b>material</b> that is difficult to handle and ship and must be kept dry. It would be of significant benefit to the public if this stream of material could be kept out of landfills and some of its potential value unlocked by having high volume alternatives for recycled carpet use. The research question that this project investigated was whether carpet could be used as a fuel in a cement kiln. If this could be done successfully, there is significant capacity in the US cement industry to absorb carpet and use it as a fuel. Cement kilns could serve as a way to stimulate carpet collection and then side streams be taken for higher value uses. The research demonstrated that carpet was technically a suitable fuel, but was unable to conclude that the overall system could be economically feasible at this time with the constraints placed on the project by using an existing system for feeding the kiln. Collection and transportation were relatively straightforward, using an existing collector who had the capacity to collect high volumes of material. The shredding of the carpet into a suitable form for feeding was more challenging, but these problems were successfully overcome. The feeding of the carpet into the kiln was not successfully carried out reliably. The overall economics were not positive under the prevailing conditions of costs for transportation and size reduction...|$|E

40|$|Aliphatic polyesters, namely {{polylactide}} (PLA) and poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) are biodegradable and biocompatible {{materials that}} find applications as resorbable suture (PLA) and drugs delivery vectors (PCL). Nevertheless, these polymers were mainly prepared by ring opening polymerization using aluminum alkoxide or tin alkoxide initiators in organic media. Recently, {{the use of}} supercritical carbon dioxide as polymerization medium was proposed as a potential alternative to the use toxic organic solvents. Nevertheless, due to the non-solubility of PCL in this medium, the growing chains rapidly precipitate during their synthesis leading {{to the formation of}} a <b>bulky</b> <b>material</b> that is typical of a precipitation polymerization. This work aims at investigating the dispersion ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-caprolactone in the presence of fluoropolymer-based stabilizers, that were prepared by combining the ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone and atom transfer radical polymerization of heptadecafluorodecylacrylate (AC 8) and so, stabilizing PCL micrometric particles in supercritical carbon dioxide. In practice, the ROP of CL was initiated by dibutyltin dimethoxide in the presence of PCL-b-PAC 8 diblock stabilizers of differents molecular weight and composition. After 24 h at 40 °C, PCL was collected as a powder that consists of small-sized microspheres. Finally, post-polymerization purification of PCL (removal of tin catalyst that may lead to toxicological problems) was demonstrated to be quite feasible by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) leading to the preparation of PCL with low catalytic residues. The second goal of this work aims at reporting on the use of sc CO 2 for the preparation of foams of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), that could be useful in the packaging sector and/or the biomedical sector as potential scaffolds for tissue engineering but also as substitutes for polystyrene thermoformed trays. The method that consists of saturating a polymer with a compressed or supercritical fluid, such as carbon dioxide followed by depressurization and polymer expansion was investigated. Indeed, no residual product is left in the foam, no toxic gas is produced and no resort to hydrocarbon solvents is required. Moreover, CO 2 is cheap, non-toxic, recyclable, non-flammable and the technology of CO 2 -assisted foaming can be used in either a batch mode or in a continuous mode within a high-pressure extruder...|$|E
30|$|Abundant uses of {{chemical}} fertilizers {{have not only}} caused the loss of soil fertility but also increase {{the large amount of}} agrowastes. The production of cow livestock and goat dung are 11.6 and 0.70 kg/animal/day, respectively, in India (Garg et al. 2006). The presence of abundant agrowastes and animal dung causes serious problems to animals as well as to human beings if there is improper management of these wastes. So, it is in emergent need to retain the soil fertility as well the handling of abundant production of agro- and animal wastes. The use of earthworm population for the increase of soil organic matter (Steven et al. 2009) and management of biological wastes have proved to be successful in processing animal wastes, Eichhornia (water weeds) and Parthinium weeds (Yadav and Garg 2010), by the method of vermicomposting. Vermicomposting is a suitable way for waste management and production of organic manure {{with the help of the}} earthworms. Many earthworm populations have converted more wastes into rich nutrient biofertilizers. In vermicomposting, different microorganisms (bacteria, actinomycetes, algae, fungi, and other micro fauna) were colonized, and as a result,the concentration of various enzymes, plant hormones, growth stimulator, and vitamins increased directly or indirectly (Suthar 2010). Gunadi et al. (2002) also reported that pre-composting solid organic wastes were essential to growth, reproduction, and survivability of the earthworm. One solution of this problem is to enhance the large population and better growth of the earthworm Eisenia fetida by different combinations of agrowastes, brans, and animal excreta. Livestock dung has been used as a main substrate for growth and development of E. fetida; some agricultural wastes with it are also used for the improvement of the growth and reproduction of the earthworm. The growth and reproduction of the earthworm was significantly affected by various factors such as waste type, temperature, density, moisture, chemical complexity, <b>bulky</b> <b>material,</b> and earthworm species during vermicomposting (Yadav and Garg 2010). In India, due to lack of knowledge about vermicomposting, the people usually use simple dung for composting in which has low quality than the vermicompost. The present study was designed to investigate and assess the reproduction rate of the cocoons and hatchling emergence as well to determine growth of E. fetida in different combinations and to evaluate the pH, C/N ratio, electrical conductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total potassium (TK), total available phosphorus (TAP), and total calcium (TCa) in the pre- and final vermibed. The present study is important not only to the small farmers but also to the large-scale farmers in informing them on the production of large amount and potent vermicompost for agricultural crops and enhancement of the epigeic earthworm population during the management of agricultural-organic wastes.|$|E
