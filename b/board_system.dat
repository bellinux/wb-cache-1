The book is written with a first-person perspective: the reader learns of the author's morning ritual, {{the fact that his}} cat is named Francie and that he married a woman he met through a Bulletin <b>Board</b> <b>System.</b> Godwin's motivation was to keep the Internet safe from government actions that restrict freedom of speech. He asserts that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution should apply equally to the Internet as it does to other media.|$|E

25|$|A Bulletin <b>Board</b> <b>System,</b> or BBS, is a {{computer}} system running software that allows users to connect and log into the system using a terminal program. Once logged in, a user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users, either through electronic mail or in public message boards. Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. CBBS, the first Bulletin <b>Board</b> <b>System,</b> was invented by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess in Chicago, becoming fully operational on February 16, 1978.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Don Black and Chloê Hardin, the ex-wife of the KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, began a small {{bulletin}} <b>board</b> <b>system</b> (BBS) called Stormfront.

All distribution boards (fuse boxes) are required to have a 'main fuse' or 'main breaker' rated at the maximum permissible load for that installation.

25|$|Unlike {{with the}} Famicom, Nintendo of America marketed the console {{primarily}} to children, instituting a strict policy of censoring profanity, sexual, religious, or political content. The most famous example was Lucasfilm's attempts to port the comedy-horror game Maniac Mansion to the NES, which Nintendo insisted be considerably watered down. Nintendo of America continued their censorship policy until 1994 {{with the advent}} of the Entertainment Software Rating <b>Board</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

25|$|Around Christmas 1983, Tom Jennings {{started work}} on a new MS-DOS–hosted {{bulletin}} <b>board</b> <b>system</b> that would emerge as Fido BBS. Jennings set up the system in San Francisco some time in early 1984. Another early user was John Madil, {{who was trying to}} set up a similar system in Baltimore on his Rainbow 100. Fido started spreading to new systems, and Jennings eventually started keeping an informal list of their phone numbers, with Jennings becoming #1 and Madil #2.|$|E
25|$|A {{precursor}} to the public bulletin <b>board</b> <b>system</b> was Community Memory, started in August 1973 in Berkeley, California. Useful microcomputers did not exist at that time, and modems were both expensive and slow. Community Memory therefore ran on a mainframe computer and was accessed through terminals located in several San Francisco Bay Area neighborhoods. The poor quality of the original modem connecting the terminals to the mainframe prompted a user to invent the Pennywhistle modem, whose design was highly influential in the mid-1970s.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{it was noted}} that some power users were {{interested}} in using FidoNet protocols as a way of delivering the large quantities of echomail to their local machines where it could be read offline. These users did not want their systems to appear in the nodelist - they did not (necessarily) run a bulletin <b>board</b> <b>system</b> and were not publicly accessible. A mechanism allowing netmail delivery to these systems without the overhead of nodelist maintenance was desirable.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Don Black and Chloê Hardin, Duke's ex-wife, began a {{bulletin}} <b>board</b> <b>system</b> (BBS) called Stormfront. Today, Stormfront {{has become a}} prominent online forum for white nationalism, white separatism, holocaust denial, Neo-Nazism, hate speech and racism. Duke is an active user of Stormfront, where he posts articles from his own website and polls forum members for opinions and questions, in particular during his Internet broadcasts. Duke has worked with Don Black on numerous projects, including Operation Red Dog (the attempted overthrowing of Dominica's government) in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Lavelle {{attended}} the Air War College in 1956–57 and then {{spent the next}} five years at Headquarters U.S. Air Force as deputy director of requirements; secretary of the Weapons Board; and deputy director of programs.

25|$|The city {{opened its}} Public Electronic Network (PEN) in 1989, {{providing}} citizens with a bulletin <b>board</b> <b>system</b> (BBS) to discuss local issues and access city services. PEN {{was the first}} municipally operated BBS in the world. While plagued by the ills common to BBSes, the site empowered residents. Due {{in part to the}} placement of publicly available terminals in libraries, homeless persons and their issues received considerable attention on PEN. The SWASHLOCK (Showers, WASHers, and LOCKers) plan was developed on PEN and implemented in 1993. PEN also served as a center to organize opposition to the 1990 proposal to redevelop 415 PCH.|$|E

25|$|Stormfront {{began as}} an online {{bulletin}} <b>board</b> <b>system</b> in the early 1990s before being established as a website in 1996 by former Ku Klux Klan leader and white supremacist Don Black. It received national attention in the United States in 2000 after being featured as {{the subject of a}} documentary, Hate.com. Stormfront {{has been the subject of}} controversy after being removed from French, German, and Italian Google indexes, for targeting an online Fox News poll on racial segregation, and for having political candidates as members. Its prominence has grown since the 1990s, attracting attention from watchdog organizations that oppose racism and antisemitism.|$|E
25|$|Hawaiian {{educators}} {{have been taking}} advantage of the Internet in their language revitalization programs. The graphical bulletin <b>board</b> <b>system,</b> Leoki (Powerful Voice), was established in 1994. The content, interface and menus of the system are entirely in the Hawaiian language. It is installed throughout the immersion school system and includes components for e-mails, chat, dictionary and online newspaper among others. In higher institutions such as colleges and universities where the Leoki system is not yet installed, the educators make use of other software and Internet tools such as Daedalus Interchange, e-mails and the Web to connect students of Hawaiian language with the broader community.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of inexpensive dial-up internet {{service and the}} Mosaic web browser offered ease of use and global access that BBS and online systems did not provide, {{and led to a}} rapid crash in the market starting in 1994. Over the next year, many of the leading BBS software providers went bankrupt {{and tens of thousands of}} BBSes disappeared. Today, BBSing survives largely as a nostalgic hobby in most parts of the world, but it is still an extremely popular form of communication for Taiwanese youth (see PTT Bulletin <b>Board</b> <b>System)</b> and in China. Most BBSes are now accessible over Telnet and typically offer free email accounts, FTP services, IRC and all of the protocols commonly used on the Internet. Some offer access through packet switched networks or packet radio connections.|$|E
