5|$|Scully {{learns that}} the {{lockdown}} population is infected with an exceedingly deadly contagion, finding {{a pile of}} <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> stored for incineration in the prison's boiler room. Scully cuts open Torrance's body bag and examines his corpse, but Dr. Osbourne, {{a member of the}} CDC team, tries to stop her. A pustule on Torrance's body erupts in Osbourne's face, causing him to flee the room. Meanwhile, the fugitives steal an RV and stop at a gas station, where Paul calls his girlfriend, Elizabeth, looking for shelter. The station's clerk finds an infected Steve in the restroom; he is knocked unconscious by Paul. Scully calls Mulder after the Marshals raid the gas station, telling him that the contagion could spread into the population if the fugitives are not captured. Mulder sees a CDC biohazard team arrive at the scene, forcibly taking away the clerk in a helicopter.|$|E

The video opens with Dev singing {{and putting on}} makeup in the mirror. She appears with darker makeup on than her usual look. She has a <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> with a <b>body</b> inside that is moving around as she strokes it. Based on the lyrics of the song, the <b>body</b> in the <b>bag</b> could be the girl that Dev has taken. Dev ties off {{both ends of the}} <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> and drags it around the flat she is in to outside through an alley and on {{the street in front of}} bystanders. She leaves the <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> on the sidewalk and goes into a store where she is shown on a security camera coming in. Dev buys a drink and does not mind the cashiers suspicious of her. She comes back outside to the <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> and ends up stealing a car that a women had left unattended. Dev drives until the sun goes down and takes out the <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> from the back of the car. She digs a hole and before leaving the <b>body</b> <b>bag,</b> she opens the bag to reveal the <b>body</b> in the <b>bag</b> was herself all along; Dev with much less makeup. The [...] "girl" [...] Dev has been singing about was herself, her past self that she has bagged up and gotten over. The last shot of the video is apparently Dev driving away as the videos fades to black.|$|R

25|$|PFC. Jose Ramon Sanchez born in Brooklyn, NY was {{assigned}} to Company D, 1st Battalion, 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division. On June 6, 1968, he was {{among a group of}} fellow Marines who comprised a patrol operating in the rugged jungle covered mountains southwest of Khe Sanh, Quảng Trị Province, South Vietnam. Their mission was to block NVA troops and supplies from infiltrating toward Khe Sanh. The Marines engaged a communist force of unknown size in heavy combat. As the fierce firefight raged around them, the Marines, who were out numbered and rapidly running low on ammunition, requested an emergency extraction. A CH46A Sea Knight helicopter was sent for Sanchez {{and the rest of the}} patrol who were on Hill 672. As the helicopter gained altitude, it was immediately struck by intense and accurate enemy ground fire causing it to enter into a nose-low attitude and crash onto an east/west mountain ridgeline, roll down to the bottom of the hill and burst into flames. Within an hour and a half, a search and recovery (SAR) team was inserted into the crash site. The team members pulled the charred bodies of the aircrew and passengers from what was left of the burned out helicopter and placed them in <b>body</b> <b>bags.</b> Of the 12 of the 23 Marines aboard who were killed, 4 were reported as MIA/KIA, besides Sanchez the other three were L/Cpl. LaPlant, L/Cpl. Palacios and L/Cpl. Harper. Various attempts to recover the bodies of the four were made to no avail.|$|E
500|$|With the {{announcement}} by Islam4UK that it planned {{to hold a}} protest march through Wootton Bassett (known for the military funeral repatriations of dead British soldiers returning {{from the war in}} Afghanistan), Choudary said [...] "You may see one or two coffins being returned to the UK every other day, but {{when you think about the}} people of Afghanistan its a huge number [...] in comparison ... I intend to write a letter to the parents of British soldiers telling them the reality of what they died for." [...] Choudary's open letter was published on 3 January 2010. [...] It explained his reasons for proposing the march, endorsed his religious beliefs, and claimed that UK politicians had been lying about the war. [...] Choudary wrote that the proposed march was to [...] "engage the British public's minds on the real reasons why their soldiers are returning home in <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> and the real cost of the war." [...] In an interview with Sky News, he stated that the location was chosen to effect a level of media attention which [...] "it would not have gained anywhere else". [...] The proposal was condemned by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who said that to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be [...] "completely inappropriate". [...] The Minhaj-ul-Quran International UK centre in Forest Gate also condemned the proposal, as did the Muslim Council of Britain, which stated that it [...] "condemns the call by the fringe extremist group Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett." [...] The planned march was cancelled by the group, on 10 January 2010.|$|E

5000|$|In modern warfare, <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> {{have been}} used to contain the bodies of dead soldiers. Disaster {{agencies}} typically have reserves of <b>body</b> <b>bags,</b> both for anticipated wars and natural disasters. During the Cold War, vast reserves of <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> were built up in anticipation of millions of fatalities from nuclear war. This was the subject of Adrian Mitchell's protest poem [...] "Fifteen Million Plastic Bags".|$|E
50|$|<b>Body</b> <b>bags</b> are {{sometimes}} portrayed in films and television as being {{made of a}} heavy black plastic. Lightweight white <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> have since become popular because {{it is much easier}} to spot a piece of evidence that may have been jostled from the body in transit on a white background than on a black background. Even so, black <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> are still in general use. Other typical colors include orange, blue, or gray. <b>Body</b> <b>bags</b> used in the Vietnam War were heavy-duty black rubberized fabric. Regardless of their color, <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> are made of thick plastic and have a full-length zipper on them. Sometimes the zipper runs straight down the middle. Alternatively, the path of the zipper may be J-shaped or D-shaped. Depending on the design, there {{are sometimes}} handles (two on each side) to facilitate lifting. It is possible to write information on the plastic surface of a body bag using a marker pen, and this often happens—either in situ (particularly when a large number of bodies are being collected) or at the mortuary, before being stored in refrigerated cabinets. Alternatively, some designs of <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> have transparent label pockets as an integral part of the design, into which a name-card can be inserted. In any case, a conventional toe tag can easily be tied to one of the lifting handles if required. <b>Body</b> <b>bags</b> are not designed to be washed and re-used, with good reason: aside from the obvious hygiene concerns, re-use of <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> could easily contaminate evidence in the case of a suspicious death. As a result, <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> are routinely discarded and incinerated after one use. In Afghanistan US forces have used <b>body</b> <b>bags</b> to deliver ammunition, medical supplies, and rations to troops in the field. Fifty or so pounds of supplies are packed loose in a body bag and pulled out of the helicopter delivering them to be easily and rapidly dragged to cover by one or two soldiers.|$|E
