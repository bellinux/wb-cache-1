500|$|Further {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} acute myeloid leukemia occurred rapidly with the development of new technology. In 1877, Paul Ehrlich developed a technique of staining blood films which allowed him to describe in detail normal and abnormal white blood cells. Wilhelm Ebstein introduced the term [...] "acute leukemia" [...] in 1889 to differentiate rapidly progressive and fatal leukemias from the more indolent chronic leukemias. The term [...] "myeloid" [...] was coined by Franz Ernst Christian Neumann in 1869, as {{he was the first to}} recognize white blood cells were made in the bone marrow (Greek: µυєλός, myelos = (bone) marrow) as opposed to the spleen. The technique of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>examination</b> to diagnose leukemia was first described in 1879 by Mosler. Finally, in 1900, the myeloblast, which is the malignant cell in AML, was characterized by Otto Naegeli, who divided the leukemias into myeloid and lymphocytic.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>examination</b> {{refers to}} the {{pathologic}} analysis of samples of bone marrow obtained by bone marrow biopsy (often called a trephine biopsy) and bone marrow aspiration. [...] <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>examination</b> {{is used in the}} diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, anemia, and pancytopenia. [...] The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the value of}} <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> trephine biopsy {{as part of the}} clinical staging for children presenting with Hodgkin disease. Patients and Methods, A retrospective study of pre-treatment <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>examinations</b> was undertaken to examine the value of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> staging in children with Hodgkin dis ease. The records of 122 children, diagnosed with Hodgkin disease at Texas Children's Hospital between February 1960 and July 1996, were reviewed. Age, sex, complete blood counts (CBC), pathology, and clinical and pathological staging results were tabulated. Results, Information was complete for analysis in 110 patients. <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> trephine biopsies identified Hodgkin disease in 2 / 110 patients (1. 8 %). The patients with <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> disease had clinical stage IIIB disease prebiopsy.

2500|$|Bone marrow samples can be {{obtained}} by aspiration and trephine biopsy. [...] Sometimes, a <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>examination</b> will include both an aspirate and a biopsy. [...] The aspirate yields semi-liquid bone marrow, which can be examined by a pathologist under a light microscope and analyzed by flow cytometry, chromosome analysis, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequently, a trephine biopsy is also obtained, which yields a narrow, cylindrically shaped solid piece of bone marrow, 2mm wide and 2cm long (80 μL), which is examined microscopically (sometimes with the aid of immunohistochemistry) for cellularity and infiltrative processes. An aspiration, using a 20 mL syringe, yields approximately 300 μL of bone marrow. A volume greater than 300 μL is not recommended, since it may dilute the sample with peripheral blood.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, a rare {{variation}} of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aplasia, {{has been described}} in association with viral infection, vaccination, alcoholism and drug-toxicity.

Complete blood counts, reticulocyte counts and repeated <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> aspiration/biopsy were carried out. Repeated <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>examinations</b> revealed markedly decreased megakaryocytes but minimal or no decrease in myeloid and erythroid cell lines.

40|$|Background: Multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma {{resulting}} in malignant effusion is rarely described in literature.

Evidence that folic acid deficiency may develop in patients suffering from leukaemia or lymphomas has been obtained from studies of the excretion of folic acid in urine (Swendseid, Swanson, Meyers, and Bethell, 1952; Girdwood, 1953), of the rate of clearance of injected folic acid from the plasma (Hogan, Maniatis, and Moloney, 1964), and from serum folic acid assays (Hoogstraten, Baker, an...|$|R

30|$|Primary myelofibrosis is {{diagnosed}} relatively {{late in life}} (median age is 66  years) and {{is more common in}} males (ratio 3 : 2) (Tefferi et al. 2012). <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> fibrosis occurring with SLE {{is diagnosed}} earlier (median age is 29  years) and is very uncommon in males (ratio 1 : 9). In 15 / 28 cases, the diagnosis of SLE and <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> fibrosis were made simultaneously. However, in 5 of these cases a number of symptoms and signs (such as arthralgias, alopecia, proteinuria) were suggestive of undiagnosed yet pre-existing SLE (Daly and Scott 1983; Matsouka et al. 1989; Inoue et al. 1992; Paquette et al. 1994; Pillai et al. 2009).
