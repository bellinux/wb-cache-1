5000|$|Anti-pilling finish alleviates pilling, an {{unpleasant}} phenomenon associated with spun yarn fabrics, {{especially when they}} contain synthetics. Synthetic fibers are more readily brought {{to the surface of}} a fabric due to their smooth surface and circular cross-section, and due to their higher tensile strength and abrasion resistance. With knit [...] "picking" [...] also occurs: by abrasion, individual fibers work themselves out of yarn loops onto the surface, and the garment catches on a pointed or rough object. Knitting is susceptible to these effects due to the open weave and <b>bulky</b> <b>yarn.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Wool {{refers to}} the hair of the {{domestic}} goat or sheep, which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped, and the wool {{as a whole is}} coated with a wax mixture known as lanolin (sometimes called wool grease), which is waterproof and dirtproof [...] Woollen refers to a <b>bulkier</b> <b>yarn</b> produced from carded, non-parallel fibre, while worsted refers to a finer yarn spun from longer fibres which have been combed to be parallel. Wool is commonly used for warm clothing. Cashmere, the hair of the Indian cashmere goat, and mohair, the hair of the North African angora goat, are types of wool known for their softness.|$|R
25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally <b>bulkier</b> <b>yarn.</b> There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|R
5000|$|Cable cast-on : A {{closely related}} technique, {{in which a}} new loop is drawn through {{the space between the}} two {{previous}} loops and then added to the needle. This edge is firm and has a neat, corded look; although it may be too <b>bulky</b> with thick <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The forming yarn rotates at {{high speed}} compare to other {{rotating}} elements. It can spin yarn at very high twist insertion rates (ie.300,000 twist/min). The yarn tension is practically independent of speed and hence very high production rates (up to 300 m/min) can be attainable. The <b>yarns</b> are <b>bulkier</b> than rotor <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behavior, {{including the}} tensile and torsional properties, of <b>bulky</b> wool singles <b>yarn,</b> {{which has an}} initial fiber packing density that is non-uniform along yarn radial direction, is modeled in this paper. The theoretical analysis is based on discrete-fiber-modeling principles by which the yarn is considered as an assembly {{of a large number}} of discrete fibers. The movement of fibers during deformation and their final positions after deformation are determined by their need to minimize tensile strain, which is the so-called the shortest-path hypothesis. Energy method is employed to calculate the applied force. Taking the nonlinear behavior of fiber at large strain into account, the contributions to yarn external force due to fiber tension, fiber bending and fiber torsion can all be derived. Comparing with the experimental data, our theoretical model gives a reasonably accurate prediction of yarn behavior at small deformation. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{significant}} texturing processes in current use, air-jet texturing, operates by mechanical interlocking and not by heat setting {{in the case of}} the other texturing techniques such as false-twist. It is a cold fluid texturing process that converts flat, continuous synthetic filament yarns into an entangled, convoluted, <b>bulky,</b> spun-like <b>yarn.</b> Air-jet texturing has three types based on the supply yarn. Single-end air-jet texturing denotes the situation whereby single filament yarn is overfed to the texturing nozzle, and the resultant textured yarn is withdrawn. In case of parallel air-jet texturing, two or more filaments yarns are fed at the same overfeed into the nozzle so as to facilitate a blend of different types of supply material, or of the same material but with different filament linear densities or number of filaments, or different cross sectional shapes. In core-effect air-jet texturing two different filament yarns are fed under different overfeeds into the air-jet at the same time. In core-effect air-jet texturing, the lower overfeed yarn is called the core-yarn and the higher overfeed yarn is called the effect-yarn. The core-yarn overfeed determines the strength of the textured yarn. The effect-yarn overfeed determines the size of the protruded loops. It also has an indirect influence upon the number of loops per unit length and also on the linear density. Perhaps the most important influence of the effect-yarn overfeed is to be seen in the structure and appearance of the yarn. This is because loops are seen on the surface of the yarn in the same way that hairs are visible in a spun yarn. However, there is limited literature on core-effect air-jet texturing or the influence of the effect-yarn parameters on air-jet texturing performance. Researchers have not given adequate prominence in core-effect air-jet texturing and most of the research limited to single-end air-je texturing. Wickramasinghe (2003) has investigated the use of steam as an alternative fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing and studied the performance of sewing threads manufactured using core-effect steam-jet textured yarns. He reported that steam could be used as an alternative fluid for air in manufacturing core-effect spun-like textured sewing threads.|$|R
