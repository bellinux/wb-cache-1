5|$|During {{the discussions}} between Gandhi and the British {{government}} over 1931–32 at the Round Table Conferences, Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation {{to the end}} of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians. The British side sought reforms that would keep Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India. They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables. Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> <b>together</b> but divide them, perpetuate their status and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} {{negative}} capability {{can be seen}} at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed to <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> <b>together</b> in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, {{but at the same time}} could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.|$|E

Questlove has referred to the recording experience at the studio as a [...] "left-of-center black music renaissance".|$|E

Described by her as [...] "the journey of a soul from darkness to light", The MDNA Tour was divided into four sections: Transgression, where guns and violence was the main theme, Prophecy, where a mix of joyful songs that <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> <b>together</b> are performed, Masculine/Feminine, a combination of sensuality and fashion {{with a few of}} Madonna's classic songs performed in a French Cabaret-style, and Redemption, which Madonna labelled as [...] "a big party and celebration". The tour received positive reviews, but courted many controversial subjects such as violence, firearms, human rights, nudity and politics.

Total gross was $305.2million from 88 sold-out shows, becoming the tenth highest-grossing tour of all time and surpassing Celine Dion's Taking Chances World Tour as the second highest-grossing tour among female artists, behind Madonna's own Sticky & Sweet Tour.|$|E
