40|$|Several {{experiments}} on sheeting {{are under way}} in the chemistry department of Iowa State College. Miss Margaret Furry, a graduate student, is working on 2 ̆ 2 The Analysis of Cotton <b>Bed</b> <b>Sheeting,</b> 2 ̆ 2 as her research problem. Frances Jones, junior in Home Economics, is working on 2 ̆ 7 the ash content of wide sheeting, and Marion Griffith is determining the deterioration of wide cotton sheeting due to laundering...|$|E
40|$|Nonwoven webs {{containing}} {{five different}} blends of bleached cotton with Lyocell rayon, bicomponent core/sheath polyester/polyethylene, or cotton comber noil were prepared by either light needlepunching, or light needlepunching followed by spunlacing (hydroentanglement). We optically acquired fiber bundle size measurements {{to learn about}} the pre-needling process, the hydroentangling process and the influence of fiber blend composition on fiber entanglement. Fiber entanglement measurements were compared to basis weight uniformity measurements. One of the bed sheet developments utilized a combination of bonding technologies (spunlacing and thermal bonding) that used low energy. Results from this work indicate that spunlacing produced high quality cosmetic pads and economical short-life <b>bed</b> <b>sheeting...</b>|$|E
40|$|Until recently, Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) were {{predominantly}} developed for {{applications in the}} biomedical and engineering industry, and {{only a limited number}} of applications in textiles are known. Fabrics made of natural fibres (e. g. cotton, flax and their mixtures) present many advantages, such as wearing comfort, but they are subject to creasing. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of compensating for this disadvantage by using SMAs to create aesthetic low crease flax/cotton fabrics. Body Temperature SMAs (BT SMA) that regain their (straight) form when they are subject to human body temperature were used for this purpose. Clothing and <b>bed</b> <b>sheeting</b> are potential applications of these hybrid structures, which become wrinkle-free when they are exposed to the heat of the body, a hair dryer or that generated by an electrical current. The materials selected to achieve this purpose were the following: (1) textile yarns (e. g. single cotton or flax/cotton yarns, two-fold flax yarns and two types of loop fancy yarns) and (2) BT SMA wires of 300 mu m diameter. A power weaving loom and a hand-weaving shuttle loom were used to embed the SMA wires, and four types of hybrid fabrics were produced. The thickness, wrinkle recovery, dimensional stability as well as the cohesion of the SMA wires in the woven fabric were tested. All the tests were performed before and after a washing cycle for both the hybrid and reference fabrics. An increase in thickness was noticed after washing, and the recovery time after crushing varied according to the type of fabric. The slippage of SMA wires from the fabrics was noticed for all the samples, which was dependent on the type of yarns used, their linear density and the weaving process...|$|E
25|$|Bleaching {{improves}} whiteness {{by removing}} natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; {{the degree of}} bleaching necessary {{is determined by the}} required whiteness and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an oxidizing agent, such as dilute sodium hypochlorite or dilute hydrogen peroxide. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, then lower levels of bleaching are acceptable, for example. However, for white <b>bed</b> <b>sheetings</b> and medical applications, the highest levels of whiteness and absorbency are essential.|$|R
