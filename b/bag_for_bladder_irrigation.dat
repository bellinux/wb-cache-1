One {{option is to}} transfer the patient to a urology ward, but often there are outstanding medical issues that require continued specialist input. Here, we describe an improved system <b>for</b> delivering temporary <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation</b> by utilizing readily available components and the novel modification of a sphygmomanometer blub. This option is good <b>for</b> <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation</b> in patients with moderate or severe gross hematuria due to various causes. Materials and methods: In this prospective study from March 2007 to April 2009, we used our new system in eligible cases. In this system, an irrigant bag with 1 L of normal saline was suspended 80 cm above the indwelled 3 -way Foley catheter, and its drainage tube was inserted into the irrigant port of the catheter. To increase the flow rate of the irrigant system, we inserted a traditional sphygmomanometer bulb {{at the top of}} the irrigant bag. This closed system was used <b>for</b> continuous <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation</b> (CBI) in patients who underwent open prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), or transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB). This high-pressure system is also used for irrigation during cystourethroscopy, internal urethrotomy, and transurethral lithotripsy. Our 831 eligible cases were divided into two groups: group 1 were endourologic cases and group 2 were open prostatectomy, TURP, and TURB cases. The maximum and average flow rates were evaluated. The efficacy of our new system was compared prospectively with the previous traditional system used in 545 cases. Results: In group 1, we had clear vision at the time of endourologic procedures. The success rate of this system was 99. 5 %. In group 2, the incidence of clot retention decreased two-fold in comparison to traditional gravity-dependent bladder flow system. These changes were statistically significant (P = 0. 001). We did not observe any adverse effects such as bladder perforation due to our high-pressure, high-flow system. Conclusion: A pressurized irrigant system has better visualization during endourologic procedures, and prevents clot formation after open prostatectomy, TURP, and TURB without any adverse effects.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1975 Dr. L. Valerie AscheThis study was made to ascertain the aetiology, origin and pathways of infection {{as well as the}} reason for recurrence of urinary tract infection in male patients with permanent indwelling catheter, at the Spinal Injuries Unit, Austin Hospital, Australia. There has been no detailed bacteriological report published since the Unit opened in 1956. Since urinary infections are frequent during the life of spinal paralytics, it is important in the management of such patients to determine whether it is relapse or re—infection which plays the major role of infection. The main body of this thesis presents the findings of a detailed search for wall—defective bacteria (L—forms) in an attempt to confirm or deny the hypothesis that persistent L—forms play a part in the repeated isolation of the same organism from a patient over a number of years. The aetiology of urinary infection occurring in new admissions was a reflection of the ward flora present at different times of survey, which in turn depended on the disinfection measures taken. Gram—negative, urea splitting organisms such as Klebsiella, Proteus, and Providence as well as the nosocomial bacteria Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Serratia were found to be more common in causing urinary infection than the traditional Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. The chlorhexidine solution used <b>for</b> <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation</b> was shown to be the source of Acinetobacter infections acquired during 1971 - 2 in new admissions. From weekly examinations during 1971 - 2 of new admissions there was little evidence that the urinary infections came from the patients' own faecal or nasal flora even when Klebsiella, Proteus or Pseudomonas were regularly isolated from such material.

With this background, {{the value of}} <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation</b> with amphotericin B {{for the management of}} funguria is directly examined. Amphotericin B <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation</b> is used frequently in clinical practice. Although its use is not standardized, there are multiple studies that attempt to show the impact on funguria management. These <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigations</b> have been used either for treatment of funguria or (less commonly) as a diagnostic test in attempts to identify upper urinary tract disease.

Urine containing the active metabolite was obtained from dogs given cyclophosphamide (125 mg/kg intravenously). It was added to acetylcysteine or normal saline in a ratio of 1 to 2, and these solutions were instilled into the bladders of normal dogs. These animals were killed after 24 hours. The dogs receiving urine with the activated product plus saline had significant cystitis, whereas those receiving urine with activated product and acetylcysteine had only minimal histologic changes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Irrigation or washouts of {{the bladder}} are usually {{performed}} in various clinical settings. In the 1980 s Elliot and colleagues argued that urothelial damage could occur after washouts and <b>irrigations</b> of the <b>bladder.</b> The exact mechanism underlying urothelial damage {{has not yet}} been discovered. To our knowledge, this is the first report of fatal fluid overload and pulmonary edema, due to urothelium disruption occurring during <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation,</b> approached performing complete histological and immunohistochemical investigation on bladder specimens. The exposed case deserves attention since it demonstrates that, although very rarely, irrigation or washouts of the bladder may have unexpected serious clinical consequences. CASE PRESENTATION: An 85 year-old Caucasian man, unable to eat independently and whose fluid intake was controlled, underwent continuous <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation</b> with a 3 -way catheter due to a severe episode of macrohematuria. During the third day of hospitalization, while still undergoing <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation,</b> he suddenly experienced extreme shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, and cough with frothy sputum. His attending nurse immediately noted that there was no return of the fluid (5 liters) introduced through <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation.</b> He was treated urgently with hemodialysis. At the beginning of the dialysis treatment, the patient had gained 7. 4 kg since the previous measurement (24 hours prior) without any clear explanation. Although a significant weight loss (from 81 to 76 kg) due to the dialysis procedure, the patient died shortly after the final treatment. The autopsy revealed that the brain and the lungs were heavily edematous. Microscopic examination of bladder specimens revealed interstitial and mucosal swelling, and loss of the superficial cell layer. Intermediate and basal urothelial cells were preserved. Altogether the above mentioned findings were suggestive of a diffuse disruption of the urothelium. In conclusion the death of the man was attributed to an acute severe pulmonary edema due to massive fluid absorption. CONCLUSION: Our case demonstrates that urothelium disruption may occur during irrigation and washouts of the bladder, also in the absence of other well-known predisposing conditions. Inappropriate use of <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation</b> should be avoided and a close attention is required of the fluid balance is mandatory when irrigating the bladder...|$|R

On contrary, incurable and antibiotics resistant {{urinary tract infection}}s are increasing. Especially, infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa have become increasingly common in patients with spinal cord injury. In order to combat incurable urinary tract infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are common in the special ward for patients with spinal cord injury, we carried out several clinical and bacteriological studies as follows. 1) Effect of 3 '- 4 '-dideoxykanamycin B (DKB) administration to Pseudomonas infected patients. 2) Effect of daily <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation</b> using Polymixin B sulfate solution (500 thousand units/ 100 /ml) 3) Culture of falling bacteria in the ward. 4) Pseudomonas infections in bedsores. 5) Pseudomonas infection at the external urethral orifice.

And, as a route of infections, the contact infection was suspected. Then we carried out the following programs as the control and prevention of ward-acquired Pseudomonas infection. 1) Putting on gloves when man contacts with urine or penis 2) Daily <b>bladder</b> <b>irrigation</b> using Polymixin B solution to patients with indwelling catheter 3) Apply an ointment of gentamicin sulfate to the external urethral orifice twice a day for catheter indwelled patients 4) Use of amphoteric surface active agent (TEGO- 51) as a disinfectant solution. After the practices of above mentioned programs, the rate of Pseudomonas infection decreased remarkably from 60 % to 30 %...|$|R
