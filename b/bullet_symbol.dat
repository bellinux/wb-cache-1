5000|$|The <b>bullet</b> <b>symbol</b> {{may take}} any {{of a variety of}} shapes, such as circular, square, diamond or arrow. Typical word {{processor}} software offers a wide selection of shapes and colors. Several regular symbols, such as * (asterisk), - (hyphen), [...] (period), and even o (lowercase O), are conventionally used in ASCII-only text or other environments where bullet characters are not available. When writing by hand, bullets may be drawn in any style. Historically, the index symbol (representing a hand with a pointing index finger) was popular for similar uses.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that life for blind people is too {{difficult}} and complicated. Compared to sighted people, {{they need more}} effort to finish a task in their daily life. The access to different kinds of documents would be a start for an improved life, giving {{them the right to}} a better quality of life. Nowadays, the blinds have access to digital documents with the use of screen readers but unfortunately without perceiving the spatial structure of the document. In this project,, we have implemented a spatial structure of four different types of documents: power point, pdf, excel and html. We have used a series of symbols to present the different kinds of information (for instance <b>bullet</b> <b>symbols).</b> The interaction with the document was developed using three different methods. First, we implemented method 1 – speech synthesis, using only a speech synthesizer for the access to the documents. The next method consists of using a mouse and a speech synthesizer. Finally, we used a concept keyboard to accomplish the third method. Furthermore, this project would not be completed without the evaluation part. Ten subjects participated to the evaluation of the usability and effectiveness of the methods, in addition to the accessibility to the structures of the documents. At the end of the evaluation, {{we were able to get}} results regarding the best method and the design of the structure for all the different kinds of documents...|$|R

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} Half United is to fight hungeracross {{the world by}} selling {{products}} and donating 7 meals for every product sold tofeeding children in need. Carmin and Christian were inspired by a statistic stating, “925million people worldwide suffer from hunger” which provided them with a missionto lower that number. [...] Theyunderstood that hunger {{is the number one}} health risk worldwide [...] leadingto malnutrition, disease, {{and not being able to}} work effectively due tostarvation. The Blacks wanted to put an end to the hunger crisis. The main itemthey use as the symbol of fighting hunger is recycled <b>bullet</b> casing necklaces.This <b>symbol</b> was chosen after a friend donated a box of spent casings to them in the early stages of product development. Then it clicked: the bullet represents their customer's fight against world hunger. Something that once could harm, can now only be used for good. These necklaces are sold all over the United States in small boutiques and inlarger department stores. HU sells other accessories such as T-shirts, hats,bracelets, and earrings with the same purpose of donating 7 meals for every product sold to children in need, both at home and abroad. Half United has inspired the community where thebusiness is located to take a stand against the hunger crisis by providing tolocal food banks and by helping the economy of Wilmington, North Carolina. Theaccessories are all handmade by staff, interns, and volunteers. Supplies, suchas the recycled bullet casings, are donated from resourcesaround town, which shows how the town is involved in the business.Seed necklaces are the next project on board for HU. They plan on planting oneseed for every necklace bought [...] in gardens in Wilmington as wellas gardens globally.|$|R
