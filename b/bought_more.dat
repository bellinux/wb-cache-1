5|$|The Football Association bought Aker's {{share of}} the stadium during the 1930s, and in 1945 also part of Lyn's share. From 1948, the Cup Final was held at Ullevaal, and has been held there since. Other {{activities}} held during the first decades included boxing, and a revival meeting hosted by Billy Graham in front of 40,000 people in 1955. In 1960, NFF <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> shares from Lyn and became the majority shareholder with 50.7%, while Lyn retained 44.2%. The reason was the planned expansion could not receive public grants with such a strong tie to a single club, but the state {{was willing to give}} grants to the stadium if it was controlled by the federation. In 1967, a new South Stand was opened, and the following year NFF moved into offices at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Street Fighter II in 1991 is {{considered}} a revolutionary moment in the fighting game genre. Yoshiki Okamoto's team developed the most accurate joystick and button scanning routine in the genre thus far. This allowed players to reliably execute multi-button special moves, which had previously required an element of luck. The graphics took advantage of Capcom's CPS arcade chipset, with highly detailed characters and stages. Whereas previous games allowed players to combat a variety of computer-controlled fighters, Street Fighter II allowed players to play against each other. The popularity of Street Fighter II surprised the gaming industry, as arcade owners <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> machines {{to keep up with}} demand. Street Fighter II was also responsible for popularizing the combo mechanic, which came about when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks that left no time for the opponent to recover if they timed them correctly.|$|E
5|$|Two local magistrates, J. Bruce and Anthony Hill, were {{stranded}} in the Castle Inn in Merthyr Tydfil. They swore in around 70 men as special constables, but they were heavily outnumbered by the radical crowds. Bruce wrote an urgent letter to Bute in Cardiff Castle, asking for urgent advice on whether to call in the armed forces, and querying whether the Marquess had readied the Militia for action. Huge crowds marched on the local iron works, stopping production. The messages from Merthyr Tydfil reached Bute that afternoon, who began to assemble the Eastern and Central Yeomanry militia units and transport ready for deployment. Bute paused until the morning, hoping to hear better news, but messengers <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> desperate news from Bruce and Hill, and the Yeomanry were dispatched. Meanwhile, an 80-man unit of the 93rd Foot {{had arrived in the}} Castle Inn from Brecon. Bute continued to keep Whitehall informed of the events by letter throughout.|$|E

5|$|The film {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics; its portrayal of Jackson and his performances were generally praised, although some critics and fans of Jackson {{felt that the}} film was made to profit from Jackson's death and argued that the musician would not have wanted the film released {{because he was a}} perfectionist. Despite some fans boycotting the film, and his family not endorsing it, the ticket sales for This Is It broke international records a month before its release. Records were also set in Japan, where more than $1 million in tickets were sold on the first day they were available. In London, fans <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> than 30,000 tickets on the first day. Record sales were also reported in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Brazil, and New Zealand. In the first opening weekend it grossed $101 million worldwide. The film sold $32.5 million over its first five days in the United States and Canada, and $68.5 million in 97 other countries—making the number one film at the box office and making it the fifth highest-grossing Halloween debut. On its theatrical run, the film's worldwide revenue gross was in total $261 million, making it both the highest-grossing concert film and documentary of all-time worldwide.|$|E

25|$|In 1921 {{the state}} <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> of the mountain, {{allowing}} it to designate the road as a hiking trail. By 1931 it had been extended beyond the tower as a footpath, descending the northeast {{side of the mountain}} into Hoyt Hollow to Willow. Later in the 1930s a lean-to was built at the summit for backpackers to camp in.|$|E

25|$|In 1857, Walker <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> {{property}} {{near the}} farm he already owned, increasing his holdings to 468 acres. He began {{construction of the}} flour mill and distillery in the same year, which he visited every day during construction even though he still resided in America. He continued his grocery business in the meantime, helping him become the leading commission merchant in Detroit. After the mill was near complete {{near the end of}} the year, Walker approximately owned $40 000 in capital.|$|E
25|$|What {{is left of}} Ghost Town {{today was}} based on Calico ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott, Arizona. Walter Knott {{inherited}} his uncle's silver mill and land, then <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> of the actual Calico ghost town in 1951 and developed it. In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico, California into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee. See 'History– Ghost Town– Calico' section above.|$|E
25|$|Israel and India share {{intelligence}} on terrorist groups. They have developed close {{defence and security}} ties since establishing diplomatic relations in 1992. India has <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> than $5 billion worth of Israeli equipment since 2002. In addition, Israel is training Indian military units and in 2008 was discussing an arrangement to give Indian commandos instruction in counter-terrorist tactics and urban warfare. In December 2008, Israel and India signed a memorandum {{to set up an}} Indo-Israel Legal Colloquium to facilitate discussions and exchange programmes between judges and jurists of the two countries.|$|E

25|$|Within a few months, the 717's {{abilities}} became clear, being {{faster than}} the BAe 146, and achieving a higher dispatch reliability, over 99%, than competing aircraft. Maintenance costs are low: according to AirTran Airways, a C check inspection, for example, takes three days and is required once every 4,500 flying hours. (For comparison, its predecessor, the DC-9 needed 21 days for a C check.) The new Rolls-Royce BR715 engine design {{is relatively easy to}} maintain. Many 717 operators, such as Qantas, became converts to the plane. Qantas <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> 717s to replace its BAe 146 fleet, and other orders came from Hawaiian Airlines and Midwest Airlines.|$|E
25|$|Cody {{established}} the TE Ranch, {{located on the}} south fork of the Shoshone River about thirty-five miles from Cody. When he acquired the TE property, he stocked it with cattle sent from Nebraska and South Dakota. The new herd carried the TE brand. The late 1890s were relatively prosperous years for the Wild West show, and he <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> land {{to add to the}} ranch. He eventually held around 8,000 acres (32km²) of private land for grazing operations and ran about 1,000 head of cattle. He operated a dude ranch, pack-horse camping trips, and big-game hunting business at and from the TE Ranch. In his spacious ranch house, he entertained notable guests from Europe and America.|$|E
25|$|However, {{according}} to research firm NPD, sales of devices running Windows in the United States have declined 21 percent compared to {{the same time period}} in 2011. As the holiday shopping season wrapped up, Windows 8 sales continued to lag, even as Apple reported brisk sales. The market research firm IDC reported an overall drop in PC sales for the quarter, and said the drop may have been partly due to consumer reluctance to embrace the new features of the OS and poor support from OEM for these features. This capped the first year of declining PC sales to the Asia Pacific region, as consumers <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> mobile devices than Windows PCs.|$|E

25|$|The R {{purchased}} the Pitkin Building on Main Street West and Oak Street in Rochester {{and added a}} two-story Gothic structure to it. The board then hired a highly qualified manager in George E Merchant, who had excelled as a division superintendent for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St Paul, and Pacific. Among the issues he faced upon beginning work in the head office in Rochester were several pending lawsuits against the R and disputes arising from the shady land acquisition practices of the company's forebear. Resolving these, he proceeded to improve the capital plant, including refurbishing the older locomotives and buying new ones. He <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> 4-4-0 Brooks engines, {{as well as a}} number of 2-8-0 Consolidations. Line construction absorbed considerable resources as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{every city}} she visited, she was feted and cheered by audiences. The actors Edouard Angelo and Philippe Garnier were her leading men. Emperor Pedro II of Brazil {{attended}} {{all of her}} performances in Rio de Janeiro, and presented her with a gold bracelet with diamonds, which was almost immediately stolen from her hotel. The two leading actors both fell ill with yellow fever, and her long-time manager, Edward Jarrett, {{died of a heart}} attack. Bernhardt was undaunted, however, and went crocodile hunting at Guayaquil, and also <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> animals for her menagerie. Her performances in every city were sold out, {{and by the end of}} the tour, she had earned more than a million francs. The tour allowed her to purchase her final home, a mansion at 56 Boulevard Pereire, which she filled with her paintings, plants, souvenirs, and animals.|$|E
25|$|Israel and India share {{intelligence}} on terrorist groups. They have developed close defense and security ties since establishing diplomatic relations in 1991. In 2009, Israel overtook Russia as India's biggest arms supplier; the U.S. even gave Israel approval {{to sell the}} Phalcon to India after earlier forcing Jerusalem to cancel a similar deal with China. India has <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> than $5 billion worth of Israeli equipment since 2002. In addition, Israel is training Indian military units and discussing an arrangement to give Indian commandos instruction in counter-terrorist tactics and urban warfare. In December 2008, Israel and India signed a memorandum {{to set up an}} Indo-Israel Legal Colloquium to facilitate discussions and exchange programs between judges and jurists of the two countries. According to an international opinion survey conducted in 2009 on behalf of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, India is the most pro-Israel country in the world.|$|E

25|$|A {{different}} {{study showed}} that higher levels of media exposure are associated with lower reputations for companies, even when the mere exposure is mostly positive. A subsequent review of the research concluded that exposure leads to ambivalence because it brings about {{a large number of}} associations, which tend to be both favorable and unfavorable. Exposure is most likely to be helpful when a company or product is new and unfamiliar to consumers. An 'optimal' level of exposure to an advertisement may or may not exist. In a third study, experimenters primed consumers with affective motives. One group of thirsty consumers were primed with a happy face before being offered a beverage, while a second group was primed with an unpleasant face. The group primed with the happy face <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> beverages, and were also willing to pay more for the beverage than their unhappy counterparts. This study bolsters Zajonc's claim that choices are not in need of cognition. Buyers often choose what they 'like' instead of what they have substantially cognized.|$|E
25|$|Polk was a slaveholder for {{his entire}} life. His father, Samuel Polk, had left Polk more than 8,000 acres (32km²) of land, and divided about 53 slaves to his widow and {{children}} after he died. James inherited twenty of his father's slaves, {{either directly or}} from deceased brothers. In 1831, he became an absentee cotton planter, sending slaves to clear plantation land {{that his father had}} left him near Somerville, Tennessee. Four years later Polk sold his Somerville plantation and, together with his brother-in-law, bought 920 acres (3.7km²) of land, a cotton plantation near Coffeeville, Mississippi. He ran this plantation {{for the rest of his}} life, eventually taking it over completely from his brother-in-law. Polk rarely sold slaves, although once he became President and could better afford it, he <b>bought</b> <b>more.</b> Polk's will stipulated that their slaves were to be freed after his wife, Sarah, had died. However, the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution freed all remaining slaves in rebel states long before the death of his wife in 1891.|$|E
25|$|During the Victorian era Canvey {{became a}} very fashionable place to visit, and its air was {{promoted}} as having healing properties. This started in 1899, after the Black Monday floods, when an entrepreneur called Frederick Hester bought Leigh Beck Farm, and started {{what was to}} be called Southview Park estate. The properties sold very quickly so Frederick <b>bought</b> <b>more</b> plots of land, selling them as dream homes for London's Eastenders. Hester wanted to create Canvey as a great seaside resort for Londoners, and so built the first promenade, a pier and a magnificent winter garden & palace, of which he planned to cover six miles (but only covered a mile), as well as a mono rail system (initially horse drawn then later electric). Hester marketed Canvey as Ye Old Dutch Island giving many of the new roads Dutch sounding names, and enticing potential buyers with free rail tickets. The project started well with thousands of plots sold, however by 1905 the scheme had fallen apart due to materials not being delivered and issues with land ownership with the laying of the mono rail. Hester was declared bankrupt and everything was sold off at an auction held at Chimney's Farm.|$|E
