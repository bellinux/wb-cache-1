Second, there is no distinction of gender.|$|E

500|$|The game is principally {{split between}} city {{management}} and tactical combat. [...] Gameplay is turn-based, alternating between player and computer, {{and much of}} the game is played on the World Map, a representation of the land of Aragon. [...] Each turn on this map represents a month in the game. [...] The map shows cities and the player's units; unexplored areas are <b>blanked</b> <b>out</b> until they have been explored by the player's units. [...] By using the keyboard and mouse, the player moves a cursor to select units and cities, and issue orders via keystrokes. [...] Cities under the player's control provide monthly income, which is supplemented by tributes from vassals and loot from battles. [...] Income from a city is improved by expending funds to develop the city's economic sectors, such as agriculture and mining, or by increasing taxation. [...] Tax rates, however, affect the loyalty of citizens; high taxes in a city lead to a decreasing population.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, The Crab {{with the}} Golden Claws, along with King Ottokar's Sceptre, {{became the first}} Tintin adventures {{published}} in the United States, in Little Golden Books. However, Casterman, working with the American publisher Western Publishing, {{made a number of}} changes: Jumbo, the sailor who Tintin leaves bound and gagged in Captain Haddock's cabin, as well as another man who beats Haddock in the cellar, could not be black Africans as depicted in the original; these were changed to a white sailor and an Arab due to the American publisher's concerns depicting blacks and whites mixing together. The accompanying text was not changed, however, and Haddock still refers to the man who beat him as a [...] "Negro". Also by request of the Americans, scenes of Haddock drinking directly from bottles of whiskey on the lifeboat and the plane were <b>blanked</b> <b>out,</b> keeping only the text. The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Hergé to be more acceptable, and they appear this way in published editions around the world. Casterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of the fourth volume in their [...] collection. In 1989, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition.|$|E

2500|$|Hip hop {{music has}} been censored on radio and TV due to the {{explicit}} lyrics of certain genres. Many songs {{have been criticized for}} anti-establishment and sometimes violent messages. The use of profanity as well as graphic depictions of violence and sex in hip hop music videos and songs makes it hard to broadcast on television stations such as MTV, in music video form, and on radio. As a result, many hip hop recordings are broadcast in censored form, with offending language [...] "bleeped" [...] or <b>blanked</b> <b>out</b> of the soundtrack, or replaced with [...] "clean" [...] lyrics. The result– which sometimes renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording– has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music, and has been parodied in films such as Austin Powers in Goldmember, in which Mike Myers' character Dr. Evil– performing in a parody of a hip hop music video ("Hard Knock Life" [...] by Jay-Z) – performs an entire verse that is <b>blanked</b> <b>out.</b> In 1995, Roger Ebert wrote: ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the film's controversy, The Birth of a Nation {{was very}} popular. At over three hours in length (including intermissions), {{the film was}} {{ground-breaking}} in its production value, budget and ambition. At the time, the film was unlike anything the American audiences had ever seen before. The Los Angeles Times in a review called The Birth of a Nation [...] "the greatest picture ever made and the greatest drama ever filmed", going on to say [...] "it was beyond doubt the most extraordinary picture that has ever been seen". The Reverend Charles Henry Parkhurst defended the film against the charge of racism by saying the film [...] "was exactly true to history" [...] by depicting freedmen as they were, and therefore the film was a [...] "compliment to the black man" [...] by showing how far black people had [...] "advanced" [...] since Reconstruction. The critic Dolly Dalrymple reported about an audience in Alabama [...] "when I saw it, {{it was far from}} silent...incessant murmurs of approval, roars of laughter, grasps of anxiety, and outbursts of applause greeted every new picture on the screen".. One man viewing the film was so moved by the scene where Flora Cameron flees Gus to avoid to being raped that he took out his handgun and began firing at the screen in an effort to help her. The American author Katherine DuPre Lumpkin in her 1947 autobiography The Making of a Southerner recalled watching the film as a 18-year old in 1915: [...] "Here was the black figure—and the fear of the white girl—though the scene <b>blanked</b> <b>out</b> just in time. Here were the sinister men the South scorned and the noble men the South revered. And through it all the Klan rode. All around me people sighed and shivered, and now and then shouted or wept, in their intensity." [...] Dixon himself was well pleased with the reaction of white audiences to the film. In a letter sent on May 1, 1915, to Joseph P. Tumulty, the press secretary to President Wilson, Dixon wrote: [...] "The real purpose of my film was to revolutionize Northern sentiments by a presentation of history that would transform every man in the audience into a good Democrat...Every man who comes out of the theater is a Southern partisan for life!". In letter to President Wilson sent on September 5, 1915, Dixon boasted: [...] "This play is transforming the entire population of the North and the West into sympathetic Southern voters. There will never be an issue of your segregation policy". Dixon was alluding to the fact that Wilson upon becoming president in 1913 had imposed segregation on federal workplaces in Washington D.C. while reducing the number of black employees through demotion or dismissal.|$|E

25|$|New Age {{meditation}} as practised by {{the early}} hippies is regarded for its techniques of <b>blanking</b> <b>out</b> the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking. This is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object.
