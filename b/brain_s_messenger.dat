40|$|The {{cytoplasm}} of HeLa cells {{infected with}} adenovirus type 2 contains {{many species of}} low molecular weight RNA, including several of viral origin. In addition to a 9 <b>S</b> <b>messenger</b> RNA, the viral genome gives rise to two species of virus-associated RNA: the major species is 5. 5 S RNA or virus-associated RNAI, and the minor species is 5. 2 S RNA or virus-associated RNAII. Virus-associated RNAI occurs in the cytoplasm in several electrophoretically separable forms, and its sequences are also present in high molecular weight nuclear RNA but not in cytoplasmic mRNA. The structure of virus-associated RNAII is shown to be distinct {{from that of the}} major species, and the position of its gene is mapped on the viral genome.

40|$|In {{the nucleus}} of HeLa cells late after {{infection}} with adenovirus type 2 mRNA-sequences which are processed via RNA splicing {{are attached to the}} nuclear matrix (Mariman et al., 1982). Although the mRNA, which codes for polypeptide IX, is not formed via splicing, about 70 % of the non-polyadenylated pre-mRNA and the polyadenylated pIX mRNA are bound to the matrix structure, indicating that polyadenylation is performed while the RNA is associated with the matrix. Binding to the nuclear matrix seems to be a common property of all mRNA-sequences in the nucleus. At the late stage of infection most of the newly synthesized mRNAs which appear in the cytoplasm are viral specific (Beltz & Flint, 1979). Kinetic analysis of the newly synthesized poly(A) -containing mRNA on sucrose gradients reveals that 7 - 12 <b>S</b> <b>messengers</b> appear more rapidly in the cytoplasm than messengers larger than 13 S. More specifically, the nuclear exit time of the pIX-mRNA, which is the major 9 <b>S</b> adenoviral <b>messenger</b> late after infection, was determined to be about 4 min, while messengers transcribed from the late region 3 need more than 16 min to arrive in the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm about 70 % of the mRNA is bound to the cytoskeletal framework, while 30 % remains as free mRNP. Analysis of the mRNA in both fractions reveals that L 3 -, E 1 B- and pIX-specific polyadenylated mRNA preferably exist as cytoskeleton-bound mRNA. However, significant differences occur in the partition of specific messengers over free and cytoskeletal RNA fractions...|$|R

DNA synthesis is entirely dependent on added RNA template and oligo(dT) primer. Both the size and the concentration of the primer affect the reaction. The product behaves similarly to DNA during centrifugation in cesium sulfate density gradients. It is shown by hybridization that the DNA made is complementary to the purified template, light-chain mRNA. The high specific activity of the complementary DNA should make it suitable for gene-dosage experiments. According to alkaline sucrose gradient analyses, some complete complementary DNA transcripts of the 14 S mRNA seem to be made. Oligo(dG) can also function as a primer for DNA synthesis, possibly by annealing to an internal cluster of cytidines in the mRNA, that correspond to the bases coding for amino-acids 119 and 120 of the MOPC 41 light chain...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Huntington's disease (HD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder {{caused by a}} CAG repeat expansion within the huntingtin gene. Mutant huntingtin protein misfolds and accumulates within neurons where it mediates its toxic effects. Promoting mutant huntingtin clearance by activating macroautophagy is one approach for treating Huntington's disease (HD). In this study, we evaluated the mTOR kinase inhibitor and macroautophagy promoting drug everolimus in the R 6 / 2 mouse model of HD. Results Everolimus decreased phosphorylation of the mTOR target protein S 6 kinase indicating brain penetration. However, everolimus did not activate brain macroautophagy as measured by LC 3 B Western blot analysis. Everolimus protected against early declines in motor performance; however, we found no evidence for neuroprotection as determined by brain pathology. In muscle but not brain, everolimus significantly decreased soluble mutant huntingtin levels. Conclusions Our data suggests that beneficial behavioral effects of everolimus in R 6 / 2 mice result primarily from effects on muscle. Even though everolimus significantly modulated its target <b>brain</b> <b>S</b> 6 kinase, this did not decrease mutant huntingtin levels or provide neuroprotection. </p...|$|R
