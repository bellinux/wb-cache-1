The first four failure criteria (FC 1, FC 2, FC 3 and FC 4) assumed were for; group of trees on the slope, tree at the top, tree in the middle and tree at the toe of the slope, while FC 5 and FC 6 were for slope models with rainfall infiltration only and rainfall plus group of tree weight respectively. Beaufort wind scale 11 was used, and Tree Diameters at <b>Breast</b> <b>Heights</b> (DBH) were varied, commencing with 25 cm, 30 cm and 60 cm for assumed eucalyptus tree height of 25 cm. The additional shear strength due to an increased cohesion from the roots (was assumed, on the top soil layer of silty clay. Finite element analysis with SEEP/W 2007 was coupled with Limit equilibrium analysis software of SLOPE/W 2007 to achieve expected output or results from different failure criteria. Initial suction of 50 kPa at the top of silty clay and 20 kPa in the layer of silty gravel, with a total 1044 generated deformed mesh boundary condition were used in transient seepage analysis.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to characterise the influence of plant spacing on the survival and growth of pines in dry and fresh coniferous forest habitats after almost 40 years since stand establishment. In this study, we compared seven types of spacing, including square, rectangular and triangular configurations, with initial densities ranging from 6944 units/ha to 15 625 units/ha. The research covered two sites where no tending interventions of selective character were performed throughout the growth period. We found that habitat conditions had an influence on tree survival as well as growth in thickness and height in the pine forest stands. In the less fertile habitat, where competition between trees was less intense, about 1, 5 to 2 times more trees survived than in the more fertile habitat. Pines growing in the fresh coniferous forest were taller and had substantially larger diameter <b>breast</b> <b>heights</b> (dbh) in comparison to pines of the dry coniferous forest. Additionally, habitat conditions had an influence on the spacing effect correctness of the analysed features. In the poorer habitat this influence was stronger, which showed in a greater differentiation of the analysed parameters as compared to the more fertile habitat. Average dbh values of all trees on the Płock surface increased with decreasing initial density and ranged from 8, 24 cm in variant A (15 625 units/ha) to 9, 79 cm in variant C (6944 units/ha). On the Łąck surface, trees growing at a lower density (variants C and E) were significantly thicker than trees growing at densities between 10 000 units/ha and 15 625 units/ha (spacing variants A, B, F, G). Furthermore, our results showed a significant influence of habitat conditions and plant spacing on the thickness of pines belonging to the 1 st biosocial class. Moreover, we found a positive influence of triangular-shaped spacing on the trees' thickness increment in the fresh coniferous forest, which confirms reports from other authors. Hence, we can deduce that triangular spacing enables trees to make better use of their surrounding space which positively impacts on their growth parameters. Based on these results, we can conclude that, in pine forests, there is a significant influence of habitat conditions on tree survival and growth in thickness and height. This study also showed significant differences between the types of plant spacing and their effect on pine shafts in the II age class. However, a relationship between height growth rate and initial density was not observed. In both of the investigated habitats, the highest trees were observed at densities around 11 500 units/ha with triangular spacing enhancing this effect. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R

The fallen trees due wind effect prior to the landslide coupled with intense rainfall are believed to trigger that landslide. Therefore, the effect of commonly known causative factor of rainfall and an uncommon landslide causal factor of wind forces on landslide occurrence were investigated in this study. The geometry of the modelled slope consists of 111 m height, 480 m length, and an inclination of 21 °. Finite element seepage software, Seep/W and limit equilibrium software, Slope/W were used for modelling the landslide occurrence using five (5) slope models with and without additional shear strength in form of tree root cohesion. Each of the slope models was subjected to four failure criteria (FC). The first two failure criteria (FC 1 and FC 2) are assigned for group of tree along the slope (FC 1) and a single tree at the middle (FC 2) of the modelled slope. The other two failure criteria (FC 3 and FC 4) are assigned for the modelled slope with rainfall infiltration alone and rainfall plus several tree weights, respectively. The wind speed during which the landslide occurred was depicted using Beaufort wind scale 11 and {{was applied to the}} appropriate models. The results obtained show that with eucalyptus trees of Diameters at <b>Breast</b> <b>Heights</b> (DBH) of 25 cm, a minimum factor of safety (FOS) of 1. 012 and 1. 273 were recorded for FC 2 in Slope model 1 and slope model 4 with and without increased cohesion, respectively.

The buds are ovoid in shape and are very small, measuring only [...] in length. These are usually not resinous, but may be slightly so.|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty day-old Abor-acre strain {{broilers}} chicks were {{used to evaluate the}} blood parameters, carcass yield, organ weight and villi morphometrics of broilers fed low protein diet in excess of dietary lysine. The chicks were weighed on the eight day and then randomly assigned to five experimental diets {{in such a way that}} each dietary treatment had 30 birds replicated thrice. Diet 1 was the control with 22. 22 % crude protein (CP) while diets 2, 3, 4 and 5 contained 16. 6 % CP each at both starter and finisher phases with varying levels of lysine ranging from 0. 50 to 0. 90 %. They all had the same level of methionine. Results showed that the birds fed diet 4 (16. 6 % CP and 0. 8 % lysine inclusion level) had a significantly (p< 0. 05) higher <b>breast,</b> villi <b>height,</b> crypt depth and muscle thickness while the lymphocyte count, total protein, abdominal fat and back size increased linearly with lysine inclusion unlike decreases in heterophil among birds fed LCP diets. It can be concluded that increased villi morphology enhanced breast yield due to enhanced absorption with increased abdominal fat as observed in birds fed 16. 6 % CP and 0. 8 % lysine inclusion leve...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{sought to}} examine the {{hypothesis}} that girls who were relatively tall during the prepubescent period (indicative of an affluent diet and good general health) were at increased risk of subsequent breast cancer. They conducted a case-control study of 214 long-term members who were {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} during 1973 – 1995 and who were age 12 years or younger when they first joined Kaiser Permanente and of 214 appropriately matched controls. Information was obtained from the medical records. While the authors observed the expected association of adult height with risk of <b>breast</b> cancer (<b>height</b> at age 15 – 18 years, tall-for-age vs. short-for-age: odds ratio = 2. 2, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 1, 4. 3), the association was no stronger earlier in life (height at age 9 – 11 years: odds ratio = 1. 0, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 5, 1. 8). The study does not support a relation between pubertal skeletal growth and adult risk of breast cancer. However, it is limited by the inclusion of few postmenopausal women.

30|$|Obesity {{may be one}} of {{the risk}} factors for breast cancer. Among 71 breast cancer patients, there are only 15 <b>breast</b> cancer patients’ <b>height</b> and weight given by {{hospital}} authority. Among these 15 patients, 12 are obese. The majority of the 12 obese patients are from 50 to 59  years old. The result shows that increase in body mass tends to cause an increase in risk of breast cancer among older patient (> 35  years old), in agreement with a study (Erin et al. 2010). The finding may help to increase awareness among women regarding importance of maintaining a healthy weight. The overweight also has the greater risk of breast cancer recurrence or death [Su et al. 2010; American Cancer Society 2011; Peacock et al. 1999; Zografos et al. 2004; Zheng et al. 2001).|$|R
