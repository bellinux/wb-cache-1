50|$|Morris chairs {{feature a}} seat with a {{reclining}} back and moderately high armrests, which give the chair an old-style appearance. The characteristic feature of a Morris chair is a hinged back, set between two un-upholstered arms, with the reclining angle adjusted through {{a row of}} pegs, holes or notches in each arm. In other instances, the reclining of the back is controlled by a metal bar set in hooked <b>back</b> <b>racks.</b> The original Morris chair had dark stained woodwork, turned spindles and heavily decorated upholstery, in typical Victorian style.|$|R

50|$|A Dutch {{convention}} is {{to carry a}} passenger on the <b>back</b> <b>rack,</b> the passenger balancing side-saddle. The sturdy rack supports passenger weight, to carry a passenger and sustain a launch without collapsing. A standard strap assembly attaches cleanly to the rack, providing useful transport capability. There are standard notches for a strap assembly with 2 to 4 elastic straps. The rack is integrated into the bike design; the taillight is usually mounted {{on the back of}} the rack.|$|E
50|$|A {{skirt guard}} (or coatguard) allows using the bike with normal clothes, {{for both the}} main rider and a {{passenger}} riding on the <b>back</b> <b>rack.</b> The skirt guard helps enable riding in cold and rain because it allows easy use of a coat, cloak, dress, skirt, scarf, or luggage; winter biking becomes possible in conjunction with wearing more clothing and using a skirtguard and chaincase. It also enables transporting various materials on the rack without getting caught in the spokes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vehicles}} have {{a capacity}} of 200 passengers, 108 seated and 92 standing. The trains have priority seating areas (fully ADA compliant) for wheelchairs. A [...] "VIP section" [...] with room for laptop use with WiFi access is also included. Bike racks, luggage <b>racks,</b> high <b>back</b> <b>racks,</b> and low floor entry for easy access are all features of what Capital Metro calls the safest and most technologically advanced trains in North America. WiFi is provided by cellular based 3G service. Capital Metro is currently researching upgrading access to 4G speeds, but {{is dependent on the}} cell carrier offering a commercial grade product that will work in Capital Metro's devices. [...] For safety, the vehicles have ten cameras outside and six inside, as well as a sophisticated communications system.|$|R

50|$|Pulling {{the drill}} string out of or running the drill string {{into the hole}} is {{referred}} to as tripping. Drill pipe, HWDP and collars are typically <b>racked</b> <b>back</b> in stands in to the monkeyboard which is a component of the derrick {{if they are to be}} run back into the hole again after, say, changing the bit. The disconnect point ("break") is varied each subsequent round trip so that after three trips every connection has been broken apart and later made up again with fresh pipe dope applied.|$|R
50|$|After leading Strath Haven High School to two PIAA state championships, Mark Jones {{played all}} over the field at the University of Tennessee, seeing action at wide receiver, safety, punt returner, and kick returner. For his career, he caught 36 passes for 556 yards (a 15.4 avg.) and five touchdowns, all during his senior season in 2003. He also rushed seven times for 65 yards. As a {{defensive}} <b>back,</b> Jones <b>racked</b> up 116 career tackles, four interceptions, ten defended passes, two forced fumbles, one tackle for a loss, and one recovered fumble. On the special teams side of the ball, he returned 46 punts for 543 yards and one touchdown; he also returned four kickoffs for 138 yards and one touchdown. His longest kickoff return was 82 {{yards for a touchdown}} against the University of Alabama in his junior year (2002). In his senior year, he ranked second in the SEC and third in the national standings, averaging 15.7 yards per punt return. Jones majored in psychology.|$|R

25|$|The Steelers, {{who lost}} {{four of the}} their first five games during the season, {{dominated}} the Colts with 526 yards of total offense, while limiting Baltimore to only 170. Quarterback Terry Bradshaw completed 14 of 18 passes for 267 yards and three touchdowns, including a 76-yard one to Frank Lewis on the third play of the game, giving him the first perfect 158.3 passer rating in NFL playoff history. Steelers running <b>back</b> Franco Harris <b>racked</b> up 132 rushing yards on 18 carries, and caught 3 passes for 24 yards, despite leaving the game with an injury early in the third quarter.|$|R
50|$|Pressing the tab key on the {{computer}} keyboard reveals the Record <b>racks</b> <b>back</b> side, where you can access additional parameters for the rackmounted devices, including signal cables for audio and CV. This allows users to virtually route cables connecting the devices in the rack like in a traditional hardware based studio. For example, a device's output can be split into two signal chains for different processing, and the connected to different mixer channels. Users can choose where {{to draw the line}} between simplicity and precision, allowing Record to remain useful at various levels of knowledge and ambition on the user's part.|$|R

50|$|A design {{variation}} {{provides for}} a slim profile keyboard mounted in independent slides under the display and the display is hinged and mounted {{at the front of}} the unit. This allows the display to be deployed with the keyboard stowed so it does not protrude into aisle space. The display, when tilted upright, may only protrude an inch or so, effectively flush with the front of the rack. The keyboard can then be pulled out, used, and pushed <b>back</b> into the <b>rack.</b> These units still fit within 1U with a short installed depth. The disadvantage in this design is typically a laptop style keyboard will be used with limited keystroke.|$|R
50|$|The Cotton Bowl Classic, held in {{the stadium}} {{of the same name}} in Dallas on January 1, matched the Tennessee Volunteers (SEC) and the Texas A&M Aggies (Big 12). On the game's seventh play from scrimmage, Vols QB Rick Clausen, a third-stringer for most of the season, {{completed}} a short pass to C.J. Fayton, who promptly turned the reception into a 57-yard touchdown to give the Vols an early lead. Clausen passed for two more TDs with no interceptions, Vols running <b>back</b> Gerald Riggs <b>racked</b> up 102 yards and a TD on the ground, and the Vols defense pressured the Aggies into five turnovers. Tennessee ended with a 38-7 win, their most one-sided bowl win ever.|$|R

The next morning, Carver tells Naomi that the breakfast that she has just received {{is the only thing}} she's eating because she's going to be put <b>back</b> on the <b>rack</b> later on. As he heads downstairs, he finds Peter trying to stick his penis in Claudia's crack.

50|$|Tedeschi {{began his}} career in 1982 in single-seaters, in 1984 he was the Italian {{champion}} in Formula Fiat Abarth. He also raced in the Italian Formula 3 for several seasons, finishing 5th in the standings in 1988. He raced in the Italian Superturismo Championship from 1994-1997 and won many races in that category before switching to the International Sports Racing Series. In 1998, he continued to race in the series up until 2000. He won at least one race {{in all of the}} categories that he participated in. He didn't race much after this, but did make one-off appearances in the Porsche Supercup in 2003 and in the Superstars Series in 2011. In September 2012, it was announced that Tedeschi would make his World Touring Car Championship debut with Proteam Racing driving a BMW 320 TC in the Race of the United States round held at Sonoma Raceway. However he had an accident in the first practice session, leaving his car to badly damaged, to be repaired in time for the races. In 2015, he went <b>back</b> to <b>rack</b> in GT Italian Tourismo Championship, driving a Ferrari 458. He participated in 6 race, earning the podium distinction in his category.|$|R
5000|$|Heavy {{equipment}} or equipment which is commonly accessed for servicing, for which attaching or detaching at all four corners simultaneously would pose a problem, {{is often not}} mounted directly onto the rack but instead is mounted via rails (or slides). A pair of rails is mounted directly onto the rack, and the equipment then slides into the rack along the rails, which support it. When in place, the equipment may also then be bolted to the rack. The rails may {{also be able to}} fully support the equipment in a position where it has been slid clear of the rack; this is useful for inspection or maintenance of equipment which will then be slid <b>back</b> into the <b>rack.</b> [...] Some rack slides even include a tilt mechanism allowing easy access to the top or bottom of rack mounted equipment when it is fully extended from the rack.|$|R

Like other full-fledged touring bikes, the Pro Tour models featured a longer wheelbase with longer chainstays for smoother ride especially while loaded, full (all eight tubes) chromoly construction for ride compliance, cantilever brakes to allow room for fenders, internal wiring for a bottom bracket generator and numerous braze-ons: two mounts on the fork for the cantilever brakes, two eyelets in <b>back</b> for a <b>rack</b> and a fender, two eyelets on the fork for a rack and a fender, low rack mounting points on the fork, mounts for two bottle cages, mounts for downtube shifters/cable stops, and seat stay mounts for a rack.|$|R
50|$|After ageing, the lees must be {{consolidated}} for removal. The bottles {{undergo a}} process known as riddling (remuage in French). In this stage, the bottles are placed on special racks called pupitres that hold them at a 45° angle, with the crown cap pointed down. Once a day (every two days for Champagne), the bottles are given a slight shake and turn, alternatively on right then left, and dropped back into the pupitres, with the angle gradually increased. The drop <b>back</b> into the <b>rack</b> causes a slight tap, pushing sediments toward the neck of the bottle. In 10 to 14 days (8 to 10 weeks for Champagne), the position of the bottle is straight down, with the lees settled in the neck. (This time can be shortened by moving the bottle more than once a day, and by using modern, less sticky strains of yeast.)Manual riddling is still done for Prestige Cuvées in Champagne, but has otherwise been largely abandoned because of the high labour costs. Mechanised riddling equipment (a gyropalette) is used instead.|$|R
