5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} {{in that the}} males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> the tadpole-filled water of the tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping small pieces of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
5|$|Abt fell to seventh {{when he was}} {{overtaken}} by Prost at the first corner on lap ten, and the former defended from a large pack of cars. By the twelfth lap, Buemi had more usable electrical energy available and closed up to Piquet, overtaking him around the inside for fourth position at the seventh turn. Félix da Costa's vehicle stopped at turn eight on lap twelve. However, the deployment of a full course yellow flag was avoided when he received radio instructions from his team to perform a full reset, enabling him to rejoin the race. By then, he had dropped {{to the back of}} the field, and later became the race's first retirement. Upfront, Rosenqvist held a five-second advantage over Bird by the fourteenth lap, but the latter was being caught by Vergne by more than four-tenths of a second per lap. Although he had less electrical energy, Vergne caught Bird, who had been <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> Buemi, and moved in front of him at the start of the 16th lap with Bird electing not to defend the second position. The mandatory pit stops, during which all drivers need to change into a second car, began on the same lap. When Rosenqvist and Vergne entered the pit lane Buemi and Bird elected to remain on the circuit for another lap. Buemi was running quicker and overtook Bird at turn eleven on lap 17. He braked late for turn eleven but avoided going off the circuit. Piquet was affected by an electrical problem, ending his chances of finishing in a points-scoring position. Engel stopped his vehicle after making his pit stop, and became the event's second retirement with electrical problems. After the pit stops, Rosenqvist regained the first position, retaining most of his four-second advantage over Vergne. Di Grassi had been passed by Turvey but reclaimed sixth place from him shortly afterwards and started to close up to teammate Abt.|$|E

It was considered essential that the machine blocked any view of the bather from the shore. Some machines were equipped with a canvas tent lowered from the seaside door, sometimes capable of being lowered to the water, giving the bather greater privacy.|$|E
25|$|After her construction, Eastland was {{discovered}} to have design flaws, making her susceptible to listing. The ship was top-heavy, which became evident when passengers congregated en masse {{on the upper}} decks. During July 1903, a case of overcrowding caused Eastland to list with water flowing {{up one of the}} ship's gangplanks. The situation was quickly rectified, {{but this was the first}} of several incidents. Later in the same month, the stern of the ship was damaged when she was <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> the tugboat George W. Gardner. During August 1906, another incident of listing occurred which resulted in the filing of complaints against the Chicago-South Haven Line which had purchased the ship earlier that year.|$|E
25|$|Bugti was {{involved}} in a struggle, at times armed, for greater autonomy for Balochistan. The government of Pakistan accused him of keeping a private militia and leading a guerrilla war against the state. On 26 August 2006, Bugti, along with some personnel of the Pakistan army, was killed when his hide-out cave, located in Kohlu, about 150 miles east of Quetta, collapsed after an explosion set off by a Pakistan Army commander, although the Chief of Army Staff at the time, General Pervez Musharraf, claimed that Akbar Bugti was <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> a corner by the Pakistani Army and decided to blow himself up, instead of facing court for the atrocities he committed against rival tribes. His death lead to widespread unrest in the area and a surge in discussion, a polarising figure with both supporters and opponents.|$|E

25|$|The {{weapon was}} moved long {{distances}} via rail on {{a variant of}} a Schnabel car; the whole chassis was hung between two huge pedestal-mounted swiveling arms fixed to five-axle bogies. When it reached its destination, the weapon was detached from its supporting arms, driven to its intended firing location, then the chassis was lowered to the ground by lowering the suspension on its continuous track units' roadwheels on each side to distribute the recoil forces more evenly in preparation for firing. The Karl-Gerät proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but under no circumstances was it allowed to make turns on soft soil lest it throw a track. The chassis had to be <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> position to fire, which expedited movement to a new position, but the firing position had to be precisely leveled and the approach route prepared ahead of time to fill in soft spots and any ditches, etc. It could only be loaded at zero elevation, so {{it had to be}} re-aimed between every shot.|$|E
25|$|Reindeer (or caribou) (also called tuttu by the Greenlandic Inuit and rensdyr or rener by Danes) are {{the only}} deer species in which both sexes have antlers. Greenland animals can vary {{considerably}} in size, with females weighing up to 90kg (198lb) and the males ("bulls") 150kg (331lb). Other species of reindeer can be larger or smaller. In Greenland both sexes may be hunted. Although they have antlers, they rarely use them against humans, even when <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> a corner by the Sami people who herd, milk, and slaughter them for food in other lands. Their usual defense against humans is to pull away or flee, often uphill. Males use their antlers when sparring against each other, and reindeer may use them {{as a last resort}} to defend themselves and their young against predators such as wolves, although wolves present no threat in southwestern Greenland. Although rarely aggressive toward humans, when in rut bulls will defend their harems from other bulls, and when humans come between a bull and his harem, attacks have been recorded.|$|E

500|$|A dirty {{incident}} marred {{the second}} game. Cashman {{was cut in}} the mouth by Sweden's Ulf Sterner's stick. The cut to his tongue required nearly 50 stitches and forced him to miss {{the rest of the}} Summit Series, although he stayed with the team. Sterner was not penalized on the play. During the second intermission, Team Canada and Team Sweden scuffled in the runway to their dressing rooms before being separated by police. Canada took a 2–1 lead in the game, but the Swedes were not in awe of Canada like they had been at the beginning of game one. The Swedish tactics were effective; Canada took 31 minutes in penalties to Sweden's two. Sweden led the game 4–3 before Esposito scored on a 35-foot shot in the final minute. The Swedish defenceman had actually <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> their goaltender, allowing Esposito an easy shot for goal.

With barely 4,000 men and only two cannon to hold off Joseph Hooker's 16,000 attacking troops, Cleburne deployed his division across both sides of the narrow pass, ordering them to conceal themselves from view and wait for his signal to spring their ambush. He had barely half an hour to wait, as the 33rd and their friends steadily <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> the gap; Matthews reports that his comrades from the other regiments had done such a good job of concealing themselves that he and his friends never noticed them until they had passed their positions. The 33rd was ordered to take its place with the rest of their brigade in the center of its line atop White Oak Ridge, on the pass's northern side.

Often, as in the films Jesus Christ Superstar (1973) and The Passion of the Christ (2004), Antipas is portrayed as effeminate (Antipas was played in those films by Joshua Mostel and Luca De Dominicis respectively); the origin of this tradition may have been Antipas' manipulation by his wife Herodias, as well as Christ's description of him as a [...] "fox" [...] in Luke 13:32, using a feminine word in the original Greek. In Salome (1953), he is portrayed by Charles Laughton, opposite Dame Judith Anderson as Herodias and Rita Hayworth in the title role. He also features in The Secret Magdalene by Ki Longfellow.

In a race against the 1975-built Urho in [...] level ice, Otso beat the older but more powerful four-propelled icebreaker by more than a ship's length, showing that in terms of ice resistance the new icebreaker was superior to her predecessor. In [...] ice, she could easily maintain a speed of [...] and small ice ridges along the way appeared to be of no consequence to the vessel.

Since the new icebreaker had a smooth inclined stem and lacked the bow propellers of her predecessors, she rode up the ridge and began listing to the port side as the hull rose from the water. After coming to a stop, Otso slid back by herself without utilizing the engines, and the ridge was penetrated on the second charge. The robustness of the ship and its propulsion system were further proven when the icebreaker was <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> a ridge at [...] "to prove to the customer it doesn't break".|$|E
