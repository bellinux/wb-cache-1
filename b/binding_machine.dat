50|$|In {{order to}} bind {{documents}} with double loop wire a <b>binding</b> <b>machine</b> and a wire closer are required. Smaller organizations will often choose a small manual wire <b>binding</b> <b>machine</b> {{that offers a}} manual hole punch and a built in wire closer. Medium-sized users will often choose a wire <b>binding</b> <b>machine</b> with an electric punch and built in wire closer. The highest volume wire binding users such as binderies, print shops and in-plant printers will usually separate the punching and finishing stages of the binding process {{in order to increase}} productivity. These users will often use a heavy duty modular interchangeable die punch or an automated punching system along with either a manual or an electric wire closing machine.|$|E

50|$|GBC {{was founded}} in 1947 by William N. Lane II and two {{business}} partners when they purchased a small trade bindery in Chicago, Illinois. First year sales totaled $250,000. GBC expanded operations in 1952, opening another domestic manufacturing plant and founding General Binding Corporation Canada, Ltd. In the 1950s GBC {{laid the groundwork for}} its international divisions, creating sales and distribution networks in Europe, Mexico, Canada, Venezuela, and Brazil. Sales were slow at first in the European market, where GBC's <b>binding</b> <b>machines</b> were readily available but supplies were not. In response to this situation, GBC established a manufacturing subsidiary in Switzerland in 1954 to produce a full range of plastic binding supplies as well as a limited number of <b>binding</b> <b>machines.</b> Wholly owned subsidiaries were then set up to market GBC machines and supplies throughout England, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and France.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} the {{association}} is the {{history of the}} machine tool industry in India. The concept of <b>binding</b> <b>machine</b> tool manufacturers into an association was first mooted at an informal gathering of ‘like-minded’ manufacturers. The manufacturers met at a formal gathering in New Delhi on 20 September 1946 to concretise the thoughts of bringing together all machine tool manufacturers under one umbrella body. The meeting chaired by Sir Dhunjishaw B. Cooper came up with the name of “Indian Machine Tool Manufacturers’ Association” or IMTMA in short for this umbrella body representing the interest of the machine tool industry. The association was granted instant recognition by the government as a body representing machine tool manufacturers in the country. IMTMA was constituted with 19 members.|$|E

The Martini automobile, powered by a Martini-designed internal combustion engine, was also introduced in 1897.

50|$|During {{the early}} 70’s simple system for {{hot melt glue}} binding within the office market started to appear but the market was fragmented, some {{companies}} produced the machines and others produced the supplies. Bindomatic was founded in 1974 {{under the name of}} Semotex and it started as a supplier within the graphic industry. When Semotex started to import and sell the hot melt systems, the idea came up to introduce hot melt office binding as a system, where both machines and supplies can be purchased from one supplier and where the two parts are tested and proven to work in combination to provide a good final product. After the invention of the Bindomatic System by Sture Wiholm, the company owner, and Jan Sabelström, the technical manager, Semotex more or less turned over to only produce and sell hot melt office binding.

50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of agriculture threshing was done by hand with a flail, requiring {{a great deal of}} labour. The threshing machine, which was invented in 1794 but not widely used for several more decades, simplified the operation and allowed the use of animal power. Before the invention of the grain cradle (ca. 1790) an able bodied labourer could reap about one quarter acre of wheat in a day using a sickle. It was estimated that for each of Cyrus McCormick's horse-pulled reapers (ca. 1830s) freed up five men for military service in the US Civil War. Later innovations included raking and <b>binding</b> <b>machines.</b> By 1890 two men and two horses could cut, rake and bind 20 acres of wheat per day.|$|R
40|$|The {{machining}} {{of carbon}} reinforced plastics (CFRP) is considerably {{different from the}} machining of metallic materials. CFRP is a heterogeneous material, because fibres and matrix have different properties. Furthermore carbon fibres are hard which causes high abrasive tool wear and thus induced high costs. Moreover the sensitivity to temperature of the polymer matrix hinders the adjustment of the process factors (chipping thickness, cutting rate, feed rate) by limiting the maximum cutting rate. Also hazardous and partly alveolar CFRP-dusts, which occur while machining CFRP, display a major problem. Until now the majority of machining takes place {{without the use of}} cooling lubricants.

As they delimit the relative positioning of anaphors and their possible antecedents in the grammatical geometry, these constraints are of crucial importance for restricting the search space for antecedent candidates and enhancing the performance of resolvers. From an empirical perspective, they stem from quite robust generalizations and exhibit a universal character, given their parameterized validity across natural languages.

The main novelty of our theory is that not all network nodes need to have the same clock granularity: we investi-gate conditions under which we can guarantee, a priori, that any interconnections generated at run time through dynamic <b>binding</b> of <b>machines</b> with different clock granularities leads to a consistent orchestration of the whole system.

Any hope he had of winning was undermined by the intervention of a Labour party candidate;He was appointed a Warwickshire County Alderman. He was selected as Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate for the Warwick and Leamington, the seat he fought in the 1929 General Election. In fact, the Liberals had not contested the seat since 1929. A general election was expected to take place in 1939 but was postponed due to the outbreak of war. He served as Chairman of the County Council. In 1944 he noted that the council’s request for policewomen hadn’t been answered.
