5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> is pressed.|$|E
5|$|Kubica {{dropped to}} 13th as his {{traction}} control fault worsened, and a train of cars {{that wanted to}} pass developed behind him. Kovalainen's performance was much better than at the previous round in Melbourne, and he attempted to pass Jarno Trulli for eighth. The top five again remained the same after {{the second round of}} stops. However, Hamilton's short first stop necessitated a relatively early second stop, allowing Räikkönen to reduce the gap and Alonso to extend his lead to 18 seconds. Nico Rosberg, running in sixth place after the stops, was forced to retire with hydraulic problems on lap 43. David Coulthard also retired after problems with his <b>brake</b> <b>pedal,</b> the same problem that he experienced in the Friday practice session.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
50|$|In Novaliches, the Cathay Metal Corporation, the Republic Biscuit Corporation, however due to {{economic}} and population humanity reason the Highway of Quirino {{going to the}} District {{had been reduced to}} two lanes from former four lanes and an island in between, the Uniwide Warehouse Club and Main Office, Man Trucks and Buses, The HATAW Jeepney Assemblers assembling Four <b>Pedalled</b> Vehicle (Rear <b>Brakes</b> <b>Pedal,</b> Front <b>Brakes</b> <b>Pedal,</b> Clutch Pedal and Accelerator Pedal used for Drifting)....|$|R
50|$|Emergency Call Ambulance is a 1999 arcade game {{released}} by Sega. It is a single-player driving game, controlled via a steering wheel, gearshift, and gas and <b>brake</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 1963 172D model {{introduced}} the lower rear fuselage with a wraparound Omni-Vision rear window and a one-piece windshield. New rudder and <b>brake</b> <b>pedals</b> were also added. 1,146 172Ds were built.|$|R
5|$|On {{the same}} lap Irvine overtook his {{teammate}} Herbert for tenth position. Wurz {{crashed into the}} barriers at turn 1 {{and was forced to}} retire. Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a minute before he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an blockage on his <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race when he pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a gearbox problem on the following lap.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the KR175, the KR200 had a {{full set}} of pedals: clutch, brake, and accelerator. The <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> still {{operated}} mechanical brakes using cables.|$|E
25|$|Second: The {{clutch pedal}} is {{unlatched}} and the clutch engaged. The <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> is pushed forward {{as far as}} possible setting brakes on the rear wheel.|$|E
5000|$|...GT {{would be}} a {{co-sponsor}} when he raced with Shimano. The frame fork and handlebars were of GT manufacture while Shimano provided the major components such as the caliper <b>brakes</b> <b>pedals,</b> cranks, chainwheels, sprockets etc.|$|R
50|$|The flight {{commands}} are duplicated, {{with the}} front seat's center stick, throttle lever, rudder <b>pedals</b> and <b>brake</b> <b>pedals</b> mechanically connected to the rear seat's. The rear stick and the throttle lever can be disassembled when carrying passenger(s).|$|R
50|$|When {{the landing}} {{feature of the}} autobrake is engaged, the {{aircraft}} automatically engages pressurized wheel braking upon touchdown to the landing surface. During the roll out, application of the <b>brake</b> <b>pedals</b> transfers control back to the pilot.|$|R
25|$|In {{position}} two, {{the valve}} blocks the line, isolating that brake from the master cylinder. This prevents {{the pressure from}} rising further should the driver push the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> harder.|$|E
25|$|The {{driver is}} {{responsible}} for {{checking to see if}} the representative box on the screen correctly identifies the parking space; if the space is large enough to park, the box will be green in color; if the box is incorrectly placed, or lined in red, using the arrow buttons moves the box until it turns green. Once the parking space is correctly identified, the driver presses OK and takes his/her hands off the steering wheel, while keeping the foot on the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal.</b> When the driver slowly releases the brake, while keeping the foot on the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal,</b> the car will then begin to back up and steer itself into the parking space.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{customers}} have reported safety problems with the antilock brakes: after an emergency braking event, and once the driver has released the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal,</b> the brakes remain in full force for some amount of time, increasing the risk of rear collisions.|$|E
50|$|New to {{the option}} list were {{adjustable}} accelerator and <b>brake</b> <b>pedals,</b> a Pontiac exclusive (and seldom ordered), and a Radial Tuned Suspension {{that included the}} upgraded tires along with other suspension mods such as front and rear sway bars.|$|R

25|$|In Finland, the car driver's license can be {{obtained}} either in a private driving school or given by a near relative who has a driver's licence. It requires that the driver has {{a car with a}} passenger <b>brake</b> <b>pedal.</b> The initial license expires after two years, and is revoked if the new driver accrues more than two fines.|$|E
25|$|Class 2: Resistance (or load) in the middle: {{the effort}} is applied {{on one side of}} the {{resistance}} and the fulcrum is located on the other side, for example, a wheelbarrow, a nutcracker, a bottle opener or the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> of a car. Load arm is smaller than the effort arm. Mechanical advantage is always greater than 1. It is also called force multiplier lever.|$|E
50|$|Rebuilt by McAlister Co. Isle de la Jette, Neuille sur Seine, Paris as a single-seater, central {{steering}} with clutch and <b>brake</b> <b>pedals</b> flanking; <b>brake</b> lever on nearside, aluminium bodywork with under-tray; liveried with Alzaga ‘signature’ white stripe on the scuttle; Talbot radiator, registered 2546 W1.|$|R
50|$|From 2004 to 2008, GO technologies, inc. {{distributed}} specialized driving aids {{for disabled}} drivers under the RediAuto Sport and Soft Touch brands. Both brands offered upscale products for drivers {{who have little}} or no ability to use their feet to operate vehicle gas and <b>brake</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{a direct}} {{consequence}} {{of their high}} pressure hydraulics, early XM <b>brake</b> <b>pedals</b> had very little, if any, travel. Phase 2 XMs had some sponginess deliberately built into the braking system (by inserting a sleeved spring into the pedal linkage) to make their brakes feel more like those on other cars.|$|R
25|$|Either type could {{potentially}} fixed by ensuring a clean mounting surface {{on either side}} of the brake disc between the wheel hub and brake disc hub before usage and paying attention to imprinting after extended usage by leaving the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> heavily depressed at the end of heavy usage. Sometimes a bed in procedure can clean and minimize DTV and lay a new even transfer layer between the pad and brake disc. However it will not eliminate hot spots or excessive run out.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} devastated Audi {{sales in}} the United States, which did not rebound for 15 years. The initial incidents which prompted the report were found by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada to have been attributable to operator error, where car owners had depressed the accelerator pedal instead of the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal.</b> CBS issued a partial retraction, without acknowledging the test results of involved government agencies. Years later, Dateline NBC, a rival to 60 Minutes, {{was found guilty of}} similar tactics regarding the fuel tank integrity of General Motors pickup trucks.|$|E
25|$|The KR175 {{used the}} {{standard}} Kabinenroller steering system, with a steering bar connected {{directly to the}} track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The KR175's steering bar was made from tubular steel. The gearshift lever, {{on the right side}} of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The foot <b>brake</b> <b>pedal,</b> which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The handbrake lever operated similarly.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of engaging the autobrake as opposed to manually pressing on <b>brake</b> <b>pedals</b> is the uniform deceleration mechanism of the autobrake. The aircraft automatically decelerates at the selected level regardless of other factors, such as aircraft drag and other deceleration methods such as deployment of thrust reversers or spoilers.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} coachwork is a {{four or five}} seater {{body with}} four doors. The driving seat, the rake of the steering, the positioning of the clutch and <b>brake</b> <b>pedals</b> are all adjustable. Gears are controlled by a central flexible lever operating in a visible gate {{and there is a}} catch for reverse.|$|R
5000|$|Features include 900° {{steering}} (2.5 turns lock-to-lock), {{with force}} feedback, via a full-sized (diameter 28 cm), Momo-styled steering, full-sized throttle and <b>brake</b> <b>pedals,</b> standard PlayStation 3 gamepad buttons ( [...] , , [...] and [...] ), a D-pad, an R3 and L3 button, {{both sets of}} shoulder buttons, both Start and Select buttons, and a PS button.|$|R
25|$|The 1974 Rambler American was a carryover. The only {{difference}} was {{the presence of}} the rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and the rear license plate was relocated {{to the center of the}} rear panel over the gas filler. The standard wheels for the year were VAM's new 14x6-inch five-spoke design with volcano hubcaps. The 258 six included an evaporative canister to reduce emissions, and a slightly lower 8.3:1 compression ratio. However, during the mid-year, the compression ratio was lowered even more to 7.6:1. In both cases, the engines were still advertised as having an output of 170hp. The seat and door panel designs were revised. The parking <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> received a new smaller rubber pad.|$|E
25|$|On high-traction {{surfaces}} such as bitumen, or concrete, many (though not all) ABS-equipped {{cars are}} able to attain braking distances better (i.e. shorter) than those that would be possible {{without the benefit of}} ABS. In real world conditions, even an alert and experienced driver without ABS would find it difficult to match or improve on the performance of a typical driver with a modern Anti-lock Braking System-equipped vehicle. ABS reduces chances of crashing, and/or the severity of impact. The recommended technique for non-expert drivers in an ABS-equipped car, in a typical full-braking emergency, is to press the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> as firmly as possible and, where appropriate, to steer around obstructions. In such situations, ABS will significantly reduce the chances of a skid and subsequent loss of control.|$|E
25|$|In fall 2003, Nadeau began {{discussions with}} MB2 Motorsports boss Jay Frye about a {{long-term}} comeback. Frye gave Nadeau a test at Concord Speedway, {{where he was}} unable to feel his car's <b>brake</b> <b>pedal.</b> He also suffered a loss of stamina during this test. Because of the effects of his accident, Nadeau had to learn to walk. He also experienced slurred speech. He undertook physical therapy five times during the week. This was later reduced to three when his condition improved. While Nadeau received a small financial settlement from NASCAR, it was not enough to pay for all of his rehabilitation, so he sold his large house near Lake Norman and moved to Davidson, North Carolina. He also suffered from depression caused by the loss of his racing career.|$|E
50|$|In {{the game}} the player can choose from four game modes: Survival - Finish at or lower than a certain {{position}} (determined by your difficulty) to continue to the next race, Champion(ship), VS, and Slot - In this game mode steering happens automatically. The only thing the players need to concern themselves with is the gas and <b>brake</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sprint 2 {{evolved from}} Gran Trak 10 and Gran Trak 20, but {{included}} a microprocessor (the 6502), {{a first for}} racing games. This allowed Sprint 2 to include two computer-controlled cars, better graphics, and more tracks. Unlike Gran Trak, this machine did not have <b>brake</b> <b>pedals,</b> but the players could still make their cars [...] "fishtail" [...] by turning their steering wheels abruptly.|$|R
25|$|Simulation testing {{determined}} that pilot error {{was the cause}} as a braking force {{was found to have}} been applied by the chief pilot during takeoff. Using data from the flight recorder, it was determined the movement was only possible by pushing down on the <b>brake</b> <b>pedals</b> from the chief pilot's seat to push upwards on the control column. The investigating committee found evidence of the braking failure in the braking system.|$|R
