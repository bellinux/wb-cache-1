50|$|In 1990 the Douglas-Peel {{trackbed}} {{was designated}} as the Rail Trail and much work undertaken to improve the station underfoot. It was {{at this time that}} the <b>breakdown</b> <b>crane</b> belonging to the railway was placed on permanent display at the station, and a section of track installed for it to sit on; the crane had been built by the Birmingham-based company of Richard C. Gibbins and delivedred new to the railway in 1893, being stored at various locations prior to its removal to Union Mills in 1991 where it still remains today.|$|E
40|$|Like {{many areas}} of engineering, changes in {{technology}} and working conditions have had a signifcant impact on breakdown and recovery equipment and techniques. Although <b>breakdown</b> <b>cranes</b> have hardly changed in concept for 100 years and innovations like hydraulic jacking equipment, when j r s t established, was heavy and cumbersome, developments in materials and technology spurred on by the Health and Safety at Work Act and pressures to reduce costs in the 1970 s {{have resulted in the}} introduction of a much wider range of equipment, which is lighter and easier to manage. This has reached a point where, for instance, only 15 per cent of incidents are now dealt with by cranes. This paper traces these changes over the last I 5 years and shows how the current range of equipment available to recovery teams has developed. ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the rear}} goods siding, {{one of the}} railway's three <b>breakdown</b> <b>cranes</b> was stored {{for a number of}} years, being removed in 1991 and {{subsequently}} restored and placed on display at Union Mills {{on the site of the}} former railway station. This crane was constructed in 1893 by the Birmingham-based firm Richard C. Gibbins. Inside the station's waiting room are several framed displays charting various historical aspects of the railway featuring old photographs, framed tickets, maps and other historical documentation relating to the earliest days of the railway. A headboard commemorating the centenary of the adjacent Poulsom Park in 1996 is also mounted on the wall above the fireplace, several other pieces of ephemera are available to view at the station. For many years, there also featured large advertisement hoardings lining the down platform but these were removed in 1974 having become unsafe. The Friends Of... group have plans to reinstate the hoarding in 2015 and have secured funding from Culture Vannin to proceed with the project subject to planning approval. An original signal windlass constructed by the Birmingham company A.J. Linley & Co., was also displayed on the up platform for many years, a similar version is extant and used to operate the unique slotted post semaphore signal which protects the station's southerly side.|$|R
5|$|Other {{operational}} {{incidents of}} note include a 1988 fire during a return voyage from Iceland to the United States which forced {{the ship to}} stop in Newfoundland for repairs, and a <b>crane</b> <b>breakdown</b> on 15 November 1991 during cargo operations that required repairs be made in Praia da VitÃ³ria, Azores.|$|R
50|$|Post-WWII, weight {{limitations}} on the aging viaduct and its limited maintenance led to a ban on double heading across both Belah and Deepdale Viaducts. As two light locomotives were still needed to haul trains up the inclines of the Tebay line, one worked as a banker at the rear. This also caused problems if the <b>breakdown</b> <b>crane</b> from Darlington was needed. This 45 ton crane itself had a weight of 156 tons. Hauling it across the viaducts required it to be spaced from the locomotive by at least three empty wagons, to distribute the load.|$|E
50|$|Taking her uncle's legacy, Crane visits her {{maternal}} aunt in Copenhagen, {{where she}} is treated as a highly desirable racial exotic. Missing black people, she returns to New York City. Close to a mental <b>breakdown,</b> <b>Crane</b> happens onto a store-front revival and has a charismatic religious experience. After marrying the preacher who converted her, she moves {{with him to the}} rural Deep South. There she is disillusioned by the people's adherence to religion. In each of her moves, Crane fails to find fulfillment. She is looking for more than how to integrate her mixed ancestry. She expresses complex feelings about what she and her friends consider genetic differences between races.|$|E
50|$|A {{railroad}} crane (North America: crane car or wrecker; UK: <b>breakdown</b> <b>crane)</b> {{is a type}} of crane used on {{a railroad}} for one of three primary purposes: freight handling in goods yards, permanent way (PW) maintenance, and accident recovery work. Although the design differs according to the type of work, the basic configuration is similar in all cases: a rotating crane body is mounted on a sturdy chassis fitted with flanged wheels. The body supports the jib (UK; North America: boom) and provides all the lifting and operating mechanisms; on larger cranes, an operator's cabin is usually provided. The chassis is fitted with buffing (UK) and/or coupling gear to allow the crane to be moved by a locomotive, although many are also self-propelled to allow limited movement about a work site.|$|E
50|$|The 12:00 1A26 {{express train}} from King's Cross to Edinburgh and Aberdeen {{collided}} at speed with {{the wreckage of}} a derailed freight train around 15:17 on that day. Seven {{people were killed and}} 45 injured, 15 seriously. Following the accident, three of the four lines (the Up Southbound and Down Northbound Fast lines and the Down Slow line) were blocked by the wreckage of the collision. The Up Slow line was not damaged and was used by special trains to take the dead and injured to Newcastle upon Tyne. The line was also used later that day for both Up and Down trains to clear other trains stranded in the area by the blockage but was later used only for Up trains, Down trains being diverted via Harrogate over the Harrogate-Northallerton line which, though it had been closed, was re-opened for the purpose. Special bus services were introduced between Leeds and Northallerton and between York and Thirsk to replace local train services disrupted by the accident. <b>Breakdown</b> <b>cranes</b> were ordered from York, Leeds and Gateshead (Newcastle), and the derailed vehicles were cleared from the track by 23:30 on 1 August. Repairs to the track were speedy and the three damaged lines were all open by 16:20 on 2 August, all with an initial speed limit of 20 mph.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{versions}} of this legend. In some the crane does not block a stick, but evades and counters it. The point of the style is to emphasize evasion and attack an opponent's vulnerabilities instead of using physical strength. Since it was created by a woman, White Crane fighting elements are especially popular in women's self-defense training because the movements do not require great strength. They more closely imitate the delicate pecking motion associated with this fighting style. Popular karate bunkai (<b>breakdown)</b> of white <b>crane</b> katas like hakutsuru stress vital point striking or kyusho.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{formulate}} the berth allocation problem as a bi-objective mixed-integer programming problem with the objective to maximize berth throughput and reliability of the schedule {{under the assumption that}} vessel handling times are stochastic parameters, being a function of other stochastic parameters (that is, quay <b>crane</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> quay-to-yard transport vehicle productivity, yard congestion, and so on). A combination of an exact algorithm, a Genetic Algorithms-based heuristic and a Monte Carlo simulation are proposed as the solution approach for the resulting problem. Based on a number of simulation experiments, it is shown that the proposed modeling approach is effective and outperforms berth allocation solutions where reliability is not considered. ...|$|R
