50|$|Within {{one month}} {{by the end of}} September 2009, at least 2,436 <b>Border</b> Break <b>machines</b> were sold to arcade operators, which {{increased}} to nearly 3,000 machines by the end of 2009. As of March 2012, the game has grossed ¥8.1 billion from arcade machine sales, equivalent to more than $100 million.|$|R
50|$|For {{amusement}} arcades, Sega's {{most successful}} games {{continued to be}} based on network and card systems. Games of this type include Sangokushi Taisen and <b>Border</b> Break. Arcade <b>machine</b> sales incurred higher profits than their console, portable, and PC games on a year-to-year basis until 2014.|$|R
40|$|Page {{deduplication}} is {{a mechanism}} to reduce the memory footprint of a system. Identical physical pages are identified across <b>borders</b> of virtual <b>machines</b> and programs and merged by the operating system or the hypervisor. However, this enables side-channel information leakage through cache or memory access time. Therefore, it is considered harmful in public clouds today, {{but it is still}} considered safe to use in a private environment, i. e., private clouds, personal computers, and smartphones. We present the first memory-disclosure attack in sandboxed Javascript which exploits page deduplication. Unlike previous attacks, our attack does not require the victim to execute an adversary’s program, but simply to open a website which contains the adversary’s Javascript code. We are not only able to determine which applications are running, but also specific user activities, for instance, whether the user has specific websites currently opened. The attack works on servers, personal computers and smartphones, and across the <b>borders</b> of virtual <b>machines...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Prime Minister Bouasone Bouphavanh said masks {{should be}} made {{available}} and health officials would be assigned to work at <b>border</b> checkpoints. The <b>machines</b> would help officials identify anyone entering {{the country with a}} high temperature and create confidence among Lao people, foreigners living in Laos and people travelling to Laos. Health officials would be on hand at international border checkpoints to ensure anyone found to be infected could be treated immediately. On 18 June, the first case in Laos was confirmed.|$|R
25|$|The Lao {{government}} {{agreed to}} buy 10 thermal imaging machines and install them at the country's major immigration <b>border</b> checkpoints. The <b>machines</b> would help officials identify anyone entering {{the country with a}} high temperature and create confidence among Lao people, foreigners living in Laos and people traveling to Laos. Health officials would be on hand at international border checkpoints to ensure anyone found to be infected could be treated immediately. Each machine could cost about US$25,000. The decision to buy them was made after the government found visitors to Laos included people coming from the United States, Spain and other affected countries.|$|R
50|$|The {{awareness}} to the users {{at the public}} ATM can be provided while a shoulder surfing is occurring. Then a decision {{can be made by}} the user if the information he is entering in the public is sensitive and if it has to be hidden. Flashing border can be used to notify and alert the user. When a person enters the area near to the user, the <b>borders</b> of the <b>machine</b> flashes by alerting the user. It can even be detailed with colors. Like red color can be used if the person entered is looking towards the display and green when the person is still near that vicinity but not looking towards the display. Another way is creating a 3-D shadow on the display of the user peeping into the display.|$|R
50|$|Saul (Mandy Patinkin), {{believing that}} the {{intelligence}} mission has failed and this is now a military operation, yields command to Pfister and leaves the room. Pfister orders the team to fall back and abort, and soldiers start falling back, but Brody refuses, planning instead to dash for the <b>border</b> while the <b>machine</b> gun fire continues around him. Carrie gets {{on the line and}} asks him to give up, but he is insistent. One of the soldiers, Turani (Jared Ward), decides to hang back for a minute and help Brody by supplying covering fire. Just as Brody is about to run for it, the Iranian army appears and captures both of them. Brody announces that he is the perpetrator of the CIA bombing and is requesting asylum. The two of them are put in a holding cell.|$|R
40|$|Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) was {{described}} in Switzerland already {{in the end of}} the 19 th century. Ragweed remained hidden until changing conditions triggered its spread. The invasion of this neophyte in Switzerland is still in a stage, where an effective low cost control should be feasible. A survey of the Swiss agricultural research station, Agroscope Changins–Wädenswil (ACW), former RAC Changins, showed for 2005 a clear trend: Beside a few known foci in arable fields, ragweed grows mainly in private garden sites all over the country. Ragweed follows human activities, and it was observed that its seeds are found in bird grain mixtures. Seeds also enter the regions along the French and Italian <b>borders</b> by agricultural <b>machines</b> and excavated material from building sites. The fact that ragweed endangers public health was one reason to follow more carefully its beginning invasion. The spread of ragweed from private house gardens via compost or via professional gardening as pathways to the fields seems to be very easy. Therefore it was necessary to act rapidly to start an effective campaign in 2005. The information on how to eradicate ragweed went to all municipalities in Switzerland and met increasing interest. This year, the aim was to eradicate ragweed in house gardens, to reduce seed production and to make ragweed known to the population. The campaign will continue in 2006...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} a {{detailed}} descriptive {{survey of the}} society of the Anglo-Scottish borders {{in the second half of}} the fifteenth century. The survey is divided into three sections, the first providing a background to border society, the second examining the structure of that society, and the third describing how the society was governed. As an introduction to the study of border society, the geography and economy of the frontier region are briefly described; a short survey of border towns is attempted; and the role of the Church in border society is examined, although this is mainly confined to a description of the ecclesiastical institutions in the area. In analysing the structure of border society in the later fifteenth century a division is made between, on the one hand, the levels of society, and, on the other, the interconnections which bound the border population together. The lower ranks of border society, both urban and rural, are examined in as uuch detail as is permitted by the scarcity of surviving evidence. The leading families on each side of the frontier are described and their role in border society is examined. Interconnections within border society are investigated from three aspects: the bond of kinship; connections and ties of dependency among leading border families; and relationships across the frontier. The topic of kinship bonds raises the question of the origin of border surnames, and an attempt is made to contribute to this controversy by examining the state of development of the surnames by the mid-fifteenth century. Connections between leading border families are examined under the categories of land-holding relationships, connections formed through marriage, and bonds based on employment or the more formal contracts of retainer manrent. Interconnections, so far as they existed, between English and Scottish borderers are described as a conclusion to the survey of the ways in which border society was knit together. The final section of the thesis is concerned with the government of border society. As a means of introduction, the background of the political relations between the kingdoms of England and Scotland is established by a detailed analysis of events during the half-century. Following this survey of how the two countries alternated between truce and open war during the period, an analysis is made or the terms of the truces signed between 1455 and 1502. This examination of truce terms, which were mainly concerned with frontier control, leads on to a survey of the operation of law-enforcement on the <b>borders.</b> The <b>machine</b> of law-enforcement, involving the imposition of both the international frontier law control and the national laws of the respective countries is described, and standards of efficiency among judicial officers are touched upon. Aspects of law-enforcement on the borders which are of particular interest are subsequently exanined, and both the general character and the causes of border lawlessness are discussed. In the examination of law-enforcement machinery the function of officials are described, but as a conclusion to the survey of law and order on the borders the holders of the various offices are investigated. In the conclusion to the thesis a brief generalised description is attempted of the characteristics of border people and their society in the later fifteenth century...|$|R
