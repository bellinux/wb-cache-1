40|$|This paper explores how {{visual images}} used in {{construction}} project design {{work can be}} understood as social semiotic compositions that are authored by design teams to be interpreted by client audiences in particular ways. The paper clarifies how visual images are strategic communicative resources employed by designers that effect the comprehension of requirements, the relations between project parties and the design process itself. A visual image of hospital patient rooms from a hospital construction project <b>briefing</b> <b>meeting</b> is examined from a multimodal social semiotic perspective; the analysis being supported and supplemented with insights from designers immersed in construction project communications with client parties. The discussion notes how different representations of requirements using visual and textual signs can impact the design discourse and relations between parties; visual images being more sophisticated than simple tools in the design process. The insights of the paper are informative for multiple civil engineering and architectural contexts where visual images assist and propel forward the design process...|$|E

40|$|Language {{and society}} {{influence}} one another. It {{is impossible to}} understand one without the other. It also influences the speech community. The existence of speech community creates many kinds of language variation. One of the language variations is a “register”. The speech community creates {{it in order to}} make simple in its conversation. This study is intended to investigate the military registers used by ARHANUD community in Karangploso Malang. More specifically, this study is focused on the English registers used by ARHANUD community in Karangploso Malang, the meanings of those registers and the conditions when the English registers were used. This study used descriptive qualitative design because it was intended to describe the phenomena about the English registers used by ARHANUD community in Karangploso Malang. The subjects of the study were two members of ARHANUD, especially in Weapon System Department-Radar-. They were chosen because of their experience in ARHANUD for almost nineteen years and held important positions as KAURMIN DEPSISTA and BATITIH Rudal DEPSISTA. Besides, the informants were qualified to give information about the English registers and also used them actively. To collect the data, the writer used structured interview and observation. The data were analyzed by identifying the kinds of the English registers based on the observation checklist and structured interview. Then, the meanings of the English registers were taken from interview. The result of the study showed that the ARHANUD community in Karangploso Malang used two kinds of English registers: formal registers and informal registers. There were 22 formal registers and 37 informal registers. Further, the meanings of the English registers were obtained from the informants’ explanation. Moreover, the English registers were used in such activities as teaching – learning process in the classroom, <b>briefing,</b> <b>meeting,</b> giving some instructions, breaking time and also when they talked each other related with radar. It was also found that there were three main reasons why they used the English registers. First, the English registers could not be changed into other languages because they belonged to a standard language. Second, the English registers were used in order to make easier in transferring information. The last, the English registers could show their identity as the persons who advanced in radar...|$|E
40|$|Context: Agriculture {{has been}} a {{critical}} building block of all Caribbean economies, {{in terms of its}} contribution to gross national output, foreign exchange earnings and employment. However, in recent years, in several countries of the Caribbean, its economic performance has been characterized by a marked unevenness and a failure to attain a steady growth pattern. Export agriculture has been in crisis; precipitated by the deterioration in traditional industries due to adjustment difficulties related to trade liberalization and commodity market price volatility; and instability in others, such as, citrus, coffee, cocoa and spices, due to severe competitive pressures and a proliferation of stringent product and process standards in developed countries. The food production sector, which generally performed better, has been faced with increasing competition in the domestic markets as the process of globalization and trade liberalization progresses. These recent experiences in agriculture suggest that policy formulation and consequent programme implementation have been key constraints in the transformation of agriculture in the region. Regional policy makers have repeatedly emphasized that domestic agriculture is largely responsive to external stimuli. In response to this, and the changing economic environment, Caribbean countries are engaged in the process of adjusting and reorienting their agricultural and rural development policies to better equip the sector to meet this new paradigm for the 21 st Century. Consequently, policy change, strong and practical policies must be prerequisites for the agricultural adjustment and repositioning process. President of Guyana, Bharrat Jagdeo, lead Head for Agriculture within the CARICOM Conference of Heads of Government (CHoG) recognized that the response for agriculture by our States, singly and collectively, requires major adjustments. Such adjustment should lead to marked improvements in how we engage, support and finance the business of agriculture, including how we organize our supply base, market our products and procure our inputs. These have significant policy implications for our Ministers of Agriculture and our entire Cabinets at the national levels, {{as well as for the}} CHoG and the Forum of Ministers of Agriculture at the regional level. This initiative, facilitated by the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture and the Rural Milieu in the Caribbean (The Alliance) and the CTA/IICA-supported Caribbean Region Agricultural Policy Network (CaRAPN) is therefore fully complementary to the CARICOM Regional Transformation Program (RTP) for Agriculture. It seeks to facilitate agriculture’s decisive move from the crossroads that it currently finds itself into bold action to reposition its industries, enterprises and peoples along a path of sustainable and equitable growth. As part of that repositioning process, the CHoG mandated countries, supported by development organizations working in agriculture within the region, to identify and develop a package of initiatives to address the three or four most binding constraints to a dynamic and competitive agricultural sector in all member states of the region. The identification of these constraints has emerged from a region-wide process of ongoing national consultations. The framework for the conduct of these national consultations was developed by the Facilitators <b>Briefing</b> <b>Meeting</b> held in Trinidad and Tobago from September 30 to October 01. This regional policy workshop is thus convened to take these national outputs a step further in the process of developing the framework, of the supportive actions required at the regional level, for agricultural repositioning. Objectives: This workshop seeks to: ?	develop firm proposals that seek, in a practical and meaningful manner, to alleviate the three or four most binding constraints to national agricultural sector growth initiatives for the consideration of the CARICOM Heads of Government. ?	strengthen the framework for regional-level agricultural policy analysis, formulation and implementation within the context of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME) in order to add value to national actions and engender regional harmony among development projects and programs; Expected Outputs: As a result of the workshop: ?	Member states will be provided with a draft framework to guide regional agricultural policy analysis, formulation and implementation within the context of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME); ?	Fulfillment of the Jagdeo mandate which required development of draft proposals that seek to address the three or four most binding constraints through regional action, for consideration of the CARICOM Heads of Government. This initiative seeks to facilitate agriculture’s decisive move from the crossroads that it currently finds itself into bold action to reposition its industries, enterprises and peoples along a path of sustainable and equitable growth.
