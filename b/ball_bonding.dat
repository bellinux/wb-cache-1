This paper suggests a new method for automatic inspection of {{that part of the}} wire bond where the wire connects to the bond pad on the chip. A popular type of bonding (connected to bond pad) known as "ball bond" is considered here. Although several approaches for <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> inspection have been introduced, they do not reveal the efficient results. The suggested method consists of five steps: (1) to enhance the edges using Binomial and the modified Laplace filter; (2) to binarize the image; (3) to extract center point of the ball bond; (4) to extract the <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> boundary; (5) to fit the ellipse using direct ellipse-specific fitting.

In the present study, the reliability performance of palladium coated silver (PCS) wire in high temperature storage test (HTST) is carried out using 18 μm diameter fine pitch PCS wire. Fine pitch <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> are made on Al metallization, with <b>bonded</b> <b>ball</b> diameter (BBD) of 32 ± 0. 5 μm and ball height (BH) of 8 ± 0. 5 μm. The aging temperature used in HTST is 170 °C and both shear and pull test are used to evaluate the aged <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> at regular time intervals. The shear force increases from 9. 9 gf at 96 h to 12. 5 gf at 192 h, and remains almost constant until 1344 h, and starts dropping gradually until 10. 9 gf at 1848 h. The pad lift percentage recorded in pull test gradually drops from 90 % at 96 h to 20 % at 1008 h, and increases to 90 % at 1848 h. The chip side fractography after shear test indicates that the main failure modes are through pad at 96 h, through <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> at 504 h, and half of both at 168 h, respectively. Cross-sectional images show that the thickness of the intermetallic compound (IMC) layer growth follows parabolic relationship and the rate constant is 0. 10 ± 0. 02 μm/h½.

40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} a new methodology for the “in situ” identification of wire-bond degradation at early stages during high-temperature aging tests on devices with standard plastic packages. This methodology {{is based on}} the measurement of the changes in wire bond resistance, which is deduced from the I(V) characteristics of the ESD protection diodes on each contact pad of the circuit. In a first stage, the measurement procedure is described, with emphasis on the initial temperature calibration. This procedure allows for an “in situ” measurement sequence, where the packages stay in the aging chamber, at elevated temperature, during the electrical tests on the pad connections performed at different aging durations. By following accurately the package temperature, using a thermocouple, it is possible to correct for slight changes and thus get a reliable I–V measurement for each interconnection. In the second stage, the aging test results are described, showing the evolution of each individual interconnection. We were able to identify the onset of wire-bond degradation through the progressive increase of their resistance. To allow for better determination of the degradation process, once an increase in wire bond resistance was detected, complete I(V) curves were recorded at the pin(s) of interest. For each pin of a TQFP 64 package, the tests were performed at least twice a day, with increased density when initial failure is detected (one complete measurement every 3 h). This strategy allowed for the detection of different behaviors on the wire bonds: good <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> (i. e. <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> with no change in their resistance), <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> with intermittent opens (these <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are in the process of}} degradation, and thermo-mechanical stresses induced in the resin by very small temperature changes are sufficient to open or close the circuits) and completely destroyed <b>ball</b> <b>bonds,</b> for which the resistance stays in an “high” level. This approach to wire-bond degradation in plastic packages is very powerful in terms of the number of interconnections which can be followed “in real time” and especially has the advantage, over other classical approaches, that the devices under test stay operational, contrary to what occurs with other types of destructive testing. These electrical test results are compared with metallographic investigations performed after a series of mechanical tests on the <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> (wire pull/ball shear tests) on a set of identical devices which undergone exactly the same High Temperature Storage (HTS) aging for 2000 h at 165 °C...|$|R
40|$|Wire bonding is {{the process}} of {{creating}} interconnects between the circuitry on a microchip and PCB boards or substrates so that the microchip can interact with the outside world. The materials and techniques used in this bonding process can cause a wide variation in bond quality, so wire bond reliability testing is very important in determining the quality and longevity of wire bonds. Due to the fact that microchips are encased in protective resins after bonding and their substrates attached to the larger device as a whole, once any single wire bond fails then it could jeapordize the entire device as the wire bonds cannot be individually replaced or fixed. Current methods of reliability testing are lengthy and often destroy the entire sample in the process of evaluation, so the availability of novel non-destructive, real-time monitoring methods as well as accelerated aging could reduce costs and provide realistically timed tests of novel wire bond materials which do not form Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) as rapidly as Au wire on Al substrates. In this thesis, five new chip designs for use in wire bond reliability testing are reported, focusing on the first joint made in a wire <b>bond,</b> called the <b>ball</b> <b>bond.</b> These chips are scaled either to test up to 55 test bonds simultaneously or just one at a time, introducing different requirements for microchip infrastructure capabilities, such as on-chip sensing/data bus, multiplexer, and switches able to operate under High Temperature Storage (HTS) which ranges from temperatures of 150 - 220 ºC. There are different heating requirements for each of these microchips, needing to be heated externally or containing on-chip microheaters to heat only the <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> under test, and not the rest of the microchip or surrounding I/O pads. Of the five chip designs, sample chips were produced by an external company. Experimental studies were then carried out with two of these chip designs. They were specifically made to test novel methods of determining <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> reliability using in-situ, non-destructive sensing, in real-time, while the <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> undergoes thermal aging. Pad resistance as an analysis tool for <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> reliability is proposed in this thesis as a new way of evaluating <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> quality and allows for the testing of electrical connection without the need for specialized measurement probes or difficult bonding processes that contact resistance measurements require. Results are reported for pad resistance measurements of a <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> under very high temperature storage (VHTS) at 250 ºC, a temperature exceeding typical HTS ranges to accelerate aging. Pad resistance measurements are taken using the four-wire measurement method from each corner of the bond pad, while reversing current direction every measurement to remove thermo-electric effects, and then calculating the average square resistance of the pad from this value. The test <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> is aged using a novel on-chip microheater which is a N+ doped Si resistive heater located directly underneath the bond pad, and can achieve temperatures up to 300 ºC while not aging any of the I/O pads surrounding it, which are located ~ 180 µm away. A 50 Ω resistor is placed 60 µm away from the heater to monitor the temperature. The use of a microheater allows the aging of novel wire types at temperatures much higher than those permitted for microchip operation while thermally isolating the test bond from the sensing and power bonds, which {{do not need to be}} aged. Higher temperatures allow the aging process to be sped up considerably. The microheater is programmatically cycled between 250 ºC (for 45 min) and 25 ºC (for 15 min) for up to 200 h or until the pad resistance measurements fail due breakdown of the bonding pad. Intermetallic compounds forming between the <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> and the pad first become visible after a few hours, and then the pad becomes almost completely consumed after a day. The pad resistance is measured every few seconds while the sample is at room temperature, and the increase in pad resistance agrees with the fact that Au/Al IMC products are known to have much higher resistance than both pure Au or Al. Also discussed are some aging results of Au wires and Pd coated Cu (PCC) wires bonded to Al bonding pads and aged at a temperature of 200 ºC in an oven for 670 h. The oven aged Au <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> also saw IMC formation on the surface of the bonding pad, much like the microheater tests. The PCC <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> became heavily oxidized due to lack of Pd on the surface of the ball, the wire portions did not oxidize much. In conclusion, the new structures have been demonstrated to age <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> faster than with conventional methods while obtaining non-destructive data. Specifically, the new microheater ages a test bond at an accelerated rate without having an observable effect on the I/O connections used to monitor the test bond. Pad resistance measurements correlate to the aging of the test bond and ensure the electrical integrity of the joint is checked. 1 yea...|$|R
50|$|In wedge bonding, {{the wire}} must be drawn in a {{straight}} line according to the first bond.

5000|$|Piezoelectric {{transducers}} {{are used}} to provide ultrasonic energy in the <b>ball</b> <b>bonding</b> process. These transducers are known as bolt-clamped transducers or Langevin transducers. The consist of metal components and piezoelectric elements, all held together by a bolt. These transducers operate at their resonant frequency of lateral vibration to introduce lateral ultrasonic excitation to the capillary. Along the lateral direction of the transducer, there exists nodal points (large displacement) and antinodal points (no displacement). Piezoelectric elements expand and contract upon alternating voltage excitation (which {{will be at the}} resonance frequency), thereby exciting resonance vibration in the structure. Usually, a few elements are stacked in order to increase the electric field for an applied voltage (stress is generated proportional to electric field). In order to maximize the energy transfer from the piezoelectric element to the structure, they are placed at antinodes, which are high strain and high stress regions. At the same time, in order to minimize energy loss to the surroundings, the transducer is held at an antinode (no displacement). At {{the front end of the}} transducer a tapered horn is used to magnify the vibration. Different tapering profiles can be used to get the desired result, such as a linear taper or parabolic taper. The horn's taper reduces the cross-sectional area, causing a larger ultrasonic energy density, then leading to more displacement near the tip. The capillary is placed near the tip for this reason. Higher order bending modes are excited in the capillary, which are quite unideal. In order to mitigate this effect, the capillary clamping position is adjusted to an antinode of the capillary. Ideally, the capillary would be short, but this is not possible because the bond needs to be made in hard to reach areas.|$|E
40|$|Microelectronic {{wire bonding}} is a {{manufacturing}} process used to electrically connect integrated circuits with circuit boards or other substrates. Conventionally, balls are molten {{at the end}} of a Au bonding wire and subsequently bonded on Al metallization of a integrated circuit. However, Pd/Ni metallization has recently been used for its improved mechanical properties. The bondability, bonding mechanism, and reliability of Au <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> on Pd are studied in this thesis. The substrates were produced in this project using three different materials. The base material is polished Cu in the shape of a coupon (1. 0 cm × 1. 0 cm × 0. 5 mm). Cu coupons are plated with Ni (1. 0 μm) using an electroless process, followed by electrolytic plating of a layer of Pd (0. 3 μm), resulting in an arithmetic mean roughness of the surface of 0. 08 μm (baseline sample, sample 0). Higher roughness values of 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 5 μm are artificially produced by rolling (sample 1), sanding (sample 2), and sandblasting (sample 3), respectively, on the Cu surface before plating Ni and Pd. A 25 μm diameter Au wire is used for bonding on the polished and roughened substrates with a process temperature of T = 220 °C, and it was found that ≈ 4 % to ≈ 18 % less ultrasonic amplitude was required for successful bonding on the roughened substrates compared to the polished substrate. Bondability is measured by shear testing the <b>ball</b> <b>bonds.</b> An average <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> strength achieved on the polished substrate is 130 MPa. This value is lower on the roughened substrate with the exception of the sandblasted substrate. Long-term thermal aging at 250 °C was performed with <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> on samples 0 - 3 for durations of ≈ 300 h. The reliability of the bonds is characterized by non-destructive contact resistance analysis during aging and destructive cross section analysis after aging. Contact resistance values for the <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> range from 1. 6 to 3. 5 mΩ at 20 °C before aging, and does not correlate with roughness. For the baseline sample, contact resistance of the <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> decreases during aging by - 6 % (median value), which indicates electrical integrity of the interconnections at high temperature. This decrease possibly is due to interfacial gap filling by Au or Pd diffusion. In contrast, the contact resistance increases for the roughened samples 1 - 3 and changes are 0. 4, 5, and 14 %, respectively (median values). A conclusive explanation for this increase has not yet been found. After 250 h of aging, a TEM analysis showed Au to Pd diffusion in the baseline sample with a diffusion depth of ≈ 0. 1 μm Au. No intermetallics, voids, or contamination is found on the interfaces after aging according to nanohardness, SEM, and TEM analyses. No bond lift-offs or electrical opens were found for the aging temperature and durations chosen. No conclusive evidence for the presence of Au-Pd intermetallics or voids is found...|$|R

Thermosonic copper <b>ball</b> <b>bonding</b> is an absorbing interconnection technology that serves as a viable and cost saving alternative to gold <b>ball</b> <b>bonding.</b> Its excellent mechanical and electrical characteristics make copper <b>ball</b> <b>bonding</b> attractive for high-speed, power devices and fine-pitch applications. However, copper is easily oxidized and harder than gold, which causes some critical process problems in connection with bondability. In this study, a 50 mum copper wire with purity of 99. 99 % was bonded on aluminum metallization with thickness 3 mum using an ASM angle 60 automatic thermosonic ball/wedge bonder. Experimental studies of copper free air balls (FABs) formation and bonding process were conducted to establish the bonding mechanism and to explain the effects of process parameters on bondability. A micro-slipping model was proposed to account for the effects of the ultrasonic power and bonding force on bondability. It was found that the bondability was determined by a slip area at the bonding interface. The occurrence of bonding only at the periphery of the contact area between FAB and aluminum metallization was attributed to partial slips at the bonding interface. Variation in the ultrasonic power and bonding force that lead to different stick-slip modes, can effect bondability in the ultrasonic bonding process. It is important to set a proper bonding time to achieve interatomic bonding without causing fatigue rupture of microjoints.

Although this bonding process has been extensively utilised in electronics packaging industry, certain fundamental aspects behind all the practice are still not fully understood. This thesis is intended to address the existing knowledge gap in terms of bonding mechanisms and interfacial characteristics {{that are involved in}} thermosonic gold and copper <b>ball</b> <b>bonding</b> on aluminium pads. The research specifically targets the fine pitch interconnect applications where a thin metal wire of approximately 20 µm in diameter is commonly used. In thermosonic <b>ball</b> <b>bonding</b> process, a thin gold or copper ball formed {{at the end of a}} wire is attached to an aluminum pad through a combination of ultrasonic energy, pressure and heat, in order to initiate a complex solid-state reaction. In this research, the mechanisms of thermosonic <b>ball</b> <b>bonding</b> were elaborated by carefully examining interfacial characteristics as the results of the bonding process by utilising dual-beam focused ion beam and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, including the breakdown of the native alumina layer on Al pads, and formation of initial intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The effect of bonding parameters on these interfacial behaviours and bonding strength is also investigated in order to establish an inter-relationship between them. Interfacial evolution in both Au-Al and Cu-Al bonds during isothermal annealing in the temperature rage from 175 ºC to 250 ºC was investigated and compared. The results obtained demonstrated that the remnant alumina remains inside IMCs and moves towards the ball during annealing. The IMCs are formed preferentially in the peripheral and the central areas of the bonds during bonding and, moreover, they grow from the initially formed IMC particles. Growth kinetics of Cu-Al IMCs obey a parabolic growth law before the Al pad is completely consumed. The activation energies calculated for the growth of CuAl 2, Cu 9 Al 4 and the combination (CuAl 2 + Cu 9 Al 4) are 60. 66 kJ/mol, 75. 61 kJ/mol, and 65. 83 kJ/mol, respectively. In Au-Al bonds, Au-Al IMC growth is controlled by diffusion only at the start of the annealing process. A t^ 0. 2 - 0. 3 growth law can be applied to the Au-Al IMC growth after the Al pad is depleted. The sequence of IMC phase transformation in both Au-Al and Cu-Al bonds were investigated.

For both substrate types, HTST caused bond healing, reducing the average Rc by about 21 % and 27 %, respectively. Au diffusion into the Pd layer was observed in scanning transmission electron microscopy/ energy dispersive spectroscopy (STEM–EDS) line-scan analysis after HTST. It is considered that diffusion of Au or interdiffusion between Au and Pd can provide chemically strong bonding during HTST. This is supported by the Rc decrease measured as the aging time increased. Cu migration was indicated in the STEM–EDS analysis, but its effect on reliability can be ignored. Au and Pd tend to form a complete solid solution at the interface and can provide reliable interconnection for high temperature (250 C) applications...|$|R
40|$|In microelectronic packaging, {{wire bonding}} is the {{predominant}} method for making electrical connections. Copper is increasingly substituting gold as interconnection material {{since it is}} a much cheaper alternative and it also offers several physical advantages. Adequate and reliable mechanical integrity of the connection is usually checked by process controls based onto ‘‘wire pull’’ and ‘‘ball bond shear’’ tests. In this paper the two methods are compared in terms of sensitiveness in detecting a latent weakness of the bond-pad structure, either induced by inappropriate wire bonding process or cumulated during reliability ageing. The failure modes (in terms of frequency and maximum test load) observed at the <b>ball</b> <b>bond</b> interface have been investigated on two different batches of a same chip, obtained from different wire-bonding recipes and including both unstressed and aged units. Cross-sections of the samples, submitted to pull and shear both in destructive and non-destructive tests, have allowed us to investigate {{the relationship between the}} bond morphological characteristics (metal deformation and potential micro-damages induced by copper bonding) and the weak points for fracture propagation inside the bond-pad inner layers and the silicon substrate. Besides the experimental activities, fracture mechanics and the finite element method have been employed to model the pull and shear tests. The aims of the finite element modelling have been to predict the reduction of test maximum load in defective <b>ball</b> <b>bonds</b> and the crack growth angle adopting a mixed- mode criterion. Good results have been obtained by the numerical fracture analysis, which can then sup- port the reliability characterization and mechanical improvement of the bond...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Thermosonic <b>ball</b> <b>bonding</b> is a key technology in electrical interconnections between an integrated circuit and an external circuitry in microelectronics. Although this bonding process has been extensively utilised in electronics packaging industry, certain fundamental aspects behind all the practice are still not fully understood. This thesis is intended to address the existing knowledge gap in terms of bonding mechanisms and interfacial characteristics {{that are involved in}} thermosonic gold and copper <b>ball</b> <b>bonding</b> on aluminium pads. The research specifically targets the fine pitch interconnect applications where a thin metal wire of approximately 20 µm in diameter is commonly used. In thermosonic <b>ball</b> <b>bonding</b> process, a thin gold or copper ball formed {{at the end of a}} wire is attached to an aluminum pad through a combination of ultrasonic energy, pressure and heat, in order to initiate a complex solid-state reaction. In this research, the mechanisms of thermosonic <b>ball</b> <b>bonding</b> were elaborated by carefully examining interfacial characteristics as the results of the bonding process by utilising dual-beam focused ion beam and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, including the breakdown of the native alumina layer on Al pads, and formation of initial intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The effect of bonding parameters on these interfacial behaviours and bonding strength is also investigated in order to establish an inter-relationship between them. Interfacial evolution in both Au-Al and Cu-Al bonds during isothermal annealing in the temperature rage from 175 ºC to 250 ºC was investigated and compared. The results obtained demonstrated that the remnant alumina remains inside IMCs and moves towards the ball during annealing. The IMCs are formed preferentially in the peripheral and the central areas of the bonds during bonding and, moreover, they grow from the initially formed IMC particles. Growth kinetics of Cu-Al IMCs obey a parabolic growth law before the Al pad is completely consumed. The activation energies calculated for the growth of CuAl 2, Cu 9 Al 4 and the combination (CuAl 2 + Cu 9 Al 4) are 60. 66 kJ/mol, 75. 61 kJ/mol, and 65. 83 kJ/mol, respectively. In Au-Al bonds, Au-Al IMC growth is controlled by diffusion only at the start of the annealing process. A t^ 0. 2 - 0. 3 growth law can be applied to the Au-Al IMC growth after the Al pad is depleted. The sequence of IMC phase transformation in both Au-Al and Cu-Al bonds were investigated. Voids in Au-Al bonds grow dramatically during annealing, however, only a few voids nucleate and grow very slowly in Cu-Al bonds. The mechanisms of void formation, including volumetric shrinkage, oxidation and metal diffusion were proposed and discussed...|$|E
