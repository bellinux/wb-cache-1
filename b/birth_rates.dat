5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower <b>birth</b> <b>rates.</b> The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E
5|$|It is also widely {{believed}} that <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> fell {{during the period}} too, meaning that {{the growth rate of}} the population fell relative to the natural death rate.

5|$|Sociologist Joel Best {{wrote in}} 1993 {{that during the}} late 19th century, adults {{developed}} an increased concern {{for the welfare of}} children. Best noted that societies experienced decreasing <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> after industrialization, with parents focusing their attention on fewer children. According to him, at that time adults began to view childhood as a sacred period of development and children as invaluable, adorable, guiltless beings. During the 1970s and 1980s, Best wrote, adults, saw children as potential victims and sought to eliminate perceived threats.|$|E
5|$|With the British {{colonization}} of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies {{that would become}} the United States of America were established.

With extremely high <b>birth</b> <b>rates,</b> low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed. The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.|$|E
50|$|Natality in {{population}} ecology is the scientific term for <b>birth</b> <b>rate.</b> Along with mortality rate, natality rate {{is used to}} calculate the dynamics of a population. They are the key factors in determining whether a population is increasing, decreasing or staying the same in size. Natality is the greatest influence on a population’s increase. Natality is shown as a crude <b>birth</b> <b>rate</b> or specific <b>birth</b> <b>rate.</b> Crude <b>birth</b> <b>rate</b> is used when calculating population size (number of births per 1000 population/year), whereas specific <b>birth</b> <b>rate</b> is used relative to a specific criterion such as age. By calculating specific <b>birth</b> <b>rate,</b> the results are seen in an age-specific schedule of births.|$|R

5|$|World War II caused {{enrollment}} {{to decline}} {{and the student}} body consisted mainly {{of high school students}} and seminarians. Following the war, new students enrolled, and the school built a temporary facility in 1947 to accommodate them. Students from Illinois began to replace out-of-state students, the percentage of day, or commuting, students rose, and the school employed more lay teachers. After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more diverse student body, due to rising enrollment caused by the G.I. Bill. By 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students. Better times and higher <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> led to growing enrollment at St. Procopius in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria is in a {{state of}} {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of families do not have children under the age of 16. Consequently, population growth and <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{efforts to}} revive {{interest}} in the breed, numbers steadily declined {{in the years before}} 1988. In 1995, there were 33 stallions in service; in 1996 this number remained the same and by 1998 it had declined to 30. In 2004, there were 111 breeders and 119 Trait du Nord foals were registered. By 2007 and 2008 there were only 17 stallions registered, a number which is exposing the breed to a dangerous increase in inbreeding. To combat this danger, farmers are cross breeding the Trait du Nord with approved Belgian and Dutch horses. The number of farmers breeding the Trait du Nord decreased from 150 to 125 in 2002, then to 92 in 2007 and 86 in 2008. After <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> remained relatively steady in the 1990s, they began to drop in the 2000s, declining from 176 in 2000 to 100 in 2005 and just 75 in 2007.|$|E

Moreover, the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have intensified the perception of a swell in the number of Han.|$|E
5|$|In Birmingham, 60.4% of the {{population}} was aged between 16-74, compared to 66.7% in England as a whole.

Females represented 51.6% of {{the population}} whilst men represented 48.4%. The differences are most marked in the oldest age group reflecting greater female longevity, where more women were 70 or over. The bulge around the early-20s is due largely to students coming to the city's universities.

5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species is one that has high <b>birth</b> <b>rates,</b> low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E

Part of this increase {{can be attributed to}} the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death rates dropped and <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, including Italians, who migrated to South Wales.
