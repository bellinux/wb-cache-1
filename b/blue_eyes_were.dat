2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that all white cats with <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> deaf. This is not true, as there are many blue-eyed cats with perfect hearing. However, white cats with <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> do have slightly higher incidences of genetic deafness than white cats of other eye colors. White cats having one blue and one other-colored <b>eye</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "odd-eyed" [...] and may be deaf {{on the same side}} as the <b>blue</b> <b>eye.</b> This <b>is</b> the result of the yellow iris pigmentation rising to the surface of only one <b>eye,</b> as <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> normal at birth before the adult pigmentation has had a chance to express itself in the eye(s).|$|R
