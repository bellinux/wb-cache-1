It was factory-equipped with power mirrors, alloy wheels, rear seat headrests, an airbag steering wheel, and offered a choice between power sunroof or air conditioning. It came in five different special colours. For [...] "regular" [...] 1994 B4 saloons and Avants, standard features as well as options available were stepped up too, including an airbag steering wheel and redesigned door liners (standard), and passenger airbags and a <b>built-in</b> <b>engine</b> immobiliser (optional).|$|E

40|$|EPiServer is {{a content}} {{management}} system where users can publish information on a website by using a web browser. EPiServer has a <b>built-in</b> search <b>engine</b> that is very simple. Many customers using EPiServer web publishing system {{is in need of}} more functionality than is offered by EPiServer's <b>built-in</b> search <b>engine.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to develop additional functionality extends that the <b>built-in</b> search <b>engine</b> in EPiServer. The assignment was also to identify what need to be developed in order to give customers a better  opportunity to help their visitors find the right information on their website. Since this thesis was started in 2005, a number of commercial search engine productsentered  the market and it has become more common for companies to invest inthese products instead of using the simple search engine that's built into EPiServer. These products have many of the features that have been developed in this thesis. Another crucial difference between EPiServer’s built in engine and other products isthe method used to index content. The approach that the commercial search enginesuse will make the relevance of search results to be much better. The product that was developed in this thesis fulfilled the demands of the customerswell, and the result of this thesis has been distributed to several of the company’scustomers. However, in recent years it has been proven to be difficult to competewith the commercial search engines...|$|R
