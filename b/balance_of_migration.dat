In the second scenario we will assume that student mobility will cause changes in the population size of the two countries. Here we assume all other causes of population growth to be absent. Consequently the country that net receives most students will face a population growth while the other country will face a reduction in its population.|$|R

It is shown that having constructed the index it is also possible to establish a weighting of the contribution of each country to the overall degree of migration balance within a region. The new index is applied to three sub-groupings of the European Union (EU) : (a) a mix of nine northern and southern EU 15 countries; (b) seven northern EU 15 countries; and, (c) four southern EU 15 countries. It is shown that in each case migration in the 1990 s was highly balanced and improving significantly over time. However, there was a substantial difference between the northern and southern countries with the former enjoying significantly higher overall balance in migration than the latter, although the rate of improvement in balance was much higher amongst the southern countries. Finally, whilst the UK and Portugal were persistently low contributors to the overall balance in EU migration, Germany's contribution was the highest. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the dynamics of}} intra-organizational innovation implementation processes based on conversion within and migration between groups. We employ a diffusion model that extends often-used epidemic models in three ways: (i) repeated acceptance and rejection decisions of adopters and non-adopters; (ii) diffusion within and across groups organized in different network structures; and (iii) management’s continuous influence on the diffusion process. The model is used to identify and evaluate senior management’s possibilities to steer the diffusion process. Analyses reveal that network structure influences the interplay between the self-reinforcing dynamics of conversion and the <b>balancing</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>migration.</b> Additionally, management can minimize diffusion time and invested resources by considering the proximity of groups {{to each other and}} to the network periphery. Providing structural explanations, this study offers insights into why, given various intra-organizational networks,management policies can yield different results on whether and how innovations are adopted in an organization.

Several reports have described that HMG-CoA re-ductase inhibitors (statins) attenuate both the migration and proliferation of VSMC. However, the potential effect of statins on VSMC programmed cell death has received little attention. MethodsHuman and rat VSMC were incubated with different concentration of statins {{in the presence of}} fetal bovine serum as a survival factor. The presence of apoptosis was evaluated by morphological criteria, flow cytometry and DNA elec-trophoresis. ResultsLipophilic statins induced, in a dose-dependent manner the appearance of VSMC apoptosis. The effect of statins was fully reversed by mevalonate, farnesylpyrophos-phate, and geranylgeranypyrophosphate, but not by cholesterol or other mevalonate metabolites, suggesting a role for isopren-oids in VSMC apoptosis. In addition, the induction of apoptosis by statins was associated with the inhibition of prenylation of Rho B. ConclusionsThe present results suggest that protein prenyl-ation inhibition by statins may be involved in statin-induced VSMC apoptosis.

Complex patterns involve large arrays of species and {{huge numbers of}} birds in crossing deserts, mountain chains and large stretches of sea. Despite the recent rapid developments of new marking technologies, standardised ringing applied to networks of stations widely distributed across the barriers still represents a unique tool to unravel {{different aspects of the}} progression of the waves of migration. The Italian Ringing Centre at ISPRA co-ordinates two major projects investigating, respectively, songbird migration across the Mediterranean in spring and over the Alps in autumn. Networks of ringing stations provide details on geographical distribution of flyways based on first-capture data and on species-specific seasonality of movements as also explained by ecological factors acting both on the wintering and breeding grounds. Physical conditions of migrants at different stages of barrier crossing provide details on the energetic cost of endurance flights, contributing {{to the understanding of the}} ecological needs of migrants. Conditions of staging migrants, stopover duration and habitat use by migrants significantly contribute to the understanding of time- versus risk-minimizing strategies, within the general framework of the energetic <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>migration.</b> Also, networks represented by the national communities of ringers contribute to the understanding of the ecological role a given country plays within larger migratory flyways.

40|$|The study {{examines}} the patterns and determinants of migration flows {{of young women}} at the age between 18 and 30 years. At the NUTS- 3 regional level, i. e. the district level (Kreise), the German internal migration flows of the year 2005 are explored. From descriptive statistics {{it can be seen}} that peripheral regions in East Germany face the strongest migration deficit with respect to young women, whereas agglomerations in West Germany but also in the East benefit from an intense migration surplus within this group. The econometric analysis of determinants of regional migration flows emphasizes the importance of economic, family-related and educational migration motives. Generally speaking, young women tend to choose regions with good income and job opportunities. In addition, they seem to be attracted by regions enabling an appropriate balance between family and career. Furthermore, the existence of excellent educational facilities is a significant pull factor regarding young female migration. This educationally motivated type of migration generates an enduring effect on the regional <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>migration,</b> which is especially true if the educational opportunities in the target region are associated with adequate career perspectives for highly qualified female graduates. In terms of recommendations for action, the study underlines the importance of policy measures improving the regional job and income opportunities. Secondly, the upgrading of fields of study mainly chosen by women seems to be a suitable way to stimulate female immigration. Moreover, the enhancement of the social infrastructure, which promotes a satisfactory work life balance, might attract young women or at least reduce the number of them leaving the region. ...|$|E

30|$|Finally, as expected, a {{positive}} <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>migration</b> experience has a double effect: while the subjective dimension (feeling well in Italy) is {{strongly associated with}} settlement intention or long stay, the economic consideration about family ability to save indicates that migrants reporting the worst economic circumstances—that is whose monthly income does not cover all spending needs—have higher intention to both settlement and short stay. These results can be interpreted in two opposite ways, {{both of which are}} supported by evidence from other studies. Firstly, our results support the hypothesis of negative selection in remigration pointed out by the aforementioned studies about migrant assimilation in the Italian labour market (Venturini and Villosio 2008; Dell’Aringa and Pagani 2011; Strom et al. 2013). Secondly, they highlight the effects of the family reunification and settlement process on family economic conditions: the presence of a completely reunified family entails a temporary status of poverty due to the growth of family size and assimilation with the Italian lifestyle necessitating extra spending (Barbiano di Belgiojoso et al. 2009; Rimoldi and Barbiano di Belgiojoso 2014).|$|R

40|$|Theories {{developed}} {{to explain the}} processes that govern the assembly and composition of natural plant communities {{can be divided into}} two broad categories. Niche-based theories propose that coevolutionary changes among species lead to character divergence (displacement), which allows for coexistence by partitioning resources among species. In contrast, ecological-drift theories propose that species diversity results from a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>migration,</b> speciation, and extinction, with little microevolutionary change. We use a game-theory model to reconcile drift and niche perspectives by developing a theory of species “marriage. ” Initially, ecological drift may determine which species encounter each other in a competitive arena. Once species come into contact, historical niche development as a result of prior coevolutionary molding of competitive ability determines which species may coexist. The model shows that only species that display the well-known tradeoff between seed size and competitive ability as a result of past competitive histories comply with the requisite for mutual evolutionary stability. Mutual evolutionary stability of competitive ability tends to make reproductive outputs more similar between species, increasing the chances of ecological equilibrium, i. e., the coexistence of species competing for a single resource. Moreover, mutual evolutionary stability guarantees that such an ecological equilibrium will be stable. The species-marriage model predicts that two or more plant species will coexist indefinitely (i. e., “marry”) when their difference in seed size, their densities, and the resource availability obey a specific quantitative relation. For example, when resource availability is high, married species should be characterized by a greater asymmetry in seed size than when resource availability is low. Thus, in the species-marriage model, competition can shape the detailed properties of communities without violating the postulates of ecological-drift theory...|$|E

The analysis draws on a nation-wide sample of households in 1983 and 1995, combining {{the characteristics of}} the migrants with those of the localities of origin and destination. The findings indicate that: internal migration is of significant scope with 17 percent of the families examined changing their locality; the likelihood of migrating rises with income and educational attainment, and declines with age up to a certain point, after which the latter trend is reversed; localities differ substantially in their <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>migration</b> and {{the characteristics of the}} migrants. We further analyze two important processes that have attracted considerable public attention: the rise of the suburbs, and the weakening of the development towns. We find that strong populations leave the metropolitan areas – in particular, the strongest move to affluent suburbs and rural communities. We also document a significant net flow out of the development towns, especially among young well-educated couples. Those who leave the development towns differ in their destination: Many of those leaving the development towns in the north stay in the region – the strongest of whom move to rural communities there – while among those leaving the towns in the south, a larger fraction moves {{to the center of the}} country. The net negative migration balance in the development towns is all the more noteworthy considering the longstanding policy to strengthen these towns and the periphery in general. The flow of strong families – from the metropolitan areas as well as from the development towns – to smaller and more homogeneous localities has important policy implications regarding the rise in disparities among localities. ...|$|E

The need {{for the development of}} the Eastern territories is designated among the four main strategic priorities of the state policy, which determines the geopolitical problem of fixing of the population in the region. The population growth rate is shown until the 1990 s is superior in comparison with the Russian indicators. The role of migration flows in the dynamics of the population of the region in Soviet and post-Soviet periods is investigated in detail. The attention is focused on the formation of negative <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>migration</b> in cooperation with the Russian regions in the period after 1991 and the positive situation in migration processes with CIS countries and far abroad. It is noted that the main reasons for out-migration from the Far Eastern region is inequality in socio-economic development compared to the Russian national level. Examples of correlations of real and nominal wages and the value of pension provision for residents of the Far East and Russia as a whole are given and the index of social well-being of the subjects of the region is presented. The analysis of natural reproduction is done and it is shown that beginning from 2012 the natural reproduction of the population reach a positive value for the first time in the post-Soviet era. At the same time it is noted that only four out of nine subjects in the region show positive dynamics for this indicator. Data on the Far Eastern excess fertility at lower mortality rates relatively to the national average is presented. It is noted that there is an ongoing process of transformation and these figures are approaching the national average. It is revealed that the birth rate in the region at present does not even follow simple reproduction of the population. In the short term the situation may become more complicated due to the reduction in the population of women in reproductive age due to their birth in the period of fertility decline. The structure of the region's population was analyzed by major age groups during the period between all-Russian population censuses from 2002 to 2010. There was a marked reduction in the proportion of persons younger than able-bodied and of working age and greater than the national average growth in the number of residents above working age.

40|$|Urbanization {{processes}} {{which take}} place in functional, ecological, socio-professional and socio-cultural planes play an increasingly important role not only in towns but also in areas situated outside towns. Those processes are of specific character in areas located in close vicinity to big agglomerations, since professional and cultural urbanization is not always accompanied here by the urbanization of functions. Around a town appears a distinct zone of the influx of people, mostly townspeople. It is a zone characterized by a poorer development of services in comparison with areas more distant from a town. The shortage of services is compensated to some extent by better communication facilities connecting such a zone with the agglomeration. A zone of that kind is called a "shadow" of a town. The range of Poznań "shadow" has been determined and characterized by the following indicators: the growth <b>of</b> population, <b>migration</b> <b>balance,</b> directions <b>of</b> <b>migration,</b> number <b>of</b> trade, catering and serivce institutions, libraries and movie-theatres. The {{study was conducted in}} selected zones around Poznań. The range of Poznań "shadow" is delimited by the borders of communes adjacent to the town or by the two closest rings (up to 10 km.). The third ring (10 - 15 km. from the town) is a transition zone. The study of spatial differentiation of urbanization processes is important for planning the development of the agglomeration and the areas adjacent to the town.
