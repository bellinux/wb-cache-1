5|$|A prohibiting order {{operates}} {{to prevent}} illegal action <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> authority from {{occurring in the}} first place. It may be granted by the High Court {{in cases where the}} applicant is aware that the authority is about to take an unlawful course of action, or to prevent the authority from repeating an unlawful act. Like a quashing order, a prohibiting order is used to help maintain good standards of public administration.|$|E
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of standing prevents applicants from burdening {{the court with}} frivolous or vexatious claims. This minimizes disruption in the administrative process. When an administrative decision <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> authority is challenged, implementation of {{the decision by the}} authority may be delayed. Therefore, the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging the decision. Furthermore, since the courts' resources are limited, restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial resources are appropriately allocated.|$|E

On the other hand, it is an established principle that no tribunal can delegate judicial or quasi-judicial functions such as disciplinary powers.|$|E

5|$|Fettering of {{discretion}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> authority {{is one of}} the grounds of judicial review in Singapore administrative law. It is regarded as a form of illegality. An applicant may challenge a decision by an authority on the basis that it has either rigidly adhered to a policy it has formulated, or has wrongfully delegated the exercise of its statutory powers to another body. If the High Court finds that a decision-maker has fettered its discretion, it may hold the decision to be ultra vires – beyond the decision-maker's powers – and grant the applicant a suitable remedy such as a quashing order to invalidate the decision.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, was {{considering}} a scheme with two cordons, one covering the main urban {{core of the}} Greater Manchester Urban Area and another covering the Manchester city centre. The measure {{was supported by the}} government, but three local authorities rejected it (Bury, Trafford and Stockport); the support of two-thirds of Manchester's 10 local councils was needed for it to be implemented. A comprehensive transport investment package for Manchester, which included the congestion pricing element, was released for further public consultation and was to be subject of a referendum in December 2008. On 12 December 2008 the scheme was overwhelmingly rejected by 10 out of 10 councils <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> referendum.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty new designs, in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> debate on the function and importance of a national flag.|$|E
