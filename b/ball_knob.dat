40|$|Abstract: Effect of {{material}} change of plastic product is investigated {{in this research}} paper. The parameter observed are waste recycle, impact property of product, aesthetic look, cycle time, production rate and cost of product. In this study {{it was found that}} by changing the material of product from thermoset plastic to thermoplast plastic and production process from compression molding to injection molding, the product becomes eco friendly because thermoplast material is recyclable. It was also found that impact strength and production rate/hour was also improved due to reduction in cycle time. The aesthetic look: smoothness of surface and glossy look of the product was become better and long lasting. And finally the cost of product was reduced tremendously. The research was carried out in a small scale industry with a case study of <b>ball</b> <b>knob</b> of machine tool handle lever...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{most common}} body parts that sustain {{injuries}} at the workplace are {{the hands and}} fingers. In association to this, researchers have conducted various studies on grip span, forces, postures, contact area and strength. However, it appears that limited {{studies have been done}} on the design of screw knobs of ergonomic shapes and sizes for pinch grip activities. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} design, develop and assess screw knobs of ergonomic shapes and sizes for pinching activities. Several designs of screw knobs were designed and fabricated. The assessment of the knobs involved workers from a manufacturing firm. The ratings on the efforts to pinch and turn the knobs were collected using surveys and analyzed with reliability and descriptive and analyses. The results show that the workers mostly preferred using the small 5 -lobes knob. However, the large <b>ball</b> <b>knob</b> was the least preferred knob to be used. The findings of this study can be used to create design guidelines on knob shapes and sizes to develop safer, more ergonomic and efficient knobs...|$|E

50|$|Inside, a few accents were noticeable. The {{only option}} was ESP, Volkswagen's {{stability}} control feature. All 20ths had a sunroof, black headliner, golf <b>ball</b> shift <b>knob,</b> black leather steering wheel with silver stitching, black leather shifter boot with silver stitching, perforated leather covered hand brake handle, and sporty black cloth Recaro bucket seats with silver stitching accents and red GTI emblems embroidered {{in the middle}} of the back rests. Aluminum trim came standard, complete with a numbered nameplate above the radio identifying the exact production number (US production only) of the vehicle. Volkswagen's premium 8-speaker Monsoon stereo system was also standard.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} a {{behaviour}} that {{has been described as}} a FAP is the egg-retrieval behavior of the graylag goose, reported in classic studies by Niko Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz. Like many ground-nesting birds, if an egg becomes displaced from the nest, the greylag rolls it back to the nest with its beak. The sight of the displaced egg is the sign stimulus and elicits the egg-retrieval behaviour. If the egg is removed from the goose during the performance of egg-rolling, the bird often continues with the behavior, pulling its head back as if an imaginary egg is still being maneuvered by the underside of its beak. The greylag will also attempt to retrieve other egg-shaped objects, such as a golf <b>ball,</b> door <b>knob,</b> or even a model egg too large to have possibly been laid by the goose itself (i.e. a supernormal stimulus).|$|R
50|$|Already a pitcher's duel, Moore and Wada matched zeroes, {{with both}} teams {{threatening}} at times. Daiei {{had a chance}} in the 6th with 1 out, but Iguchi flew out to the warning track in left, and Matsunaka weakly grounded out to the catcher. In the 7th, the Hawks had Valdes and 2nd and Muramatsu at 1st on a controversial hit-batsman call (Hoshino-kantoku argued that the <b>ball</b> hit the <b>knob</b> of Muramatsu's bat). Wada was pinch-hit for by Ohmichi with runners on 2nd and 3rd after Torigoe sacrificed, but Moore got Ohmichi to ground out to 2nd to end the threat.|$|R
5000|$|Commonly {{utilized}} in CAD applications, 3D modeling, animation, 3D visualization and product visualization, users can manipulate the controller's pressure-sensitive handle (historically {{referred to as}} either a cap, <b>ball,</b> mouse or <b>knob)</b> to fly through 3D environments or manipulate 3D models within an application. The appeal of these devices over a mouse and keyboard {{is the ability to}} pan, zoom and rotate 3D imagery simultaneously, without stopping to change directions using keyboard shortcuts or a software interface. 3Dconnexion devices are compatible with over 100 applications including Autodesk Inventor, Solid Edge, Blender, Google Earth, Second Life, NASA World Wind, Virtual Earth 3D, Geomagic, Google SketchUp 6, Cinema4D, Maya, SolidWorks, T-FLEX CAD, Photoshop, and more ...|$|R
50|$|A {{straight}} key {{is the common}} telegraph key as seen in various movies. It is a simple bar with a knob on top and a contact underneath. When the bar is depressed against spring tension, it forms a circuit and allows electricity to flow. Traditionally, American telegraph keys had flat topped knobs and narrow bars (frequently curved). British telegraph keys had <b>ball</b> shaped <b>knobs</b> and thick bars. This appears to be purely a matter of culture and training, but the users of each are tremendously partisan. Straight keys {{have been made in}} numerous variations for over 150 years and in numerous countries. They are the subject of an avid community of key collectors. The {{straight key}}s used in wire telegraphy also had a shorting bar that closed the electrical circuit when the operator was not actively sending messages. This was to complete the electrical path to the next station so that its sounder would operate, as in the operator receiving a message from the next town. Although occasionally included in later keys for reasons of tradition, the shorting bar is unnecessary for radio telegraphy, except as a convenience when tuning the transmitter.|$|R
40|$|Radiation is one {{of natural}} {{phenomenon}} that often discussed in light atomic reaction nuclear application and electromagnetic wave especially in gamma ray X ray and UV light. Commonly we usually {{think that they are}} negative deadly and dangerous for living creatures. Radiaton may be correlated with thermal phenomenon but this reasearch was applied to get audio phenomenon and radiation especially ultrasonic radiation. Sound is a particle of vibration that propagates through medium and transmitted as longitudinal wave in which the displacement of the medium is parallel to the propagation of the wave. Radiation is the emission of waves in all directions in space by vibratory sources transducers form small <b>balls</b> or <b>knob</b> 234 this study were irradiating exposing to bulk cooking oils. The bulk cooking oil was treated by the ultrasonic exposure 1. 5 hours and 3 hours and 24 -hour incubation that it showed no aerobic colony. And besides the untreated bulk cooking oil showed a few aerobic colonies. And also the untreated used bulk cooking oil showed more some aerobic colonies. The research results shows that ultrasonic exposure at 48 kHz for 1. 5 hours can enhance the microbiological quality of bulk cooking oil for 10 day storage...|$|R
5000|$|Going {{on sale in}} November 2006 from Â£22,295 RRP, with {{an initial}} goal of a limited {{production}} run of only 1500 (Europe models), the Edition 30 was available in 6 colours; Tornado Red, Black, Candy White, Reflex Silver (Metallic), Steel Grey (Metallic) and finally Diamond Black (Pearl). Due to strong demand, 2280 cars were eventually built with a small number continuing into the 2009 model year. The changes over the standard production model included a modified engine that produced an extra [...] more than the standard [...] version, raising the output to , giving rumour that it was faster in the dry and {{more powerful than the}} R32. Slight changes to the body work included body coloured side skirts and Votex front spoiler, colour-keyed rear bumper and tinted rear lights from the R32. Changes to the interior included a return for the golf <b>ball</b> shaped gear <b>knob</b> and silver [...] "Edition 30" [...] logo'd sill plates. Edition 30 seats were also decked out in the distinctive red stitching on 'Vienna' leather and 'Interlagos' fabric mix. Red stitching was also added to the leather-covered steering wheel. Finally, dependent on the market and the options available the Edition 30 was available with 18" [...] BBS originated 'Pescara' alloy wheels, or black versions of the 18" [...] 'Monza II' alloy wheels.|$|R
5000|$|Volkswagen {{produced}} a limited quantity of 1000 special-edition 3 and 5-door GTI Anniversary models, celebrating 20 {{years of the}} GTI model. This had the usual GTI specification but came equipped with special chequered Recaro front sport seats and matching rear seats bearing the GTI logo, red seat belts front and rear, half-chromed and leather golf <b>ball</b> gear <b>knob,</b> red stitched leather steering wheel and handbrake gaiter. The release knob on the hand brake was also red and silver instrument dials. Floor mats also had red piping along their edges. The red theme continued externally with a red striping on the bumpers and red brake calipers. The wheels were 16" [...] x 7" [...] split rim BBS RS 722 alloys, visually similar to the 15" [...] that were found on VR6 model. Brush stainless steel rear twin tailpipes on the exhaust and smoked front fog and indicator lamps to match the rear lamps. 3 optional extras were made available; electric sunroof, air conditioning and metallic black paintwork. Insurance {{was based on the}} standard GTI which made this version a very desirable model. The edition was sold in only 6 colour schemes and the 1000 number figures that were produced was as follows; 600 8 valve models, 150 16 valve models and 250 TDI models. The diesel model was only produced for the European market and was not sold in the UK. Unfortunately many of the models fell into the UK company car and lease market prior to the second-hand market and its believed only a few hundred still survive.However, another factor in the rarity of Mark 3 Golfs, unlike the excellent build quality of the Mark 2, at least in the UK, is the very low quality steel sourced by VW on some occasions, and used across the range, from entry model to VR6. According to independent mechanics and parts specialists, and MOT testers, the floorpan, both door sills, and rear hatch can suffer severe rot and disintegration, and anybody planning to buy one is advised to check for rot, and holes and patches to the floorpan.|$|R
6000|$|... 1449. When an {{electrical}} brush from an inch to six {{inches in length}} or more is issuing into free air, it has the form given, fig. 117. But if the hand, a <b>ball,</b> of any <b>knobbed</b> conductor be brought near, the extremities of the coruscations turn towards it and each other, and the whole assumes various forms according to circumstances, as in figs. 119, 120, and 121. The influence of the circumstances in each case is easily traced, and I might describe it here, but that I should be ashamed to occupy {{the time of the}} Society in things so evident. But how beautifully does the curvature of the ramifications illustrate the curved form of the lines of inductive force existing previous to the discharge! for the former are consequences of the latter, and take their course, in each discharge, where the previous inductive tension had been raised to the proper degree. They represent these curves just as well as iron filings represent magnetic curves, the visible effects in both cases being the consequences of the action of the forces in the places where the effects appear. The phenomena, therefore, constitute additional and powerful testimony (1216. 1230.) to that already given in favour both of induction through dielectrics in curved lines (1231.), and of the lateral relation of these lines, by an effect equivalent to a repulsion producing divergence, or, as in the cases figured, the bulging form.|$|R
60|$|By these means Rachel {{reached that}} stage in {{thinking}}, if thinking {{it can be}} called, when the eyes are intent upon a <b>ball</b> or a <b>knob</b> and the lips cease to move. Her efforts {{to come to an}} understanding had only hurt her aunt's feelings, and the conclusion must be that it is better not to try. To feel anything strongly was to create an abyss between oneself and others who feel strongly perhaps but differently. It was far better to play the piano and forget all the rest. The conclusion was very welcome. Let these odd men and women--her aunts, the Hunts, Ridley, Helen, Mr. Pepper, and the rest--be symbols,--featureless but dignified, symbols of age, of youth, of motherhood, of learning, and beautiful often as people upon the stage are beautiful. It appeared that nobody ever said a thing they meant, or ever talked of a feeling they felt, but that was what music was for. Reality dwelling in what one saw and felt, but did not talk about, one could accept a system in which things went round and round quite satisfactorily to other people, without often troubling to think about it, except as something superficially strange. Absorbed by her music she accepted her lot very complacently, blazing into indignation perhaps once a fortnight, and subsiding as she subsided now. Inextricably mixed in dreamy confusion, her mind seemed to enter into communion, to be delightfully expanded and combined with the spirit of the whitish boards on deck, with the spirit of the sea, with the spirit of Beethoven Op. 112, even with the spirit of poor William Cowper there at Olney. Like a ball of thistledown it kissed the sea, rose, kissed it again, and thus rising and kissing passed finally out of sight. The rising and falling of the ball of thistledown was represented by the sudden droop forward of her own head, and when it passed out of sight she was asleep.|$|R
