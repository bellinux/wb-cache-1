5|$|In the uplands of the island, an {{area that}} used to be lawn has <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> oak, hickory, ash, cherry, tree of heaven and sassafras. By the lighthouse, several {{openings}} in the shrubbery have been made to provide a variety of habitats for wildlife and a barrier of shrubs has been planted on the cliffs east of the lighthouse.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} other modes of feeding. Grimpoteuthis has a reduced or {{non-existent}} radula and swallows prey whole. In the deep-sea genus Stauroteuthis, {{some of the}} muscle cells that control the suckers in most species have <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> photophores which are believed to fool prey by directing them towards the mouth, making them {{one of the few}} bioluminescent octopuses.|$|E

50|$|After a few concerts Błażej {{decided to}} leave the band and move to Kielce and <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> Dydas, guitarist of another punk rock band from Szczecin - Włochaty. Soon after another changes took place. Paweł Boguszewski <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> Kanister and Kefir <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> Mirosław Lipniewski.|$|R
5|$|Being an {{expansion}} to Dark Forces II, Mysteries of the Sith requires the Dark Forces II CD-ROM {{the first time}} the player starts the game. LucasArts has made improvements to the 3D engine used in Dark Forces II by including colored lighting. The full motion video cut scenes that were used between levels in Dark Forces II have <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> cinematics rendered by the 3D engine.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the earlier {{priority}} of good sea {{air on the}} pier had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> a desire for public entertainment. The pier reached record levels of attendance in the early 20th century, attracting around 1.5 million visitors between 1910 and 1911. Attendance fell due to the onset of World War I, but resumed afterwards, with around 2 million people visiting between 1918 and 1919.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E

50|$|Also in 1959, the 14.67 MHz {{transmitter}} <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> a new 20 kW unit. All site antennas <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> vertical antennas by 1971.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the twelve}} {{original}} boilers, two smaller ones were mixed-fuel capable. They <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> oil-fired units. Their coal bunkers <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> fuel-oil tanks.|$|R
5|$|DM {{eventually}} assigns {{names to}} all of its locomotives when they are repainted, usually after locations along its right-of-way, but a few exceptions have been named for people (like road number 550, named after Senator Larry Pressler). All of the first-generation diesel locomotives purchased from Chicago and North Western and Milwaukee Road have since <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> more recent locomotives, although the newer locomotives were also bought used.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.|$|E
5|$|MagSafe, a {{magnetic}} charging connector, has <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> USB-C charging. Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the user’s {{field of view}} to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power. The Macintosh startup chime {{that has been used}} since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.|$|E
50|$|Preliminary plans by the Architectural Services Department {{indicate}} that the existing gateball court will <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> basketball courts, the existing tennis courts will <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> a football pitch, and the existing changing room block will <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> a bridge structure connecting to a new gateball court {{on top of the}} hill.|$|R
50|$|Counties and burghs <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> two-tier {{regions and}} districts and unitary islands council areas, and the regions and districts <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> unitary council areas in 1996.|$|R
50|$|Nusinersen is an {{antisense}} oligonucleotide {{in which the}} 2’-hydroxy groups of the ribofuranosyl rings <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> 2’-O-2-methoxyethyl groups and the phosphate linkages <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> phosphorothioate linkages.|$|R
5|$|Several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to produce sequels and remakes in the decades following Caligaris release. Robert Wiene bought the rights to Caligari from Universum Film AG in 1934 with the intention of filming a sound remake, which never materialized before Wiene's death in 1938. He intended to cast Jean Cocteau as Cesare, and a script, believed to be written by Wiene, indicated the Expressionist style would have <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> a French surrealist style.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St Cuthbert (which {{tourists}} often {{mistake for}} the cathedral) has a fine Somerset stone tower and a superb carved roof. Originally an Early English building (13th century), {{it was much}} altered in the Perpendicular period (15th century). The nave's coloured ceiling was repainted in 1963 at the instigation of the then Vicar's wife, Mrs Barnett. Until 1561 the church had a central tower which either collapsed or was removed, and has <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> the current tower over the west door. Bells were cast for the tower by Roger Purdy.|$|E
5|$|The English Twenty20 cricket champions are {{the winners}} of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) Twenty20 {{competition}} for first-class cricket counties, most recently the Friends Life t20, although from 2014 this has <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> the NatWest t20 Blast. The competition culminates with 'Finals Day': a single day on which both semi-finals and the final are contested at the same ground. Northamptonshire are the current champions, claiming their second title in the 2016 season.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} typically {{consist of}} {{a mirror image of}} the drug's effects: Sedative effects and suppression of REM and SWS stages of sleep can <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by insomnia, nightmares, and hypnogogic hallucinations; its antianxiety effects <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> anxiety and panic; muscle-relaxant effects <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> muscular spasms or cramps; and anticonvulsant effects <b>are</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> seizures, especially in cold turkey or overly-rapid withdrawal.|$|R
500|$|Starting in 1896, Sachsen was dry-docked at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for an {{extensive}} modernization. The ship's entire propulsion system, including screws, boilers, and engines <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> new equipment.

5|$|The Peace Candle {{was first}} erected in 1951, {{and has been}} put up almost every year since then. Due to damage or disrepair, the Peace Candle has <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> new candle {{structures}} twice since the original construction. The first candle lasted until 1968, the second candle from 1969 to 1989, and the current candle was built in 1990 {{and is expected to}} last until around 2014. The structure is dedicated to the Easton area {{men and women who have}} served or are serving in the United States armed forces.|$|E
5|$|The entire cast {{from the}} {{previous}} games has <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> new characters. CO powers have been toned down, and no longer affect all units or the whole battle or the whole map. Tag powers from Dual Strike which allowed players to move twice in one turn have been removed. Players gain CO powers much later in the campaign than before, {{and they have a}} much less significant role in overall gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} room, {{like the}} exterior, is oriented east-west. The most prominent decorative element inside is the hand graining detail {{on the wood}} surfaces. An elevated gallery lines the north wall facing the pews which are bisected by 3½ ft (1.1 m) tall, 5 in (13cm) wide beaded board partition. The pews, partition, door, and window trim are all hand grained. The interior walls are covered with 6 in (15cm) pine wainscotting. The original iron stoves have <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> oil-burning stoves, set into the original flues.|$|E
50|$|The Harvard School of Public Health {{holds that}} {{saturated}} fats should <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> cis monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, {{but that they}} should not <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> refined carbohydrates.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, the Bell Jet Ranger <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> a more {{powerful}} Eurocopter Squirrel emergency helicopter and in 1994 the Squirrel <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> a twin-engine MBB/Kawasaki BK 117.|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} triarii {{were reduced to}} 600 per legion, forming 10 maniples of 60 men each. The triarii still made up the third line in the legion, behind {{the front line of}} hastati and the second line of principes, but the rorarii and accensi were phased out. Leves had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> velites, who had a similar role but were also {{attached}} to principes and triarii.|$|E
5|$|The two Sydney punchbowls are {{the only}} known {{examples}} of Chinese export porcelain hand painted with Sydney scenes and dating from the Macquarie era, lasting 1810–1821. The bowls were procured in China sometime between 1796 and 1820; about three decades after the First Fleet's arrival at Port Jackson in Sydney Cove. By 1850 Chinese-made porcelain imports had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> British earthenwares transfer-printed with decoration of Chinese derivation.|$|E
5|$|A governor, Sir John Fowell, was {{appointed}} to run the local defences, and to prevent smuggling, while Sir Henry was heavily fined by Parliament. By 1661 and the restoration of Charles II to the throne, the guns at Kingswear were mounted on the roof, which had been accidentally burnt down during the fighting in the war and had <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> a new lead version. Sir John retained his role as governor and, although Charles briefly reasserted {{the rights of the}} town over the defences, control quickly passed to the Crown. By the 18th century, Kingswear had fallen into ruin, although 12-pounder, 9-pounder and 8-pounder (5.4kg, 4kg and 3.6kg) guns were still installed there in 1717.|$|E
