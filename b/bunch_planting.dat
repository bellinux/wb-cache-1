40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to select families with superior performance and large genetic variability for diallel crosses for potential use in the pre-breeding of oil palm. The experiment consisted of 42 full-sib families divided into three trials with 16 families and 3 witnesses in common in randomized blocks, with four blocks and 12 plants per block. The characteristics evaluated in the experiment were number of <b>bunches</b> per <b>plant</b> (NBP), <b>bunch</b> weight per <b>plant</b> (BWP) and <b>bunch</b> average weight per plant (BAW). The estimation of variance components showed that there was greater genetic variance within families than between families. The heritability for all traits was high, above 0. 75, and the coefficient of environmental variation was low to moderate for all traits (between 4 and 13). Tocher’s method separated families into seven groups, whereas the UPGMA method identified six groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to morphologically characterize fruits of the babassu palm tree (Attalea vitrivir) and to estimate their productivity in the north of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Twenty mature fruits were collected from 10 plants in three different areas in Januária, Minas Gerais. Eighteen biometric parameters of the fruits were measured, the oil contents of the seeds was determined, the adherence to normal distribution was evaluated, distribution frequencies were evaluated and the effects of individuals and areas on the variables and the correlations between them were analyzed. The production of fruit <b>bunches</b> per <b>plant</b> and the number of fruits per <b>bunch</b> from 10 <b>plants</b> were quantified in three areas and the potential production under both natural harvesting and cultivation conditions were estimated. Significant differences were found among all of the biometric parameters examined between the different individuals and the different areas, which shows wide morphological variability in the fruits. The average oil content was 45. 7 %, but with significant differences among individuals. The observed variability favors the selection of productive individuals in genetic improvement programs. The potential productivity of endocarps and oil based on a density of 400 /plants per hectare would be respectively 6. 4 and 1. 2 tons/ha, which indicates the possibility of using A. vitrivir for producing charcoal, bio fuels, and for carbon fixation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to assess and characterize two clones, 169 and 685, of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and to evaluate the wine produced from these grapes. The experiment {{was carried out in}} São Joaquim, SC, Brazil, during the 2009 harvest season. During grape ripening, the evolution of physical-chemical properties, phenolic compounds, organic acids, and anthocyanins was evaluated. During grape harvest, yield components were determined for each clone. Individual and total phenolics, individual and total anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity were evaluated for wine. The clones were also assessed regarding the duration of their phenological cycle. During ripening, the evolution of phenolic compounds and of physical-chemical parameters was similar for both clones; however, during harvest, significant differences were observed regarding yield, number of <b>bunches</b> per <b>plant</b> and berries per bunch, leaf area, and organic acid, polyphenol, and anthocyanin content. The wines produced from these clones showed significant differences regarding chemical composition. The clones showed similar phenological cycle and responses to bioclimatic parameters.

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{chemical}} composition of grape berries during development exhibits large variation {{within a single}} bunch. To monitor {{the change in the}} concentration of tartaric acid and malic acid between individual berries, a high-throughput method using UHPLC-MS/MS was developed to quantify these acids in berry extracts. Methods and Results: The results from analysis of single-vine datasets indicated that there was a large variation in the concentration of tartaric acid and malic acid between individual berries and also between bunches of berries across a vine. From these data, an optimum sampling size of 30 berries per vine was determined, which has an estimated standard error under 10 % of the expected average berry acid concentration. Conclusions: A high-throughput UHPLC-MS/MS method using the stable isotope dilution analysis has been developed to quantify tartaric acid and malic acid in individual berry extracts and extracts prepared from samples of multiple berries. Signiﬁcance of the Study: This method enabled the study of variation in acid concentration and content between individual berries. This makes it possible to quantify the variation in the acids at several levels (berries, <b>bunches</b> and <b>plants)</b> and to recommend ideal sampling sizes for data collection in vineyards. E.

However, in order to cultivate it sustainably, it is necessary to optimize the limited resources used, mainly water and soil. Therefore, in arid areas, it is necessary to cultivate under intensive conditions, irrigate with reclaimed water and cut production costs. To optimize water consumption, partial root-zone drying (PRD), which keeps a part of the root system dry, was used. This water management strategy, employed successfully in other oil crops, yielded less fruit per bunch, but more fruit <b>bunches</b> per <b>plant.</b> This fact will probably allow to establish higher planting density and, consequently, higher productivity per surface unit.

Therefore numerous studies have considered different agronomic practices that limit photosynthetic activity. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of a natural anti-transpirant on grapevine physiology and berry and wine composition on different cultivars. In 2013 and 2014, in South Italy and Souther Australia, Aglianico and Falanghina, Shiraz and Semillon vines were treated at veraison with the anti-transpirant Vapor Gard® (T) and compared with a control (C) sprayed just with water. A bunch thinning (BT) treatment was also applied to both the Vapor Gard® treatment and the control. For each treatment was assessed vegetative response (pruning weight) and production (production and number of <b>bunches</b> per <b>plant,</b> TSS, pH, TA, polyphenols, anthocyanins) of individual varieties. Consideration was also the effectiveness of the film terpene that has come to form on the leaves, limiting gas exchange, through measurements of net photosynthesis and transpiration (LI- 6400). The results demonstrate that the application of anti-transpirant has reduced assimilation rate (A), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs), sugars berries accumulation (TSS) and wine alcohol degrees (% vol.). No significant differences between treatments were observed for other berry and wine compositional measures taken between cultivars.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the fruit yield of naturally occurring populations of Pindo palms (Butia odorata) in different habitats and agricultural ecosystems. Three areas were selected in the municipalities of Barra do Ribeiro, Tapes and Arambaré, all of which are located on the Litoral Médio in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Eleven 25 x 100 m² plots were selected in the aforementioned areas, and fruit yield was evaluated in the 2008 and 2009 seasons. Chemical conditions of the soil in each plot, elevation of terrain, height, and density of the reproductive Pindo palms were also assessed. Data analysis revealed a strong correlation between the edaphic conditions and the yield from the Pindo palms. Tapes Pindo palms exhibited higher fruit yield as a result of an increase in the number of <b>bunches</b> produced per <b>plant,</b> along with highly fertile soils and greater availability of calcium and magnesium. The lowest fruit yields were linked to nutrient-poor soils in Brachiaria pastures, as well as sandy plains containing high levels of sodium. Changes in the characteristics of the soils associated with habitat and management influenced the fruit yield of Pindo palms...|$|R
5000|$|A {{different}} {{view is that}} the Kola Bou represents Durga herself, who in Bengal is considered the mother of Ganesha. Those who know of that tradition do not consider Ganesha's association with Kola Bou as a marital one. Haridas Mitra says that the Kola Bou is intended to serve as a symbolic summary for the nine types of leaves (nava patrika) that together form a sacred complex on Durga Puja. [...] The officiating priests who carry out the ceremony tie a <b>bunch</b> of eight <b>plants</b> on the trunk of the plantain tree and it is the grouping of all nine plants that constitute the Kola Bou. [...] The nine plants all have beneficial medicinal properties. According to Martin-Dubost, the Kola Bou does not represent a bride or shakti of Ganesha, but rather is the plant form of Durga. He connects the plant symbol back to the festival enactment of Durga's return of the blood of the buffalo demon to the earth so that the order of the world may be re-established and luxuriant vegetation reappear. He links Ganesha to this vegetation myth and notes that Astadasausadhisristi ( [...] , [...] "Creator of the eighteen medicinal plants") is a name of Ganesha.|$|R
40|$|Increasing the Production and Quality of Grape Yield with Drip Irrigation and Mineral Plus Fertilizer. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to find out the optimum of irrigation intervals and mineral plus fertilizer application in order to increase the production and quality of grape yield. The research was set up for two years program. In the first year, the observation was focused on vegetative growth while yield production was observed in the second year. Three intervals of irrigation viz 2, 4 and 6 days and mineral plus fertilizer dose (M, M 0 and M) was tested in nested randomized block design with three replications. Parameter of vegetative growth such as plant height, stem diameter and number of branch was measured regularly. Supporting parameters such as soil moisture content, soil water potential, plant water status as indicated by relative water content (RWC) was also measured. In the second year, the production and quality of yield such as number of <b>bunch</b> per <b>plant,</b> number of fruit per bunch and sugar content of fruit were measured. The results showed that mineral plus fertilizer gave a significant effect on grape production, both in first and second harvest. Total yield production of first and second harvest of treatment M 0, M 1 and M 2 was 23. 63 kg 27. 95 kg and 30. 81 kg, respectively. The yield was increased of 18. 28 % and 30. 38 % of M 1 and M 2 compare to M 0. Interval water supply, has a significant effect on grape yield both in first and second harvest. Total yield production of I 1, I 2 and I 3 was 33. 04 kg, 28. 18 kg and 21. 17 kg, respectively. This was decreased of about 14. 71 % and 35. 93 % of I 2 and I 3 compare to I 1. Yield quality was increased as mineral fertilizer increased. Sugar content, volume of seed and respondent that mentioned the yield was sweet, significantly increased as mineral plus fertilizer increase...|$|R
500|$|Another popular festival held in Chamba is the [...] "Minjar Mela", held on {{the second}} Sunday of the Shravana month, {{corresponding}} to the month of August in the Gregorian calendar. It marks {{the triumph of the}} Raja of Chamba over the ruler of Trigarta (now called as Kangra), in 935 AD and also celebrates the paddy and maize crops grown {{at this time of the}} year. The festival commences with offerings of 'minjar', consisting of a <b>bunch</b> of paddy <b>plant</b> and golden silk wrapped in red fabric. The offerings also include a rupee, a seasonal fruit, and a coconut. This occasion is also celebrated with a flag hoisting ceremony at the Chaugan that initiates a week of cultural and social programmes. The image of the deity, Lord Raghuvira, and more than 200 other deities, are taken in a procession, in a chariot pulled by ropes. Folk dances and music performances known as 'Kunjari Malhar' are part of the festivities. On the last day of the festival, a parade is held from the Akhand Chandi Palace to Ravi River, where offerings are made to the river. This commemorates an event in which Raja Sahil Verman changed the course of the river, to make the Hari Rai temple accessible to all devotees.|$|R
