60|$|Suppose, for example, that 10 {{yards of}} <b>broad</b> <b>cloth</b> cost in England as much labour as 15 yards of linen, and in Germany {{as much as}} 20. If England sends 10 yards of <b>broad</b> <b>cloth</b> to Germany, {{and is able to}} {{exchange}} them for linen according to the German cost of production, she will get 20 yards of linen, with a quantity of labour with which she could not have produced more than 15; and will gain, therefore, 5 yards on every 15, or 33-1/3 per cent. But in this case Germany would obtain only 10 yards of cloth for 20 of linen. Now, 10 yards of cloth cost exactly the same quantity of labour in Germany as 20 of linen; Germany, therefore, derives no advantage from the trade, more than she would possess if it did not exist.|$|E

25|$|To be an {{efficient}} manufacturing facility, a loomshop needed good daylight, controlled ventilation, un-obstructed space, provision for storage, heat, and access for goods and workers. Hand looms were manual, the artisan raised the heddles using foot levers, {{and threw the}} shuttle {{the width of the}} loom by hand, forward and back. The left hand was used to operate the batten that compressed the pick. <b>Broader</b> <b>cloth</b> could not be woven this way, so the weaver used a child to throw back the shuttle. John Kay's flying shuttle of 1733, removed the need for the child. The weaver jerked the two hammers or pickers with a picking stick held in the right hand. The pickers propelled the shuttle, and the left hand operated the batten.|$|R

The Jacquard head was introduced onto hand looms in the 1820s. Because the Jacquard head was placed {{on top of the}} standard loom, an increased ceiling height as needed to accommodate them. Power looms were only suitable for coarse <b>broad</b> <b>cloths,</b> and hand looms continued to be used for the finest silks and the complex Jacquard work. In 1839, two silk workers James Mayers and John Ryle left the town and on the Marion sailed to New Jersey settling in the town of Paterson. Together they opened mills (1846) and established the American silk weaving industry. In hard times 3,000 townsfolk left and joined them, and in 1900 the Paterson newspaper regularly included the Births, Marriages and Deaths column from the Macclesfield Chronicle.|$|R

If for 20 yards, Germany will be as before, and England will derive the whole of the benefit. If for any number intermediate between 15 and 20, the advantage will be shared between the two countries. If, for example, 10 yards of cloth exchange for 18 of linen, England will gain an advantage of 3 yards on every 15, Germany will save 2 out of every 20.|$|E

He clutched here and there with his hand to try and ease the strain upon his muscles. He drew up his knees, altered his seat, and set his teeth with a grim determination to go through with it should it kill him. His head was splitting, his flayed face smarting, and every joint in his body aching as if it were dislocated. But he forgot all that when, with the rising of the moon, he heard the clinking of horses' hoofs down upon the track by the river, and knew that, unseen by them, he had already got well abreast of his companions.

60|$|Vivian {{pulled up}} his horse as he ascended through the fine {{beechwood}} which leads {{immediately to the}} city of Frankfort from the Darmstadt road. The crowd seemed to increase every moment, but as they were all hastening the same way, his progress was not much impeded. It was Frankfort fair; and all countenances were expressive of that excitement which we always experience at great meetings of our fellow-creatures; whether the assemblies be for slaughter, pleasure, or profit, and whether or not we ourselves join in the banquet, the battle, or the fair. At {{the top of the hill}} is an old Roman tower, and from this point the flourishing city of Frankfort, with its picturesque Cathedral, its numerous villas, and beautiful gardens in the middle of the fertile valley of the Maine, burst upon Vivian's sight. On crossing the bridge over the river, the crowd became almost impassable, and it was with the greatest difficulty that Vivian steered his way through the old narrow winding streets, full of tall ancient houses, with heavy casements and notched gable ends. These structures did not, however, at the present moment, greet the traveller with their usual sombre and antique appearance: their outside walls were, in most instances, covered with pieces of <b>broad</b> <b>cloth</b> of the most showy colours, red, blue, and yellow predominating. These standards of trade were not merely used for the purpose of exhibiting the quality of the article sold in the interior, but also of informing the curious traveller the name and nation of their adventurous owners. Inscriptions in German, French, Russian, English, Italian, and even Hebrew, appeared in striking characters on each woollen specimen; and, as if these were not sufficient to attract the attention of the passenger, an active apprentice, or assistant, commented in eloquent terms on the peculiar fairness and honesty of his master. The public squares and other open spaces, and indeed every spot which was secure from the hurrying wheels of the heavy old-fashioned coaches of the Frankfort aristocracy and the spirited pawings of their sleek and long-tailed coach-horses, were covered with large and showy booths, which groaned under the accumulated treasures of all countries. French silks and French clocks rivalled Manchester cottons and Sheffield cutlery, and assisted to attract or entrap the gazer, in company with Venetian chains, Neapolitan coral, and Vienna pipe-heads: here was the booth of a great book-seller, who looked to the approaching Leipsic fair for some consolation for his slow sale and the bad taste of the people of Frankfort; and there was a dealer in Bologna sausages, who felt quite convinced that in some things the taste of the Frankfort public was by no means to be lightly spoken of. All was bustle, bargaining, and business: there were quarrels and conversation in all languages; and Vivian Grey, although he had no chance either of winning or losing money, was amused.|$|E

He is famous for his marksmanship and his ability to lead men in battle. Many poor peasants he meets throughout his journey protest against the Federales because they burn their houses, take their wives, their stock, and their food. His dog was murdered, one of the most iconic and melodramatic scenes in the novel. It depicted a moment of helplessness a recurring theme throughout the book. Macias and his band of men traveled great lengths and looted and sacked villages throughout their journey in order to stay alive. They raped many Mexican women and hung dozens of men. Macias also had a semi-sexual encounter with another man that changed the essence of his character {{throughout the rest of the}} novel. Demetrio Macías and his men were not much better though. After conquering a town he would loot many houses. Still many of these poor men joined Macías in the fight against Huerta’s troops. At the beginning of the novel he fights to change his country, when at the end he does not know why he continues to fight, comparing his actions to that of a pebble he throws into a canyon. Many of Macías' men forget what they are fighting for and as time goes by start to concentrate more on their own needs. While at the beginning of his journey, Macías is fighting against various injustices at the end he seems to lose sight of the purpose. Mariano Azuela shows that while the Revolution improved various conditions and got rid of certain inequalities, it also created new ones.|$|R
40|$|This {{panel will}} address the technical, {{economic}} and marketing hurdles that inhibit {{the widespread use of}} cloth/clothing modeling, design and animation technology. Many of the fundamental technologies needed to support cloth modeling have already been developed. Still, we do not see computer-animated characters wearing realistic clothing, and clothing designers are not creating new fashions with computer-based 3 -D design systems. The CAD industry is capable of providing the systems for designing the Boeing 777, but almost none of the clothing we wear is designed with 3 -D CAD tools. The panel will explore the reasons that the design of cloth and clothing, a material that {{has been a part of}} the human experience for thousands of years, has not yet been fully computerized. A variety of issues related to cloth/clothing modeling will be explored. Are there fundamental technological barriers preventing us from fully deploying computer technology when modeling, designing, or animating cloth/clothing? Have the technical problems been solved and our computers are just not fast enough? Do we simply need good user interfaces to solve this difficult modeling problem? Is realism always important when modeling cloth? Does computer-based manufacturing place special demands on cloth modeling? Are designers, artists and clothing makers resisting the computerization of their “black art”? Can the average user even afford to do cloth modeling? Is the technology too expensive? These are some of the questions that the panelists will address. Before describing the challenges involved in modeling and animating clothing, the panelists will provide a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in the field. Topics will include the detailed modeling of cloth, the research involved in clothing virtual actors, bringing clothing animation to the entertainment industry, textile mechanics and engineering applications, and the latest in apparel CAD software and technology. Each speaker will briefly describe their work in the field, augmenting their talks with images, animations and live demonstrations. The panel will strive to achieve several goals. It will highlight cloth/clothing modeling as a separate field of study. Very often cloth modeling is seen as simply another application of deformable models. Cloth is a unique material with unusual properties that requires new and different modeling methods. In the CAD field, software systems for designing clothing are certainly different from conventional CAD systems that model collections of rigid parts. Given the unique nature of the field, it is important to seed the SIGGRAPH community with new ideas and challenges. The panel will educate the audience in a way that stimulates future research in cloth/clothing modeling. Another goal of the panel is to expose the SIGGRAPH community to those people working in the field of cloth/clothing modeling who are interested in more than just visual effects. The panel includes speakers who have a <b>broader</b> view of <b>cloth</b> modeling, including those working within the textile engineering and CAD communities. They are more concerned with accurately modeling cloth as an engineering material and bringing powerful CAD tools to the marketplace than the making of pretty pictures. The panel also consists of an international participant, in recognition that some of the best clothing modeling research is being conducted overseas...|$|R
