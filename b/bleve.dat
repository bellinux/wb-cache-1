25|$|Hydrogen peroxide, {{either in}} pure or diluted form, can pose several risks, the main one being that it forms {{explosive}} mixtures upon contact with organic compounds. Highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide itself is unstable {{and can cause}} a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (<b>BLEVE)</b> of the remaining liquid. Distillation of hydrogen peroxide at normal pressures is thus highly dangerous. It is also corrosive, especially when concentrated, but even domestic-strength solutions can cause irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin. Swallowing hydrogen peroxide solutions is particularly dangerous, as decomposition in the stomach releases large quantities of gas (10 times the volume of a 3% solution), leading to internal bloating. Inhaling over 10% can cause severe pulmonary irritation.|$|E

[...] Additionally, the head end of the train was rolled back to the accident scene, and pulled away seven cars of the train that were not derailed. At this point, {{a decision was made}} by the fire chief to pull firefighters back from the derailment, because of the risk of a <b>BLEVE</b> (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion). This evacuation of personnel was two blocks for one hour, then , and finally the initial evacuation was completed so quickly that fire hoses in use were abandoned and froze where they lay.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage systems require {{handling}} {{large volumes of}} high pressure CO 2. Having thorough knowledge of the related hazards is essential, as is knowing how to prevent, detect, control and mitigate accidents. This paper gives a short description of CO 2 Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosions (<b>BLEVEs)</b> and presents results from preliminary, small scale experiments with CO 2 <b>BLEVEs.</b> The mechanism of superheated liquid CO 2 boiling is not fully understood. Analogies can be made between gas explosions and rapid phase transitions occurring in <b>BLEVEs.</b> The experiments indicate that violent boiling may occur before the spinodal point is reached. Shock waves in the experiments were generated by the decompression of the vapour in the vessel before rupture. However, our recent theoretical models show that boiling also will contribute to shock strength. We observed fragment velocities up to approximately 100 m/s. Such fragments are a serious hazard. Large scale tests and laboratory tests are needed for validation of equation of state models and {{for the development of}} computational fluid dynamic codes for use in risk analysis...|$|R

50|$|The Kingman explosion, {{also known}} as the Doxol {{disaster}} or Kingman <b>BLEVE,</b> was a catastrophic boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (<b>BLEVE)</b> that occurred on July 5, 1973 in Kingman, Arizona.|$|E
50|$|A <b>BLEVE</b> {{need not}} be a {{chemical}} explosion—nor does there need to be a fire—however if a flammable substance is subject to a <b>BLEVE</b> it may also be subject to intense heating, either from an external source of heat which may have caused the vessel to rupture in the first place or from an internal source of localized heating such as skin friction. This heating can cause a flammable substance to ignite, adding a secondary explosion caused by the primary <b>BLEVE.</b> While blast effects of any <b>BLEVE</b> can be devastating, a flammable substance such as propane can add significantly to the danger.|$|E
40|$|Modern furnace designs often {{incorporate}} {{extensive use}} of cooled elements to achieve long campaign lives at high operating intensities. However, contact between water and high temperature fluids can result in powerful Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosions (<b>BLEVEs).</b> Therefore cooling such elements with water carries inherent risks when used under slag and particularly below molten metal or matte. Alternative cooling media exist that can reduce or eliminate the risk of <b>BLEVEs.</b> These media are analysed and discussed {{in the context of}} deeply cooled furnace elements. Important factors in selecting alternative coolants are explored including: critical heat flux, thermal limits, toxicity, flammability, unit cost, etc. Key cooling system design criteria are reviewed in the context of both traditional and alternative coolants. Results of Computational Fluid Dynamics are presented for an example tap-block cooler design using a number of selected coolants. Research needs to advance the safe use of alternative coolants are presented...|$|R

50|$|While {{the term}} <b>BLEVE</b> {{is most often}} used to {{describe}} the results of a container of flammable liquid rupturing due to fire, a <b>BLEVE</b> can occur even with a non-flammable substance such as water, liquid nitrogen, liquid helium or other refrigerants or cryogens, and therefore is not usually considered a type of chemical explosion.|$|E
40|$|Even though <b>BLEVEs</b> {{have been}} studied {{by a number of}} authors, there are still {{significant}} gaps in their knowledge and in the prediction of their physical effects. Diverse methodologies have been proposed to calculate the peak overpressure of the explosion, but their results sh ow an important scattering.

40|$|Fire {{is often}} {{considered}} {{as the most}} hazardous accidental event which may affect safety in the chemical industries. The fire damage may be thermal or non thermal. As examples, the fire plume may transport a variety of toxic effluents, which may injure {{the staff of the}} industrial premises and the fire fighters, as well as the inhabitants in the neighbourhood. Intense radiation produced by big fires may cause serious burn injuries and generate "domino effects" to previously non affected equipment in the vicinity and result in related phenomena such as jetfires, fireballs, <b>BLEVEs</b> 1. Moreover, polluted extinction waters while unconfined may greatly affect the aquatic environment.

50|$|The Feyzin {{disaster}} was {{the worst}} accident which had occurred in petroleum and petrochemical plants in Western Europe, prior to the Flixborough disaster in 1974. Since then, many pressurised tanks containing liquefied gases have BLEVE'd. The hazards are now better understood and storage spheres are protected from fire engulfment by better design. However, so many firemen and emergency servicemen have been killed while trying to control large fires that the cautious philosophy is to evacuate and take shelter until the material burns itself out. <b>BLEVE's</b> produce intense thermal radiation from the fireball. This and blast damage from the bursting pressure vessel are relatively localised compared with unconfined vapour cloud explosions. Therefore, evacuation of up to 0.5 km will usually {{ensure the safety of}} people. Burning hydrocarbon storage vessels are very spectacular but unpredictable.

50|$|<b>BLEVEs</b> can {{be caused}} by an {{external}} fire near the storage vessel causing heating of the contents and pressure build-up. While tanks are often designed to withstand great pressure, constant heating can cause the metal to weaken and eventually fail. If the tank is being heated in an area where there is no liquid, it may rupture faster without the liquid to absorb the heat. Gas containers are usually equipped with relief valves that vent off excess pressure, but the tank can still fail if the pressure is not released quickly enough. Relief valves are sized to release pressure fast enough to prevent the pressure from increasing beyond the strength of the vessel, but not so fast as to be the cause of an explosion. An appropriately sized relief valve will allow the liquid inside to boil slowly, maintaining a constant pressure in the vessel until all the liquid has boiled and the vessel empties.|$|R
40|$|The domino {{sequences}} {{found in}} major accidents have been analyzed {{for a large}} set of cases (330); the first event triggering the domino effect was an explosion or a fire, both with approximately the same contribution; the same proportion has been found when all domino effect steps were considered. Although fire effects usually reach a distance much shorter than those of an explosion, as fire is the most frequent major accident it is often found {{as the first step}} of domino sequences. This is especially true in the case of <b>BLEVEs.</b> Both in fixed plants and in the transportation of hazardous materials, {{in the event of a}} fire, if flames affect a vessel and the fireproofing layer has been damaged, a BLEW can occur at any moment 127 BLEW accidents involving domino effect have been analyzed. It has been found that fire is significantly more frequent than explosion, both in triggering the domino effect sequence and in intermediate steps. The time to failure can range from 1 min or even less up to several hours, an aspect that should be very important for the management of the emergency.

5000|$|A boiling liquid {{expanding}} vapor explosion (<b>BLEVE,</b> [...] ) is {{an explosion}} {{caused by the}} rupture of a vessel containing a pressurized liquid above its boiling point.|$|E
50|$|Typically, a <b>BLEVE</b> {{starts with}} a {{container}} of liquid which is held above its normal, atmospheric-pressure boiling temperature. Many substances normally stored as liquids, such as CO2, propane, and other similar industrial gases have boiling temperatures, at atmospheric pressure, far below room temperature. In the case of water, a <b>BLEVE</b> could occur if a pressurized chamber of water is heated far beyond the standard 100 C. That container, because the boiling water pressurizes it, is capable of holding liquid water at very high temperatures.|$|E
50|$|At 5:40 a.m., {{the cloud}} reached the flare and ignited, {{resulting}} in a vapor cloud explosion that severely damaged the tank farm and resulted in a massive conflagration fed by the LPG leaking from newly damaged tanks. Just four minutes later, at 5:44 a.m., the first tank underwent a <b>BLEVE</b> (Boiling Liquid/Expanding Vapor Explosion). Over the next hour, 12 separate <b>BLEVE</b> explosions were recorded. The fire and smaller explosions continued until 10 a.m. the next morning. It is believed that the escalation was caused by an ineffective gas detection system.|$|E
