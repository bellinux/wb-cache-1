The earliest mentions of cricket in Ireland, Scotland and Wales occur even later in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg {{also became}} {{an expert in}} dealing with noted Berkeley {{physicist}} Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation, and often answered a junior man's question <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.|$|E
5|$|The campaign's {{ultimate}} limitation was {{the poor}} formulation of military strategy. The types of targets selected from one operation {{to the next}} differed radically and no sustained pressure was put on any one type of British target. The Luftwaffes strategy became increasingly aimless. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> begun.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Sinclair {{broke the}} record of most goals scored in the Olympics for women's soccer, {{claiming}} the golden boot of the competition from two goals against South Africa, one against Great Britain, and three against the United States. She scored a hat-trick in a 4–3 extra time loss in the semifinal match against the American squad. Canada was unhappy {{with the performance of}} referee Christina Pedersen, who made a series of controversial decisions in favour of the Americans. Sinclair was ultimately fined a reported $3,500 and banned four matches for post match comments, which accused Pedersen of bias and deciding the result of the match <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> kicked off.|$|E

5|$|In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under Gustaf Otto Stenbock put to sea, but sailed {{no further}} than Stora Karlsö off Gotland <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to turn back to Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, {{and the loss of}} vital equipment. Stenbock, held {{personally}} responsible for the failure by King Charles XI, was forced to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, who attempted to put to sea in January to February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet Union, {{both the}} Germans and the Soviets spent {{the spring and}} early summer of 1943 {{preparing}} for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences and, {{for the first time in}} the war, Hitler cancelled the operation <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> achieved tactical or operational success. This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month. Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40,000 people.|$|E

However, the series was allowed to be different in tone to the planned Phase II, for the feature films that had come <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> changed the audience expectations of what Star Trek was. It was originally proposed in Gerrold's The Worlds of Star Trek to have the second-in-command leading the away team, and it was anticipated that this would be included in Phase II – it was instead first introduced in The Next Generation.|$|E

5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} delays that {{affected}} {{the development and}} deployment of the CF-100 could also affect its successor, {{and the fact that}} the Soviets were working on newer jet-powered bombers that would render the CF-100 ineffective, the RCAF began looking for a supersonic, missile-armed replacement for the Canuck even <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> entered service. In March 1952, the RCAF's Final Report of the All-Weather Interceptor Requirements Team was submitted to Avro Canada.|$|E
5|$|The MTB had {{withdrawn}} {{out of range}} at about 01:30, but not <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> suffered engine damage; a bullet had disabled the starboard engine. After 10 minutes it moved back inshore hoping to pick up any survivors. It was again located by the Germans at about 02:30. The MTB was forced to withdraw once again under increasingly heavy mortar and machine gun fire. Unable to locate any survivors, it recrossed the German minefield and arrived back in Portsmouth at 10:00.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a matter}} of weeks, the brigade, {{as part of the}} 2nd New Zealand Division, was in Greece and manning defences on the Aliakmon Line in {{preparation}} for the anticipated invasion of the country by the Germans.

The brigade was eventually evacuated on the night of 24 April to Crete.|$|E

5|$|Having {{failed to}} defeat the RAF, the Luftwaffe adopted a {{different}} and clearer strategy of strategic bombing known as The Blitz. However, as with the campaign against the RAF, the types of targets differed radically and no sustained pressure was put under any one type of British target. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> even begun. The end result of the air campaign against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war. As Hitler committed Germany to ever increasing military adventures, the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched {{and was unable to}} cope with a multi-front war. By 1944, the Allies were ready to launch Operation Overlord, the invasion of Western Europe. The Battle of Britain ensured that the Western Allies had a base from which to launch the campaign and {{that there would be a}} Western Allied presence on the battlefield to meet the Soviet Red Army in central Europe at the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1578, Elizabeth I {{granted a}} patent to Humphrey Gilbert for {{discovery}} and overseas exploration. That year, Gilbert sailed for the Caribbean {{with the intention}} of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America, but the expedition was aborted <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> crossed the Atlantic. In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt, on this occasion to the island of Newfoundland whose harbour he formally claimed for England, although no settlers were left behind. Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Walter Raleigh, who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584. Later that year, Raleigh founded the Roanoke Colony on the coast of present-day North Carolina, but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Yamaha {{introduced}} a new square-four cylinder bike, similar to Suzuki's RG500. Roberts raced to a second-place finish behind Marco Luchinelli at the non-championship Imola 200 race. Roberts' bike had a suspension failure in the Grand Prix season opener at Austria, but he rebounded to win the next two races in Germany and Italy. Roberts' title hopes suffered a setback at the Dutch TT at Assen when his Yamaha's front brake pads were installed incorrectly causing his front wheel to lock up on the starting line, ending his race <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> started. He came back to score a second place behind Lucchinelli in Belgium, but was once again struck by misfortune when {{a bad case of}} food poisoning forced him to miss the San Marino Grand Prix. He then narrowly lost the British Grand Prix to Jack Middelburg by three-tenths of a second before ending his season with a seventh place in Finland and a retirement in Sweden. Suzuki team riders Mamola and Lucchinelli battled to the final race of the season before the Italian claimed the championship with a total of five Grand Prix victories, with Mamola finishing in second and Roberts in third place.|$|E

5|$|It is {{commonly}} and erroneously, {{believed that a}} Sejm was first disrupted by the liberum veto by a Trakai deputy, Władysław Siciński, in 1652. In reality, he vetoed only {{the continuation of the}} Sejm's deliberations beyond the statutory time limit. He had, however, set up a dangerous precedent. Over the proceedings of the next few sejms, the veto was still occasionally overruled, but it became gradually more accepted. Before 20 years had passed, in 1669 in Kraków, the entire Sejm was prematurely disrupted on the strength of the liberum veto <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> finished its deliberations by the Kiev deputy, Adam Olizar. The practice spiraled out of control, and in 1688, the Sejm was dissolved even before the proceedings had begun or the Marshal of the Sejm was elected.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the prison}} {{business}} was run by a debtors' committee of nine prisoners and a chair (a position held by Dickens' father). Appointed on the last Wednesday of each month, and meeting every Monday at 11am, the committee was responsible for imposing fines for rules violations, an obligation they met with enthusiasm. Debtors could be fined for theft; throwing water or filth out of windows or into someone else's room; making noise after midnight; cursing, fighting or singing obscene songs; smoking in the beer room from 8–10 am and 12–2 pm; defacing the staircase; dirtying the privy seats; stealing newspapers or utensils from the snuggery; urinating in the yard; drawing water <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> boiled; and criticizing the committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{finished}} castle {{was initially}} equipped with 28 brass and iron artillery guns and a garrison of 28 men, commanded by a captain. It {{may have seen}} service in 1545 when a French fleet attacked the coast, but its operational value was short lived. The Camber and the surrounding harbours began to silt up, becoming unusable by shipping, and the coastline receded away from the fort, eventually placing it well in-land. Furthermore, the fort had been superseded by newer European military designs even <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been completed, and peace with France later in the century removed much of the requirement for the fort. The castle still remained operational up until 1637, when it was closed by King Charles I. With the outbreak of civil war in 1642, much of the fortification was dismantled by Parliamentary forces to prevent it {{being used by the}} Royalists.|$|E
