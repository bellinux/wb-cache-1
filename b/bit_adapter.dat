40|$|Excessive {{application}} of swine manure on agricultural lands {{is likely to}} increase water pollution. Potential impacts of swine manure management on bacterial contamination in subsurface drainage are often difficult to assess in the field. In this study, leachate from intact 20 –cm (8 –in.) diameter, 30 –cm (12 –in.) long soil columns receiving simulated fall and spring manure applications at 168 kg N/ha (150 lb N/ac) and 336 kg N/ha (300 lb N/ac) was analyzed for bacterial densities. The fall soil columns were frozen for 7 weeks between manure application and irrigation. Soil columns were collected in sterile galvanized tubing using a Giddings probe and 20 –cm <b>bit</b> <b>adapter.</b> Fecal coliform, E. coli, and enterococci densities in leachate from the columns were determined for four weekly irrigation events following manure application. While a positive trend between the manure application rate and bacterial densities in the leachate water was observed, this effect was not generally statistically significant at the 10 % level. However, an interaction between the application rate and timing was observed, suggesting that an increase in application rate is more likely to cause greater bacterial contamination in subsurface drainage for spring application than for fall application. Bacterial densities in leachate were most often significantly higher where manure had been applied in the spring at 336 kg N/ha, versus the other manure treatments. Additionally, less bacterial leaching was observed in fall manure–applied columns as compared to the spring manure–applied columns. Bacterial densities in leachate from fall manure–applied soil columns were significantly lower in comparison with bacterial densities in leachate from the spring manure–applied soil columns at the 10 % level during the second, third, and fourth irrigation events...|$|E

5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of power {{screwdrivers}} range from a simple 'stick'-type with batteries, a motor, and a tip holder all inline, to powerful [...] "pistol" [...] type VSR (variable-speed reversible) Cordless drills that also function as screwdrivers. This is particularly useful as drilling a pilot hole before driving a screw is a common operation. Special combination drill-driver <b>bits</b> and <b>adapters</b> let an operator rapidly alternate between the two. Variations include impact drivers, which provide two types of 'hammering' force for improved performance in certain situations, and [...] "right-angle" [...] drivers for use in tight spaces. Many options and enhancements, such as built-in bubble levels, high/low gear selection, magnetic screw holders, adjustable-torque clutches, keyless chucks, 'gyroscopic' control, etc., are available.|$|R
40|$|Most demand {{assignment}} {{time division}} multiple access (TDMA) satellite access protocols use centralizedcontrol access schemes, rather than distributed ones, because their simplicity and robustness usually compensates for the longer allocation delay. Starting from the fifo ordered demand assignment/information <b>bit</b> energy <b>adapter</b> (FODA/IBEA) centralized-control protocol, we studied two distributed-control protocols, named distributed allocation with request in fixed slots (DRIFS) and faded environments effective distributed engineering redundant signalling (FEEDERS) respectively, for accessing a geostationary satellite channel. Multimedia traffic and faded environments were considered {{in the study of}} both access schemes. This paper presents the DRIFS proposal, together with the recovery procedures from critical events, the handling of which is central to the discussion of a distributed satellite access protocol. Probabilities of such events are also estimated...|$|R

Both protocols derive from the Fifo Ordered Demand Assignment/Information <b>Bit</b> Energy <b>Adapter</b> (FODA/IBEA) centralized-control system and have the same features. The distributed technique to compute the capacity allocation adopted by FEEDERS improves some performance in FODA/IBEA, but raises a problem about system stability. Techniques to solve this problem are presented, together with system performance. A comparison is also made with the FODA/IBEA system...|$|R
50|$|A rundown fixture, {{also known}} as a joint simulator, is used during the {{calibration}} process to help test power tools (electric screwdrivers, air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, nutrunners, etc.). A joint simulator is placed on top of the transducers. An <b>adapter</b> <b>bit</b> is inserted into the power tool and is mated to top of the joint simulator. By using springs of different stiffness or stacking Belleville washers in set patterns, the joint simulator can replicate soft, medium, or hard joints. This is important when trying to repeat how a tool may be used on an actual process.|$|R
