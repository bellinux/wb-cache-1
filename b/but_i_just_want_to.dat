And you will tell your children of the Idea we fought and died for--teach them it must be lived for as well as died for, else the price paid for it will have been given for nought.

6000|$|... "I cannot {{even allow}} that," [...] she objected. [...] "The advantage, {{if there was}} any, rested on the other side. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> you to {{remember}} what we were told in that first wonderful outpouring of fabricated news--that the naval supremacy of England was gone for ever, that {{the freedom of the}} seas was assured, that German merchant vessels were steaming home from all directions!

6000|$|... "It {{was only}} {{to tell you how}} I loved you. I always loved you. From the first I was a {{different}} man when I was with you. But of course it was absurd, I knew that well enough.

5000|$|I {{think it}} was, [...] "How do {{we keep the}} urgency and the {{excitement}} of what Thursday's doing?", which to me {{has always been a}} chemistry kind of thing, like the way the band fits together and pops into place and stuff. How do we do that but make it more multi-dimensional? We didn't focus at all. We put anything we were mildly interested in there and said, [...] "Let's juxtapose this into the mix." [...] So we ended up with big sort of ballads that were almost like U2 and some grindcore stuff and some really blasty, screamy shit, and other stuff...I would love to leave some sort of legacy. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get to a place where we're not living or dying by the trends. There's a few bands in every genre that don't leave the genre, don't say [...] "we're not doing this anymore" [...] but kind of outlast it. I would really like to be the Sonic Youthof our scene. That would be really rad. Geoff Rickly ...|$|E
5000|$|Dabney Coleman later recalled:I {{thought it}} was a great idea. I didn’t get along with the {{director}} Franklin. He's since passed on, but he was… Well, I won’t say that. But it was great working with that little kid. Henry Thomas. What a great kid. And a great actor. I’ll tell you, though, it's amazing how many people have come up to me and said something to me about that film, including Timothy Bottoms... So Timothy came up to my table at Dan Tana's, where I was, uh, kind of a regular... Timothy says, [...] "You don’t know me from veal parmesan, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> thank you for playing Jack Flack. You don’t know what that movie means to my son and me." [...] That happens to me two or three times a year. It's always either a father saying, [...] "I saw that movie with my son," [...] or a son saying, [...] "I saw it with my dad." [...] But then they say, [...] "Seeing that movie was very important in my life." [...] And that's always very nice to hear.|$|E
5000|$|I don’t {{want to be}} {{qualified}} as a female singer. I {{just want to be}} a singer. And I don’t think you should {{be qualified}} by your gender. That’s always bullshit. And unfortunately, it’s probably not going to change in my lifetime. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be considered a good lyricist and a good singer, not a “girl” singer or a “girl” lyricist. That’s not relevant. Just evaluate me on my music and my lyrics and I'll be happy. Gretchen Seager DeSantis recalled:So many of the stories that women were able to tell in ROCKRGRL were stories they weren’t able to tell in any place else. What was different about ROCKRGRL was {{that a lot of the}} artists we talked to had cautionary tales. My favorite artists to talk to are the ones who can talk honestly about what happened. They were dropped by their label - why did that happen? Bands broke up, why did that happen? In ROCKRGRL, what I was looking for were career arcs and career stories - how people got started, what their career was like, how it went for them, and what unusual things they did to be successful.|$|E
500|$|I {{started writing}} what I felt was Bat Out of Hell part 2, {{definitely}} like The Godfather part I and part 2, that's how I saw it. I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to see if I could make a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What I {{want you}} for is this, Mat. There {{is a friend}} of mine just come from New York.

I want to arrange that he shan't be there, you understand; I don't <b>want</b> him killed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> him to have a hint that he had better not meddle with other people's business--a hint, you know, strong enough to lay him up for three weeks or a month; and I should not mind paying twenty dollars to the man who gives him the hint.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Flanagan {{said she}} [...] "disliked" [...] playing Rosie. Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Flanagan commented: [...] "When I'm acting, I like things to feel real, and I didn't like Rosie's bitchiness. I didn't enjoy playing {{that kind of}} character. She went through a phase of being such a catty girl. As an actress you {{do the best job}} you can, but I didn't enjoy it because it didn't feel real. I always said to myself that I was going to leave when I turned 21. For me, the show {{represents}} my childhood, and I just couldn't have properly become an adult if I hadn't left. I'm so grateful for the opportunities Corrie has given me, but I was in a bubble and the time is right for me to go. It finally feels as though I've left my childhood behind. People keep asking me what I'm going to do next, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> enjoy being me and live for the moment for a while. I've been on Corrie since I was 10. It hasn't just been my job, it's been my whole life." [...] Flanagan added that she wanted to play a [...] "completely different character, such as a role in Downton Abbey or Juliet in Romeo and Juliet".|$|E
5000|$|I'd like {{somebody}} {{to mention that}} day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to give his life serving others.

I want you {{to be able to say}} that day that I did try to feed the hungry. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were naked. I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison. And I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major. Say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter. I won't have any money to leave behind.

40|$|I {{begin this}} {{paper with a}} very Australian media parable about a man called I will call X. This story {{illustrates}} my theme of how the media can manipulate, or at least attempt to manipulate public opinion on crime and criminal justice matters. 1 I then move to a discussion on {{the courts and the}} media, and finally some suggestions on {{what can be done to}} alleviate the current problems. The tale begins simply enough, with a report in our local Queensland (Australia) newspaper, the Murdoch owned Courier Mail, on May 28 2007 that a local radio announcer X had been violently attacked 2 ̆ 2 bashed 2 ̆ 2 overnight in Brisbane 2 ̆ 7 s CBD. His injuries were said to be a broken nose, cracked cheekbone, and fractured skull. Although released from intensive care, he remained in hospital. A message from his radio station asked for privacy during his recuperation. All that was known at that stage therefore was that he had sustained head injuries in some sort of altercation. The next day, May 29, the Courier Mail reported an interview with X where he said 2 ̆ 2 I have no recollection of it, and I just want to know why? 2 ̆ 2. The report stated that he had been found in the street by a passerby and taken to hospital where he was heavily sedated. He is also reported to have said 2 ̆ 2 I love this city and I 2 ̆ 7 ve always felt safe, yet from what I have heard today about the number of incidents, it 2 ̆ 7 s not good. From now on, when I go out I will think more about where and what I am doing and have my wits about me 2 ̆ 2. And further in the story: 2 ̆ 2 I don 2 ̆ 7 t want to talk about what sort of people they are, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know what was going through their head. I am just lucky it 2 ̆ 7 s not more serious. I was feeling sorry for myself early this morning and then you realise you didn 2 ̆ 7 t lose your life and how lucky you are 2 ̆ 2. Brisbane 2 ̆ 7 s Lord Mayor was reported as saying that the attack on X was a 2 ̆ 2 horrifying situation 2 ̆ 2, but that safety in the city had improved in recent years. It is relevant at this point to note that the Courier Mail had been leading a campaign to have the defence of accident reviewed, after several high profile cases where accused persons have been acquitted by a jury of homicide charges after killing people in street attacks, and relying on the accident defence in that the deaths were not foreseeable, given the nature of the attack...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the release}} of Mac Miller's second studio album Watching Movies with the Sound Off, Miller began {{recording}} material under a new character named Delusional Thomas. On November 1, 2013, Miller released a previous unannounced mixtape named Delusional Thomas, introducing the new character. The mixtape was produced by Miller under his production alias' Larry Fisherman and features him rapping in a distorted pitched up voice. He explained the voice choice saying, [...] "to {{me it was a}} character and I wanted to give his whole own complete, like, everything. There was part of me that wanted to do my own voice, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> it to be its own complete character. And I feel like that evil voice inside your head is always kind of in that pitch." ...|$|R
5000|$|I drive Coty {{a little}} bit crazy, because it's always not {{signature}} enough. I go back and say things like, 'Can we push the sandalwood {{a little bit}} more, can we make a tiny bit more sexy?' To translate that into actual chemistry is a difficult thing. Then they go back and say, 'What does she mean by sexy?' And I'm like, 'You know if you take that little piece that smells {{a little bit like}} wood but has a little bit of musk? <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> you to {{add a little bit of}} sweetness. Can you do that for me?' And then I think we are in the right direction. And then they come with one or two variations and I say, 'No, that's not it.' It's a long process.|$|R
5000|$|Van Houten {{has stated}} that Hollywood makes her unhappy: [...] "I have seen Hollywood, and {{although}} I have nothing against it, it's not my kind of life.

2500|$|Lyrically, Live Through This was {{markedly}} less frenetic than Pretty on the Inside, {{and reflected}} Love's tumultuous life between 1991 and 1994, though Love stated {{that she felt}} the record was [...] "not as personal" [...] as the band's former work: [...] "You know, when women say, [...] "Well, I play music, and it's cathartic," [...] that applies to me to a degree, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to write a good rock record. I would love to write a couple of great rock songs in my life, like Chrissie Hynde did. If you write something [...] that will transcend {{a long period of}} time and make people feel a certain way, there's really nothing like that." [...] The lyrics present on the album deal heavily with themes of motherhood, depression, body image, child abuse, and elitism, and includes recurring motifs of milk, pregnancy, and suicide.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Fairfield, New South Wales, Suli is of Tongan {{descent and}} played his junior rugby league for Fairfield United. He was then {{signed by the}} Wests Tigers.

2500|$|Speaking to Billboard {{magazine}} {{she said}} [...] "I think the fans {{have been very}} patient with me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to make sure that}} this album was right – the right type of music, the right core. I feel like we're getting to that point where I felt comfortable with putting something out." [...] Speaking of the types of records she was making, in a separate interview with Rap-Up, Norwood compared her album to previous records. [...] "It’s just gonna be a different album, but of course expressing the love that I feel now and the struggles and different situations that I’ve gone through in the past,... My music always tends to be the soundtrack to my life and definitely inspired by what I see other people go through as well—gritty, edgy, different." [...] Then touching the subject matter of songs on the album, Norwood said she felt like the past failures in her life should be addressed, ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, he {{made his}} {{narrative}} feature film debut with Too Young to Die, based on the real-life story of Park Chi-gyu and Lee Sun-ye, {{a man and woman}} who fell in love in their early seventies then rediscovered sex. It became controversial for its sensitive yet honest depiction of sex between the elderly couple (who played themselves), and was initially banned from release by the Korea Media Rating Board. Park said, [...] "I wanted to break the preconception about the elderly. Even if the body ages, desire for sex and thirst for love do not fade away. I wanted to capture the [...] "moment of love," [...] and the audience accepted it as a cinematic expression of pure love. Some sees the (seven-minute sex) scene as a challenging of taboos, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to deliver a love story." [...] Too Young to Die drew praise domestically and internationally, and was invited to various film festivals, including Critics' Week at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.|$|R
5000|$|Stewart related that {{midway through}} filming, Wayne {{asked him why}} he, Stewart, never {{seemed to be the}} target of Ford's venomous remarks.

Then, toward the end of filming, Ford asked Stewart what he thought of Strode's costume for the film's beginning and end, when the actors were playing their parts 25 years older. Stewart replied, [...] "It looks a bit Uncle Remussy to me." [...] Ford responded, [...] "What's wrong with Uncle Remus?" [...] He called for the crew's attention and announced, [...] "One of our players doesn't like Woody's costume.

5000|$|His {{creative}} process consists of him working {{alone in his}} room with his guitar and adding other instruments later.
