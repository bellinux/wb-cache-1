40|$|DB, the Wrst blindsight case to {{be tested}} {{extensively}} (Weiskrantz, 1986) has demonstrated the ability to detect and discriminate a range of visual stimuli presented within his perimetrically blind visual Weld defect. In a temporal two alternative forced choice (2 AFC) detection experiment we have investigated the limits of DB’s detection ability within his Weld defect. <b>Blind</b> <b>Weld</b> performance was compared to his sighted Weld performance and to an age-matched control group (n D 6). DB reliably detected {{the presence of a}} small (2 °), low contrast (7 %), 4. 6 c/ ° Gabor patch with the same space-averaged luminance as the background presented within his <b>blind</b> <b>Weld</b> but performed at chance levels at the same eccentricity (11. 3 °) within his sighted Weld. Investigation of detection as a function of stimulus contrast revealed DB’s ability to detect the presence of an 8 % contrast stimulus within his <b>blind</b> <b>Weld,</b> compared to 12 % in his sighted Weld. No signiWcant diVerence in detection performance between DB’s sighted Weld and the performance of six age-matched control participants suggests poor sighted Weld performance does not account for the results. Monocular testing also rules out diVerences between the eyes as an explanation, suggesting that DB demonstrates superior detection for certain stimuli within his visual Weld defect compared to normal vision...|$|E
40|$|Damage to {{the optic}} {{radiation}} or the occipital cortex results in {{loss of vision}} in the contralateral visual Weld, termed partial cortical blindness or hemianopia. Previously, we have demonstrated that stimulation in the Weld defect using visual stimuli with optimal properties for blindsight detection can lead to increases in visual sensitivity within the <b>blind</b> <b>Weld</b> {{of a group of}} patients. The present study was aimed to extend the previous work by investigating the eVect of positive feedback on recovery of visual sensitivity. Patients’ abilities for detection of a range of spatial frequencies within their Weld defect were determined using a temporal two-alternative forced-choice technique, before and after a period of visual training (n = 4). Patients underwent Neuro-Eye Therapy which involved detection of temporally modulated spatial grating patches at speciWc retinal locations within their Weld defect. Three patients showed improved detection ability following visual training. Based on our previous studies, we had hypothesised that should the occipital brain lesion extend anteriorly to the thalamus, little recovery would be expected. Here, we describe one such case who showed no improvements after extensive training. The present study provides further evidence that recovery (a) can be gradual and may require a large number of training sessions (b) can be accelerated using positive feedback and (c) may be less likely to take place if the occipital damage extends anteriorly to the thalamus...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} a novel technique for {{the determination of}} the fusion state of laser <b>welded</b> <b>blind</b> joints (e. g. overlap joints) by measuring the vibrations of the workpiece during the welding process. In case of incomplete fusion, the workpiece vibrations differ significantly from the vibrations observed during a sound weld. The detection of the vibrations is performed by observing a speckle pattern on the workpiece surface. The movement of this pattern allows remote detection of the workpiece oscillations close to the keyhole. Those oscillations contain information on the fusion state of the weld...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) {{forward and}} aft skirts were {{designed}} with fracture control considerations {{used in the}} design data. Fracture control is based on reliance upon nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques to detect potentially critical flaws. In the aerospace industry, welds on aluminum in the thicknesses (0. 500 to 1. 375 in.) such as those encountered on the SRB skirts are normally welded from both sides to minimize distortion. This presents {{a problem with the}} potential presence of undefined areas of incomplete fusion and the inability to detect these potential flaws by NDE techniques. To eliminate the possibility of an undetectable defect, weld joint design was revised to eliminate <b>blind</b> root penetrations. <b>Weld</b> parameters and mechanical property data were developed to verify the adequacy of the new joint design...|$|R
