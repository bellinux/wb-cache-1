Analysis of the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> funds in the country’s crane sector is presented. Special attention is paid to the structure of the cranes park and crane utilization efficiency. In the analysis of <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> funds, the factors that impede the efficiency of production funds were established as follows: the greatest negative impact on <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> funds efficiency of businesses was in small tower crane fleet; a small range of tower cranes in the park is reducing the technical possibilities of the lease. Basing on the analysis and observation of tower cranes installation and dismantling, the poor supply of the parts for the work place, lack of competence and motivation of the support staff have been ascertained. After elimination of these factors it is possible to raise the efficiency of the main production funds. Article in Lithuania...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Objectives The aim of {{the study}} is to develop a system of {{indicators}} that allow the level of intensity and extensiveness of using the active part of the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets of a construction firm to be determined, and available reserves to be assessed in order to provide their further effective use in the production process. Method During the research, both the methods of estimating the level of intensive and extensive exploitation of the active part of <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets and the Lagrange multi-parameter optimisation method were used. Results A solution of the relevant issue is proposed, connected with the intensive development of the construction company in the current market conditions based on the optimal use of the reserves of the active part of <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets. A system of indicators is developed for estimating the reserves of the active part of <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets and a methodology is proposed for their optimal distribution between objects that are simultaneously under construction, according to the criterion for obtaining maximum profit. Conclusion The revealed reserves of the active part of <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets should be taken into account when planning all types of production and economic activities of a construction firm. This allows the formation of plans to be the scientific validated, contributing to increasing efficiency and the use of available resources in the production process to be minimised. In this case, it is necessary during the planning process to ensure the optimal use of available reserves using the criterion of maximising the profit received by the construction firm. The tools proposed in the work allow us to evaluate and effectively use the construction company's existing reserves of various types of active part of <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets and, on this basis, increase the efficiency of construction production.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{the problem}} of {{sustainable}} development of enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex has not only military, but economic importance. The article provides {{an analysis of the}} availability, scope, composition and structure of the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets of JSC "Concern "Sozvezdie" for 2013 - 2015, and analysis of efficiency of use of the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets in JSC "Concern "Sozvezdie" for 2013 - 2015. JSC "Concern "Sozvezdie" JSC approved the program of innovative development and technological modernization, the development objective of which is the proved choice of the list and content of activities, the implementation of which should ensure the development of the Concern as a scientific and industrial socio-economic system – a holistic entity. Assessment of the dynamics of the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets has shown that the security of JSC "Concern "Sozvezdie" OPF for 2013 - 2015 increased by 89, 81 %. The degree of updating of production assets during the period was 50. 7 %. The analysis of the efficiency of the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets in JSC "Concern "Sozvezdie" has shown that for every 1 % increase in revenue major funds have grown by 0. 65 %. The rate of fondamenti decreased by 18. 2 %. The assessment of efficiency of use of the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> assets of JSC "Concern "Sozvezdie" shows that the total technical re-equipment of scientific and technological, testing and production and technological base of the enterprises of the Concern is directed on creation of production capacities to ensure serial production of advanced weapons, military and special equipment in the framework of the state defense order, as the main activity {{of the majority of the}} companies of the Group, and reconstruction, the expansion and creation of production to the production of innovative civilian products...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{that one of}} the indices for planning and evaluating the economic activity of enterprises and construction should be an index of the utilization of production funds. This should be used with indices of volume and profitableness. In the beginning a planned normative index of utilization of the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> funds could be worked out according to types of production in the framework of the given economic administrative region; it should be differentiated for each enterprise of the extracive industry, the building materials industry and industries with a small assortment of products. Taking the oil industry of our economic region as an example, behind the index of overfulfillment of the plan for extraction and output per worker there is concealed the retarded transfer of capital investments, into the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> funds. Proceeding from the established norms of amortization â 10 % per annum (together with capital repairs) â and the expenses of amortization amounting to 20 rubles per planned cost of one ton of oil, the output of oil (together with gas) should be five tons per every thousand rubles of <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> funds of the Oil and Gas Industry Administration of the Krasnodar Economic Council. Actually in 1957 the output of the <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> funds per thousand rubles was 3. 1 tons. Though it was 18 % higher than in 1955, now it is only 64 % of the level which is necessary for replacement of the capital expenditures actually made. ...|$|R

But the activator concentration may fail to form spatial patterns if the system does not have a positive <b>basic</b> <b>production</b> term for the activator.
