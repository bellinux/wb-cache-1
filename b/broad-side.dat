The captain knew his vessel, however, and did not let her lose her way, making everything draw again as it might be by instinct. The proas tacked, too, and, laying up much nearer to the wind than we did, appeared as if about to close on our lee-bow.

6000|$|... [Footnote 2: There is a {{touching}} incident {{connected with the}} fortunes of two young officers of the navy, that is not generally known. When the Essex frigate was captured in the Pacific, by the Phoebe and Cherub, two of the officers of the former were left in the ship, {{in order to make}} certain affidavits that were necessary to the condemnation. The remainder were paroled and returned to America. After a considerable interval, some uneasiness was felt at the protracted absence of those who had been left in the Essex. On inquiry it was found, that, after accompanying the ship to Rio Janeiro, they had been exchanged, according to agreement, and suffered to go where they pleased. After some delay, they took passage in a Swedish brig bound to Norway, as the only means which offered to get to Europe, whence they intended to return home. About this time great interest was also felt for the sloop Wasp. She had sailed for the mouth of the British Channel, where she fell in with and took the Reindeer, carrying her prisoners into France. Shortly after she had an action with and took the Avon, but was compelled to abandon her prize by others of the enemy's cruisers, one of which (the Castilian) actually came up with her and gave her a <b>broad-side.</b> About twenty days after the latter action she took a merchant-brig, near the Western Islands, and sent her into Philadelphia.

Government ordered inquiries to be made in Sweden for the master of the brig in which they had embarked; he was absent on a long voyage, and a weary period elapsed before he could be found. When this did happen, he was required to give an account of his passengers. By producing his logbook and proper receipts, he proved that he had fallen in with the Wasp, near the line, about a fortnight after she had taken the merchant-brig named, when the young officers in question availed themselves of the occasion to return to their flag.

40|$|During {{the past}} decades, the rapid {{development}} of communication systems has extended to {{every aspect of}} modern technology. To better satisfy the need of people {{to interact with the}} world, investigations into the critical communication components mostly within the Radio-Frequency (RF) range have faced a diverse range of operational requirements and environment. The development of reconfigurable devices conforms to these demands with broader applicability. The resonant circuit, consisting of an inductance and capacitance, is fundamental to the design of passive resonant devices. The adjustment of their inherent inductance or capacitance provides a pathway for frequency reconfiguration. The split ring resonator (SRR) is first introduced to generate negative permeability in artificial materials. The physical geometry of a SRR features a gap in a broken conductive ring, and is characterised as a compact sized resonant circuit due to the effective capacitance and inductance occurring on the gap and ring respectively. The integration of SRRs to RF devices has been widely explored, not just to enhance the performance but also enable reconfiguration in some resonant devices. The concept of tuning the intrinsic capacitance or inductance of the SRR has been realised by the addition of active devices such as diodes and MEMS switches. However, interference to the electromagnetic properties due to the additional components and their bias line networks, and tolerance control on the placement of the controlling element is a serious concern. If tuning is required in array structures such as metamaterials, component count, and bias issues are significantly elevated. The aim of this research is to investigate and conceive pneumatic levitation systems as a mean of changing the structural arrangement of SRRs to reconfigure their resonant frequency or other parameters. Rotation, elevation and lateral movement of the SRRs are realised by implementing pneumatic levitation, and the resulting changes in the transmission response are characterised. The resonant frequency of a SRR is dependent on the orientation of the incident electromagnetic waves. Pneumatic levitation is firstly proposed to allow free rotation of a SRR in the azimuthal plane resulting in continuous resonant frequency variations. The inclusion of another identical SRR located below the spinning SRR forms a <b>broad-side</b> coupled architecture. Depending on whether the static SRR is placed parallel or perpendicular to the electric field, the coupled SRRs can achieve 10 % (2. 66 GHz to 2. 39 GHz) or 12 % (2. 67 GHz to 2. 38 GHz) continuous frequency sweep respectively. The levitation platform which holds the SRR is demonstrated to provide different spinning speed profiles and hence frequency sweep rates for the SRR response based on various platform designs. An advanced pneumatic levitation system is devised to allow discrete on-demand resonant frequency control of <b>broad-side</b> coupled SRRs utilizing the rotation angle and separation of SRRs. The pneumatic structure stops the upper SRR at desired locations to achieve an associated resonant frequency response. The coupled SRRs can realise a 35 % tunable frequency range (3. 236 GHz to 2. 11 GHz) over 180 degrees of rotation. The separation of SRRs, driven by the applied pneumatic pressure, demonstrates a tunable frequency range from 0. 7 % to 11. 3 % depending on the set rotation angle. The horizontal arrangement of SRRs introduces another dimension for structure tuning based on the lateral space between two resonators. A pneumatic levitation system which enables the manipulation of the horizontal placement of a SRR leads to a smooth conversion between edge coupled and <b>broad-side</b> coupled SRRs. The transition affects the mutual capacitance of the structure resulting in changes to the transmission response. A 28 % frequency reduction from 3. 2 GHz results during the transition from edge coupled to <b>broad-side</b> coupled mode if two gaps of the SRRs are initially facing each other. When the gaps are facing outwards at the start, a second resonant frequency appears in the examined band and mirrors the shift of the first resonance in the opposite direction, increasing from 3. 2 GHz. The investigation of the lateral control of a SRR using pneumatic levitation is further explored with the integration of an SRR with a CPW and monopole antenna for proof of concept reconfigurable RF device functionality. The integration of pneumatic systems as an approach to tune the structure of SRRs exhibits tremendous potential for the physical modification of coupled SRRs, and possibly also any small resonant devices or components. Both simulation and experiments has demonstrated the possibilities to manipulate frequency shift between 2. 1 GHz to 3. 24 GHz. Furthermore its key advantages are its non-metallic structure which has minimal impact on the resonant properties and incident field, the near frictionless operation, and the control over the degrees of freedom of structural variation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the design, analysis, and experimental validation of a high-directivity and high coupling microwave directional coupler. The motivating application is in broadband signal routing between cores of multi-core processors, where the delay of simple wire interconnects introduces unacceptable latency. The performance goals include scalability with frequency, a coupling coefficient of 3 dB, directivity larger than 40 dB, high return loss, low insertion loss below 3 dB {{at the center}} frequency, and small footprint. The approach to this problem taken in the thesis {{is a combination of}} edge and <b>broad-side</b> coupling in a multi-layer, multi-conductor microstrip coupled-line system. The two coupling mechanisms between neighboring pairs of coupled lines, along with appropriate end interconnections, allow for reduced size and design that achieves equal propagation velocities for the different modes supported by the five-conductor guiding structure that contribute to coupling. To validate the approach, a coupler designed for operation at 1 GHz is demonstrated to have a isolation of - 22 dB with a coupling coefficient of 3 dB and a return loss of - 20 dB. The coupler is implemented on a FR- 408 substrate with a permittivity of 3. 66 and 1. 17 mm and 0. 17 mm thicknesses, and a total area of 12. 65 cm^ 2. Three metalization layers are used in the design, with edge and <b>broad-side</b> coupled pairs of lines on the top two layers and diagonal end interconnects between the top and bottom lines. The coupler design is then scaled to 3 GHz by shortening the coupled-line length, and established - 24 dB isolation, coupling of 3 dB, return loss of - 20 dB, and has a total area of 6. 9 cm^ 2. The analysis of the coupler shows that full-wave electromagnetic modeling agrees well with measurements and is necessary during the design process, while circuit analysis with built-in coupled-line models shows poorer agreement with experimental data. A tolerance analysis shows that the coupler performance is most sensitive to milling precision and separation between coupled-lines. Based on the measured and simulated results, it is shown that this type of coupler can be further scaled to higher frequencies and on-chip implementations for signal distribution in multi-core processors, or any other application where a number of components need to be interconnected with low latency and no reflection.

40|$|Recent {{research}} results {{have shown that}} the traditional structural testing for delay and crosstalk faults may result in over-testing due to the non-trivial number of such faults that are untestable in the functional mode while testable in the test mode.

The first pattern of a two-pattern test is still delivered by scan in the test mode but the pattern is generated {{in such a way that}} it does not violate the functional constraints extracted from the functional logic.

The various localization systems that were implemented during this PhD include localization of snow avalanches, artillery and supersonic aircraft in the infrasound domain, the localization of helicopters, civilian aircraft, speakers and auditorium reflections in the audio domain and the localization of chirps in the underwater ultrasound domain. The "goniometer" is defined as an instrument that measures angles. An "acoustic goniometer" is therefore a system that measures the direction of arrival (DOA) of sounds, and thus estimates the source direction. A goniometer {{is made up of}} an antenna, composed of several sensors arranged in a particular geometry, and a calculation algorithm. The successive implementations were designed around a common framework, based on a two-step spatio-temporal process. The temporal step tackles the problem of the Time Delay Estimation along the antenna baselines, whereas the second step introduces the antenna geometry, in order to estimate the Direction of Arrival per se. The multi-sources case, as well as the outlier's rejection, is assured by a detection module, which uses the temporal and spatial properties of the propagation model. The performances of the TDE and the localization are studied as a function of every relevant parameter, {{in order to determine the}} optimal antenna to run the two-step process. The antenna design rules concern its geometry, its size and its orientation. The results presented in the applications chapter give a realistic idea of the goniometry capacities. Its performances are largely competitive to those of other techniques. Up to now, the goniometry developed during this work, fulfilled all prior requirements. Moreover, the goniometry appeared to be, in many cases, in advance with regards to technological tools such as the sound pick-up, the CPU implementation or installation constraints. The advice that could be given, when tackling a new antenna design, is firstly to visualize both spatial and temporal properties of the propagating waves and of the perturbating phenomena, and secondly to compare them to the goniometer characteristics. This work has demonstrated that the best performances were achieved for the goniometry of a unique stationary compact source generating broadband low pass signals in a homogenous medium without wind and noise, performed with a wide symmetrical <b>broad-side</b> antenna...|$|E
