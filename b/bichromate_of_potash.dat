All put together, there is in this room about three miles of shelving, completely filled, as you see, with about 22,000 cells or jars. The electricity is generated in these jars. They contain carbon and zinc plates in a solution of <b>bichromate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> and sulphuric acid and water. We fill them up once every two weeks, and renew the plates occasionally. There is a deal of sulphate of copper used up here, sir, in creating electricity--about six tons in the year. Pure copper accumulates on the plates in the operation, but the zinc wears away." ...|$|E

John White I had also purchased Shawfield estate and its policies including Shawfield House and Hayfield, and in the following years the business flourished, particularly in the manufacture of <b>bichromate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash,</b> with their premises expanding over the previously rural estate.|$|E

The global potash market was considered a duopoly between Canpotex and Belarusian Potash Company (BPC), a similar consortium which exported Belarusian (Belaruskali) and Russian potash (Uralkali); until the BPC marketing venture failed in 2013, the two collectively controlled 70% <b>of</b> global <b>potash</b> exports.|$|R
50|$|White {{graduated}} in 1864, {{and worked for}} a year for his uncle's company, Mackenzie & Aitken, accountants, and then {{for a year and}} a half for Leisler, Bock & Co, continental merchants. He then joined his father's business, of which he became a partner in 1867. After his father's death in 1887 White and his cousin William Chrystal became the sole partners in the Shawfield Chemical Works, which was the largest of its kind in the world and employed some 500 men in 1909. The main product was <b>bichromate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash.</b> His nephew H. H. Barrett was later admitted a partner. At Rutherglen he constructed an institute for his workers, with baths, gymnasium and reading rooms, among other facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Chrystal {{was educated}} at The Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University. After {{working in a}} {{laboratory}} in the 1870s he joined J & J White Chemicals as an expert chemist, and after his uncle John died in 1881 he became the technical partner in the business. By this time Chrystal’s cousin John Campbell White, the son of his other uncle James, was also a partner. After the death of James White in 1884, another cousin Hill Hamilton Barrett became the commercial partner. At this time the Shawfield works, mainly producing <b>bichromate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash,</b> were the largest of their kind {{in the world and}} employed over 500 men. Chrystal was credited with improving the manufacturing processes for the products.|$|E

TL was measured before and after beta irradiation in Sr- 90 irradiator to a dose of 25 Gy. A maximum peak at 43. 5 ° was observed in XRD pattern <b>of</b> <b>Potash</b> and the calculated crystallite size reported as 89. 37 nm. The Laser diffraction particle size analyzer given the average particle diameter <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> was 23. 03 µm. TGA <b>of</b> mineral <b>Potash</b> recorded in the temperature range of 1 54 °C- 700 °C. The observed FTIR bands in the range of 4000 – 500 cm have been tentatively assigned.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} compare the response of sunflower cultivar SF- 187 to muriate and sulphate <b>of</b> <b>potash,</b> each at 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg ha - 1. Different sources and levels of K did not significantly affect the plant height, stem diameter, 1000 -achene weight and harvest index. However, leaf area per plant, stalk yield, number of achene head - 1, seed yield and oil contents were affected significantly by K 2 O levels. A significant increase in seed yield and oil contents was observed upto 100 kg ha - 1 but both these parameters were decreased beyond this limit. A decrease of 26 and 20 per cent in seed yield was noted by potassium application {{at the rate of}} 150 kg ha - 1 in the form <b>of</b> sulphate <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> and muriate <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> respectively.

50|$|Belarus has a {{large number}} <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> {{deposits}} - all formed during the Famennian stage of the Late Devonian epoch - with commercial reserves of 10 billion metric tonnes. Three main potash deposits have been explored - Starobin (Старобінскае, Старобинское), Petrikov (Петрыкаўскае, Петриковское) and Oktyabrsky (Акцябрскае, Октябрьское). Sylvinite (potash ore) from these three deposits contains up to 28%, 40% and 39% KCl respectively. Amounts of MgCl2 vary from 0.15-0.3% in Starobin to 1.5-4% in Petrikov and more than 5% in Oktyabrsky. The Starobin deposit has 2.6 billion tonnes of proven reserves (A, B, C1 categories) and 600 million tonnes of prognosed reserves (C2 category) <b>of</b> <b>potash.</b> Reserves at the Petrikov deposit are estimated at 2.12 billion tonnes (C1 and C2 categories) <b>of</b> <b>potash.</b> The Oktyabrsky deposit has 637 million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> (C1 and C2) and 1.1 billion tonnes of carnallite. Only the Starobin deposit is used, but in 2014 construction of the first factory in the Petrikov deposit began. Several smaller, less-explored deposits are known, mainly in Homiel Voblasts and Minsk Voblasts.|$|R
