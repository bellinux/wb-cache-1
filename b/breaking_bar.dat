60|$|Both lads {{ran into}} the cockpit. They were {{on the edge of}} the <b>breaking</b> <b>bar.</b> A huge forty-footer reared a foam-crested head far above them, {{stealing}} their wind for the moment and threatening to crush the tiny craft like an egg-shell. Joe held his breath. It was the supreme moment. French Pete luffed straight into it, and the Dazzler mounted the steep slope with a rush, poised a moment on the giddy summit, and fell into the yawning valley beyond. Keeping off in the intervals to fill the mainsail, and luffing into the combers, they worked their way across the dangerous stretch. Once they caught the tail-end of a whitecap and were well-nigh smothered in the froth, but otherwise the sloop bobbed and ducked with the happy facility of a cork.|$|E

40|$|In industry, the {{predictive}} maintenance {{has become a}} strategic concept. Economic interest of on-line diagnosis of faults in electric machines gave rise to various researches in that field. This paper proposes a local approach to tackle the problem of <b>breaking</b> <b>bars</b> and end-rings of squirrel cage in induction machines based mainly on the signature of the local variables, such as the normal flux density. This allows a finer analysis, by use of a finite element based simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{resulting}} in this report {{is to develop a}} mechanically enhanced <b>breaking</b> <b>bar,</b> or prying bar, for bringing down trees. There was already a prototype to study, which was assembled by welded steel components. A specification of demands took form after continuous technical discussions with the inventor, assignee and mentors. When an analysis of this device and its function was made, the work continued with calculations to establish the foundation to design a mechanical model. Geometrical relationships were established to design the sub-components of the <b>breaking</b> <b>bar</b> and its functions. Simulations regarding material strength and mechanical function were made by the use of different modules in the CAD-software Solid Works and led to a simplified version of the <b>breaking</b> <b>bar.</b> The new simplified version was accepted by the inventor and the drawings for the new tool could now be made. During the time of this work the inventor has prepared his patent request and therefore this work has been classified and considered under secrecy for the inner circle persons containing the Kogertek-employees. The <b>breaking</b> <b>bar</b> which was produced with its powerful gear ratio is amplifying the force from the handle by a factor 25 and lifts 50 mm in the felling cut of the tree. In theory the tool would weigh approximately 1800 grams and can be used to bring down a tree with a diameter of at most 40 cm. Drawings for the constituent components were sent to a workshop to be manufactured and a mechanical <b>breaking</b> <b>bar</b> was assembled and tested...|$|E
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} {{feedback}} mechanisms associated with surf zone sandbar response have been characterized using bathymetric surveys, sampled approximately monthly over a 16 -year period at the Army Corps of Engineers' Field Research Facility (North Carolina). The measured bathymetry was alongshore averaged and modeled by the superposition of two Gaussian-shaped sandbars on an underlying planar slope. A third, half-Gaussian-shaped bar represented steepening at the shoreline. The rms error between the measured bathymetry and the profile model was 0. 10 m (estimated over 322 different surveys). The model explained 99 % of the profile variance that remained after first removing the linear, cross-shore trend from each observed profile. Bar response, which was {{extracted from the}} modeled profiles, was compared to a local hydrodynamic forcing variable Γ (Γ {{was defined as the}} ratio of the wave height to water depth, evaluated at bar crest locations). At low values of Γ (i. e., nonbreaking conditions), bars migrated onshore, and their amplitude tended to decay. At high values of Γ (i. e., breaking conditions), bars migrated offshore, with relatively little change in amplitude. The transition between onshore and offshore migration occurred at a value of Γ that was consistent with the onset of wave <b>breaking.</b> <b>Bar</b> migration was associated with a stabilizing feedback mechanism, which drove bar crests toward an equilibrium position at the wave breakpoint. However, we observed that the rate of bar response showed no reduction for any nonzero choice of Γ, indicating that bars never reached equilibrium. Systematic bar amplitude decay was observed under nonbreaking conditions. Bar amplitude decay could drive Γ farther away from breaking conditions, allowing further bar amplitude decay. This is a destabilizing feedback mechanism, potentially leading to bar destruction...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{failures}} of large induction machines due to rotor <b>bar</b> <b>breaks</b> {{have become a}} major industrial concern in South Africa. These failures have occurred while applying current condition monitoring methods. This would imply that current theories are either inadequate or badly implemented. This thesis investigates two currently used condition monitoring strategies which focus on monitoring the stator current and axial vibration to detect <b>bar</b> <b>breaks</b> {{as well as a}} third method which involves putting destructive shaft voltages to good use and using this signal to diagnose rotor defects. This document begins by familiarizing the reader with two conventional approaches which involve monitoring the stator current and the axial vibration to detect rotor <b>bar</b> <b>breaks.</b> Thereafter the origins of shaft voltage are discussed and its use as a condition monitoring tool is first theoretically derived and then validated by finite element simulations. A thorough discussion of the measurement equipment required is presented and ultimately the performance of these three methods is tested by means of a laboratory measurement as well as two on-site measurements. The results from these measurements suggest that when making proper use of both conventional condition monitoring methods, these methods have a 50 % success rate in the detection of rotor <b>bar</b> <b>breaks.</b> The alternative method investigated, which involves monitoring the shaft voltage, has a 75 % success rate in the detection of rotor <b>bar</b> <b>breaks.</b> This highlights the use of shaft voltage as a condition monitoring tool.

40|$|Wave breaker vortex Wave {{reflection}} A {{laboratory experiment}} {{was conducted in}} a wave tank to examine macroscale features of wave <b>breaking</b> over <b>bars</b> and reefs. Submerged triangular-shaped obstacles representing bars and reefs were installed on a 1 / 30 concrete slope to cause wave breaking. Seaward and shoreward slopes of the obstacles were varied, as was the deepwater wave steepness Ho/Lo, which resulted in 108 monochromatic wave tests and 12 irregular wave tests. Empirical expressions were determined for the wave properties investigated, which includedbreaker type, height, and depth; plunge, splash, and penetration distance; breaker vortex area; wave decay; wave reflection; and wave runup. Additionally, data acquired from other studies involving plane slopes were reanalyzed to determine breaker indices and plunge distance. Differences were found between wave properties on plane slopes and barred profiles. Plunging and collapsing breakers were predominate for regular waves <b>breaking</b> over <b>bars</b> and reefs, whereas spilling breakers occurred on the plane slope.
