25|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{politics}} and corruption of Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish immigrants infiltrated the NYPD, {{which was used}} as political tool, with positions awarded by politicians to loyalists. Many officers and leaders {{in the police department}} took bribes from local businesses, overlooking things like illegal liquor sales. Police also served political purposes such as manning polling places, where they would {{turn a blind eye to}} <b>ballot</b> <b>box</b> <b>stuffing</b> and other acts of fraud.|$|E
25|$|Mikhail Gorbachev, former President of the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, {{has called}} on the {{authorities}} to hold a new election, citing electoral irregularities and <b>ballot</b> <b>box</b> <b>stuffing.</b> He criticized Vladimir Putin and the United Russia political party for violating peoples human rights and for not ruling {{the country in a}} proper Democratic fashion. During the next major round of demonstrations that occurred on 24 December, he called on Putin to resign.|$|E
50|$|At {{least three}} members of the project have been taken in for {{questioning}} by the NYPD on more than one occasion. On February 8, 2013, an Illuminator was arrested after projecting a <b>ballot</b> <b>box</b> <b>stuffed</b> with dollar bills onto Mayor Michael Bloomberg's apartment in Manhattan. Two members were also arrested and charged with Illegal Advertising on September 9, 2014, though the charges were dropped soon after.|$|R

He also claimed that 12 people had died in the election violence.|$|R
25|$|The 37th All-Star Game in 1985 {{marked the}} first time that honorary captains were {{selected}} for each team. The Game also brought forth the notion of fan balloting of the starting lineup (already adopted in the National Basketball Association and by this time had returned, following a hiatus brought on by <b>ballot</b> <b>box</b> <b>stuffing,</b> to MLB; the NFL gave the fans the vote in the 1990s), as the game was suffering from having little media coverage. The idea came into fruition the following year.|$|E
25|$|Reform {{elements}} {{began to}} get {{the upper hand in}} 1905. Charles Dold was elected in January of that year despite ballot irregularities, accusations of bribery, and <b>ballot</b> <b>box</b> <b>stuffing.</b> When Dold appeared to have enough support to win re-election on July 16, 1905, Madden's supporters attempted to prevent his victory by smashing ballot boxes and destroying ballots. Madden's thugs severely beat Michael Donnelly, a Dold supporter and international president of the Amalgamated Butcher Workmen, {{on the floor of the}} convention in full view of hundreds of delegates. Madden disrupted the election so much that a new election was held on August 6. Again, Madden used violence and fraud to force cancellation of the election. Dold finally won re-election on August 13. Madden's forces boycotted the August 13 election and claimed the results were invalid. He pressured the CFL into invalidating the election on August 20, but public outcry and an investigation by the AFL led the CFL to reverse itself on September 3.|$|E

50|$|Candidates {{were arrested}} before the elections, <b>ballot</b> <b>boxes</b> were <b>stuffed</b> by the colonial {{administration}} and the voting in the villages (douars) took place without polling booths under the surveillance of the army.

50|$|Nevaeh {{tries to}} ruin Mae's night but is dumped by Jaden in the process. To Nevaeh's disappointment, Mae is crowned {{homecoming}} queen. However, it is {{revealed that the}} <b>ballot</b> <b>box</b> was <b>stuffed</b> by the army in order to trap Albert. Nevaeh interrupts Mae's speech and attempts to convince the audience that Albert is a robotic super soldier, but Jaden thwarts her by turning her warnings into compliments. The situation is successfully resolved and Gabby, along with Bart, talk to Jaden and find out that he originally intended to ask Mae to homecoming, but wasn't brave enough to do so. Gabby also realizes that she was wrong about him.|$|R
2500|$|Abdullah, {{the main}} {{opponent}} to Hamid Karzai {{in the presidential}} election, said that his supporters were lodging complaints of election fraud, in particular from Kandahar province.

2500|$|By August 25, the ECC {{said it had}} {{received}} 1,157 complaints, with 54 categorized as [...] "high priority" [...] and material to the outcome, and many more still expected. Some of the worst fraud may have occurred in Helmand province, according to allegations from at least two presidential candidates. A spokesman for Ashraf Ghani alleged large-scale <b>ballot</b> <b>box</b> <b>stuffing</b> in Lashkar Gah, {{the capital of the}} province. An aide to Dr. Abdullah accused election officials in Helmand of having doubled the real turnout figure – a claim that found some anectdotal support in changing figures given by the top local Independent Election Commission official in Helmand, who told The Times {{on the day of the}} election that fewer than 50,000 people had voted in the province, then changed the number to 110,000, and then to 150,000 in subsequent days.|$|E

5000|$|The {{brief history}} of the county was marked by a bitter and {{sometimes}} violent rivalry between two towns, Ravanna and Eminence, over which would serve as county seat. During a vote on this issue held in 1887, Bat Masterson and twenty deputies from Dodge City {{were sent to the}} county to keep the peace. Ravanna won the election by just 35 votes. The citizens of Eminence charged that the <b>ballot</b> <b>boxes</b> had been <b>stuffed.</b> The Kansas Supreme Court agreed, and in 1889 the county seat was transferred to Eminence.|$|R
5000|$|The presidential {{election}} {{was held on}} November 7, 1876. Tilden carried {{his home state of}} New York and most of the South, while Hayes' strength lay in New England, the Midwest, and the West. Early returns suggested that Tilden had won the election; many major newspapers prematurely reported a Democratic victory in their morning editions. However, several other newspapers were more cautious; for example, the headline of The New York Times read: [...] "The Results Still Uncertain." [...] The returns in several states were tainted by allegations of electoral fraud; each side charged that <b>ballot</b> <b>boxes</b> had been <b>stuffed,</b> that ballots had been altered, and that voters had been intimidated.|$|R
5000|$|Nigeria has {{the label}} of {{having one of the}} world's highest levels of corruption. This is {{especially}} seen within the public sector including stealing public funds and accepting bribes It is estimated that between 1999 and 2007, Nigeria has lost around $4-8 billion yearly due to corruption [...] Politicians often siphon public funds to further their political careers and also pay gangs to aid them in rigging elections. The elections since the end of military rule occurring in 1999, 2003, and 2007 were bloody affairs and were openly rigged. In 2007, <b>ballot</b> <b>boxes</b> were visibly <b>stuffed</b> by paid gangs and in some cases, electoral results were simply made up. Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 300 were killed due to the 2007 elections and that {{is considered to be a}} conservative estimate as cited from a Human Rights Watch telephone interview with Derrick Marco, Nigeria country director in March 2007. These measures of violence and intimidation discouraged the general public from voting. Those who did come out were subject to attacks by gangs ...|$|R

50|$|Reports of violence, voter {{intimidation}} and <b>ballot</b> <b>box</b> <b>stuffing</b> began coming in {{shortly after the}} polling stations opened.

His name, along with names of many thousands across the country, was missing from the voter list prepared by the Georgian government. Entire neighborhoods were mysteriously removed from the voter list in the areas where opposition was likely to do well.|$|E

50|$|In {{the recent}} Kazakh elections, many Kazakh voters were offered {{a choice of}} voting on {{electronic}} voting machines or on paper ballots.
