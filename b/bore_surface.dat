Molten aluminum was transported from Reynolds and Alcoa reduction plants to the foundry, inside thermos tank trucks. The block was cast using the Accurad process. The casting process provided a uniform distribution of fine primary silicon particles approximately 0.001 in in size. Pure silicon provides a hard scuff and wear resistant surface, having a rating of 7 on the mohs scale of hardness, the same as quartz, as compared to diamond which is 10. The blocks were aged 8 hours at [...] to achieve dimensional stability. The technical breakthroughs of the block lay in the precision die-casting method used to produce it, and in the silicon alloying which provided a compatible <b>bore</b> <b>surface</b> without liners. Before being shipped to Tonawanda, the blocks were impregnated with sodium silicate, where they were machined through the outer skin.From Massena, the cast engine blocks were shipped as raw castings to Chevy's engine plant in Tonawanda, New York.

40|$|International audienceThe {{cylinder}} <b>bore</b> <b>surface</b> texture, widely {{produced by}} the honing technique, is an essential factor for a good engine performance (friction, oil consumption, running-in, wear etc.). This explains the improvement and development of various new honing techniques. These different honing processes generate surfaces with various texture features characteristics (roughness, valleys depth, cross hatch angle, etc.). This paper addresses a comparison of ring-pack friction for cylinder surfaces produced by plateau honing and helical slide honing. It takes in consideration the mutual effect of superficial plateau roughness amplitude and honing angle. A numerical model is developed to predict friction within the cylinder ring-pack system in mixed lubrication regime.

40|$|Can {{hollow fiber}} {{membranes}} {{be produced in}} other geometries than circular? If so, are membrane properties maintained {{and what could be}} the possible benefits of other geometries? This article gives answers and describes the fabrication of micro-structured hollow fiber membranes using micro-fabricated orifices or needles with characteristic patterns, which are replicated either in the shell surface or in the <b>bore</b> <b>surface</b> of the fiber. By a dry¿wet spinning process using short air gaps, hollow fiber gas separation membranes with geometrical structures like rims on the outer perimeter have been produced. The benefit of the produced fibers has been demonstrated with gas permeation measurements. The selectivity of the membrane remained unchanged (¿O 2 /N 2 (ideal) = 6. 5) and the apparent skin thickness of both fiber types were comparable. Compared to circular fibers, an increase of gas flow (19 %) was found due to the introduced surface increase taking variations in the skin thickness into account. This shows that the membrane properties are independent of the type of spinneret used. Finally, it was shown that not only the shell surface, but also the <b>bore</b> <b>surface</b> could be successfully micro-structure...|$|E
40|$|Frictional losses {{between the}} piston rings to {{cylinder}} <b>bore</b> <b>surface</b> {{is one of}} the major sources of mechanical losses in an internal combustion engine (ICE). Traditional plateau honing produces a relatively rough cylinder <b>bore</b> <b>surface</b> with many valleys for oil retention and plateau surfaces that are usually has micro roughness's that causes mechanical friction to act as a bearing surface. A smooth polished dimpled surface is more ideal to achieve low friction and wear in an ICE. Alternative methods to create a smooth dimpled surface on a hypereutectic aluminum ADC 12 substrate for frictional improvements are evaluated in this study using an oscillating wear tester (OWT). The methods include casting in the dimples in the aluminum matrix, sandblasting as well as embossing the pits using a gritted roller. The texture samples are evaluated by examining the surface properties, measuring frictional coefficient as well as wear characteristics. It was found that the samples embossed with # 480 grit sandpaper and sandblasted with # 240 sieve sand samples had the more desired properties with a reduced coefficient of friction (μ) of 23 % at low sliding speeds before hydrodynamic lubrication mode and 6. 9 % in the fully hydrodynamic lubrication region.

40|$|One of {{the causes}} of the {{degradation}} in rail accelerator performance is the formation of a secondary arc. Experimental evidence of arc restrike and the subsequent growth of this secondary arc is presented. A simple analytical treatment of arc restrike is developed in terms of breakdown of residual vapor atoms. It is found that after the passage of the primary arc, the bore volume contains a large number of residual neutral vapor atoms. If the density of these atoms is in excess of the critical density, then for a certain length of time the condition exists in the bore for the formation of a secondary arc. Evaporation of atoms from the <b>bore</b> <b>surfaces</b> cannot provide a sufficient number of atoms for an arc restrike.

The {{effect of}} spinning parameters such as polymer dope flow rate, bore liquid flowrate, air gap and take-up {{speed on the}} microstructure {{and shape of the}} bore and its deformation was investigated. It was found that when a high bore liquid flowrate was used, the microstructure in the <b>bore</b> <b>surface</b> was destroyed. The bores were deformed to an oval shape when the fiber walls were thick. This was attributed to buckling of the fiber shell {{as a result of the}} coagulation and shrinkage of the outer surface. Fibers were also fabricated with a round-needled spinneret for comparison. The intrinsic pure water permeabilities (based on the actual <b>bore</b> <b>surface</b> areas) of fibers with structured and round bores were found to be similar. On the other hand, the structured fibers have larger pores in the skin layer. Smaller pores on the round fibers are considered to form when the inner surface coagulates and the skin layer is pulled inwards due to the shrinkage caused by phase separation. When the bore is structured, the wavy shape can damp this contraction effect resulting in larger pores. The skin layer thickness of the fibers was investigated using a colloidal filtration method. It was shown that fibers with microstructured bores which have mostly uniform skin layer thickness and reasonably narrow pore size distribution can be fabricate...|$|E

The pressure buildup inside the vessel was 1000 bar. After each pulse the erosive wear of the test pieces was determined and after testing the reaction zone of the coatings was sputtered to a depth of 2 micrometers and analyzed by AES and SIMS during the process. Both coatingj materials showed excellent adhesion and their erodion resistance proved superior to the unprotected alloy steel. Tantalum, however, exhibited a much better performance than columbium. This was due to the different properties of the gas/metal reaction l ayers formed. In both cases the <b>bore</b> <b>surface</b> was covered with propellant gas residue of 1 micrometer thickness, that was built up and carried out with each pulse. Underneath, a layer consisting of Ta sub 2 O sub 5 or Nb sub 2 O sub 5 was formed.
