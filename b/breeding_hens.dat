6000|$|In a {{well-known}} {{passage in the}} thirtieth chapter of Genesis, rules are given for influencing, as was then thought possible, the colour of sheep; and speckled and dark breeds are spoken of as being kept separate. By the time of David the fleece was likened to snow. Youatt (20/31. 'On Sheep' page 18.), who has discussed all the passages in relation to breeding in the Old Testament, concludes that at this early period [...] "some of the best principles of breeding must have been steadily and long pursued." [...] It was ordered, according to Moses, that [...] "Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind;" [...] but mules were purchased (20/32. Volz 'Beitrage zur Kulturgeschichte' 1852 s. 47.) so that at this early period other nations must have crossed the horse and ass. It is said (20/33. Mitford 'History of Greece' volume 1 page 73.) that Erichthonius, some generations before the Trojan war, had many brood-mares, [...] "which by his care and judgment {{in the choice of}} stallions produced a breed of horses superior to any in the surrounding countries." [...] Homer (Book 5) speaks of Aeneas' horses as bred from mares which were put to the steeds of Laomedon. Plato, in his 'Republic' says to Glaucus, [...] "I see that you raise at your house a great many dogs for the chase. Do you take care about breeding and pairing them? Among animals of good blood, are there not always some which are superior to the rest?" [...] To which Glaucus answers in the affirmative. (20/34. Dr. Dally translated in 'Anthropological Review' May 1864 page 101.) Alexander the Great selected the finest Indian cattle to send to Macedonia to improve the breed. (20/35. Volz 'Beitrage' etc. 1852 s. 80.) According to Pliny (20/36 'History of the World' chapter 45.), King Pyrrhus had an especially valuable breed of oxen: and he did not suffer the bulls and cows to come together till four years old, that the breed might not degenerate. Virgil, in his Georgics (lib. 3), gives as strong advice as any modern agriculturist could do, carefully to select the breeding stock; [...] "to note the tribe, the lineage, and the sire; whom to reserve for husband of the herd;"--to brand the progeny;--to select sheep of the purest white, and to examine if their tongues are swarthy. We have seen that the Romans kept pedigrees of their pigeons, and this would have been a senseless proceeding had not great care been taken in breeding them. Columella gives detailed instructions about breeding fowls: [...] "Let the <b>breeding</b> <b>hens</b> therefore be of a choice colour, a robust body, square-built, full-breasted, with large heads, with upright and bright-red combs. Those are believed to be the best bred which have five toes." [...] (20/37. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1848 page 323.) According to Tacitus, the Celts attended to the races of their domestic animals; and Caesar states that they paid high prices to merchants for fine imported horses. (20/38. Reynier 'De l'Economie des Celtes' 1818 pages 487, 503.) In regard to plants, Virgil speaks of yearly culling the largest seeds; and Celsus says, [...] "where the corn and crop is but small, we must pick out the best ears of corn, and of them lay up our seed separately by itself." [...] (20/39. Le Couteur on 'Wheat' page 15.) ...|$|E

Taylor (1947), using a rice-fishmeal ration reported that 0. 12 mg. of P. G.

Schweigert, et al., (1948), using a ground corn-casein ration, re-ported that the requirement was between 0. 12 and 0. 42 mg. per kilogram of ration.

Methods: Data on <b>Hen</b> Harrier <b>breeding</b> distribution in 10 km[*]×[*] 10 km survey squares from national surveys were used in conjunction with information on the location of wind farms to examine whether, and to what extent, changes in Hen Harrier distribution and abundance between 2000 and 2010 were related to wind energy development. Results: Of the 69 survey squares holding Hen Harriers during the 2010 breeding season, 28 % also overlapped with one or more wind farms. Data from 36 of the squares with <b>breeding</b> <b>Hen</b> Harriers during the 2000 survey revealed a marginally non-significant negative relationship between wind farm presence and change in the number of breeding pairs between 2000 and 2010. Conclusions: A considerable overlap exists between <b>Hen</b> Harrier <b>breeding</b> distribution and the location of wind farms in Ireland, particularly in areas between 200 and 400 m above sea level. The presence of wind farms is negatively related to Hen Harrier population trends in squares surveyed in 2000 and 2010, but this relationship is not statistically significant, and may not be causal.

Materials and Methods: This {{study was conducted in}} 48 apparently healthy laying hens vaccinated with Salmonella inactivated polyvalent vaccine, eggs and progeny chicks; 12 each from four different breeds of poultry,viz.,Vanraja, Gramapriya, BlackRock, and KalingaBrown.

40|$|Infection of <b>breeding</b> <b>hens</b> with Eimeria maxima induces {{production}} of parasite-specific antibodies which are transferred, via the egg yolk, to hatchling chicks. These antibodies (immunoglobulin G) are highly protective, mediating up to a 97 % reduction in oocyst excretion in challenged hatchlings. However, {{the degree of}} maternally derived immunity transferred by the hens to their offspring declines with increasing time after infection of the hens. This decline in immunity {{is directly related to}} declining immunoglobulin G titers. However, sera from highly protected hatchlings recognize only a very few E. maxima proteins on Western blots (immunoblots). In particular, a 230 -kDa protein band is outstanding for its association with maternally derived immunity to E. maxima in hatchlings. This band was excised from a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) preparative gel of crude merozoite protein extract.
