25|$|Work {{on a more}} {{advanced}} armoured fighter, conceived as an armoured version of the Sopwith Snipe, began early in 1918. The forward portion of the fuselage was a 605lb (275kg) box of armour plate, forming {{an integral part of}} the aircraft structure, protecting the pilot and fuel system, with a 0.315 in (8mm) front plate, a 0.433 in (11mm) <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> 0.236 in (6mm) side plates and rear armour consisting of an 11-gauge and 6-gauge plate separated by an air gap. The rear (unarmoured) section of the fuselage was a generally similar structure to the Snipe’s, but flat sided, to match the forepart. The two-bay wings and tailplane were identical in form to those of the Snipe, but were strengthened to cope with the extra weight, while the fin and rudder were identical to the Snipe. The new aircraft used the same Bentley BR2 rotary engine as the Snipe, covered by an unarmoured cowling – the foremost armour plate forming the firewall.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{there are}} two {{platforms}} above ground level, accessed by near-vertical timber steps and hatchways in the floors. The tower framework features original components, including: 140mm x 100mm timber stud work; circular girts made from beech; a combination of diagonal timber bracing and steel spiral strapping; timber floor joists on each level supported on a circular steel angle; and floors lined with wide tongue and groove boards. A small number of timber components were replaced after the 1999 move when the tower was damaged, and some steel bracket work was installed. The steel, angled <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> and tie-down brackets bolting the structure to the slab also date from , with some original brackets remaining as examples. Some early timber shelving remains, {{as well as some}} of the 1940s electrical conduit, wiring and switches (no longer in use). Signage and a safety strap on the top ladder have been introduced since restoration of the structure in 1999.|$|E

30|$|The steel webs are {{connected}} to the concrete deck through connecting plates and shear rods. The webs of the box girder are made of 28 -mm steel plates {{in the vicinity of the}} piers and 18 -mm steel plates for most of other locations of the girder. The steel <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> are of 28  mm in the vicinity of the piers and of 42  mm around the center of each span. The steel <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> in the vicinity of piers are also strengthened by 400 -mm-thickness concrete to resist the shear force. Shell elements with proper thickness are also used to model these connecting <b>plates,</b> webs and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> of the girder (see Fig.  3).|$|R
500|$|The Dickson charge pump, or Dickson multiplier, {{consists}} of a cascade of diode/capacitor cells with the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> of each capacitor driven by a clock pulse train. [...] The circuit is a modification of the Cockcroft-Walton multiplier but takes a DC input with the clock trains providing the switching signal instead of the AC input. [...] The Dickson multiplier normally requires that alternate cells are driven from clock pulses of opposite phase. [...] However, since a voltage doubler, shown in figure 7, requires only one stage of multiplication only one clock signal is required.Yuan, pp.13-14 ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] is a {{permanent}} magnet and moving coil motor that swings the heads to the desired position. A metal plate supports a squat neodymium-iron-boron (NIB) high-flux magnet. Beneath this plate is the moving coil, {{often referred to as}} the voice coil by analogy to the coil in loudspeakers, which is attached to the actuator hub, and beneath that is a second NIB magnet, mounted on the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> of the motor (some drives have only one magnet).|$|E
2500|$|If {{the speed}} of the top plate is low enough, the fluid {{particles}} will move parellel to it, and their speed will vary linearly from zero at the bottom to [...] at the top. [...] Each layer of fluid will move faster than the one just below it, and friction between them will give rise to a force resisting their relative motion. [...] In particular, the fluid will apply on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite one to the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate.</b> An external force is therefore required {{in order to keep the}} top plate moving at constant speed.|$|E

40|$|A single film (typical {{of a film}} in a foam) {{moving in}} a {{confined}} geometry (i. e. confined between closely spaced top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates)</b> is analysed via the viscous froth model. In the first instance the film {{is considered to be}} straight (as viewed from above the top plate) but is not flat. Instead it is curved (with a circular arc cross-section) in the direction across the confining plates. This curvature leads to a maximal possible steady propagation velocity for the film, which is characterised by the curved film meeting the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> tangentially. Next the film is considered to propagate in a channel (i. e. between top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> and sidewalls, with the sidewall separation exceeding that of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates).</b> The film is now curved along as well as across the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates.</b> Curvature along the plates arises from viscous drag forces on the channel sidewall boundaries. The maximum steady propagation velocity is unchanged, but can now also be associated with films meeting channel sidewalls tangentially, a situation which should be readily observable if the film is viewed from above the top plate. Observed from above, however, the film need not appear as an arc of a circle. Instead the film may be relatively straight along much of its length, with curvature pushed into boundary layers at the sidewalls...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{approach}} to the probabilistic corrosion rate estimation model for inner <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> of bulk carriers. Firstly, by using the data from thickness measurements for inner <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> for considered 25 bulk carriers, the related best fitted linear model for the corrosion wastage is obtained {{as a function of}} ship’s age. In this model it is assumed that life of coating is 4 years. The obtained related corrosion rate is equal to mm/year. Notice that the obtained linear model is a particular case of a power model proposed in some earlier investigations. In {{view of the fact that}} the corrosion rate of ship hull structures is influenced by many factors, many of an uncertain nature, in recent studies several authors investigated a probabilistic model as more appropriate to describe the expected corrosion. Motivated by these investigations, and using 2926 thickness measurements for corrosion wastage of inner <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> of considered 38 special ships surveys, this paper examines the cumulative density function for the corrosion rate involved in the mentioned linear model, and considered here as a continuous random variable. The obtained statistical, numerical and graphical results show that the logistic distribution or normal distribution would be well appropriate for the probabilistic corrosion rate estimation model for inner <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> of bulk carriers. It is believed that this fact will be confirmed with greater statistical reliability in our future investigations including many more data collected on the considered corrosion...|$|R
