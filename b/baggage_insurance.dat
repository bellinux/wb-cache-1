50|$|On the day Mr Radcliffe {{reported}} the complete registration of the Deed of Settlement, Mr J.U. Ellis (also Director of the Screw Steam Shipping Company) became the Society’s first Chairman. Ill health cut short his tenure and was succeeded by Mr P.D. Hadow - {{who was also}} a Director of the P&O.Both the Chairman and board were conscious {{of the fact that there}} was a limit to the amount of Marine life business that could be obtained. Knowing that an assurance fund must increase or perish, the decision was taken to extend the business remit by introducing elements such as Passenger life assurance and <b>Baggage</b> <b>insurance.</b> The main focus was the extension of the Society’s operations into the field of ‘general’ (as opposed to ‘marine’) life assurance. In 1862, in order to remove any possible misapprehension that the Society was solely concerned with life risks, the name ‘Marine Life and Casualty Mutual Assurance Society’ was abandoned and the present full name of the Society adopted.The change of name was followed by a change of address from 137 Leadenhall Street via 60 Fenchurch Street (now the Fenchurch Street Post Office) to 14 Leadenhall Street - the home of the Society for the next sixty years.|$|E
30|$|Our work {{is based}} on a joint {{analysis}} of the OAG scheduling databases and a collection of web fares published by easyJet. We collected all fares from the easyJet booking website on every day during the period September 2006 –September 2009. These data therefore account for daily price variation, but not intraday changes. For each flight, we begin checking the price 90  days prior to departure and continue until the day before departure. The fares considered in this paper include basic tariffs, airport charges, and other taxes and unavoidable costs. They exclude supplements such as speedy boarding, voluntary carbon tax, extra <b>baggage,</b> and special <b>insurance.</b>|$|R
