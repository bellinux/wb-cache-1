5|$|Eleusis is {{probably}} Abbott's most prominent game, {{due to its}} metaphors and its suitability {{for use as a}} teaching tool. He invented it in 1956, and it appeared in his self-published book Four New Card Games. It was also published in the book Abbott's New Card Games a year later. Martin Gardner wrote about it in his Mathematical Games column in the June1959 issue of Scientific American. Basically, the gameplay consists of the dealer choosing a secret rule dictating how cards are to be played, and the players playing cards in an attempt to figure out the rule through inductive reasoning. In 1973, Abbott decided to improve Eleusis; the result was considered to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> than the original, with various improvements to the layouts and gameplay making it work quite a bit better. Martin Gardner wrote about this version in the October1977 issue of Scientific American. Abbott also self-published a pamphlet in 1977 with the rules for the improved version, titled The New Eleusis. It has appeared in several card game collections, such as Hoyle's Rules of Games and New Rules for Classic Games, among others.|$|E
25|$|Tryon {{became a}} strong {{supporter}} of the idea that in time of war there should be a national insurance scheme for merchant vessels. He was concerned that in the event of war insurance rates for vessels against loss by enemy action would immediately become impossibly high, so that merchant ships would simply stop trading with Britain, even if the numbers being lost were relatively small. This would be disastrous for the country, so it would <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> for the government to implement its own scheme to reimburse owners for lost cargoes and ships.|$|E
25|$|Radar {{might have}} helped detect the convoys {{regardless}} of the starvation in resources. However, progress was slow. A 136MHz FuG Atlas was installed in a Fw 200C-3/U3 in July 1941 and the similar Neptune-S was later trialled off Norway, but proved disappointing. When it was compared to a captured British metric (200MHz) ASV (air-to-surface vessel) MK II from a crashed Hudson in Tunisia, the British radar was found to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>better.</b> By this time Rostock, operating 120MHz with a 16-nautical-mile (30km) range was under development, but production was slow and by November 1942 only five Fw 2000C-4/U3s in the west had radar, {{and one of those}} was the captured British set. The low-UHF band FuG 200 Hohentweil, operating at 550MHz, with a range of 43nm (80km) was being developed. It entered service in August 1943 in the Fw 200C-6, but Kessler's low place in the pecking order meant only 16 Fw 200s out of 26 in III./KG 40 had radar. It is unknown whether other groups were issued with the radar.|$|E

[...] Kevin Smith, who guest starred in the episode [...] "Driver Ed", said that Veronica Mars was [...] "hands-down, the best show on television right now, and proof that TV can <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> than cinema." [...] Stephen King described the series as [...] "Nancy Drew meets Philip Marlowe, and the result is pure nitro. Why is Veronica Mars so good? It bears little resemblance to life as I know it, but I can't take my eyes off the damn thing." [...] Ed Brubaker called it [...] "the best mystery show ever made in America." ...|$|E
500|$|After Germany had to cede most {{of former}} German New Guinea and Kiautschou/Tsingtao to Japan {{and with an}} intensifying Sino-German cooperation, {{relations}} between Berlin and Tokyo were nearly dead. Under the initiative of Wilhelm Solf, who served as German ambassador to Japan from 1920 to 1928, cultural exchange was strengthened again, culminating in the re-establishment of the [...] "German-Japanese Society" [...] (1926), {{the founding of the}} [...] "Japanese-German Cultural Society" [...] (1927), and of the [...] "Japanese-German Research Institute" [...] (1934). In the 1920s–30s, Germany was the destination of choice for Japanese students wanting to study abroad with 80% of the Japanese students going abroad to study doing so at German universities. In the 1920s, both France and Germany kept the franc and the Reichsmark undervalued, making both countries very attractive for Japanese wanting to study abroad, but as German universities were considered to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> than French universities, Japanese students tended to opt for the former rather than the latter. Many of the men who emerged as leaders of the Pan-Asia movement in Japan in the 1930s studied at German universities in the 1920s, which led the Japanese historian Hotta Eri to note there was a strong German influence on the discourse of Japanese Pan-Asianism.|$|E
500|$|Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph {{discussed}} the episode's refreshing strong-women theme: [...] "Game of Thrones has been justly criticised for employing young actresses as wobbly-wobbly window dressing and, though the toplessness has been dialed back this season, it's {{still very much}} a calling card. However there are reasons for suspecting that the series is attempting to make amends – by arguing that Westeros would <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> off with women in charge. Even as Sansa was turning the tide at Winterfell, in Meereen, Daenerys and Yara Greyjoy were striking up a lady bromance – and seemingly rock-solid alliance – for the ages." [...] Laura Prudom of Variety agreed: [...] "After seasons of criticism over the show's misogyny (sometimes earned, sometimes not), it's thrilling to see an episode like 'Battle of the Bastards', where women like Dany, Sansa and Yara — and emasculated men (either figuratively or literally) like Tyrion and Theon — break the gears of war and the familiar patterns of violence by attempting to 'leave the world better than we found it', despite the examples set by the evil white cisgendered men who came before them." [...] According to Sarah Larson of The New Yorker, [...] "Sansa watches calmly, then smiles. You've come a long way, baby. Or she's become a monster, and so have I. The women of Westeros are on the warpath." ...|$|E

2500|$|At ILA 1984 in Hanover Wolf Hoffmann {{presented}} a mock-up {{for a new}} project based on the Hoffmann Dimona motor-glider, called Hoffmann Visonar, before being renamed. [...] The Observer's design aim was long endurance with minimal fuel burn, combined with extremely good vision from the cockpit. [...] To obtain this, the conventional tractor propeller is driven by a mid-mounted engine placed behind the two side-by-side seats. [...] This location for the power-plant was intended to leave the nose clear of obstruction.

2500|$|Debate {{continues}} {{as to whether}} pre-Communist Tibetan society was especially oppressive or was comparable to, or better than, similar social structures in nearby regions. According to the Tibetan Government-in-Exile: [...] "In terms of social mobility and wealth distribution, independent Tibet compared favourably with most Asian countries" [...] {{the fact that most}} Dalai Lamas, including Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama and Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama, came from peasant families being cited as an example of this. Travelers who witnessed conditions in both China and Tibet in the 1940s found the Tibetan peasants to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> off than their Chinese counterparts. [...] Academics debate whether tribal cultures, such as the Mongolian nomadic steppe culture, are feudal in nature. Much of Mongolian, Tibetan and Chinese political history is inter-related but the extent of their shared social culture is uncertain.|$|E
