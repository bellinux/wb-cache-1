40|$|The total {{atmospheric}} attenuation of direct irradiance is often expressed {{as the product}} of independent <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> transmittances pertaining to the different depleting materials in the atmosphere. In theory, it is clear however that the <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> transmittances of the two most important attenuating factors, aerosols and water vapour, cannot be considered independent of each other. This is most relevant when trying to isolate the effect of atmospheric aerosols from the measurement of <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> direct irradiance. These questions are addressed in an analytical approach. Several <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> direct transmittance equations and corresponding turbidity parameters are discussed with respect to the analytical results.

This presented {{a vast array}} of opportunities, but also fierce competition. In this study it is indicated that <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> are permitting organisations to operate more effectively in the business environment. Consequently, it is the objective of this study to gain insight into <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> from the South African industrial perspective, assess the factors and propose guidelines that are needed in order for <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> to be successful. In the literature study the traditional and modern organisation structure and remuneration systems are contrasted and the importance of the change process in achieving the desired state is emphasised. It is shown that <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> aligns with the concept of the modern organisation and to arrive at this state a disciplined and logical approach must be followed. <b>Broad</b> <b>banding</b> is identified as a compensation system that not only facilitates the change process to the modern organisation, but also provides a solid foundation to build upon The second part of the literature study addresses many of the questions surrounding <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> and provides guidelines for the design and implementation of <b>broad</b> <b>banding.</b> The study presents amongst others the background of <b>broad</b> <b>banding,</b> design and implementation aspects, remuneration within bands, controlling cost, communication and training. A South African company within the industrial environment formed the basis of the practical study. The forces initiating the <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> process are identified and discussed and the resulting remuneration strategy presented. A review of a the three-stage process follows which constitutes a pre-implementation, implementation and post-implementation phase. The above process is scrutinised and a number of learning points developed by the author. A recommended model is provided for implementation of <b>broad</b> <b>banding.</b> The findings from the literature research and the industrial company are combined to provide guidelines on what to expect and how to enhance success...|$|R

For Na 2 IrO 3 the <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> is seen for temperatures <= 200 K and persists inside the magnetically ordered state. For Li samples, the intensity of this mode increases, shifts to lower wave numbers, and persists to higher temperatures. Such a mode has recently been predicted (by Knolle et al.) as a signature of the Kitaev spin liquid. We assign the observation of the <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> to be a signature of strong Kitaev exchange correlations. The fact that the <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> persists even inside the magnetically ordered state suggests that dynamically fluctuating moments survive even below T-N. This is further supported by our mean-field calculations. The Raman response calculated in mean-field theory shows that the <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> predicted for the SL state survives in the magnetically ordered state near the zigzag-spin liquid phase boundary.
