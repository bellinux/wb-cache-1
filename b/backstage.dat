5|$|After the war Knight {{returned}} to her previous themes of the ballet, the circus and Gypsies, and continued to divide her time between London and Malvern. In 1948 Knight painted <b>backstage</b> at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, mostly observing {{the work of the}} wardrobe department, still working under austerity restrictions. The same year she painted a large group portrait of Princess Elizabeth and several civic dignitaries opening the new Broadgate Centre in Coventry. A period of illness affected her work on this commission, and, despite Knight's repainting large parts of the canvas, the finished painting was not well received. A major exhibition of over eighty works by Knight was held at the Ian Nicol Gallery in Glasgow, in 1952. The following year Knight {{returned to}} the theatre, painting and producing crayon studies, <b>backstage</b> at the Old Vic in London during the Birmingham Repertory Theatre's production of Henry IV, Part 1 & Part 2. Throughout this period Knight continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy each year, most notably with a portrait of Jean Rhodes, a professional strong woman known as 'The Mighty Mannequin', which when shown in 1955 led to further portrait commissions for Knight. In 1956 Knight worked <b>backstage</b> at the Royal Opera House during performances and rehearsals by the Bolshoi Ballet.|$|E

5|$|Rodgers {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a musical comedy about the cast and crew <b>backstage</b> at a theatre.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Me and Juliet {{can be traced}} to the early days of the {{relationship}} between Rodgers and Hammerstein. The musical Oklahoma! opened in 1943; it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's first work together and a massive hit. Soon after Oklahoma! opened, Rodgers began considering the idea of a musical set <b>backstage</b> at a theatre staging a musical. The production could explore different areas of the <b>backstage</b> world. Rodgers also saw it as the opportunity to write a pure musical comedy, without the serious themes which had marked their early works—such as the attacks on racism in South Pacific, and the cultural tolerance in The King and I.|$|E
