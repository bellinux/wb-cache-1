5|$|In December 2016, a homebrew remake was {{released}} that, {{for the most}} part, kept the original game the same. However, the mechanic of E.T. falling into the pit was amended so that a keypress was required before the player fell into the pit. The holes were also visually removed and were discovered with an indicator at the <b>bottom</b> <b>left</b> of the screen.|$|E

5|$|The Italian naval ensign {{comprises}} the national flag defaced with {{the arms of}} the Marina Militare; the Marina Mercantile (and private citizens at sea) use the civil ensign, differenced by the absence of the mural crown and the lion holding open the gospel, bearing the inscription PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEVS, instead of a sword. The shield is quartered, symbolic of the four great thalassocracies of Italy, the repubbliche marinare of Venice (represented by the lion passant, top left), Genoa (top right), Amalfi (<b>bottom</b> <b>left),</b> and Pisa (represented by their respective crosses); the rostrata crown was proposed by Admiral Cavagnari in 1939 to acknowledge the Navy's origins in ancient Rome.|$|E

5|$|The {{gear and}} dial in the <b>bottom</b> <b>left</b> {{of the game}} screen {{is related to the}} Kotarou's Rewrite ability. The dial moves forward {{whenever}} this ability is used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much the dial has moved. Throughout most of the game, the text is presented in a dialog box on the lower portion of the game screen, but this is changed for the Terra scenario, where the text is overlaid across the entire screen.|$|E
5|$|He {{broke his}} fibula during August 2009, which {{resulted}} in him being ruled out of playing for eight weeks. He finished 2009–10 with 39 appearances and 13 goals. His first appearance of 2010–11 came in the opening match, a 1–0 home defeat to Hereford on 7 August 2010, in which he missed an early opportunity to score, shooting wide of the goal having been one-on-one with goalkeeper Adam Bartlett. His first goals of the season came after scoring twice in a 7–0 home victory over Barnet on 21 August 2010, the first a shot into the <b>bottom</b> <b>left</b> of the goal and the second a close-range header. He finished the season with 48 appearances and 29 goals, including 28 goals in the League Two, making him the division's top scorer.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a third-person perspective, and the player can freely move in three-dimensional space and rotate the camera in any direction. The top left corner of the screen interface shows the status of Logan's armour, a 'danger-meter' which rises as the player engages enemies through combat, and a target lock. A radar is displayed in the <b>bottom</b> <b>left</b> corner of the screen which shows the location of various objects including friendly units, enemies, weapon pick ups or mission objectives. The current weapon equipped is always displayed in the bottom right corner, with the ammunition count. Depending on the weapon used, the camera will shift to first-person mode to assist in aiming.|$|E

5|$|Coulson was {{released}} by Barnsley {{at the end of}} the season, leaving him free to join Grimsby permanently, signing a two-year contract on 31 May 2010. In the third match of 2010–11, at home to Hayes & Yeading United on 21 August 2010, he took a kick to his ankle, which was expected to keep him out of the team for a month. He returned on 18 September 2010 after starting in a 2–1 defeat at home to Fleetwood Town, but was substituted at half-time. Coulson made a goalscoring second comeback from his ankle injury in Grimsby's 2–2 home draw with Eastbourne Borough on 30 October 2010. For the first time as a Grimsby player he scored twice in one match in a 2–1 victory at home to AFC Wimbledon on 5 March 2011, with a first-half shot into the <b>bottom</b> <b>left</b> of the goal and a second-half shot into the top-left corner from inside the penalty area. Coulson's first season as a permanent Grimsby player concluded having scored nine goals in 33 appearances.|$|E
5|$|On 10 December, {{the first}} match after United's {{elimination}} from the UEFA Champions League, Nani scored a brace {{in a home}} match against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He opened the scoring in the 17th minute to put them 1–0 up with a shot into the <b>bottom</b> <b>left</b> corner. He scored his second goal in the 56th minute, tapping in from Antonio Valencia's drilled cross across the six-yard box to extend the lead to 3–1. He was later replaced by winger Ashley Young as the match finished 4–1 to the home side. Nani scored his sixth league goal {{of the season and}} provided two assists in a 5–0 away win at Fulham on 21 December. He first advanced on a run down the left flank before crossing for Danny Welbeck to slot home. He then met a Ryan Giggs cross with his head to glance United into a 2–0 lead. He then returned the compliment, squaring for Giggs to put United 3–0 up before half-time.|$|E
5|$|Parslow started York's first {{competitive}} fixture since promotion away to League One Doncaster Rovers in {{the first}} round of the League Cup in the opening match of 2012–13 on 11 August 2012, which the team lost 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out following a 1–1 draw after extra time. He then played in York's first League Two fixture, a 3–1 home defeat by Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012. His only goal of 2012–13 was the opener in York's first victory of the season, a 3–1 away win against Barnet on 25 August 2012, with a 20-yard volley into the <b>bottom</b> <b>left</b> corner. Parslow played at right back, left back and defensive midfield throughout the season, and played in the latter position in the end of season run-in to form part of a midfield trio also including Tom Platt and Adam Reed that helped York avoid relegation. He became the first York player to be named Clubman of the Year on three occasions, having been presented the award before York's final home match of the season against Southend United on 20 April 2013. Parslow missed only one match for York in 2012–13, making 50 appearances and scoring one goal, and signed a new two-year contract with the club in May 2013.|$|E

5|$|The game {{progresses}} linearly {{from one}} story event to the next, usually {{presented as a}} cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide benefits to the characters. Players may also choose {{the order in which}} they tackle some areas. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. Combat in Kingdom Hearts occurs in real time and involves pressing buttons to initiate attacks by the on-screen character. An action menu, similar to those found in Final Fantasy games, found at the <b>bottom</b> <b>left</b> of the screen provides other combat options such as using magic and items, although players can also assign selected magic spells that can be instantly used whilst holding the shoulder button. As players progress through the game, they can receive certain Disney characters as summons, such as Dumbo and Tinker Bell, each with their own unique abilities. There is also a context-sensitive option {{at the bottom of the}} menu, usually used for interacting with the environment or performing special attacks. This menu is manipulated by using the right analog stick or digital pad, while movement is controlled by the left analog stick, allowing the player to navigate the menu while avoiding or approaching enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower the}} values of {{ionization}} energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more metallic character the element has. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties. Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and relativistic effects, tends to increase going down a group (or column or family). Thus, the most metallic elements (such as caesium and francium) are found at the <b>bottom</b> <b>left</b> of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements (oxygen, fluorine, chlorine) at the top right. The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found on some periodic tables, {{and the practice of}} sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as metalloids.|$|E
