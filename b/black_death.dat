5|$|One {{theory that}} has been {{advanced}} is that the devastation in Florence caused by the <b>Black</b> <b>Death,</b> which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in {{a shift in the}} world view of people in 14th-century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. It has also been argued that the <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art. However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.|$|E

5|$|With {{the third}} album The Forsaken the band {{developed}} {{more in the}} direction of a more technical style, as it is apparent on the style of The Return of the <b>Black</b> <b>Death.</b> The band's musical development resulted in that The Forsaken includes several guitar solos. Also the quality of production compared to The Return of the <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> improved. Through the introduction of the two ex-members of Vaakevandring, the style became more melodic and atmospheric.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> the area's {{population}} collapsed. Those miners who had survived the pandemic left mining to work in farming, in which wages had doubled owing to the severe labour shortage, and the mines of Bere Alston were abandoned.|$|E

5000|$|While {{acknowledging}} progress, Satcher {{has criticized}} health disparities. He asked the question, “What {{if we had}} eliminated disparities in health in the last century?” and calculated that {{there would have been}} 83,500 fewer <b>black</b> <b>deaths</b> in the year 2000. That would have included 24,000 fewer <b>black</b> <b>deaths</b> from cardiovascular disease. If infant mortality had been equal across racial and ethnic groups in 2000, 4,700 fewer black infants would have died in their first year of life.|$|R
5|$|Not {{counting}} the 28 remaining stave churches, at least 250 wooden houses predating the <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> in 1350 are preserved {{more or less}} intact in Norway. Most of these are log houses, some with added stave-built galleries or porches.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} {{sector of the}} English economy, still by far the largest, was transformed by the <b>Black</b> <b>Death.</b> With the shortage of manpower after the <b>Black</b> <b>Death,</b> wages for agricultural labourers rapidly increased and continued to then grow steadily throughout the 15th century. As their incomes increased, labourers' living conditions and diet improved steadily. A trend for labourers to eat less barley and more wheat and rye, and to replace bread in their diet with more meat, had been apparent since before the <b>Black</b> <b>Death,</b> but intensified during this later period. Nonetheless, England's much smaller population needed less food {{and the demand for}} agricultural products fell. The position of the larger landowners became increasingly difficult. Revenues from demesne lands were diminishing as demand remained low and wage costs increased; nobles were also finding it more difficult to raise revenue from their local courts, fines and privileges in the years after the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Despite attempts to increase money rents, {{by the end of the}} 14th century the rents paid from peasant lands were also declining, with revenues falling as much as 55% between the 1380s and 1420s.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> forced Louis to leave Italy in May. He made Ulrich Wolfhardt {{governor}} of Naples, but his mercenaries did not hinder Joanna I and her husband from returning in September. Louis, who had signed a truce for eight years with Venice on 5 August, sent new troops to Naples {{under the command of}} Stephen Lackfi, Voivode of Transylvania, in late 1349. Lackfi reoccupied Capua, Aversa and other forts that had been lost to Joanna I, but a mutiny among his German mercenaries forced him to return to Hungary. The <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> had meanwhile reached Hungary. The first wave of the epidemic ended in June, but it returned in September, killing Louis's first wife, Margaret. Louis also fell ill, but survived the plague. Although the <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> was less devastating in the sparsely populated Hungary than in other parts of Europe, there were regions that became depopulated in 1349, and the demand for work force increased in the subsequent years.|$|E
50|$|On Thursday, December 9, 1841, his {{colleague}} Representative Joseph Lawrence {{took to the}} House floor to announce <b>Black's</b> <b>death</b> and provide a eulogy. Lawrence stated that Black was well liked by anyone who {{came into contact with}} him. Lawrence indicated that Black was his childhood friend. Lawrence also stated that Black had been in good health the day before his death. Lawrence then submitted a resolution that crepe should be worn in honor of <b>Black's</b> <b>death.</b> The resolution was adopted.|$|R

5|$|After the <b>Black</b> <b>Death,</b> monumental {{construction}} in Norway {{came to a}} standstill, except for vernacular building, only to be resumed in the 16th and 17th centuries under Danish administration. There are few examples of Renaissance architecture in Norway, the most prominent being the Rosenkrantz Tower in Bergen, Barony Rosendal in Hardanger, and the contemporary Austråt manor near Trondheim, and parts of Akershus Fortress.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} dignitaries {{who lived in}} Chadderton's manor houses, Chadderton's {{population}} during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers, {{most of whom were}} occupied in farming, either growing and milling of grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, pigs and domestic fowl. Workers supplemented their incomes by hand-loom spinning and weaving of wool at home. The community was ravaged by an outbreak of the <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> in 1646.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-14th century Bristol is {{considered}} to have been England's third-largest town (after London and York), with an estimated 15–20,000 inhabitants {{on the eve of}} the <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> of 1348–49. The plague inflicted a prolonged demographic setback, with the population estimated at between 10,000 and 12,000 during the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} {{the abandonment of}} villages from the bubonic plague of 1348, the <b>Black</b> <b>Death,</b> which killed a third to a half of the population (he states), and the subsequent new colonisation and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the Breckland of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as Leicestershire were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in Gloucestershire can be seen today only as a ground-plan from the air.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the emperor}} was later unable {{to cope with}} the {{mounting}} incursions of Ottoman forces, Hungarian invasions from the northwest and the <b>Black</b> <b>Death.</b> In an ill-fated attempt to combat these problems, he divided the country between his two sons, thus forcing it to face the imminent Ottoman conquest weakened and divided.|$|E
50|$|Ipsen's steady {{career on}} stage was offset by a {{volatile}} personal life. She was married four times. Ipsen was married {{the first time}} in 1910 with the actor Jacob Texière, but the marriage was dissolved within the same year. Then, in 1914, she married civil engineer H.H.O. Moltke, and they divorced after three years. Her marriage in 1919 with film director Emanuel Gregers lasted four years. Ipsen was married for a fourth time in 1932 to the journalist Ejnar Black. They remained together for 17 years until <b>Black's</b> <b>death</b> in 1949. After <b>Black's</b> <b>death,</b> Ipsen isolated herself outside of work, preferring the company of her assistant and housekeeper, Stella Jensen.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of <b>Black's</b> <b>death</b> in January 2016, Devon and Cornwall Police were five weeks from {{submitting}} a file to the CPS in which they sought a new {{decision on whether to}} prosecute him.

5|$|In 1337 Phillip confiscated Aquitaine and Ponthieu from Edward alleging he was {{harbouring}} Phillip’s fugitive {{cousin and}} enemy, Robert of Artois. In response, Edward proclaimed himself king of France {{to encourage the}} Flemish to rise in open rebellion against the French king. The conflict, later known as the Hundred Years' War, included a significant English naval victory at the Battle of Sluys, and a victory on land at Crécy, leaving Edward free to capture the important port of Calais. A subsequent victory against Scotland at the Battle of Neville's Cross resulted in the capture of David II and reduced the threat from Scotland. The <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> brought a halt to Edward's campaigns by killing perhaps {{a third of his}} subjects. The only Plantagenet known to have died from the <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> was Edward III's daughter Joan in Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, {{diplomatic}} contact continued {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols, until the Ilkhanate dissolved in the 1330s, and {{the ravages of}} the <b>Black</b> <b>Death</b> in Europe caused contact with the East to be severed. A few marital alliances between Christian rulers and the Mongols of the Golden Horde continued, such as when the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a (d. 1312) and later to his successor Uzbek (1312–1341).|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic microbes, and toxins {{that they}} produce, have been {{developed}} as possible agents of warfare. Crude forms of biological warfare have been practiced since antiquity. In the 6th century BC, the Assyrians poisoned enemy wells with a fungus said to render the enemy delirious.
