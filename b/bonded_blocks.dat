40|$|Triaxial {{compression}} {{tests were}} carried out on artificially structured soil samples at confining pressures of 25, 37. 5, 50, 100, 200, and 400 [*]kPa. A binary-medium constitutive model for artificially structured soils is proposed based on the experimental results, the disturbed state concept (DSC), and homogenization theory. A new constitutive model for artificially structured soils was formulated by regarding the structured soils as a binary medium consisting of <b>bonded</b> <b>blocks</b> and weakened bands. The <b>bonded</b> <b>blocks</b> are idealized as bonded elements whose deformation properties are described by elastic materials, and the weakened bands are idealized as frictional elements whose deformation properties are described by the Lade-Duncan model. By introducing the structural parameters of breakage ratio and local strain coefficient, the nonuniform distribution of stress and strain within a representative volume element can be given based on the homogenization theory of heterogeneous materials. The methods for determination of the model parameters are given {{on the basis of}} experimental results. Comparisons of predictions with experimental data demonstrate that the new model provides satisfactory qualitative and quantitative modeling of many important features of artificially structured soils...|$|E

By analyzing the breakage mechanism of natural soils, the structured soils can be conceptualized as binary medium materials consisting of <b>bonded</b> <b>blocks</b> and weakened bands. On this basis, a new strength criterion is proposed for structured soils. The expressions of the strength criterion on both meridian and deviator planes are given to describe the strength properties of structured soils on these planes.

Two laboratory composites for indirect restorations, Solidex and Targis, and a conventional composite, Filtek Z 250, were tested. Forty-eight composite resin blocks (5. 0 x 5. 0 x 5. 0 mm) were incrementally manufactured, which were randomly divided into six groups, according to the surface treatments: 1 - control, 600 -grit SiC paper (C); 2 - silane priming (SI); 3 - sandblasting with 50 mm Al 2 O 3 for 10 s (SA); 4 - etching with 10 % hydrofluoric acid for 60 s (HF); 5 - HF + SI; 6 - SA + SI.

Therefore, {{the aim of the}} study was to evaluate the effect of in vitro ageing of RBC on its micro-tensile bond strength with resin luting cement (RLC). Materials and methods: Forty standardised RBC blocks (4 × 6 × 8 mm) were fabricated. Twenty blocks were divided into four groups (N= 5 per group). Group 1 (control) received no ageing; in group 2, specimens were exposed to 500 cycles of thermocycling (TC) at 5 – 55 °C; in group 3, specimens were exposed to 5000 cycles of TC and in group 4 specimens were placed in Sodium hydroxide (0. 1 N, NaOH) for one week. Following treatment, RBC blocks were paired with identical untreated RBC blocks and bonded, using RLC (Panavia F 2. 0) under constant load. RLC was cured for 160 s at the intensity of 650 mWcm− 2. <b>Bonded</b> <b>blocks</b> were sectioned using a diamond saw at 500 rpm and 250 ground force. A total of 160 specimen sticks were subjected to micro-tensile bond strength testing (Bisco Inc., Virginia, USA) at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Fractographic analysis was performed using a stereomicroscope (63 ×). Means of micro-tensile bond strength (μ-tbs) were analysed with ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test (P= 0. 05). Results: μ-tbs was significantly higher for group 1 (54. 20 ± 7. 34 MPa) as compared to group 2 (44. 17 ± 8. 61 MPa) and group 3 (20. 32 ± 7. 91 MPa). Specimens in group 4 debonded prior to μ-tbs testing. 77. 5 % specimens in group 1 and 100 % specimens in groups 2 and 3 showed adhesive failures at the RBC and RLC bonding interface.

METHODS: Three CAD/CAM ceramics(IPS e. max CAD, VITA ENAMIC and VITA SUPRINITY) were prepared into blocks(14 mm× 12 mm× 4 mm). Final crystallization for IPS e. max CAD and VITA SUPRINITY was obtained. Surface treatments on the ceramics were initially hydrofluoric acid(HF) (IPS Ceramic Etching gel) for 60 s and then a silane coupling agent(Monobond-S) for 60 s. Two blocks of each ceramic were bonded with six resin cements respectively: Clearfil SA Cement, Variolink II®, 3 M RelyX Ultimate, VITA Duo cement, seT and NX 3. <b>Bonded</b> <b>blocks</b> were cut into beams of 1. 0 mm 2 cross-sectional area and randomly distributed to two subgroups according to two water storage times: 6 and 12 months. They were tested in a universal testing machine. Fracture surfaces were examined with polarized microscopy and SEM to determine failure modes. These results were compared with the data previously reported for 24 -hour, 1 -month and 3 -month. Three-way ANOVA and Bonferroni tests were used for statistical analysis(p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Three-way ANOVA showed that all three independent factors(ceramic, resin luting cement) had significant effects on the bond strengths(p< 0. 001). Bond strengths in all groups decreased {{as a function of}} storage time. The 24 hour data was significantly higher than the other groups. The bond strength tested at 3, 6 and 12 months showed no statistical difference. Overall, the bond strength in Vita Suprinity® groups was the highest while IPS e. max® CAD groups had the lowest value in three ceramics(p< 0. 05). Variolink® II had the highest bond strength overall, followed by VITA Duo cement, 3 M RelyX™ Ultimate, NX 3 and Clearfil SA Cement. seT presented the lowest bond strength.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the use of hydrogen bonds for the construction of nanoporous materials. These materials attract a great deal of interest because of their large surface area to volume ratio and their applications in areas such as filtration, separation, adsorption, catalysis, and ion conduction. Organic materials are especially appealing for these applications, because their properties can be tailored. The use of supramolecular interactions is required to control the organization of materials at the molecular level. Hydrogen bonds are ideal supramolecular interactions for the construction of these nanoporous materials, thanks to their directionality and reversibility. The directionality causes the positioning molecules {{in such a way that}} voids have been created in between the molecules, such as in two- and three-dimensional hydrogen bonded organic frameworks.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 66 human third molars were randomly divided in three equal groups: 1 - <b>Bonding</b> composite <b>blocks</b> with dual cured RelyX ARC cement to dentin without pretreatment. 2 - <b>Bonding</b> composite <b>blocks</b> with dual cured Rely XARC cement to immediately sealed dentin with single bond and 3 - <b>Bonding</b> composite <b>blocks</b> with dual cured Rely X ARC cement to immediately sealed dentin with single bond and a flowable composite. Shear bond strengths were measured with a universal testing machine. Data were analysed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey statistical tests. Results: Means and standard deviations of tensile bond strengths were as follows: group 1 : 8. 55 ± 3. 18, group 2 : 6. 67 ± 2. 21 and group 3 : 14. 07 ± 5. 02.

In this work a system consisting of the blocks of Si 3 N 4, which had been coated with a preceramic film containing a fine dispersion of silicon and a thin layer of germanium powder, were investigated to determine the effect of the thickness of the germanium film. The maximum service temperature is not determined by the melting point of the germanium since the germanium forms a higher melting point solid solution with the silicon in the film. Control of the thickness of the germanium film is critical as it was shown that thicker layers result in lower strength bonds due to differences in thermal expansion and the maximum service temperature is lower due to the lower liquidus temperature of the leaner Ge-Si solid solution.

40|$|AIM: Liquid resin in bonding {{composite}} {{has been}} identified as a major irritant in human cell culture. However, liquid resin is assumed to {{play a critical role in}} composite adhesion to enamel by forming resin tags to mechanically interlock with acidetched enamel prisms. By <b>bonding</b> occlusal bite <b>blocks</b> to enamel surfaces without the use of liquid resin, mechanical interlocking between the liquid resin tags and acid-etched enamel prisms should not exist to enable the bite blocks to resist heavy functional occlusal forces. Survival analysis of a case series of composite bite <b>blocks</b> <b>bonded</b> without liquid resin will demonstrate if mechanical interlocking is critical in the mechanism of enamel adhesion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of mechanical interlocking in the mechanism of enamel adhesion of composite resin in vivo. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: Twenty-three patients had bilateral occlusal bite <b>blocks</b> <b>bonded</b> on the posterior teeth to raise the bite during fixed orthodontic therapy. Depending on the individual clinical situation and enamel quality, the choice of the occlusal surfaces of teeth for the bite <b>blocks</b> <b>bonded</b> without liquid resin included 55 and 65 (1 case), 17 and 27 (1 case), 16 and 26 (14 cases), 35 and 45 (1 case) and 36 and 46 (6 cases). The service durations of the occlusal bite blocks recorded were analyzed using the Kaplan Meier product limit method. RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 23 patients (95. 7 %) experienced no failure of the bilateral occlusal bite blocks. Forty-five of 46 (97. 8 %) occlusal bite blocks lasted up to the end of their intended treatment purposes. They remained on average for 27. 8 months (range 1. 5 to 29. 0 months), and the only failure occurred at 1. 5 month. The failed bite block was replaced to finish the treatment (additional 3. 1 months).
