5|$|The {{basic number}} system {{consists}} of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 {{using a combination of}} these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its <b>basic</b> <b>value</b> multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E

In these cases, access to that data is provided by copying a 32- or 64-bit value, versus copying an entire data structure. However, smaller values like integers are the same size as pointers (typically both are one word), so there is no advantage to passing a pointer, versus passing the value. Also, pass-by-reference inherently requires a dereferencing operation, which can produce noticeable overhead in some operations, typically those used with these <b>basic</b> <b>value</b> types, like mathematics.|$|E

We test a set of hypotheses that specify how the motivational structure of <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> constrains and gives coherence to core political values.

The study was made using a comparative qualitative method on a questionnaire survey that {{high school teachers}} answered {{from the perspective of}} the subject that they are teaching. The results indicate that teachers who have studied, and are teaching, humanities, more often experience confrontation with the <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> than teachers teaching other subjects. Also, the study shows that there is a common definition on what the <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> are even though the right of interpretation belongs to the individual.

40|$|Basically {{this study}} {{intended}} {{to find out}} essential <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> which support social harmony in conflict-prone areas, with a profound study at primary schools in Sambas regency, west Kalimantan. As revealed {{by a number of}} data sources, west Kalimantan is one of the areas which is prone to conflict. This is evidenced by the happening of several ethnic conflicts including in Sambas regency so that it is an important policy of the regional government to find a solution in order to prevent similar conflicts from happening again in the future. The profound study at primary schools is deemed highly essential since social harmony values should be instilled among the students at an early age. In addition to that, teachers are knowledgeable about the foundation which creates an attitute of harmony among their students. The method used in this research is a qualitative one, with primary school teachers as the subject of the research. They represent three characteristic areas, namely: the urban area, the suburban area and the remote area of Sambas regency. Primary data collection was carried out through interview and focus group discussion (FGD), with the interactive model proposed by Miles & Huberman as technique of qualitative data analysis. The findings obtained from data collection and analysis revealed that social harmony has an important and profound meaning for society in Sambas regency. Basically there are three pillars of essential <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> which serve as the framework of social harmony, namely: (a) the <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> of mutual respect, (b) the <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> of tolerance and togetherness, and (c) the <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> of freedom and responsibility. Internalization of these <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> happen intensively especially in families through custom formation at households and society in Sambas regency. Meanwhile at schools these <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> are developed and reinforced through more formal custom formation by the teachers and school regulations...|$|R

40|$|Do the {{political}} {{values of the}} general public form a coherent system? What might be the source of coherence? We view political values as expressions, in {{the political}} domain, of more <b>basic</b> personal <b>values.</b> <b>Basic</b> personal <b>values</b> (e. g., security, achievement, benevolence, hedonism) are organized on a circular continuum that reflects their conflicting and compatible motivations. We theorize that this circular motivational structure also gives coherence to political values. We assess this theorizing with data from 15 countries, using eight core political values (e. g., free enterprise, law and order) and ten <b>basic</b> personal <b>values.</b> We specify the underlying <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> expected to promote or oppose each political value. We offer different hypotheses for the 12 non-communist and three post-communist countries studied, where the political context suggests different meanings of a <b>basic</b> or political <b>value.</b> Correlation and regression analyses support almost all hypotheses. Moreover, <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> account for substantially more variance in political values than age, gender, education, and income. Multidimensional scaling analyses demonstrate graphically how the circular motivational continuum of <b>basic</b> personal <b>values</b> structures relations among core political values.

It also appeared that one of the schools had more students who finished school with final grades.  The result that we have got showed that there is a difference between these two schools in the <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> work and that the school that worked with this continuously has also bigger amount of students with final grades.  During work on this study we discovered other issues that we hope someone else can answer in the future...|$|R

Values are desirable goals that are sought by individuals to satisfy their needs and are important for understanding career orientations in terms of protean and boundaryless career orientations and career anchors. However, how career orientations or career anchors fit into a well-established and supported model and into the structure of <b>basic</b> human <b>values</b> remains an important and under-investigated question. The aim {{of this study was to}} use Schwartz's model of structural values to empirically explore the relationships and structural correspondences among <b>basic</b> <b>values,</b> career orientations, and career anchors. A heterogeneous sample of 238 employees from French-speaking Switzerland (Mage = 35. 60, SD = 13. 03) completed the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ 5 X), the Protean and Boundaryless Career Attitudes Scales (PCAS, BCAS), and the Career Orientation Inventory (COI) via an anonymous and confidential survey questionnaire. The results showed that it was possible to meaningfully position both career orientations and career anchors in Schwartz's values structure. The protean and boundaryless career orientations were positively related to Schwartz's <b>basic</b> <b>values</b> that emphasized openness to change and career anchors meaningfully followed the motivational continuum of these <b>basic</b> <b>values.</b> Overall, the overlap among the <b>basic</b> <b>values,</b> career orientations, and career anchors appeared relatively important, suggesting that these <b>basic</b> <b>values,</b> orientations, and anchors should be considered simultaneously to understand and address the factors and processes underlying individuals' career choices and paths...|$|R
