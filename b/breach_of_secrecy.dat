The publication of the conversations between then Governor of the Bank of Italy Antonio Fazio, senior management of Unipol and Italian centre-left politician Piero Fassino was a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> rules and was seen at the time as an attempt to discredit Berlusconi's political rivals. Their publication also eventually led to the collapse of the proposed takeover of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by Unipol and the resignation of Fazio. The head of the company used by Italian prosecutors to record the conversations has been previously convicted of stealing the recordings and making them available to Berlusconi. On 7 February 2012, at an initial court hearing, Berlusconi denied he had listened to the tapes and ordered their publication. On 7 March 2013, Berlusconi was sentenced to a one-year jail term. On 31 March 2014, the Milan Court of Appeal ruled that whilst the evidence did not clear Paolo and Silvio Berlusconi from guilt, they were both acquitted due to the statutes of limitations, although a €80,000 compensatory award to Fassino was upheld.|$|E

Manhattan Project leaders called the article [...] "a complete lack of responsibility, compliance with national censorship code and cooperation with the Government in keeping an important project secret", and considered drafting Raper into the military, but the article apparently did not cause Axis spies to investigate the project.

40|$|Abstract: The Norwegian return codes, used {{within an}} Internet voting project piloted in September 2011, intend to {{simultaneously}} achieve both receipt-freeness and individual verifiability. They are delivered as text messages with a code representing {{the value of}} a voter’s cast ballot, but, according to the Norwegian Government, they would not <b>breach</b> the principle <b>of</b> <b>secrecy,</b> and they are not voting receipts, since the voter could always cancel the vote. However, some international electoral standards, like the Recommendations on E-voting from the Council of Europe, clearly forbid an Internet voting system that enables a “voter to be in possession of proof of the content of the vote cast. ” This paper analyzes {{the extent to which the}} Norwegian system complies with this standard and it concludes that there is no contradiction in using a teleological approach. ...|$|R

40|$|Model {{checking}} {{approaches to}} the analysis of security protocols have proved remarkably successful. The basic approach is to produce a model of a small system running the protocol, together with a model of the most general intruder who can interact with the protocol, and then to use a state exploration tool to search for attacks. This has led to a number of new attack upon protocols being discovered. However, if no attack is found, this only tells us that there is no attack upon the small system we modelled; there may be an attack upon some larger system. This is the question we consider in this paper: we present sufficient conditions on the protocol and its environment such that if there is no attack upon a particular small system (with one honest agent for each role of the protocol) leading to a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> (using [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a static analysis framework for detecting instances <b>of</b> security <b>breaches</b> in infinite mobile and cryptographic systems specified using {{the languages of}} the 7 r-calculus and its cryptographic extension, the spi calculus. The framework is composed from three components: First, standard denotational semantics of the 7 r-calculus and the spi calculus are constructed based on domain theory. The resulting model is sound and adequate with respect to transitions in the operational semantics. The standard semantics is then extended correctly to non-uniformly capture the property of term substitution, which {{occurs as a result}} of communications and successful cryptographic operations. Finally, the non-standard semantics is abstracted to operate over finite domains so as to ensure the termination of the static analysis. The safety of the abstract semantics is proven with respect to the nonstandard semantics. The results of the abstract interpretation are then used to capture <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> the <b>secrecy</b> and authenticity properties in the analysed systems. Two initial prototype implementations of the security analysis for the 7 r-calculus and the spi calculus are also included in the thesis. The main contributions of this thesis are summarised by the following. In the area of denotational semantics, the thesis introduces a domain-theoretic model for the spi calculus that is sound and adequate with respect to transitions in the structural operational semantics. In the area of static program analysis, the thesis utilises the denotational approach {{as the basis for the}} construction of abstract interpretations for infinite systems modelled by the 7 r-calculus and the spi calculus. This facilitates the use of computationally significant mathematical concepts like least fixed points and results in an analysis that is fully compositional. Also, the thesis demonstrates that the choice of the term-substitution property in mobile and cryptographic programs is rich enough to capture <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> security properties, like process secrecy and authenticity. These properties are used to analyse a number of mobile and cryptographic protocols, like the file transfer protocol and the Needham-Schroeder, SPLICE/AS, Otway-Rees, Kerberos, Yahalom and Woo Lam authentication protocols...|$|R
