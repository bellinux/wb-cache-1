50|$|Museum of Abu Ali Ibn Sino in Afshona {{village of}} Peshku {{district}} of Bukhara region {{was formed in}} connection with the 1000th anniversary of the great thinker. The building was small; the halls incorporating with each other were not comfortable for demonstration of exhibits and the museum’s activities. In the years of independence, the building was reconstructed and re-equipped taking into account all condition necessary for a museum. In November 2006, solemn opening ceremony of the updated museum of Abu Ali Ibn Sino, equipped on modern museum standards took place. At the same time, according to the plan for development of Peshku district of Bukhara region a medical college, information-resource center, library, polyclinic, hotel and a teahouse started to operate.The museum has following sections “The Age of Ibn Sino”, “Contemporaries of Ibn Sino”, “The life and work of Ibn Sino”, “Activity of Ibn Sino in the Academy of Ma’mun”, “Scientific heritage of ibn Sino”, “Legacy of ibn Sino and Modern Science”, “Ibn Sino and modern medicine”. More than 700 exhibits disposed on the podium lead away the visitors to the era of medieval Maverannahr. Among interesting artifacts found in the ancient buildings of Bukhara region there are ceramic subjects, coins and jewelry of the 9th and 10th centuries. Special interest of visitors is called by a <b>breadboard</b> <b>model</b> of an ancient drugstore of the 7th century which was found out during excavation on site of ancient settlement Paykand.|$|E

40|$|MERTIS (MERcury Thermal {{infrared}} Imaging Spectrometer) is {{an advanced}} infrared remote sensing instrument {{that is part}} of the ESA mission BepiColombo to planet Mercury. The enabling technology that allows sending the first spectrometer for the thermal infrared spectral range to Mercury is an uncooled microbolometer. One of the challenges is the calibration of the instrument. Radiometric and spectroscopic <b>breadboard</b> <b>models</b> of MERTIS were used to develop proper calibration methods. In the context of the calibration we are reporting on the ongoing efforts to separate non-scene and scene signal portions from each other. The non-scene signal portion is contained in the raw image data sets and is usually the dominating signal contribution. The conventional method to measure the non-scene signal contributions using a shutter or space-view and perform a time-interpolation is compared to an approach using linear pixel-to-pixel relations in which information from the outer regions of the image matrix is used for the estimation of the non-scene signal components of the inner regions where additional scene signal components exist. The results of both methods are discussed in terms of noise or errors of the extracted scene information. The proposed method could be used without further instrument modifications offering a functional redundancy which is important to keep alive the MERTIS operation in the case of a breakdown of the mechanically stressed high-speed shutter device. ...|$|R
