5|$|North American river otters live {{an average}} of 21 years of age in captivity, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> reach 25 years of age. However, they {{normally}} live about 8 to 9 years in the wild, but are capable of living up to 13 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be aggressive with other dogs {{to try to}} prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> become dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys {{can be an effective}} tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
5|$|Steaks {{are usually}} grilled, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be pan-fried, or broiled. Steak is often grilled {{in an attempt}} to {{replicate}} the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.|$|E

5|$|Tellurites can be leached {{from the}} mixture {{with water and}} are {{normally}} present as hydrotellurites HTeO3− in solution. Selenites are also formed during this process, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be separated by adding sulfuric acid. The hydrotellurites are converted into the insoluble tellurium dioxide while the selenites stay in solution.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{computers}} to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E

5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, {{the source of}} nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen {{is available in the}} soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria like archaea are prokaryotic – unicelluar, {{and having}} no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle. Bacteria are microscopic, {{with a few}} {{extremely}} rare exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis. Bacteria function and reproduce as individual cells, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> often aggregate in multicellular colonies. Some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex swarming structures, operating as multicellular groups {{as part of their}} life cycle, or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as E.coli.|$|E

Piped water is {{supplied}} by Yorkshire Water who also maintain the sewerage system. About 1% of the population use water from private supplies. They are usually in the more remote parts of the East Riding. The majority are bore holes <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be wells or natural springs.|$|E

5|$|Dogs {{that are}} {{employed}} to guard sheep help to mitigate human–wolf conflicts, {{and are often}} proposed {{as one of the}} non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves. Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviors, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression. The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation, especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock-guarding dogs. However, shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.|$|E
5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} tree. As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in {{the canopy of}} a host tree and begin life as an epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since it effectively girdles the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> still be harmed by competition for light, water and nutrients. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E
5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} {{the uniqueness of the}} solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the uniqueness of the solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E

Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want to repeat the necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, Marge {{gets the}} family {{together}} to discuss romance, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only come up with vignettes from their failed relationships {{in the form of}} clips from previous episodes. Homer, however, saves the day when he brings up how he and Marge got together. Ultimately, the kids do not care for this one and wind up watching Itchy & Scratchy while Homer and Marge share a moment together.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they have}} been seen by a {{predator}} they commonly try to escape, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also use distraction with an ink cloud ejected from the ink sac. The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.|$|E

5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} breed {{clubs in the}} UK {{supporting}} the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations on a yearly basis. The breed is friendly but tough and is suitable for interaction with older children. There are no breed specific health concerns, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be affected by spinal problems due to their elongated body and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{probably}} have the slowest {{growth rates of}} any reptile, continuing to grow larger for the first 35years of their lives. The average lifespan is about 60years, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> live to be well over 100years old. One such male even reproduced successfully {{for the first time}} at 111 years of age with an 80 year old female. Some experts believe that captive tuatara could live as long as 200 years.|$|E
