Note that booster transformers only [...] "boost" [...] the return of traction current through its intended path, the [...] "return conductor", rather than randomly through the earth, and do not boost, but rather reduce, the available voltage at the train, and introduce additional losses. The autotransformer system enforces the traction return current taking its intended path, while reducing the transmission losses, and therefore achieves both required objectives, of controlling return current leakage to earth and ensuring low energy loss, simultaneously. There is an initial cost penalty, because the previous return conductor, insulated to a fairly modest voltage, must be replaced by an anti-phase feeder, insulated to 25 kV, and the autotransformers themselves are larger and {{more expensive than the}} previous booster transformers.|$|E
50|$|The Flexible Plug and Play project, {{according}} to the submission documents, will test a number of so called smart devices on a distribution network {{in order to improve}} its efficiency and to allow more power to flow through it without reinforcement.1) Dynamic Line Rating device. The maximum current an overhead power line can carry is an ever changing value affected by the weather. However, in distribution networks the conventional approach is to operate lines with static or seasonal limits. In theory dynamic line rating allows constant monitoring of a line’s capacity. Knowing the limits of a section of the network at any moment will help to operate the network at its peak.2) Automatic Voltage Control. An AVC device monitors voltage levels and automatically adjusts them within pre set limits. In the Flexible Plug and Play project it is envisaged AVCs will be working as part of an Automatic Network Management system.3) Modern Protection Relay. The existing network uses directional over-current (DOC) protection relays which cannot handle reverse power flows. It’s said the modern protection relay will be designed to overcome this problem. It will be tested at the March and Peterborough sub stations.4) Frequent Use Switches. The distribution network in the test area uses isolator switches at Normally Open Points (NOPs) however, they are not designed for frequent use and have to be reset manually. Frequent Use Switches would be controlled remotely, allowing different network configurations to be used.5) Quadrature <b>Booster</b> <b>transformer.</b> Quad Boosters are common on transmission networks but not on distribution grids. According to the Flexible Plug and Play progress report dated June 2012 a Quad Booster could be fitted at the British Sugar factory site in Wissington. Apparently the Combined Heat & Power plant operated by British Sugar has seasonal limits on generation export due to the suboptimal loading of the three incoming 33kV circuits. The Quadrature Booster will be connected to one of the circuits to ensure load balancing and it will enable the export of additional generation from the CHP unit onto the electricity grid.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{industrial}} processes {{are based on}} a large amount of electronic devices such as programmable logic controllers and adjustable speed drives. Unfortunately, electronic devices are sensitive to disturbances, and thus, industrial loads become less tolerant to power quality problems such as sags, swells, and harmonics. Voltage sags are an important power quality problem. In this paper proposed a new configuration of Static Var Compensator (SVC) considering three different conditions named as topologies and <b>Booster</b> <b>transformer</b> with fuzzy logic based controller, capable of compensating for power quality problems associated with voltage sags and maintaining a prescribed level of voltage profile. Fuzzy logic controller is designed to achieve the firing angles for SVC such that it maintains voltage profile.

The diode-clamped multilevel voltage source converter topology lies in the framework that DC-link capacitors common to three phases that can lower switching frequency. Small reactive filter component and easy implementation of modulation make this topology attractive.

40|$|AbstractVoltage sags can be {{symmetrical}} or unsymmetrical {{depending on}} {{the causes of the}} sag. At the present time, {{one of the most common}} procedures for mitigating voltage sags is by the use of dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs). By definition, a DVR is a controlled voltage source inserted between the network and a sensitive load through a <b>booster</b> <b>transformer</b> injecting voltage into the network in order to correct any disturbance affecting a sensitive load voltage. In this paper, modelling of DVR for voltage correction using MatLab software is presented. The performance of the device under different voltage sag types is described, where the voltage sag types are introduced using the different types of short-circuit faults included in the environment of the MatLab/Simulink package. The robustness of the proposed device is evaluated using the common voltage sag indices, while taking into account voltage and current unbalance percentages, where maintaining the total harmonic distortion percentage of the load voltage within a specified range is desired. Finally, several simulation results are shown in order to highlight that the DVR is capable of effective correction of the voltage sag while minimizing the grid voltage unbalance and distortion, regardless of the fault type...|$|E
40|$|There {{exists a}} {{critical}} mass in research related to adaptive protection approaches that {{address some of the}} shortcomings of conventional protection functions. This is in response to concerns in the reliability of conventional protection which manifested itself in some severe disturbances in more recent years. Despite the fact that adaptive protection offers a compelling technical solution to some of these performance problems, the industry has not widely adopted adaptive protection approaches as a de facto policy for future protection scheme implementations. This is attributed to the difficulties associated with the testing of such schemes where no significant work has been reported yet. Furthermore, the benefits vs. the risks associated with such a protection strategy are not well understood. This is coupled with the conservatism towards radical changes in the way the power system is operated. As such the work reported in this thesis complements the existing body of research in order to address some of the major technical and institutional challenges associated with adopting adaptive protection schemes for future networks, especially those networks that exhibit flexibility in operation to deal with uncertainty in generation and to maximise asset utilisation. These are network characteristics that adaptive protection approaches are seen to be an effective enabler of. This thesis focuses on formal structural and behavioural modelling of adaptive protection schemes as means to effectively validate their functional operation and verify their performance. Novel contributions have been made in formalising a user requirements driven architecture for these schemes. Furthermore, significant contributions have been made to conducting formal algorithm verification that complements inherently limited standard protection scheme validation techniques. The thesis makes thorough use of a proposed adaptive distance protection scheme for circuits with quadrature <b>booster</b> <b>transformers</b> to communicate the challenges, lessons learned and contributions in designing, implementing and testing adaptive protection schemes...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis deals with the application of analytical and numerical tools to Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) management in railways. Analytical and numerical tools are applied to study the electromagnetic coupling from an alternating current (AC) electrified railway line, and to study the electrical properties of concrete structure - a widely used component within the railway infrastructure. An electrified railway system is a complex distributed system consisting of several sub-systems, with different voltage and current levels, co-located in a small area. An analytical method, based on transmissions line theory, is developed to investigate railway electromagnetic coupling. The method is used to study an electrified railway line in which the running rails and earth comprise the current retum path. The model is then modified to include the presence of <b>booster</b> <b>transformers.</b> The analytical model {{can be used to}} study the railway current distribution, earth potential and electromagnetic coupling - inductive and conductive coupling - to nearby metallic structures. The limiting factor of the analytical model is the increasing difficulty in resolving the analytical equation as the complexity of the railway model increases. A large scale railway numerical model is implemented in Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) and the electromagnetic fields propagated from the railway model is studied. As this work focuses on the direct application of TLM in railway EMC management, a commercially available TIM software package is used. The limitation of the numerical model relates to the increased computation resource and simulation time required as the complexity of the railway model increases. The second part of this thesis deals with the investigation of the electrical properties of concrete {{and the development of a}} dispersive material model that can be implemented in numerical simulators such as TIM. Concrete is widely used in the railway as structural components in the construction of signalling equipment room, operation control centres etc. It is equally used as sleepers in the railway to hold the rails in place or as concrete slabs on which the whole rail lines are installed. It is thus important to understand the contribution of concrete structures to the propagation of electromagnetic wave and its impact in railway applications. An analytical model, based on transmission line theory, is developed for the evaluation of shielding effectiveness of a concrete slab; the analytical model is extended to deal with reinforced concrete slab and conductive concrete. The usefulness and limitation of the model is discussed. A numerical model for concrete is developed for the evaluation of the effectiveness of concrete as a shield. Initially, concrete is modelled as a simple dielectric material, using the available dielectric material functionality within TLM. It is noted that the simple dielectric model is not adequate to characterise the behaviour of concrete over the frequency range of interest. Better agreement is obtained with concrete modelled as a dispersive material having material properties similar to that exhibited by materials obeying Debye equation. The limitations of the dispersive material model are equally discussed. The design of conductive concrete is discussed, these have application in the railway industry where old existing structures are to be converted to functional rooms to house sensitive electronic system. A layer of conductive concrete can be applied to the facade to enhance the global shielding of the structure...|$|R
40|$|Distribution {{system needs}} to be {{protected}} against voltage sags, swells that adversely affect the reliability & quality of power supply at the utility end. These problems can be mitigated with voltage injection method using custom power device, Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR). In this paper we design a Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) which is utilized for power quality improvement. The main power quality problems like voltage sag and swell are studied in this paper. The device used to phase out voltage sags and a swell in the distribution lines is the Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR). The DVR can restore the load voltage within few milliseconds by injecting series voltage which is actually missing voltage in to system through series connected <b>booster</b> <b>transformer,</b> when it is subjected to voltage sags. Generally DVR can be connected to grid through inverter topologies such as Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) or Current Source Inverter (CSI). This device can be implemented to protect a group of medium or low voltage consumers. This study present compensation of sags and swells voltage during single line to ground, double line to ground and three phase line to ground faults. By using DVR technology, power quality enhances, which is shown in simulation waveform...|$|E
40|$|As {{distinct}} from radial electric power lines, in high voltage networks {{in most cases}} consumers are fed from two sides. The advantages in this arrangement are: greater reliability of electricity supply, better power quality, and smaller active power losses. However, the losses could be reduced more fully only when the network is a uniform loop or a uniform network fed at two sides by equal EMFs. If these conditions are not complied with, circulating current (or equalizing current when EMFs at two sides are not equal) arises, and the active losses increase proportionally to its square, whereas voltage losses – proportionally to its first degree. To reduce losses in such cases, the referred currents should be eliminated. Irrespective of its cause, a <b>booster</b> <b>transformer</b> mostly is used for this purpose. If a non-uniform loop includes voltage of one standard rating, the circulating current can be eliminated by cheaper means than with a booster transformer: by inserting an induction coil into the loop. When the loop contains two standard voltage ratings, two transformers or autotransformers are needed. In this case, to eliminate circulating current not only an induction coil should be inserted into the loop but also the transformer turn ratio is to be appropriately adjusted. When during a day the loads change approximately proportionally, the reactance of the induction coil may remain constant, however the turn ratio of a transformer should be changed in either case – whether the loads vary proportionally or not. When the network is not a loop but has independent EMF at two sides, two quantities must be calculated: the magnitude of EMF difference {{at the ends of}} a network, and the inductance of the coil...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{electromagnetic}} compatibility (EMC) problems of distributed electrical networks, especially that caused by lightning to electrified railway. Lightning transients were found to damage important devices that control train movements, causing traffic stoppage and delays. This thesis attempts to develop computational models for identification of parameters influencing the coupling phenomena between those devices and lightning. Some supporting experimental investigations are also carried out. This thesis forms the groundwork {{on the subject of}} lightning interaction with the electrified railway networks. Lightning induces transient overvoltages in railway conductor systems such as tracks, overhead wires, and underground cables, either due to direct lightning strike to the system or due to the coupling of electromagnetic fields from remote strikes. Models based on multiconductor transmission line theory were developed for calculating the induced voltages and currents. A transmission line return stroke model, that can predict the remote electromagnetic fields comparable to experimental observations, is also developed. Earlier works on modeling earth return impedances for transient studies in power distribution systems are not readily applicable for railways for lightning transients, in cases of low earth conductivities found in Sweden and for large variation in conductor heights. For the wires above ground, the ground impedance models were modified for wide range of frequencies, soil conductivities and wide spread of conductor heights. Influences of pole insulator flashovers, pole-footing soil ionizations and interconnections between the conductors on the lightning surge propagation are studied. Wave propagation in buried shielded and unshielded cables with ground return is studied. Simplified, valid and computationally efficient ground impedance expressions for buried and on-ground wires are proposed. A model for the coupling phenomena (transfer impedance) through multiple cable shields with multiconductor core is also proposed. Besides, experimental studies on lightning induced transients entering a railway technical house, failure modes of relay and rectifier units used in the train position/signaling applications for lightning transients are performed. A high frequency circuit model for the <b>booster</b> <b>transformer</b> for lightning interaction studies is developed. The simulation models are being converted to user-friendly software for the practicing engineers of the railway industry...|$|E

The basis for the comparison was a given part of the Swedish railway system, with steel transportation trains. Primarily, {{emphasis was placed on}} running time and energy consumption in simulation results. Two transformer systems were analyzed, <b>booster</b> and auto <b>transformers.</b> The high voltage transmission line, parallel to the railroad track, was disconnected in some simulations. Inclination detail level, describing slope of the railway tracks, was different in the two simulators. Therefore, the inclination was set to zero in some simulations, to make the conditions more equal for comparison. In simulations with inclination, the running time was 17 - 22 minutes shorter in TPSS than in TracFeed. The energy consumption for one train in TPSS was 23 % lower than in TracFeed. Without inclination, the running time in TPSS was only about one minute longer than in TracFeed. The energy consumption, without inclination, was only 3 % lower than the TracFeed results. The change in active and reactive power of the trains was also studied. In addition, the power flow from the converter stations was analyzed. TPSS simulation times were nearly one minute, while the mean simulation time in TracFeed was four minutes. The simulations showed that there are possibilities of development of TPSS. A necessary development concerns the inclination. The possibility to simplify TracFeed was also tested. A couple of neural networks were built in order to test the feasibility of replacing some calculations with simulations...|$|R
40|$|For {{studying}} {{the response to}} transients caused by lightning and other electromagnetic disturbance sources, electrified railway systems can be represented as a system of multiconductor transmission lines (MTL) above a finitely conducting ground. The conductors present in this system would be wires for traction power supply, auxiliary power, return conductors for traction current, the tracks, and finitely conducting ground. In contrast to conventional power systems, where the MTL system is usually only terminated at the line ends, there are lumped devices connected in series and as shunt along the railway network, for example, <b>booster</b> and auto <b>transformers,</b> track circuits, and various interconnections between conductors, influencing surge propagation. In this doctorial thesis a new method for incorporating lumped series and shunt connected devices along MTL systems is presented. Telegrapher’s equations, using the finite difference time domain method, are adopted for finding surge pulse propagations along the MTL systems, simultaneously solving for the lumped devices connected along the lines by means of Kirchoff’s laws for nodal currents and voltages using a circuit solver. As part of this work, case studies are carried out to determine voltages appearing across devices connected along MTL systems representative of a typical Swedish single-track electrified railway system, in cases of direct and indirect lightning strikes. The influence of soil ionization at the grounding points and the nonlinear phenomenon of flashovers between overhead wires and the poles are also investigated. The calculations made show that the devices connected along this system, which are needed for normal and safe operation of the railway system, and nonlinearities are affecting the surge current and voltage distribution and peaks appearing along the MTL system and across devices...|$|R
