50|$|Market {{discipline}} {{is a topic}} of particular concern because of <b>banking</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance laws. Most governments offer deposit insurance for people making deposits with banks. Normally, bank managers have strong incentives to avoid risky loans and other investments. However, mandated deposit insurance eliminates much of the risk to bankers. This constitutes a loss of market discipline. In order to counteract this loss of market discipline, governments introduce regulations aimed at preventing bank managers from taking excessive risk. Today market {{discipline is}} introduced into the Basel II Capital Accord as a pillar of prudential banking regulation.|$|E

Our study also shows that the adjustments in retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates are asymmetric and rigid upwards during the regulated period, but tend to be rigid downwards during the deregulated period.

40|$|Effective Market Discipline (MD) puzzles {{financial}} {{economists and}} regulators for decades, while the recent bail-in legislation for European banks extremely raises {{the need for}} even stronger MD. It may not be {{exaggeration to say that}} a new regime for the European banking market is born after the aforementioned decision. This paper’s objective is the broader MD examination, using variables that are not usually included in MD studies, but concern the European Union (EU) and the European Monetary Union (EMU) in the last years. In particular, apart from <b>banking,</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance and pure macroeconomic indicators, we also include governance and sovereign debt indices. The new regime may need a new MD approach. We choose Greece to implement our assumptions, because it is the country with the most severe economic, sovereign and governance problems in the EU. We employ data for the period 2002 - 10. The empirical evidence supports that market discipline is superficial, while there is ample evidence that MD is directly influenced by the poor governance performance and the excessive government debt.
