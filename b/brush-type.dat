The self-assembly behavior of these block copolymers in aqueous solution was studied by dynamic light scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The critical micelle concentration of the synthesized polymers was found {{to depend on the}} length of the PEG side chains, but neither on the molar mass of the P(PEGMA) blocks nor the temperature. All of the block copolymers form micelles in the nanometer range. Emulsion polymerizations of styrene were carried out using the obtained <b>brush-type</b> amphiphilic block copolymers, and the influence of the block copolymer structure, surfactant concentration, and temperature was studied. The PS-b-P(PEGMA 1100) copolymers seem to be the most efficient surfactants at low polymerization temperature, providing good colloidal stability. Monodisperse hairy particles with core-shell structures (observed by cryo-TEM) were obtained using the block copolymers with the long PEG side chain and the highest molar mass. Polystyrene films prepared from the latexes, containing the <b>brush-type</b> copolymers, display a lower contact angle than that obtained in films with conventional low molecular weight surfactants.

The nanocarbons derived from PAA contain nitrogen, whose content decreases with increasing heat treatment temperature. At each heat treatment temperature, the specific surface area as well as pore structure is similar for both the nanocarbons derived from PAA and PVC. Nevertheless, the markedly large electrochemical capacitance, measured in 1 mol dm- 3 sulphuric acid, is obtained for the PAA-derived nanocarbons, compared with that from PVC, due to pseudocapacitance arising from nitrogen species in the former nanocarbons. Despite the specific surface area of less than 250 m 2 g- 1, the PAA-derived nanocarbons reveal the capacitance as large as ~ 130 F g- 1.

Despite {{the remarkable}} potential of such nanoparticles in various biomedical applications, the stabilisers used in formulating the nanoparticles are often limited to commercially available polymers {{such as the}} Pluronic block copolymers. This study explored the potential of using Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) technology to design amphiphilic <b>brush-type</b> polymers {{for the purpose of}} stabilising phytantriol and monoolein-based lipid dispersions. The synthesised <b>brush-type</b> polymers consisted of a hydrophobic C 12 short chain and a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGA) long chain with multiple 9 -unit poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) brushes with various molecular weights. It was observed that increasing the PEO brush density and thus the length of the hydrophilic component improved the stabilisation effectiveness for phytantriol and monoolein-based cubosomes. Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments confirmed that the RAFT polymer-stabilised cubosomes had an internal double-diamond cubic phase with tunable water channel sizes. These properties were dependent on the molecular weight of the polymers, which were considered in some cases to be anisotropically distributed within the cubosomes. The in vitro toxicity of the cubosomes was assessed by cell viability of two human adenocarcinoma cell lines and haemolytic activities to mouse erythrocytes. The results showed that phytantriol cubosomes stabilised by the RAFT polymers were less toxic compared to their Pluronic F 127 -stabilised analogues.

40|$|Drugs {{which are}} chiral possess {{different}} forms (R- and S-enantiomers) {{which are made}} up of the same chemical composition but are spatially arranged differently. This difference can affect the behaviour of enantiomers of chiral drugs greatly. Separations are an important tool in order {{to gain access to the}} different enantiomers of a racemic compound. Furthermore, quality control procedures in industry require fast, reliable and high throughput analysis methods for these separations. Several analytical techniques are available for chiral separations including gas chromatography (GC), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), capillary electrophoresis (CE) and capillary electrochromatography (CEC). Yet separations via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) represent the most prominent method. Miniaturization is a current trend sweeping across all areas of separation science and indeed the development of stationary phases for use in nano-HPLC is an area of increasing interest. Monoliths for nano-HPLC are advantageous as stationary phase supports, over conventional particle-packed equivalents, due to their dual pore distribution, enhanced mass transfer ability and relatively wide macropores allowing high flow rates with minimal backpressures. Inorganic silica-based monoliths are particularly advantageous due to their wide range of solvent compatibility and ease with which their surface may be derivatized. With Pirkle/brush type chiral stationary phases, which utilise low molecular mass chiral selectors, it is possible to introduce the selector via polymerization to the monolithic support for a comprehensive coverage. In this work, hybrid-type native silica monolithic capillary columns (100 μm i. d) were prepared in 8 generations and tested for efficiency. Those monolithic columns which displayed H (height equivalent to theoretical plate) < 12 micron were silylated with anchor group. Characterization of the monoliths morphology was elucidated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Surface coverage of the monolith with anchor group was chromatographically evaluated, with modification process repeated if necessary. A cinchonine-derived chiral selector monomer was prepared with good yield (75 %) and covalently attached to the anchor-modified silica monoliths via radical initiated addition co-polymerization to produce <b>brush-type</b> chiral stationary phase.

30|$|The linkage of PEG {{onto the}} surface of SPIONs was further corroborated by DLS and zeta {{potential}} measurements. The DLS profiles of bare SPION and PEG-SPION in water (at different pH values) and different solvents are depicted in Figure S 3 (see Additional file 1). From this Figure, the hydrodynamic diameter (DH) of SPIONs was observed to be higher than that of PEG-SPION in most of the solvents. At neutral pH, the observed DH is 145.8  nm (PDI[*]=[*] 0.28) and 115  nm (PDI[*]=[*] 0.154) in water for SPION and PEG-SPION, respectively. These sizes are much higher than those observed in HRTEM. This is ascribed to the agglomeration of SPION {{as a result of their}} mutual magnetic attraction, whereas the formation of <b>brush-type</b> configuration of PEG (due to the high grafting density of 5 chains of PEG per nm 2 surface area of SPION and large Flory radius of 4.7  nm) may partly contribute to the increase in hydrodynamic diameter for PEG-SPION. In acidic and basic conditions, the induction of surface hydration or the formation of electric double layer (EDL) on the surface of dispersed PEG-SPION may lead to the increased hydrodynamic diameter [48, 49]. Further, when dispersed in biological buffers, such as PBS 7.2 and NaCl solution, both SPION and PEG-SPION tend to flocculate due to Debye screening of electrostatic repulsion or adsorption of counter-ions [50].|$|E

We found that these polymer-surfactant complexes are able to respond by changing their sizes, both in bulk and at the air-solution interface, when T is increased above the coil-globule transition temperature (LSCT) of the copolymer. However, the thermoresponse was found to be dependent on surfactant concentration, cs: for cs = 2. 8 mM, the opposite behavior takes place, i. e. the size increases with T. At the interface, the intensity of the effect produced on the surface tension by increasing T above LCST diminishes continuously as cs increases, reducing the ability of the interfacial complex to respond to temperature changes. We studied the stability of aqueous foams formulated with these mixtures as a function of T and cs.

Enantiopure diamines, namely 1, 2 -diaminocyclohexane and 1, 2 -diphenyl- 1, 2 -ethylene-diamine were treated with 3 -(triethoxysilyl) propyl isocyanate, to yield reactive ureido selectors that were eventually attached to unmodified silica particles through a stable, bidentate tether, through a facile two-step one-pot procedure. A full chemical characterization of the new materials has been obtained through solid-state NMR (both 29 Si and 13 C CPMAS) spectroscopy. Columns packed with the two Crab-like chiral stationary phases allow for different mechanisms of separation: normal phase liquid chromatography, reversed phase liquid chromatography and polar organic mode and show a high stability at basic pH values. In particular, the Crab-like column containing the 1, 2 -diphenyl- 1, 2 -ethylene-diamine selector proved a promising candidate for the resolution {{of a wide range}} of racemates (including benzodiazepines, N-derivatized amino acids, and free carboxylic acids) both in normal phase and polar organic mode.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} diverse members of Amaryllidaceae is Cyrtanthus Aiton, a large, sub-Saharan Africa genus of {{approximately}} 55 species found mostly in South Africa. To investigate phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships within Cyrtanthus, sequence data from the plastid ndhF gene and the ITS nrDNA region for 41 species were analyzed with parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian-inference approaches. Various recombination detection algorithms were used to test for interspecific hybridization in the ITS alignment. The genus resolved as monophyletic, comprising three poorly to well-supported major lineages: a predominantly Afrotemperate lineage, largely restricted to seasonally moist sites in summer rainfall southern Africa, a subtropical lineage found mostly in nonseasonal rainfall regions, often in dry habitats, and a Cape Floristic Region-centered lineage in which most species are concentrated in the summer-dry to nonseasonal rainfall southwest. The ITS sequence alignment shows no evidence for reticulation between any of the species. Relationships inferred by the molecular data disagree with those derived from morphological data, but agree with previously published groupings based on karyotype morphology. Fitch optimization of selected floral characters on the combined gene tree reveals recurrent patterns of convergence. Ornithophilous floral forms occur in parallel among the three primary clades, putatively sphingophilous species are concentrated in the Afrotemperate lineage in seasonally moist upland grasslands; the <b>brush-type</b> Aeropetes tulbaghia butterfly and inferred long-proboscid fly pollination syndromes are unique in the Cape lineage. Macroecological factors inferred to have influenced the evolution of Cyrtanthus are changes in rainfall seasonality, the advent of fire, {{and the availability of}} new habitats at high and low altitudes and in rock-free soils or rock crevices. This study gives greater clarity on relationships within the genus and enables its division into three informal infrageneric groups...|$|E
40|$|Mixtures of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) with {{plasticizers}} {{have been}} used in ion-selective electrodes for many years. The same material has proven useful in solid-phase microextraction (SPME), both with and without artificial receptors. In the first study, we hypothesized that by increasing the polymer concentration in plasticized PVC membranes containing artificial receptor, the extraction selectivity of target barbiturates over similar molecules could be improved. This is verified by SPME-CE experiments. At 30 %, 40 %, and 50 % (w/w) PVC, as polymer concentration increases, selectivity for barbiturate extraction over other cyclic imides becomes better in the presence of barbiturate receptor and worse without it. In the second study, SPME has been applied to the analysis of eight barbiturate drugs and drug analogs in serum samples. Finally, a screening method for fast evaluation of chiral selectors has been proposed based on molecular recognition in plasticized PVC membrane. The advantage of this method {{is that it does not}} require the covalent immobilization of either the analyte or the selector, and the potential selector usage is at the microgram level. The method needs to be verified prior to application to libraries of peptide mimics. R/S-N-(3, 5 -dinitrobenzoyl) -phenylglycine bonded to silica gel is a commercial available <b>brush-type</b> CSP which can resolve various racemic mixtures, such as Troger's base, 2, 2, 2 -trifluoro- 1 -(9 -anthryl) - 1 -ethanol, 1 -phenyl-butanol, etc. We have used freely diffusing selectors (R or S-N-(3, 5 -dinitrobenzoyl) -phenylglycine and its methyl ester). The selectors are doped into plasticized PVC membranes. The test analytes are the three mentioned above. Distribution difference of the two enantiomers of the Troger's base and 1 -phenyl-butanol could be detected by the extraction of plasticized PVC membrane containing the test chiral selector. The difference in the selectivities is significant (p< 0. 01) by a t-test. Thus, we have demonstrated that a partitioning experiment with a selector-doped membrane can be used to determine the efficacy of a potential chiral selector...|$|E
40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{focuses on}} three main topics: 1) 	Design and {{evaluation}} of new stable bidentate urea-type stationary phases for HPLC and UHPLC. New totally synthetic bidentate urea-type phases were envisioned for HPLC and UHPLC, characterized by a high stability, a wide application range and an excellent suitability for LC-MS. Four conceptually new stationary phases {{have been developed for}} the separation {{of a wide variety of}} polar compounds by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) through a facile one-pot two-step procedure with the aim of obtaining high hydrolytic stability in a variety of elution conditions. A full chemical characterization of the new materials has been obtained through solid-state NMR (both 29 Si and 13 C CPMAS) spectroscopy. A major application field of the bidentate urea-type stationary phase with free amino groups USP-HILIC-NH 2 -sil was sugars analysis, usually hampered by anomer peak splitting and instability of the stationary phases under conditions normally employed to suppress it. Complex mixtures of mono-, di- and oligosaccharides were successfully resolved under mild chromatographic conditions, which also allowed an easy interface with mass spectrometry. The potential of such materials was shown in the separation of other highly polar compounds, including polyols, hydroxybenzoic acids, nucleobases, and vitamins. A parallel project was developed using a very similar synthetic scheme where enantiopure diamines were treated with (3 -isocyanatopropyl) triethoxysilane to yield reactive ureido selectors that were eventually attached to unmodified silica particles through a stable, bidentate tether. The two steps were part of an easy and time-saving one-pot procedure, as was the case for the HILIC phases. These new monomeric <b>brush-type</b> chiral stationary phases, hereafter called “Crab-like” CSPs, are characterized by an excellent stability and enantioselectivity, a high permeability and efficiency, as well as an extended compatibility with all solvents and no memory effect, which allowed us to operate under normal phase, reversed phase and polar organic mode conditions. Comparative studies were performed with commmercial polymeric <b>brush-type</b> CSPs bearing the same chiral selector (1, 2 -diaminocyclohexane and 1, 2 -diphenyl- 1, 2 -ethylenediamine) in order to evaluate the resolution and performance skills of the new “Crab-like” CSPs in different elution modes. 2) 	Extending the use of “Inverted Chirality Columns Approach (ICCA) ” for enantiomeric excess determination in absence of reference samples: application to a water-soluble camptothecin derivative. The aim of the present study was to extend the use of the “Inverted Chirality Columns Approach (ICCA) ” previously developed for the identification and quantitation of the trace enantiomer in highly enriched samples of the camptothecin (CPT) family of drugs to a novel water-soluble CPT derivative, namely namitecan (ST 1968), currently undergoing phase I clinical trials as anticancer agent. Namitecan, identified from a series of hydrophilic 7 -oxyiminomethyl derivatives, contains a free terminal amino group, which traditionally hampers the analysis under normal-phase HPLC conditions. Nevertheless, commercially available Pirkle-type chiral stationary phases (CSPs) available in both the enantiomeric forms (i. e., having the same bound selector with opposite configuration) mainly operate under normal-phase HPLC conditions. For this reason, namitecan was pre-columnN-derivatized with isocyanates A–D and their sulfur analogues E–H to reduce its polarity by converting the amino group into a fragment compatible with the chiral recognition mechanism (i. e., ureido and thioureido groups). Once the optimal columns system and derivatizing agents were selected, an original enantioselective HPLC–MS/MS technique was developed on the Whelk-O 1 CSPs. 3) 	Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of the epimerization processes in Artemisinin-derived antimalarial drugs by Dynamic High Performance Liquid Chromatography (D-HPLC). Stereodynamic investigations have been performed on two active artemisinin derivatives having labile stereogenic centres, namely dihydroartemisinin (DHA), and an in vivo degradation product of DHA containing an endoperoxide, an aldehyde and a ketonic moiety, namely MKA (monoketoaldehyde). We were able to obtain MKA through pyrolysis or basic degradation of DHA and have fully characterized its structure through a variety o analytical techinques. The stereodynamic studies performed have focused on a stereolabile hemiacetalic function present in both molecules. Linear Solvation Energy Relationships (LSER) analysis was used to study the thermodynamics of the epimerization process in DHA and MKA. Computational studies have provided further data on the differential stability and acidity of the two epimeric forms of MKA, while a kinetic investigation is introduced...|$|E
40|$|In {{the face}} of today’s rapidly growing energy demands {{accompanied}} by limited, non-renewable supplies, development of novel energy alternatives that are both renewable and inexpensive has become more important than ever. Development of 3 D structures exploring the properties of nano-materials and biological molecules has been shown through the years as an effective path forward {{for the design of}} advanced bio-nano architectures for enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs). Despite advantages over conventional fuel cells, EFCs still suffer from several problems including low efficiency and stability. Overcoming these limitations in order to make them more viable for real world application is an ongoing challenge for researchers. Functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were covalently bonded to diazonium salt modified gold surfaces through carbodiimide chemistry creating a <b>brush-type</b> nanotube alignment. Having CNTs ordered in this nature developed a highly ordered structure with markedly high surface area that allowed for the attachment of protein/DNA assembly. The specificity of the enzyme immobilization was controlled by small protein structural motifs, called zinc fingers (ZnF) that bind to specific dsDNA sequences and may be genetically bound to small laccase (SLAC- 3 ZnF) or other redox enzymes. Utilizing scaffolds with gold nanoclusters (AuNC) for mediated electron transfer (MET), we test the capabilities for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) by SLAC- 3 ZnF. Direct absorption on SWNT results in poor ORR while using DNA results in slowed reaction kinetics. With the addition of AuNC, ORR and electron transfer are improved. Analytical techniques such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and enzymatic activity analysis, allowed characterization at each stage of development. Additionally, two methods for co-immobilization on consecutive tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzymes were investigated. Encapsulation using deacylated chitosan (chit) and tethering through amide bond linkage with 1 -pyrenebutanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (PBSE) were used to immobilize porcine heart malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate synthase (CS) on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). The effects of each method on the oxidation of L-malate (M) by MDH in the presence of CS are reported. Poly-(methylene green) -modified MWNT “buckypaper” (PMG-BP) was used to reduce cell overpotential through regeneration of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) from reduced form (NADH).
