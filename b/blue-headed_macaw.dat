25|$|The morphology-based {{taxonomy}} of C. spixii, intermediate between the macaws {{and the smaller}} Arini, has been confirmed by recent molecular phylogenetic studies. In a 2008 molecular phylogenetic study of 69 parrot genera, the clade diagrams indicate that C. spixii split from the ancestral parakeets before the differentiation of the modern macaws. However, {{not all of the}} macaw genera were represented in the study. The study also states that diversification of the Neotropical parrot lineages occurred starting 33 mya, a period roughly coinciding with the separation of South America from West Antarctica. The author notes that the study challenges the classification of British ornithologist Nigel Collar in the encyclopedic Handbook of the Birds of the World, volume 4 (1997). A 2011 study by the same authors which includes key genera of macaws further elucidates the macaw taxonomy: the clade diagram of that study places C. spixii in a clade including the macaw genera which is sister to a clade containing the Aratingas and other smaller parakeets. Within the macaw clade, C. spixii was the first taxon to diverge from the ancestral macaws; its nearest relatives are the red-bellied macaw (Orthopsittaca manilata) and the <b>blue-headed</b> <b>macaw</b> (Primolius couloni).|$|E
5000|$|The {{red-bellied macaw}} and <b>blue-headed</b> <b>macaw</b> are {{typically}} only found in captivity in a zoo setting, or {{as part of}} a breeding program and are rarely kept as pets.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} in the {{south-west}} Amazon and adjacent east Andean foothills. It prefers openings in humid forest, e.g. along rivers or clearings, but has also been observed in Moriche Palm swamps and outskirts of towns. It occurs from the lowlands up to an altitude of 1550 m (5100 ft). As several other parrots, the <b>blue-headed</b> <b>macaw</b> is known to visit clay-licks.|$|E
50|$|The {{capture of}} {{individuals}} for the wild bird trade potentially presents a serious problem. It {{is rare in}} captivity and consequently prices are high (US$12,500 but {{the past few years}} have declined as low as $4,000 - 5,000 US in some EU countries). International trade in this species was virtually unknown in 1993, where CITES only registered three legally traded individuals, but this had risen to 55 individuals in 2000. As of August 2007, the International Species Information System listed only 26 individuals in zoos outside its native countries, and Loro Parque (not included on ISIS) has 35+ individuals. CITES reported that approx. 50 illegally held <b>blue-headed</b> <b>macaws</b> were seized throughout the World in 1993-2000, and an investigation in Germany in 2001 resulted in approx. 30 individuals being seized.|$|R
50|$|About 520 {{bird species}} have been {{reported}} in the park including: the <b>blue-headed</b> <b>macaw,</b> Spix's guan, the bat falcon, the red-bellied macaw, the sunbittern, the spangled cotinga, the king vulture, the white-necked jacobin, Chapman's swift, the ocellated poorwill, the pygmy antwren, the white-throated toucan, the jabiru, the golden-tailed sapphire, the Amazon kingfisher, the harpy eagle, the red-necked woodpecker, the scarlet macaw, the Amazonian royal flycatcher, etc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-headed</b> <b>macaw</b> or Coulon's macaw (Primolius couloni) is {{native to}} eastern Peru (except in north), {{north-western}} Bolivia (mainly in Pando), and far western Brazil (only in Acre). It has a total length of about 41 cm (16 in), making it {{a member of the}} group of smaller macaws sometimes known as the mini-macaws, which includes any species of macaw with a total length of 50 cm (20 in) or less. As in all macaws, its tail is long and pointed and the bill is large and heavy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-headed</b> <b>macaw</b> is 41 cm (16 in) long. It has mainly green plumage (often tinged olive, esp. below) {{with the}} head, flight {{feathers}} and primary coverts blue. The uppertail has a maroon base, a narrow green {{center and a}} blue tip. The undertail and underwing are greenish-yellow {{similar to that of}} several other small macaws (e.g. red-bellied and golden-collared macaw). The medium-sized bill is pale greyish-horn with a black base (extent varies, but upper mandible in adults typically appears mainly pale). The iris is whitish with a narrow, often barely visible, maroon eye-ring. Unlike most other macaws, the facial skin and lores are dark greyish. The legs are dull pinkish. Juveniles resemble adults, but with the entire bill black, greyer legs, darker iris and the facial skin and lores white.|$|E

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{thought to}} be secure (i. e. Least Concern), the <b>Blue-headed</b> <b>Macaw</b> is now classified as Endangered in the IUCN Red List, based on an apparent decline and a population estimate of < 2500 mature individuals. We review published and unpublished sources, collating records from 61 localities in Peru, Brazil and Bolivia, and compiling information on habitat use, seasonality, group size, demography, and population density. We find the species {{to be associated with}} disturbed habitats at one site, but a broader analysis revealed no significant associations with forest type, riverine habitats, degree of disturbance or altitude. By mapping locality records, and accounting for discontinuities, we calculate an Extent of Occurrence of 460, 000 km 2. Range-wide data on encounter rates and flock sizes suggest that the species is sedentary and gregarious, with an overall population density of one mature individual per 10 - 50 km 2. Our figures for range size and density (both highly conservative) indicate that the global population estimate should be revised upwards to 9200 - 46, 000 mature individuals. Balanced against an increasing threat from trade, these data argue for a reversal in status to Vulnerable, with a shift to Near Threatened possible in future. Given these recent fluctuations in conservation status, the <b>Blue-headed</b> <b>Macaw</b> provides valuable insight into the difficulties of using IUCN Red List criteria to assess poorly known taxa. Red List assessments should be based on extensive reviews where possible, and analyses using Red List data should consider effects of data quality. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
