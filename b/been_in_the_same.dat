5|$|As the two nearby Manchester {{clubs have}} rarely <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{division}} as Stockport, historically {{there has been}} little rivalry with either club. However, the rivalry between Stockport County and Manchester City took form between 1997 and 2002, when the two clubs spent three out of five seasons in the same division and during the 1998/99 season, Stockport were a division above City.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis {{said that}} the church was {{supposedly}} founded in about 605 by St Eugrad.

St Gallgo's and St Eugrad's have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> parish since at least 1253.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Arsenal and Manchester United is a notable one in English {{football}} as both clubs are recognised for having great history and traditions. Although the two clubs have frequently <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> division as {{each other since}} 1919, the rivalry was instigated in 1990, when a brawl resulted in both clubs having points deductions in the Football League First Division.|$|E

5|$|Bolton's main rivals {{historically}} {{have been with}} near neighbours Bury, though this has lessened since the Second World War as the two clubs have rarely <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> league. The club also has a rivalry with Blackburn Rovers, as {{the two sides are}} separated by just fifteen miles and are both founder members of the Football League. More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with Wigan Athletic, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Bolton fans maintain a mutual dislike with the fans of Tranmere Rovers, Burnley, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E

5|$|The closest {{geographically}} {{has been}} the rivalry with the New York Jets. The Patriots and Jets have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> division (what is now the AFC East) since both teams' foundings in 1960, and have played each other {{at least twice a}} year since then. The rivalry between the Jets and Patriots has escalated since 1996, when Patriots head coach Bill Parcells left the Patriots under controversy to become the head coach of the Jets; he was replaced by former Jets coach Pete Carroll. Four years later Carroll was fired, and Parcells's assistant, Bill Belichick, resigned the day he was named the Jets' head coach to become the head coach of the Patriots. Six years after that, Eric Mangini, an assistant under Belichick, became the head coach of the Jets.|$|E

End points of a polygon <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> component of a complement of another polygon if number of common points of these polygons is even; 2. Two points of polygon L <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> component of a complement of polygon M if two points of polygon M <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> component of polygon L...|$|R

5|$|Miran Pastourma is a famed pastourma and sujuk charcuterie {{business}} and market in Athens, Greece. The {{market has been}} in operation since 1922.

The founder of the shop, Miran Kourounlian, {{is thought to be}} the man who brought pastourma to Athens for the first time. Miran is considered the largest company {{of its kind in the}} European Union. The flavour of pastourma coming from the historical enterprise permeates Euripides Street in the centre of Athens. Miran and its neighbor Arapian Cold Cuts are considered two of the historical establishments of Athens. Miran has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> spot in Euripidou Street since its opening in 1922. Miran is the recipient of multiple gourmet prizes.|$|E

25|$|Changes as to {{inequality}} and poverty {{have not always}} <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> direction.

25|$|With the {{destruction}} of the Chagas Cumberland had to satisfy himself that the Portuguese and Spanish were denied any of the riches on board. He successfully evaded attempts by the Spanish navy to find him. Alonso de Bazán failed to intercept Cumberland partly because he was hoping to protect the West Indian treasure fleet which was still in the Caribbean. Another fleet under Don Antonio De Urquiola also failed to find the English, despite his having <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> area when they headed home past Cape St. Vincent in September.|$|E
25|$|The park's {{tennis courts}} have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{location}} since c. 1925-1930. North {{of the five}} tennis courts is a playground. Historically, there were two playgrounds divided by an oval path; north of these areas were other recreation features, including a wading pool. During the 1950s the Chicago Park District reneovated the playground area and added additional features including an open shelter, a sand court, wading pool and a basketball court. Between 1970 and 1980 the wading pool was converted into a spray feature. The playground equipment and area has had additional updates in the ensuing years.|$|E
25|$|After Octavian's {{return to}} Rome, {{he and his}} {{supporters}} realised they needed the support of legions. Agrippa helped Octavian to levy troops in Campania. Once Octavian had his legions, he made a pact with Mark Antony and Lepidus, legally established in 43 BC as the Second Triumvirate. Octavian and his consular colleague Quintus Pedius arranged for Caesar's assassins to be prosecuted in their absence, and Agrippa was entrusted with the case against Gaius Cassius Longinus. It may have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year that Agrippa began his political career, holding the position of Tribune of the Plebs, which granted him entry to the Senate.|$|E

In 1968, he and four others (including William Sloane Coffin, Marcus Raskin, Mitchell Goodman, and Michael Ferber) were singled out for prosecution by then Attorney General Ramsey Clark on charges of conspiracy to counsel, aid, and abet resistance to the draft. Spock and three of his alleged co-conspirators were convicted, although the five had never <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> room together. His two-year prison sentence was never served; the case was appealed and in 1969 a federal court set aside his conviction.|$|E
25|$|The 1929 Tour de France had 22 stages, {{the longest}} over 366km, and lasted 5,257km.

A unique problem faced the organisers because Frantz and André Leducq had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> leading group and all three had the same elapsed time. For the only time in the Tour de France, the yellow jersey was given to three riders on the same day.|$|E
25|$|This royal {{residence}} has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> location by Norrström in {{the northern}} part of Gamla stan in Stockholm since the middle of the 13th century when the Tre Kronor Castle was built. In modern times the name relates to the building called Kungliga Slottet. The palace was designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and erected on the same place as the medieval Tre Kronor Castle which was destroyed in a fire on 7May 1697. Due to the costly Great Northern War which started in 1700, construction of the palace was halted in 1709, and not recommenced until 1727— six years after the war. When Tessin the Younger died in 1728, the palace was completed by Carl Hårleman who also designed a large part of its Rococo interior. The palace was not ready to use until 1754, when King Adolf Frederick and Queen Louisa Ulrika moved in, but some interior work proceeded until the 1770s. No major conversions have been done in the palace since its completion, only some adjustments, new interiors, modernization and redecorating for different regents and their families, coloration of the facades and addition of the palace museums.|$|E
