The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can <b>be</b> <b>utilized</b> beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can <b>be</b> <b>utilized</b> while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to bludgeon enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E
5|$|Northern Laos, however, was {{not going}} to be a {{priority}} for the Americans. It was decided at the Honolulu Executive Conference of April 1965 that U.S. aircraft could be used for interdiction in Laos only after close air support needs were met in South Vietnam. General Westmoreland was also granted veto power over bombing, interdiction, and reconnaissance programs outside territorial South Vietnam. That decision placed Barrel Roll behind South Vietnam, Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger in order of precedence. Only an estimated two percent of the total U.S. aerial effort in Southeast Asia was going to <b>be</b> <b>utilized</b> in northern Laos.|$|E

5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices {{of animals}} and food to deities, spirits, and ancestors at temples and shrines, {{in the belief that}} these items could <b>be</b> <b>utilized</b> by those in the spiritual realm.

These tombs were commonly adorned with uniquely decorated hollow clay tiles that function also as a doorjamb to the tomb. Otherwise known as tomb tiles, these artifacts feature holes in {{the top and bottom of}} the tile allowing it to pivot. Similar tiles have been found in the Chengdu area of Sichuan province in south-central China.|$|E

Making matters worse, Trưởng discovered that his force was to be reduced by the removal of the Marine Division.|$|E
