Coming into the game, Fran Dunphy had a NCAA tournament record 11-game losing streak, at Penn and Temple Owls. [...] "I probably think about it less than others do," [...] said Dunphy, [...] "but you think about it. I would <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> <b>if</b> I said I didn't. But I'm so thrilled for these kids and so thrilled to be in the tournament. We've had a nice run – this particular group, four straight years of going to the NCAA tournament is pretty special." ...|$|E

Beginning that year, Metallica won three consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance for the song [...] "One" [...] from ...And Justice for All, their cover of Queen's [...] "Stone Cold Crazy", and their eponymous album in 1992. When Metallica won the Grammy in 1992, drummer Lars Ulrich referenced the previous award by facetiously [...] "thanking" [...] Jethro Tull for not putting out an album that year, though they actually had released the album Catfish Rising in 1991. A decade after Jethro Tull defeated Metallica, Ulrich admitted: [...] "I'd <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> <b>if</b> I didn't tell you I was disappointed. Human nature is that you'd rather win than lose, but Jethro Tull walking away with it makes a huge mockery of {{the intentions of the}} event." [...] As of 2010, Metallica holds the record for the most wins in the metal category, with a total of six.|$|E

Seeing this, Todd Flanders asks his father, Ned, [...] "Does Mr. Simpson have a demon, daddy?" [...] To which Ned replies, [...] "Looks like it. Run and get daddy's exorcism tongs." [...] About the word, Mark Peters and Daniel O' Brien of Cracked.com wrote [...] "We'd <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> <b>if</b> we said we didn't go out to every Christian-themed general store in the country hoping to acquire our very own set of exorcism tongs the day this episode aired." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> <b>if</b> I said that I was sure I would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E
500|$|... "When {{it comes}} to having inestimable influence, Blink-182 might well be {{contemporary}} punk's version of the Beatles", wrote Scott Heisel in a 2009 Alternative Press cover story on the band. The same magazine later ranked Blink the fourth of the [...] "30 Most Influential Bands of the Past 30 Years," [...] just behind Radiohead, Fugazi, and Nirvana. The new generation of pop punk and alternative rock fans found the Blink sound [...] "hugely influential," [...] with Montgomery writing, [...] "...without them, there'd be no Fall Out Boy, no Paramore, or no Fueled by Ramen Records." [...] In 2011, The New York Times asserted that [...] "no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182," [...] stating that even as the band receded after its 2005 split, [...] "its sound and style could {{be heard in the}} muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine." [...] Maria Sherman of The Village Voice took that sentiment a step further, writing [...] "It's pretty simple: Blink-182 is the most important band of the '90s, dick jokes and all. Apart from the sound, Blink's ideology has been popularized [...] their presence is everywhere." [...] According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker, the group [...] "emerged as a touchstone, spawning more imitators than any American rock band since Nirvana." [...] Bands such as Panic! at the Disco and All Time Low originated covering Blink-182 songs. [...] "Anyone in our genre would <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> <b>if</b> they said they weren't influenced by Blink-182," [...] said Joel Madden of Good Charlotte. Bands such as You Me at Six and 5 Seconds of Summer have also named the band as influences.|$|E

[...] "I think it's unfair to fans and we should be honest. The band being over is definitely not my choice. I kind of was unlucky in that I came in [...] {{towards the end of the}} cycle when things naturally came to the end. There was so much drama surrounding the group, I think the music just got lost. I don't like all the drama and the negativity. We kind of fizzled out about two years ago.

[...] Former driver Allan McNish wrote in his BBC F1 column that the result was like [...] "a Grand Prix victory" [...] for Marussia and that it was [...] "a deserved reward for their dogged determination and never-say-die attitude."
