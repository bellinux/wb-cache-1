40|$|The ballast sediments deposit {{not only}} provide the {{breeding}} ground for the survival organisms, but also affect the weight balance {{of the ship and}} even accelerate the corrosion of the ballast tank. In this work the performance of a ballast water flushing system for the 138, 000 m 3 LNGC (Liquefied Natural Gas Carrier) double <b>bottom</b> <b>cargo</b> ship is studied. A simulation model of the ballast tank was made to conduct the numerical analysis. Besides, a scaled experimental setup was established on basis of the similarity principle. With different injecting velocities at the flushing inlet, the sediments distribution in the ballast tank is investigated and the energy consumption of the circulating pump is studied. The results show that by flushing the ballast water on the bottom, the sediments first accumulate at the far end, with the sediments volume fraction climbs up to 10 – 30 %, before gradually getting removed over time. Further, higher inlet velocity leads to a more rapid decrease of average sediments proportion in the ballast tank over time, but the energy consumption in circulating pump significantly increases as well. The required power for this proposed ballast water flushing system is within the common range and thus applicable in the cargo ship...|$|E

50|$|Initially the barges moored in {{the early}} canals would come {{to rest on the}} muddy <b>bottom</b> making <b>cargo</b> {{handling}} nearly impossible. So at certain places attempts were made to build wooden jetties and stone fortified quays to replace the sloping embankments of the canals such that barges could be moored alongside and be discharged and loaded even if the canal was empty of river water.|$|R
50|$|Because a troop {{transport}} carries less {{weight than}} a cargo ship, {{it was also}} found to be useful to place concrete in the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>cargo</b> holds {{in order to improve}} the ship's comfort, safety and performance.|$|R

50|$|In response, the FAA, {{in charge}} of {{actually}} implementing these recommendations, agreed with McDonnell Douglas that the additional venting {{would be difficult to}} install. Instead, they proceeded with the modification of the locking system, and additionally added a small clear window set into the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>cargo</b> door that allowed operators to directly inspect whether or not the latches were in place. Combined with the upgrades to the wiring that had already been on the books, this should prevent a repeat of the accident.|$|R
50|$|Key {{components}} of a cargo hook include the load beam, the keeper, and the attach point. The load beam is the solid piece of metal at the <b>bottom</b> of a <b>cargo</b> hook that supports the load. Usually it has a curved, narrow end {{which is used to}} load a ring, rope, or net onto the hook. The keeper is the locking, spring-operated mechanism that keeps the load from sliding off the load beam during transport. The attach point attaches the hook to the belly of the helicopter, swing system, or longline.|$|R
50|$|Initially, many of {{the stores}} in the mall were local stores instead of {{national}} chains that can be commonly found in many malls. In addition to those mentioned above, the first stores that opened with the mall included Paperback Booksmith, Playhouse Toys, Record Bar, Coker's, Candlewood, Singer's, Suzanne's, Baskin-Robbins, <b>Bottoms</b> Up, Curious <b>Cargo</b> Gifts, Kinney Shoes, Magic Cavern (Arcade), Der Dog Haus, Friedman's, Gingham Peddler, Lowery Organs, Lynn's Hallmark, Hickory Farms, Karmelkorn, La Marick, Leaf 'n Match, Merle Norman, Nelson's Men's Shop, Endicott-Johnson, and Orange Bowl. Most of these stores changed within the time span of Myrtle Square's thirty-year history, although some remained loyal and remained in the same location.|$|R

25|$|The cargo {{handling}} on Milazzo {{was intended to}} be automated and featured a railcar and elevator system. Two longitudinal compartments between the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>cargo</b> holds and the hull each contained twin rail lines spanning the length of the cargo carrying spaces. Extending {{from the bottom of the}} hull to above the ship's funnel were twenty elevator and crane combinations. To unload the ship, the onboard railcars were positioned under doors in each cargo hold which, filled the cars with the coal. The rail cars were then positioned in the elevators, raised to the top, and had their loads dumped into chutes that then discharged the coal from the ship. The ship could discharge all 14,000 long tons of her cargo in 48 hours.|$|R
40|$|The {{inherent}} {{moisture in}} a coal cargo constantly migrates under the dynamic ship motion during maritime transport. The moisture often builds {{up at the}} <b>bottom</b> of the <b>cargo.</b> The accumulated water, if not removed sufficiently by the bilge well, can cause safety concerns during a voyage and difficulties during cargo unloading. The study {{presented in this paper}} aims to develop a program to investigate the moisture migration within coal cargoes in order to assess and eliminate shipping risks. The moisture migration phenomenon is initially modelled by adopting the classic infiltration theory, and considering the ship motions experienced by bulk carriers. An experimental method is developed to empirically characterise the moisture migration of a coal sample under simulated shipping dynamics. A predictive model is also developed to estimate the total moisture migration in a full size cargo by properly scaling up the experimental results. The model was validated by bilge well log collected from actual coal shipping voyages from Australia to international destinations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{through the}} {{three-dimensional}} simulation {{of the cargo}} hold in the pre-cooling process–LNGC to reflect the changes of the cooling fluid at the internal space of the hold in pictures, which can directly and properly show the changes. In that case, it is of great practical and theoretical significance for us to master the Pre-cooling law, increase the Pre-cooling rate and the management of LNGC in the future. LNG Cargo Hold Pre-cooling System In the transportation process of the LNG carriers, the temperature differences between the inner LNG and the outer can reach close to about 200 ℃?. The thermal maintenance system and the temperature distribution of hull structure of the cargo hold are very complicated [1, 2]. In the analysis process of pre-cooling of LNG hold ship, the analysis of temperature field, pressure changes and thermal stress is of the especial importance. Hold pre-cooling system is shown in Fig. 1. LNG (typically- 162 ℃?) going through the inlet tube 1 the cooling fluid enters into the nozzle 5, then enters into the hold that needed pre-cooling. LNG firstly vaporizes when coming across the heat. In this process, it absorbs the vaporization latent heat and then becomes gas state. As liquefied natural gas has a certain pressure and speed, it can reach the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>cargo</b> hold. And the gasification gas exhausts through the outlet tube 2...|$|R

40|$|In {{this new}} era of space exploration, a host of launch {{vehicles}} are being examined for possible use in transporting cargo and crew to low Earth orbit and beyond. Launch vehicles derived from the Space Shuttle Program (SSP), known as Shuttle Derived Vehicles (SDVs), are prime candidates for heavy-lift duty because of their potential to minimize non-recurring costs and because the Shuttle can leverage off proven high-performance flight systems with established ground and flight support. To determine the merits of SDVs, a detailed evaluation was performed. This evaluation included a trade study and risk assessment of options based on performance, safety reliability, cost, operations, and evolution. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explain the approach, processes, and tools used to evaluate launch vehicles for heavy lift cargo transportation. The process included defining the trade space, characterizing the concepts, analyzing the systems, and scoring the options. The process also included a review by subject experts from NASA and industry to compare past and recent study data and assess the risks. A set of technical performance measures (TPMs) was generated based on the study requirements and constraints. Tools such as INTROS and POST were used to calculate performance, FIRST was used for prediction of reliability, and other software packages, both commercial and NASA-owned, were applied to study the trade space. By following a clear process and using the right tools a thorough assessment was performed. An SDV can be classified as either a side-mount vehicle (SMV) or an in-line vehicle OLV). An SMV is a Space Shuttle where the Orbiter is replaced by a cargo carrier. An ILV is comprised of a modified Shuttle External Tank (ET) with engines mounted to the <b>bottom</b> and <b>cargo</b> mounted atop. For both families of vehicles, Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are attached to the ET. The first derivate of Shuttle is defined as the vehicle with minimum changes necessary to transform the Space Shuttle into an SDV. Deltas from the first derivate were also formulated to study more SDV options. Examples of deltas include replacing the SRBs with larger and/or more SRBs, adding an upper stage, increasing the size of the ET, changing the engines, and modifying the elements. Challenges for SDV range from tailoring infrastructure to meeting the exploration schedule. Although SDV is based on the Space Shuttle, it still includes development risk for designing and building a Cargo Carrier. There are also performance challenges in that Shuttle is not optimized for cargo-only missions, but it is a robust system built on reusability. Balancing the strengths and weaknesses of the Shuttle to meet Lunar and Mars mission objectives provides the framework for an informative trade study. SDV was carefully analyzed and the results of the study provide invaluable data for use in the new exploration initiative...|$|R
