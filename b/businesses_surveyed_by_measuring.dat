40|$|Excerpt] A {{recent study}} of more than 1, 500 workers found that nearly a third {{considered}} flexibility {{to be the most important}} factor when considering employment offers. Surprisingly, employers are just as quick to sing praises of the benefits associated with accommodating their workforce. When asked in a survey, 91 percent of HR professionals agreed that flexible work arrangements positively influence employee engagement, job satisfaction, and retention. Although a few firms still contemplate whether or not the benefits outweigh the costs of increasing workplace flexibility accommodations, most organizations have already moved past these initial rounds of deliberation, and are beginning to calculate the implications. Eighty percent of all <b>businesses</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> WorldatWork offered flexible work option arrangements to employees. However, only 37 % of those surveyed report they have a formal, written philosophy or policy to support employee flexibility options. Currently, firms are faced with two real issues as they continue on the path of embracing workplace flexibility. First, how can an organization create a culture that maximizes as well as sustains the benefits of workplace flexibility? Secondly, what are some of the challenges an organization should be careful to avoid or mitigate when building out workplace flexibility...|$|R

We consider two types of local geographic characteristics: (1) economic variables that may influence firm risk and (2) other variables that may influence lender decisions. The analysis uses the 1993 National <b>Survey</b> of Small <b>Business</b> Finances (NSSBF) and detailed addi-tional data on the demographic and economic characteristics of the local area where each small <b>business</b> <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> the NSSBF is located. After controlling for a vari-ety of loan, firm, owner, and local market characteristics, we find no statistically significant differences in approval rates between White-owned firms and firms owned by Asians, Hispanics, or women. The only racial disparity that is statisti-cally significant is the difference in approval rates between White-owned and Black-owned firms. Importantly, our results show that the economic and demographic characteristics of a firm’s local geography should be considered if a more accurate quantification of these racial disparities and understanding of their underlying sources is desired...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new statistic to measure more accurately the cosmic sound speed of clusters of galaxies at different redshifts. This statistic is evaluated by cross-correlating cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations caused by the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect from observed clusters of galaxies with their redshifts. When clusters are distributed in redshift bins of narrow width, one could measure the mean squared cluster peculiar velocity with an error σC 2 S clusters of flux above 200 mJy which will be detected by PLANCK, coupled with high resolution microwave images to eliminate the cosmological part of the CMB fluctuations. The latter can be achieved with observations by the planned ALMA array or the NSF South Pole telescope and other <b>surveys.</b> <b>By</b> <b>measuring</b> the cosmic sound speed and the bulk flow in, e. g., 4 spheres of ∼ 100 h− 1 Mpc at z = 0. 3, {{we could have a}} direct measurement of the matter density 0. 21 0. 3 wit...|$|R
