40|$|The aim of {{this study}} aimed to {{investigate}} food pairings as an important sensory phenomenon in order to determine how different components in the selected food pairings affect and interact with other components. Three novel food pairings (<b>banana</b> <b>and</b> bacon, <b>banana</b> <b>and</b> olive oil, <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> <b>and</b> rice) were selected. A conjoint approach utilising qualitative (organic volatile analysis and descriptive sensory analysis) and quantitative (comparable semi quantitative organic volatile analysis and affective sensory tests) methods of analysis n an attempt to elucidate {{the success or failure of}} selected food pairings. Free choice profiling (descriptive sensory analysis) data was analysed using Generalised Procrustes analysis. The correlation between volatile analysis and descriptive sensory analysis results were analysed using ANOVA partial least squared regression. Hedonic results were analysed using a Friedman rank sum test, while preference results were analysed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. The food pairings of <b>banana</b> <b>and</b> bacon <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> <b>and</b> rice were found to be liked significantly more than <b>banana</b> <b>and</b> olive oil. The results of this study suggest that synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions between the volatile compounds in the foods influenced the hedonic ratings of these food pairings...|$|R

This observation may be attributed to low pH values, high acidity and high alcohol contents of the wines which are known to inhibit the growth of pathogens and gives fermenting yeast a competitive advantage in natural environment as reported by Reddy and Reddy (2005) and Chilaka et al. (2010). The absence of the growth of the yeast in pawpaw, <b>banana</b> <b>and</b> watermelon wine <b>and</b> <b>banana</b> <b>and</b> watermelon wine could be due to the high alcoholic content which exceeded the ethanolic tolerance level of the yeast used for fermentation.|$|R
5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from <b>bananas</b> <b>and</b> coconuts, of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees. In addition, David's winds uprooted many trees {{on the tops of}} mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E
5|$|Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid {{is often}} a result of {{chromosome}} number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced gametes. While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits. Triploid <b>bananas</b> <b>and</b> watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also parthenocarpic.|$|E

5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, {{the definition of}} a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, <b>bananas</b> <b>and</b> bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.|$|E
5|$|Iniki's {{high winds}} also downed 26.5% of the island's {{transmission}} poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800mile (1300km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service {{for an extended}} period of time. Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas were without power for up to three months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like <b>bananas</b> <b>and</b> papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.|$|E

There were also heavy losses to fruit trees {{and to the}} sugar industry, after the storm destroyed sugar mills and the rail lines that carried the cane to the mills. The storm destroyed over 100tobacco drying barns, including their contents. The destruction of the tobacco represented a $30million loss for the country. High winds also destroyed 96tobacco storage facilities, although the tobacco was removed beforehand. In Güines near Havana, Alma destroyed food crops, which further exacerbated Cuba's existing food shortages. Alma's passage also resulted in water shortages, prompting the government to urge residents to use less water. There was heavy structural damage across western Cuba, including in Havana, Matanzas, Camagüey, Pinar del Río, and Las Villas. The hurricane destroyed 1,083houses, and overall damage was estimated at $200million. Alma killed 12people {{in the country and}} injured 78others. In the storm's aftermath, Cuban officials sent about 100,000people from Havana to the cities around the capital to repair storm damage. Such forced labor was a complaint about the rule of Fidel Castro, after the food and supply shortages.|$|E

A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} has a {{well-developed}} sense of smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The smells of rotting meat, <b>bananas,</b> <b>and</b> coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Evo {{returned to his}} family, who had escaped the agricultural devastation of 1980's El Niño storm cycle by relocating to the Tropics of Cochabamba in the eastern lowlands. Setting up home {{in the town of}} Villa 14 de Septiembre, El Chapare, using a loan from Evo's maternal uncle, the family cleared a plot of land in the forest to grow rice, oranges, grapefruit, papaya, <b>bananas</b> <b>and</b> later on coca. It was here that Morales learned to speak Quechua, the indigenous local language. The arrival of the Morales family was a part of a much wider migration to the region; in 1981 El Chapare's population was 40,000 but by 1988 it had risen to 215,000. Many Bolivians hoped to set up farms where they could earn a living growing coca, which was experiencing a steady rise in price and which could be cultivated up to four times a year; a traditional medicinal and ritual substance in Andean culture, it was also sold abroad as the key ingredient in cocaine. Evo joined the local soccer team, before founding his own team, New Horizon, which proved victorious at the August 2nd Central Tournament. The El Chapare region remained special to Morales for many years to come; during his presidency he often talked of it in speeches and regularly visited.|$|E

The winds also stripped 16tons of grapefruit from their trees on the island. Nationwide, {{hundreds of thousands of}} trees fell during the storm. On Cayo Largo del Sur, the strong waves wrecked seaside cabanas. In Villa Clara Province, about 45mi (75km) of roads were damaged, and the winds destroyed the roofs of 28sugar refineries. In Havana, the storm wrecked a dozen buildings and downed several trees. Nationwide, the hurricane downed hundreds of power lines, leaving many towns without power, and power plants were damaged in Sancti Spíritus and Cienfuegos provinces. The hurricane also damaged 21hospitals and dozens of health clinics, along with 32schools. Extensive crop damage occurred along the storm's path, affecting thousands of hectares of arable land, and damaging 105agricultural facilities. Flooding affected the banana, fruit, coffee, sugar cane, and rice crops. Nationwide, the storm damaged about 25,406hectares of <b>bananas</b> <b>and</b> 686,893hectares of sugar cane, along with 36,249hectares of other crops. In Sancti Espíritu, 28,000tons of rice were wrecked, and in Matanzas, 7,500tons of citrus crops were heavily damaged. Total damages in the country were estimated at $362million (1996 USD).
