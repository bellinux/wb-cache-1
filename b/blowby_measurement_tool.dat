The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted knowledge translation intervention, using PTs as knowledge brokers (KBs) to facilitate the use in clinical practice of four evidence-based <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> designed to evaluate and understand motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). The KB model evaluated in this study was designed to overcome many of the barriers to research transfer identified in the literature. Methods A mixed methods before-after study design was used to evaluate the impact of a six-month KB intervention by 25 KBs on 122 practicing PTs' self-reported knowledge and use of the <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> in 28 children's rehabilitation organizations in two regions of Canada. The model was that of PT KBs situated in clinical sites supported by a network of KBs and the research team through a broker to the KBs. Modest financial remuneration to the organizations for the KB time (two hours/week for six months), ongoing resource materials, and personal and intranet support was provided to the KBs. Survey data were collected by questionnaire prior to, immediately following the intervention (six months), and at 12 and 18 months. A mixed effects multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the impact of the intervention over time and by region. The impact of organizational factors was also explored. Results PTs' self-reported knowledge of all four <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> increased significantly over the six-month intervention, and reported use of three of the four <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> also increased.

40|$|Abstract Background Given {{the current}} {{emphasis}} on networks as vehicles for innovation {{and change in}} health service delivery, the ability to conceptualise and measure organisational enablers for {{the social construction of}} knowledge merits attention. This study aimed to develop a composite tool to measure the organisational context for evidence-based practice (EBP) in healthcare. Methods A structured search of the major healthcare and management databases for <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> from four domains: research utilisation (RU), research activity (RA), knowledge management (KM), and organisational learning (OL). Included studies were reports of the development or use of <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> that included organisational factors. Tools were appraised for face and content validity, plus development and testing methods. <b>Measurement</b> <b>tool</b> items were extracted, merged across the four domains, and categorised within a constructed framework describing the absorptive and receptive capacities of organisations. Results Thirty <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> were identified and appraised. Eighteen tools from the four domains were selected for item extraction and analysis. The constructed framework consists of seven categories relating to three core organisational attributes of vision, leadership, and a learning culture, and four stages of knowledge need, acquisition of new knowledge, knowledge sharing, and knowledge use. <b>Measurement</b> <b>tools</b> from RA or RU domains had more items relating to the categories of leadership, and acquisition of new knowledge; while tools from KM or learning organisation domains had more items relating to vision, learning culture, knowledge need, and knowledge sharing. There was equal emphasis on knowledge use in the different domains. Conclusion If the translation of evidence into knowledge is viewed as socially mediated, tools to measure the organisational context of EBP in healthcare could be enhanced by consideration of related concepts from the organisational and management sciences. Comparison of <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> across domains suggests that there is scope within EBP for supplementing the current emphasis on human and technical resources to support information uptake and use by individuals. Consideration of <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> from the fields of KM and OL shows more content related to social mechanisms to facilitate knowledge recognition, translation, and transfer between individuals and groups. </p...|$|R

40|$|Craniofacial {{pre-operative}} {{planning and}} post-operative prediction applications are gaining {{more and more}} attention since the introduction of computer-aided devices in medical realm. This is due to that applications associated with this field are crucial for many tasks in diagnosis and treatment planning, as for example in the pre-operative and post-operative of craniofacial surgery. Currently, it is common practice in radiology to use 2 D <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> for the definition of distance, diameters, arcas or angles in planar slices of radiological data. This, however, gives only rough estimation for spatial measurements such as the extent of a 3 D object. In particular, the volume of 3 D objects can only be estimated roughly. Therefore, tools are required that integrate measurements in 3 D visualizations. The development of <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> {{to be used in}} the context of complex 3 D visualization is difficult because the user has to be provided with enough depth cues to access the position and orientation of such a <b>measurement</b> <b>tool.</b> A simple transition of existing line-based 2 D <b>measurement</b> <b>tools</b> into 3 D is not sufficient...|$|R
