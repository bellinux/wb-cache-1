The load capacity of strengthened beams S 2 M 1, S 2 M 2 and S 2 M 3 were 127, 133 and 137 kN, respectively. Wrapping of the <b>beam</b> <b>S</b> 2 M 3 by CFRP sheet {{resulted in more}} increasing of load capacity {{in comparison with the}} other specimens of S 2 -group (S 2 M 1 and S 2 M 2). As shown in Fig.  6 a, the load carrying capacity of beams S 2 M 1, S 2 M 2 and S 2 M 3 was increased 3, 8 and 11 % higher than that of the strengthened <b>beam</b> <b>S</b> 1 MN, until the debonding of tensile laminate occurred. After that, a behavior similar to S 1 MN was shown for beams S 2 M 1 and S 2 M 2; while the <b>beam</b> <b>S</b> 2 M 3 behaved as a beam with more strength than S 1 MN, until the debonding of compressive laminate occurred, and then showed a behavior similar to S 1 MN.

Then, as can be seen from Fig.  6 a, wrapping of the strengthened beams by CFRP sheet (S 2 M 3) can result in better performance of specimen. The failure mode of <b>beam</b> <b>S</b> 2 M 1 was interfacial debonding of tensile laminate induced by flexural crack formed in the beam mid-span, followed by the debonding and buckling of the bottom CFRP.

Of the 31 with redshift information, four redshifts are only minimum values based upon absorption lines and four other objects have uncertain redshifts based upon the detection of only a single emission line. Unlike BL Lacs from the complete X-ray-selected Einstein Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS) sample (XBLs), most RBLs possess weak but moderately luminous emission lines. The emission-line luminosities of RBLs are several orders of magnitude lower than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs); however, there is significant overlap in the luminosity distributions of the two classes.

In this context, various analytical models have been developed which describe overall effects of sea surface roughness on the Doppler signal mechanisms. Nevertheless, such models are limited in the complexity of the sea surface current estimation that can be used. In fact, the resolution of the sea surface Doppler velocity in azimuth direction is typically coarser as compared to the normalized radar cross section image. Approach: This study introduced a new method to retrieve sea surface current from RADARSAT- 1 SAR Standard <b>beam</b> mode (<b>S</b> 2) data. The method was based on the utilization of the Wavelength Diversity Ambiguity Resolving (WDAR) and Multi Look beat Frequency (MLBF) algorithms to remove Doppler centroid (f DC) ambiguity.
