40|$|Wader species {{migrating}} {{through the}} Sivash (Ukraine) use hypersaline and brackish lagoons. We studied {{the use of}} the two habitat types, and focused on the profitability of Brine Shrimp Artemia salina, prey species in hypersaline lagoons for Dunlins Calidris alpina, Curlew Sandpipers Calidris ferruginea and <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> Limicola falcinellus (although the latter was abundant in the brackish habitat only). Colour-marked Dunlins restricted feeding to the lagoon type in which they were initially captured. Dunlins and Curlew Sandpipers fed in areas where Brine Shrimps were of average size (0. 23 - 0. 34 mg AFDM). Artemia intake may be restricted by the visual foraging mode, as during rain and twilight pecking rates decreased to 45. 9 - 76. 8 % of values measured during dry periods in full daylight. Feeding activities were higher in hypersaline than in brackish lagoon (84. 6 and 69. 0 %, respectively). <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> feeding on Artemia had longer handling times (0. 87 s prey(- 1)) than Dunlins and Curlew Sandpipers (0. 58 and 0. 54 s prey(- 1)), which performed surface tension transport (STT) of prey in their pointed, thin bills. There were no differences in body mass increases in Dunlins in hypersaline and brackish lagoons. In <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> catching results suggest an increase in body mass in the brackish lagoon only. Supported by intake rate-based calculations of potential mass gain rates, we conclude that Brine Shrimp can form a profitable prey for Dunlins and for Curlew Sandpipers, but apparently not for <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>Sandpipers...</b>|$|R

40|$|We studied phenology, staging {{time and}} {{refuelling}} in <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> Limicola falcinellus stopping over during spring migration in the Sivash (Black Sea, Ukraine) in May 1991 - 94. In the study area, peak staging numbers of 2000 - 2500 individuals {{occurred in the}} third week of May. In May 1993, 460 birds were marked with a yellow dye and 126 of these were colour-ringed. Before 28 May no departure of birds dyed yellow could be detected; by 3 June all birds had departed. Colour-ringed adults in mid May 1993 staged for a minimum of 8. 2 days. After the observed departure of large flocks (24 May and later) the staging time of colour-ringed birds decreased significantly with body mass at the time of capture. Of birds mist-netted in 1991 - 94, 99. 3 % were in full summer plumage and 89 % were adults. In second-year birds, fuel deposition rate (measured between individuals) was 0. 44 g/day. In adults caught from early May to 24 May, overall fuel deposition rate was 1. 04 g/day (3. 4 % of lean body mass). Mean adult body mass in early May was 34. 8 g, increasing to 45. 5 g after 24 May. Estimated body mass at departure was 51 g. Departure body mass and flight range estimates suggest that although birds refuelled quickly, fuel loads are only just sufficient for an unbroken flight to Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula.

40|$|The <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> Limicola f. falcinellus is {{a little}} studied European wader species with {{unfavourable}} conservation status. We describe the migration of the <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> at Ottenby, southeast Sweden, from 1950 - 2000 using data from ringing activities and field observations. Numbers of ringed and observed Broad-billed Sandpipers varied considerably between years. There was no trend in numbers trapped over the study period, but a positive trend in numbers observed (probably explained by improved identification skills and observation possibilities). The populations passing Ottenby during autumn migration have probably been relatively constant in size during the last 50 years. The species was only rarely seen during spring migration (median 29 May). As shown by autumn ringing data, adult birds pass mainly in July (median date 21 July) and juveniles mainly in August (median date 17 August). Adult birds had on average somewhat longer wings and longer total-head than juvenile birds, {{but there were no}} significant differences in body mass between age groups. Broad-billed Sandpipers carried an average fuel load proportional to 25 % of lean body mass, which is relatively low for migrating waders, but some individuals may have had fuel stores of up to 50 - 70 %.

40|$|Broad-billed Sandpipers Limicola falcinellus {{were counted}} and trapped in Puck Bay on the {{southern}} Baltic coast in autumn. The number of arriving birds varied greatly between years. The observed pattern was not completely convergent with data gathered at Ottenby, Sweden, 220 km north of Puck Bay. It seems that within years these two stop-over sites might be used by different groups of migrants {{with the majority of}} birds that stopped in southern Sweden being able to fly over the Polish coast, making their next stop somewhere closer to the wintering grounds. Adult Broad-billed Sandpipers migrated {{in the second half of}} July, and juveniles in August and the first half of September. There were no significant differences in biometrics between adults and juveniles. Morphometric variables were not correlated with date in either age group. Hence, the assumption of earlier departure of females from the breeding grounds was not supported. On average, Broad-billed Sandpipers gained 1. 6 g/ day in body weight, with a maximum value of 4. 0 g/day (from 29 g to 33 g after one day). The theoretical flight range of Broad-billed Sandpipers departing from the Puck Bay region ranged between 1, 300 and 1, 400 km.

40|$|In spring, {{large numbers}} of {{migrating}} Broad-billed Sandpipers make a stop-over in the Sivash, a shallow lagoon system in the Crimea, Ukraine, between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Observed fuelling rates are high and, {{in just a few}} weeks, the birds can build up sufficient departure mass to reach their breeding grounds in a single non-stop flight (Verkuil et al. 2006). For feeding, Broad-billed Sandpipers prefer the brackish lagoons with a diverse benthic prey community. They ignore the hypersaline lagoons which are teeming with brine shrimp (Artemia sp.), a common prey for migrating Dunlins and Curlew Sandpipers in this area (Verkuil et al. 2003). In this paper we report on diet choice in relation to gut processing efficiency of different possible prey species for Broad-billed Sandpipers. We ask two questions: “Why do Broad-billed Sandpipers avoid feeding on brine shrimp in the hypersaline lagoons?” and “Do they specialize on one particular prey species in the brackish lagoons?”. Digestion efficiency of birds fed with brine shrimp was lower than for birds fed with the polychaete Nereis diversicolor or the crustacean Gammarus insensibilis. In the brackish lagoons, prey items seen ingested were both polychaetes (Nereis diversicolor) and larger crustaceans. Field observations on defecation intervals compared with identical observations on captive individuals suggest that both polychaetes and crustaceans were included in the diet. Although studies from other staging and wintering sites report that <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> usually eat polychaetes, we suggest that they optimize their energy intake by eating a multi-course meal...|$|E
40|$|Migratory {{activity}} of waders departing from north-western Australia in March-April 1991 was recorded by field observations and radar tracking. Field observations {{showed that the}} species concerned were mainly Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica, Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola and Great Knot Calidris tenuirostris. Peak migration {{took place in the}} second week of April. Most flocks departed in the late afternoon, never at high tide. A strong correlation was found between the tidal cycle and the timing of departures. The majority of the flocks flew towards NNW. Given that the next stopover site of especially the larger sized waders is in east and south China (Barter & Wang 1990) this observed departure direction is more westerly than a course along the great circle route (0 -degree). Wind patterns along two possible northward routes (a great circle and an island hopping route along the island-arc of South-east Asia) are analysed. In view of recoveries of waders ringed in Australia, especially the smaller waders (Mongolian Plover Charadrius mongolus, Large Sandplover Charadrius leschenaultii, Red-necked Stint Calidris ruficollis, Curlew Sandpiper Calidris ferruginea, <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> Limicola falcinellus, Terek Sandpiper Xenus cinereus) may migrate via the island hopping route, while the larger ones (Grey Plover, Great Knot, Red Knot Calidris canutus, Bar-tailed Godwit, Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus and Eastern Curlew Numenius madagascariensis) take a direct, great circle flight to China. Considerable tail wind assistance can be gained during the northward trip, more so along the island arc than along the great circle. Flight range estimates indicate that the smaller waders cannot fly the 4500 - 5500 km nonstop to east and south China, while the larger species can, on the condition that they experience tail wind assistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{coast of}} Bohai Bay, {{north-western}} Yellow Sea, {{is critical for}} waterbirds migrating along the East Asia-Australasian Flyway. Between 1994 and 2010, a total of 450 km 2 of offshore area, including 218 km 2 of intertidal flats (one third of the original tidal area in the bay), has been reclaimed along the bay for two industrial projects. This has caused the northward migrants to become concentrated in an ever smaller remaining area, our core study site. The spring peak numbers of two Red Knot subspecies in the East Asia-Australasian Flyway, Calidris canutus piersmai and C. c. rogersi, in this so far little affected area increased from 13 % in 2007 to 62 % in 2010 of the global populations; the spring peak numbers of Curlew Sandpiper C. ferruginea increased from 3 % in 2007 to 23 % in 2010 of the flyway population. The decline in the extent of intertidal mudflats also affected Relict Gulls Larus relictus, listed by IUCN as ‘Vulnerable’; during normal winters 56 % of the global population moved from the wintering habitats that were removed in Tianjin to the relatively intact areas around Tangshan. Densities of wintering Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata, and spring-staging <b>Broad-billed</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> Limicola falcinellus and Sanderling Calidris alba have also increased in the remaining areas. With the proposed continuation of land reclamation in Bohai Bay, we predict waterbird densities in the remaining areas to increase {{to a point of}} collapse.

40|$|Large {{numbers of}} waders {{migrating}} northward in spring use the Sivash, a large system of shallow, brackish and hypersaline lagoons in the Black Sea and Azov Sea region (Ukraine). The bottoms of these lagoons are often uncovered by the wind. Hence, for waders {{the time and}} space available for feeding depend on wind conditions. In hypersaline lagoons the benthic and pelagic fauna was very poor, consisting mainly of chironomid larvae (0. 19 g AFDM. m- 2) and brine shrimps Artemia salina, respectively. Brine shrimp abundance was correlated with salinity, wind force, wind direction and water depth. Dunlin Calidris alpina and curlew sandpiper Calidris ferruginea were the only species feeding on brine shrimp. As brine shrimp densities are higher in deeper water, smaller waders such as broad-billed sandpipers Limicola falcinellus are too short-legged to reach exploitable densities of brine shrimp. In brackish lagoons the benthic and pelagic fauna was rich, consisting of polychaetes, bivalves, gastropods, chironomid larvae, isopods and amphipods (8. 9 to 30. 5 g AFDM. m- 2), {{but there were no}} brine shrimps. Prey biomass increased with the distance from the coast, being highest on the site that was most frequently inundated. Dunlin, <b>broad-billed</b> <b>sandpiper</b> and grey plover Pluvialis squatarola were the most abundant birds in the brackish lagoon. Due to the effects of wind-tides only a small area was usually available as a feeding site. Gammarus insensibilis was the alternative prey resource in the water layer, and their density varied with wind direction {{in the same way as}} brine shrimp. Curlew sandpipers and dunlins in the hypersaline lagoons and broad-billed sandpipers in the brackish lagoons often changed feeding sites, probably following the variation in prey availability. Only because of the large size and variety of lagoons are waders in the Sivash always able to find good feeding sites...|$|E
