The carrier's Strategic Reserve deployment ran from April to June, and was followed by manoeuvres along the east coast of Australia until September. In the lead up to Melbournes 1961 deployment to the Strategic Reserve, the carrier visited Bombay, Karachi, and Trincomalee. It was the first time a flagship of the RAN had entered Indian waters. Melbourne returned to Australia in June, and on 15 June led several ships in a ceremonial entry to Sydney Harbour to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the RAN. In August, Melbourne was called upon to lead Exercise Tuckerbox, in the Coral Sea. Following the conclusion of Tuckerbox, the carrier visited several New Zealand ports before returning to Sydney for demonstration exercises and public relations activities.|$|E

But President García guaranteed financial disaster by his totally unexpected decision in July 1987 to nationalize the banks not already under government ownership.

It would not seem to have been a move necessary for any component of his program, or needed for government control in a banking sector in which it already had a dominant position.

This was a good and <b>bad</b> <b>year</b> for Jarrett; the good thing was that he won four races (New Hampshire was the fourth win in July) with the bad part being the fact that he suffered a hard crash and a minor concussion at the new Kansas Speedway. In an interview, Jarrett said that he did remember not being in the Protection One 400 but only getting on the plane to go to the racetrack. After that season, Jarrett's long-time crew chief Todd Parrott departed and Jimmy Elledge took over the role as a replacement. After seven races of the 2002 season, Jarrett and Parrott reunited, and Jarrett went on to clinch two victories (Pocono and Michigan) and rebounded to ninth in the final standings after the poor start to the year.|$|E
25|$|Since 1805 was a <b>bad</b> <b>year</b> for fishing, he instead took {{loads of}} coal from Suðuroy across the Atlantic to Bergen and Copenhagen, {{trying to open}} up direct trading, but was {{prevented}} from importing goods to the Faroes by the Danish Royal Trade Monopoly authorities. Instead, by vaccinating members of his crew successively using material from the previous man, he succeeded in bringing the first smallpox vaccine back to the Faroes, {{and with the help}} of one of his brothers spread vaccination through the islands. The following year, after again attempting to trade directly, he was convicted and fined on two charges of contravention of the trading laws, but cleared of smuggling goods back to the Faroes, having sold them to a Swedish ship in the Kattegat. He reacted by counter-suing the Tórshavn district sheriff, Joen Christiansen Øre, for large-scale smuggling; the Monopoly officials appear to have been conducting personal trading on the side. However, he seems to have dropped the lawsuit. In 1807, after a year's effort to overcome refusals by the local government in the Faroes and by the Monopoly, he sailed to Copenhagen on Royndin Fríða as one of a deputation of five presenting a popularly supported proposal for a three-year experimental lifting of the trade restrictions. They had to illegally sell 2,600 knitted sweaters and other merchandise to a Norwegian merchant to finance the voyage, but Crown Prince Frederick, who was governing as regent for his father, and others in Copenhagen were sympathetic, and trade would have been opened up if war with England had not begun.|$|E

40|$|As the {{southern}} Great Plains get hotter and drier, is federal policy that encourages farmers not {{to adapt to}} climate change leading to another Dust Bowl? That's the troubling question raised by a new EWG report that shows how {{a provision in the}} federal crop insurance program provides a strong financial incentive for growers to plant the same crops in the same way, year in and year out, regardless of changing climate conditions. What's worse, this program is focused on the same southern Great Plains counties hit hardest by the Dust Bowl of the 1930 s, the worst man-made environmental disaster in American history. The federal crop insurance program guarantees farmers' earnings from their crops won't fall below a percentage of their usual income. The percentage is set based on a multi-year average of a farmer's actual crop yields. Averaging good and <b>bad</b> <b>years</b> grounds the program in reality. But a provision called the Actual Production History Yield Exclusion – snuck into the 2014 Farm Bill during conference negotiations – allows growers to drop <b>bad</b> <b>years</b> from their average crop yield calculations. The government simply pretends these <b>bad</b> <b>years</b> didn't happen. In some cases, more than 15 <b>bad</b> <b>years</b> can be thrown out when calculating the average yield, resulting in artificially inflated insurance payouts. It makes sense for crop insurance to give growers a break if they're occasionally hit by one or two <b>bad</b> <b>years,</b> but keeping growers on a treadmill of failed crops and insurance payouts is foolish. Helping farmers adapt to the new weather conditions would be considerably better, and was exactly what helped growers survive the Dust Bowl and return to productivity. The southern Great Plains are getting hotter and drier. Drought has been common over the last 10 years and forecasts show the number of days above 100 degrees quadrupling by 2050. Implementing conservation practices to adapt to changing climate conditions is vital for growers who want to stay in business. Some, but not enough, growers are already adopting conservation techniques in this region. Savings from ending the misguided yield exclusion policy could be used to help more growers change the way they farm to face the challenges posed by a changing climate...|$|R
