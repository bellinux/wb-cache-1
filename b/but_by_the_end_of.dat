5|$|Allison Janney as Allie , Dean's overworked mother. She {{initially}} {{struggles to}} sell her VeggiForce vitamins, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the film, she has found success and VeggiForce {{has become something of}} a cult.|$|E
5|$|During the interregnum {{following}} the English Civil War, the Old Blockhouse {{was occupied by}} the Royalists and it was attacked by the Parliamentary forces of Sir Robert Blake in 1651. Blake's naval guns out-ranged those of the fort, and, after fierce fighting, the blockhouse was taken. A battery of guns was maintained at the blockhouse until at least the 1750s, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 18th century the fortification was disused and in ruins.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{some of the}} CRG {{radicals}} including Wang Li and Guan Feng {{were arrested}} on the orders of Mao, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Cultural Revolution the new drive to eradicate 'ultra-leftists' would see the arrest of {{nearly all of the}} CRG's members (Jiang Qing would survive until the death of Mao).|$|E
50|$|Korey {{decided to}} start a Kickstarter in {{launching}} a new site.The initial goal was $30,000, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> they earned $133,860. From there, DoubleToasted was created.|$|R

50|$|Berkeley Tribe {{continued}} publishing through mid-1972 <b>but,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> arcane North Korean style revolutionary political jargon {{had come}} to dominate the underground newspaper, alienating much of Tribe's former audience.|$|R
5|$|Nadar (1820–1910), {{the son of}} a publisher, had {{previously}} had medical training in Lyon and at Hôtel-Dieu. However, by the late 1830s he had left medicine to focus on the printed press, becoming a caricaturist, journalist, and novelist. He only began photography in 1854, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> that decade he was well known for his portraits of famous persons and advances in photographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|The {{expenditures}} that Caracalla {{made with}} the large bonuses he gave to soldiers prompted him to debase the coinage soon after his ascension. At the end of Severus' reign, and early into Caracalla's, the Roman denarius had an approximate silver purity of around 55%, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his reign the purity {{had been reduced to}} about 51%.|$|E
5|$|While {{the show}} was still in previews, writer Owen Davis claimed the story had been lifted from his earlier play Lola, which had {{appeared}} briefly on Broadway in March 1911, then was adapted as a movie in 1914. He filed a lawsuit, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> May it was settled with a cash payment to Davis.|$|E
50|$|Of the 3,000 {{civilians in}} Ostend the {{majority}} had left en masse {{during the early}} part of <b>the</b> siege <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> only two civilians remained; the wife of a freebooter and her paramour a journeyman blacksmith.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of the war, T-34s {{comprised}} about four percent of the Soviet tank arsenal, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> it made up at least 55% of tank production (based on figures from; Zheltov 2001 lists even larger numbers).|$|R
5000|$|Yekaterina Guseva as Olga Belova (née Surikova) - Sasha's {{wife and}} only love. Throughout the decade {{they have their}} share of {{domestic}} squabbles, some more serious than others, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> they solidify their love. She is a violinist and was raised by her grandmother.|$|R
5|$|Although Herrerasaurus {{shared the}} body {{shape of the}} large {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, it lived {{during a time when}} dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later Los Colorados Formation consisted mainly of a variety of crurotarsal archosaurs and synapsids. In the Ischigualasto Formation, dinosaurs constituted only about 6% {{of the total number of}} fossils, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Triassic Period, dinosaurs were becoming the dominant large land animals, and the other archosaurs and synapsids declined in variety and number.|$|E
5|$|As {{the summer}} of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 {{remained}} far below Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July. In {{the middle of that}} month, the Advertising Standards Authority ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company's claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified. Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced the price to £259.90 <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.|$|E
5|$|Both serials were {{promptly}} {{released on}} iTunes, with DVD releases following {{over the next}} few months. Both on the iTunes and the DVD release, episode 3 of The Web of Fear was represented by a tele-snap reconstruction, edited by John Kelly. Episode 3 {{had been part of the}} same find, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> protracted negotiations for the return of the film cans, the episode had disappeared from the cache, with the presumption that it was sold to a private collector.|$|E
5000|$|The episode had a mixed {{reaction}} in this zap2it review: [...] "It felt like Ugly Betty had completely derailed {{at the beginning}} of the episode -- and believe me, I still have some issues -- <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> there were a couple of resolutions that finally felt right." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "This {{is another}} tale in which Merrivale is loud and tantrum-y but tolerable, and the {{narration}} more continuous and sane than usual. But these merits are only relative. The circus atmosphere is still present. ... Setting and situation cannot fail to attract <b>the</b> reader; <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>the</b> multiplication of farfetched clues and {{the twists and}} double twists in the evidence exceed the limit, just like <b>the</b> horseplay <b>by</b> and about Sir Henry. As for detection properly so called, it is there <b>but</b> obscured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> foregoing." ...|$|R
500|$|The final {{match of}} the month was against Charlton at Highbury. Arsenal scored twice {{in the space of}} the opening four minutes, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> were [...] "clinging to their lead like nervous kittens". After 27 games, the team stood in first {{position}} and had accumulated 67 points. They were nine points clear of both Chelsea and Manchester United.|$|R
5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production of diamonds. This occurred when the monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.|$|E
5|$|From 1642, Charles {{fought the}} armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War. After his defeat in 1645, he {{surrendered}} to a Scottish force that eventually handed {{him over to the}} English Parliament. Charles refused to accept his captors' demands for a constitutional monarchy, and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the Isle of Wight, Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 1648 Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army had consolidated its control over England. Charles was tried, convicted, and executed for high treason in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the Commonwealth of England was declared. The monarchy was restored to Charles's son, Charles II, in 1660.|$|E
50|$|G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom marks Kamakura’s first {{appearance}} in animated form. Here he {{is seen as an}} apprentice to Snake Eyes with Jinx. He struggles to use his new sword throughout much of <b>the</b> movie, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> finally masters it. The sword is said to possess mystical properties and that only someone with exceptional skill and focus can use it.|$|R

5000|$|Cinema {{historian}} Stuart Galbraith IV {{writes about}} the movie: [...] "A fascinating look inside a facet of Arab culture profoundly significant yet virtually unknown outside North Africa and the Arab world. 'Lion of the Desert' is a Spartacus-style, David vs. Goliath tale that deserves more respect than it has to date. It's not a great film, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> it becomes a compelling one." ...|$|R
5|$|His {{time in the}} Senate allowed Blaine {{to develop}} his foreign policy ideas. He {{advocated}} expansion of the American navy and merchant marine, which had been in decline since the Civil War. Blaine also bitterly opposed {{the results of the}} arbitration with Great Britain over American fishermen’s right to fish in Canadian waters, which resulted in a $5.5 million award to Britain. Blaine’s Anglophobia combined with his support of high tariffs. He had initially opposed a reciprocity treaty with Canada that would have reduced tariffs between the two nations, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his time in the Senate, he had changed his mind, believing that Americans had more to gain by increasing exports than they would lose by the risk of cheap imports.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was furious}} over {{the failure to}} destroy the convoy, and ordered that all {{remaining}} German major warships be broken up for scrap. In protest, Raeder resigned; Hitler replaced him with Admiral Karl Dönitz, who persuaded Hitler to rescind the order to dismantle the Kriegsmarine's surface ships. In March, Lützow moved to Altafjord, where she experienced problems with her diesel engines. The propulsion system proved to be so problematic that repairs in Germany were necessary. She briefly returned to Norway, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> September 1943, a thorough overhaul was required. The work was completed in Kiel by January 1944, after which she remained in the Baltic Sea to conduct training cruises for new naval personnel.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Cosby's only {{contract}} was with Jell-O, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the year he}} had added two more endorsements. By August, Cosby began promoting E. F. Hutton & Co. {{with a series of}} print and television advertisements, and comedy concerts. The company had been accused of fraud and needed a spokesperson who was well-liked. Soon after Cosby's commercials aired, the company merged with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. In late December, he added J. Walter Thompson agency account Kodak Colorwatch System photographic processing system to his list. The estimated $10 million contract included commercials featuring Cosby to run in print, on television, as point of sale, and in promotional programs.|$|E
5000|$|Harris had a {{reputation}} for carousing, and sometimes forgot lyrics. His [...] "Good Rockin'" [...] recording session largely followed Brown's original lyrics, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> he replaced <b>the</b> last section with a series of raucous [...] "hoy hoy hoy!" [...] interjections, a commonly used expression in jump blues tunes of the time, going back to 1945's [...] "The Honeydripper" [...] by Joe Liggins.|$|R
50|$|The {{power of}} a state to {{regulate}} and control the basic social relationship of marriage of its domiciliaries is here challenged and set at nought by a majority order of this court arrived at not by a concurrence of reasons <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> result of four votes supported by divergent concepts not supported by authority and in fact contrary to the decisions in this state and elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|I Heart California {{received}} a generally mixed reception from critics. Phillip Cosores of Consequence of Sound called the album [...] "a muddled mess of having too many cooks {{in the kitchen}} and no clear direction from a concept band with seemingly no real concept. Sure there are terrific moments, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> one song stands out for it nearly self-aware statement 'it goes nowhere and it does nothing'." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} her accession, Mary issued a proclamation {{that she would}} not compel any of her subjects to follow her religion, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> September leading Protestant churchmen—including John Bradford, John Rogers, John Hooper, Hugh Latimer, and Thomas Cranmer—were imprisoned. Mary's first Parliament, which assembled in early October 1553, declared the marriage of her parents valid and abolished Edward's religious laws. Church doctrine was restored to the form it had taken in the 1539 Six Articles, which (among other things) re-affirmed clerical celibacy. Married priests were deprived of their benefices.|$|E
5|$|In the {{newspaper}} articles, Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell were each able to publish their own {{side of the}} story, filing their own charges against Cope. Ballou's articles were poorly researched, written, and read, and Cope himself was smarting from a piece in The Philadelphia Inquirer which suggested the University of Pennsylvania trustees would ask Cope to step down unless he provided proof for his charges against Marsh and Powell. Marsh himself kept the Herald story alive with a fiery rebuttal, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> January the story had faded from all {{the newspaper}}s, and little changed between the bitter rivals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the war the natural ice {{industry}} collapsed into insignificance. Industry turned entirely to plant ice and mechanical cooling systems and the introduction of cheap electric motors resulted in domestic, modern refrigerators becoming common in U.S. homes by the 1930s and more widely across Europe in the 1950s, allowing ice {{to be made in the}} home. The natural ice harvests shrunk dramatically and ice warehouses were abandoned or converted for other uses. The use of natural ice on a small scale lingered on in more remote areas for some years, and ice continued to be occasionally harvested for carving at artistic competitions and festivals, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century there were very few physical reminders of the trade.|$|E
40|$|The 2014 {{legislative}} session ended rather unremarkably with a do-no-harm budget and significant political finger pointing.   The majority caucus in the House and Senate held their ground throughout the session, {{with the usual}} “no new taxes” vs. “need for rethinking tax breaks and some creative thought on revenue enhancement,” with little accomplished.   The legislators worked {{on a number of}} major issues, including amendments to the marijuana statute enacted in 2012, oil-transport via rail, gun control, minimum-wage, and gasoline-tax increases for enhancements to <b>the</b> transportation infrastructure, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>the</b> only noteworthy accomplishments aside from a minimal supplemental budget was the ample placing of blame on political opponents...|$|R
5000|$|Cookman was {{the only}} NHS-registered t'ai chi practitioner, with schools in Kent and Cambridgeshire, and was {{chairman}} of the Tai Chi and Chi Kung Forum for Health. He started learning it in 1981, and travelled to South Africa to teach its relaxation techniques to murderers and other violent criminals. [...] "It was pretty scary," [...] he said. [...] "At first, they wouldn't talk <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> they were working together and shaking hands with each other." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, This is not Retro stated: [...] "When I {{first heard}} [...] "Just Dream" [...] it started off by {{sounding}} totally different to what I was expecting, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> I was going 'Of course... it couldn't be anyone but Carol Decker', {{which is a}} good trick I think! There's a real dancey-club sheen to the song, particularly at the beginning... it sounds like the track could be given the full dance remix treatment." ...|$|R
