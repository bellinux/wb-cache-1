5|$|On July 25, 2000, Bush {{surprised}} {{some observers}} when he selected Dick Cheney—a former White House Chief of Staff, U.S. Representative, and Secretary of Defense—to be his running mate. At the time, Cheney was serving {{as head of}} Bush's Vice-Presidential search committee. Soon after at the 2000 Republican National Convention, <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> were officially nominated by the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} before the {{election}} Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids electors from voting for someone from their own state for both President and Vice President.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> were re-elected in the 2004 presidential election, {{running against}} John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards. During the election, the {{pregnancy}} {{of his daughter}} Mary and her sexual orientation as a lesbian became a source of public attention for Cheney {{in light of the}} same-sex marriage debate. Cheney has stated that he is in favor of gay marriages personally, but that each individual U.S. state should decide whether to permit it or not.|$|E

25|$|In modern elections, {{a running}} mate is often {{selected}} in order {{to appeal to a}} different set of voters. A Habitation Clause issue arose during the 2000 presidential election contested by George W. Bush (running-mate Dick Cheney) and Al Gore (running-mate Joe Lieberman), because it was alleged that <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> were both inhabitants of Texas and that the Texas electors therefore violated the Twelfth Amendment in casting their ballots for both. Bush's residency was unquestioned, as he was Governor of Texas at the time. Cheney and his wife had moved to Dallas five years earlier when he assumed the role of chief executive at Halliburton. Cheney grew up in Wyoming and had represented it in Congress. A few months before the election, he switched his voter registration and driver's license to Wyoming and put his home in Dallas up for sale. Three Texas voters challenged the election in a federal court in Dallas and then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where it was dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Obama, {{having a}} Caucasian mother and Kenyan {{father of the}} Luo ethnic group, became the first African American {{as well as the}} first bi-racial {{president}}. Although he may have been the first black president to win an election, Obama was not the first African American to run for president. Shirley Chisolm, Jesse Jackson, Lenora Fulani, Carol Moseley Braun, Alan Keyes, and Al Sharpton all at some point were in the process for presidential nomination. The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither candidate was a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant; Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President; all other tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated (1964, 1972, 1984). Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since 1960 (John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson) (in the previous election cycle (2004) Democrats also nominated two sitting Senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, but they lost to incumbents <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cheney),</b> Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since 1940 (Franklin D. Roosevelt/Henry A. Wallace). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. This was the first presidential election since 1952 in which neither of the major party candidates was either the incumbent President or Vice-President.|$|E

2500|$|Bush's {{explanation}} {{was written by}} Fred F. Fielding, White House Counsel {{during the last two}} years of Bush's presidency. According to a Time Magazine article published six months after Bush left office, Fielding worded the commutation [...] "in a way that would make it harder for Bush to revisit it in the future...; [...] language was intended to send an unmistakable message, internally as well as externally: No one is above the law." [...] The article suggested that there was a fundamental difference between how <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> viewed the [...] "War on Terror", with aides close to Bush feeling that Cheney had misled the President and damaged the administration's moral character with the Plame leak.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Tao Ruspoli, Cockburn said, [...] "No doubt about it, since I got here in the early 70s things have gone downhill. The Left is in terrible shape. What's the leading obsession of the Left right now? This whole, I think, mad idea that <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> organised {{the attack on the}} World Trade Towers. I think it's absolutely insane. I think [...] are capable of monstrous evil, I just think the theories they have - of no plane hitting the Pentagon - is nutty. It's like flying saucers." [...] He noted that his friend Chuck Spinney had a friend on the plane who was later identified by his dental records because his teeth were found inside the Pentagon. Cockburn writes in standard incisive wit [...] "This doesn’t faze the conspiracists. They’re immune to any reality check. Spinney “worked for the government.” They switched the dental records. The Boeing 757 was flown to Nebraska for a rendez-vous with President Bush, who shot the passengers, burned the bodies on the tarmac and gave Spinney’s friend’s teeth to Dick Cheney to drop through a hole in his trousers amid the debris in the Pentagon." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2006, US Vice President Dick Cheney {{referred}} {{to himself as}} the Darth Vader of the Bush administration. Discussing the administration's philosophy on gathering intelligence, he said to CNN's John King, [...] "It means {{we need to be}} able to go after and capture or kill those people who are trying to kill Americans. That's not a pleasant business. It's a very serious business. And I suppose, sometimes, people look at my demeanor and say, 'Well, he's the Darth Vader of the administration.'" [...] Jon Stewart put on a Darth Vader helmet to address Dick Cheney as a [...] "kindred spirit" [...] on The Daily Show on January 25, 2007. Cheney's wife, Lynne, presented Stewart with a Darth Vader action figure on her appearance on the show on October 10, 2007. Both Stewart and Stephen Colbert have occasionally {{referred to}} Cheney as [...] "Darth Cheney". In the satirical cartoon show Lil' Bush, Dick Cheney's father is portrayed as being Darth Vader. At her presidential campaign event on September 19, 2007, Hillary Clinton also referred to Cheney as Darth Vader. At the 2008 Washington Radio and Television Correspondents' Association Dinner, Cheney joked that his wife Lynne told him that the Vader comparison [...] "humanizes" [...] him. George Lucas told The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, however, that Cheney is more akin to Emperor Palpatine, and that a better stand-in for Vader would be George W. Bush. An issue of Newsweek referenced this quote, and compared <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cheney</b> to Vader and Palpatine, respectively, in a satirical article comparing politicians to various Star Wars and Star Trek characters.|$|E
