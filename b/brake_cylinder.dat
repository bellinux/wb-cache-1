25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the reservoir charging valve, and the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action, these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|E

25|$|As the {{pressure}} in the train line {{and that of the}} reservoir equalize, the triple valve closes, causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in, and the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> is not pressurized.|$|E
25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve, the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the train line pressure {{and in turn}} triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> When the engine operator releases the brake, the locomotive brake valve portal to atmosphere is closed, allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive. The subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge {{the contents of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> to the atmosphere, releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs.|$|E
25|$|If the {{pressure}} in the train line is {{higher than that of}} the reservoir, the triple valve connects the train line to the reservoir feed, causing the air pressure in the reservoir to increase. The triple valve also causes the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> to be exhausted to the atmosphere, releasing the brakes.|$|E
5000|$|The driver’s {{brake valve}} is self-lapping; the {{position}} of the valve activates a specific brake pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> and therefore a specific braking rate.|$|R

25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E

2500|$|Virtually all {{railroad}} {{rolling stock}} {{is equipped with}} manually operated mechanical hand brake devices that set and release the brakes.

[...] Newer locomotives have electric systems that simply place an electric motor in place of the chain winding mechanism. [...] This brake acts independent of the action of the automatic air brakes, which function collectively when coupled in a train and are {{under the control of the}} locomotive driver / engineer.|$|E
50|$|Visually, class P5b {{could be}} {{distinguished}} from a boxcab P5a by having a lower row of ventilation grilles {{on the sides of}} the superstructure, and by having outside <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> on the trucks.|$|R

5000|$|To release brakes, {{the driver}} makes the {{pressure}} {{rise in the}} , via the brake controller; the pressure in the brake pipe is restored (air is taken from the main reservoir tanks, and from the main pipe if present) to the value present in the [...]Inside the [...] the brake pipe pressure wins over the command reservoir pressure and so {{the connection between the}} <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> and the auxiliary tanks is modified (or cut, depending on the pipe pressure); the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> unload themselves sending their air outside until their pressure reaches a value proportional to the entity of the depression.When pipe pressure is , the cylinders will unload until they are empty.|$|R
2500|$|In addition, an {{emergency}} application brings in an additional component of each car's air brake system: the emergency portion. The triple valve {{is divided into}} two portions: the service portion, which contains the mechanism used during brake applications made during service reductions, and the emergency portion, which senses the immediate, rapid release of train line pressure. In addition, each car's air brake reservoir {{is divided into two}} portions—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the [...] "dual-compartment reservoir”. Normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service portion to the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder,</b> while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the service portion and the emergency portion of the dual-compartment reservoir to the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder,</b> resulting in a 20–30% stronger application.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the brakes}} must be applied before {{recharging}} has been completed, a larger brake pipe reduction {{will be required}} in order to achieve the desired amount of braking effort, as the system is starting out at a lower point of equilibrium (lower overall pressure). If many brake pipe reductions are made in short succession ("fanning the brake" [...] in railroad slang), a point may be reached where car reservoir pressure will be severely depleted, resulting in substantially reduced <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston force, causing the brakes to fail. On a descending grade, the unfortunate result will be a runaway.|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 Caprice {{received}} a restyling with more rounded body lines and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender corner lamps which illuminated with the headlamps, {{as well as}} a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel. Taillight lenses were all red as the backup lights were relocated into the rear bumper, unlike in the lesser full-size models that had their backup lamps {{in the center of the}} taillights. A dual-master <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> was now included, while front disc brakes were optional. Other new options included a stereo 8-track tape player, power door locks, and a fiber optic exterior light monitoring system. The same seating selections continued as before with revisions to trim patterns plus the new addition of all-vinyl upholstery as a no-cost option for conventional and Strato bench seats in sedans and coupes. Engines and transmission offerings were carried over from the previous year. The exception was the optional [...] Turbo Jet V8 was no longer listed, leaving the [...] 427 as the top engine. The three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission that previously only available with the [...] and [...] V8s was now optional with the [...] Turbo Fire V8. As with all 1967 cars sold in the U.S., Caprices featured occupant protection safety features that included an energy-absorbing steering column, soft or recessed interior control knobs, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors.|$|E
5000|$|Modern WSP {{systems are}} {{microprocessor}} controlled and employ two stage valves that permit fine {{control over the}} air pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders.</b> This is essential {{to be able to}} capture and control a sliding wheel and to minimise the amount of air resource used by the WSP. When the brake is applied, the WSP first applies the dynamic brake. If that is not successful it then “blends” the friction and dynamic braking systems. If control is still not established the system reverts to friction braking only where blowdown valves rapidly cycle the air in the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> [...] Examples of this kind of equipment are manufactured by Knorr Bremse (EP compact, EP2002) Faiveley Transport (EPAC) and POLI Wabtec (ATHENA).|$|R

2500|$|In North America, Westinghouse Air Brake {{supplied}} High Speed Control {{brake equipment}} for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains. [...] This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D-22 passenger and 24-RL locomotive brake equipment. [...] On the conventional side, {{the control valve}} set a reference pressure in a volume, which set <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure via a relay valve. On the electric side, pressure from a second straight-air trainline controlled the relay valve via a two-way check valve. This [...] "straight air" [...] trainline was charged (from reservoirs on each car) and released by magnet valves on each car, controlled electrically by a 3 wire trainline, in turn controlled by an [...] "electro-pneumatic master controller" [...] in the controlling locomotive.

[...] Each axle was also equipped with anti-lock brake equipment. [...] The combination minimized braking distances, allowing more full-speed running between stops. The [...] "straight air" [...] (electro-pneumatic trainline), [...] anti-lock, and speed graduating portions of the system were not dependent on each other in any way, and {{any or all of}} these options could be supplied separately.|$|E

50|$|A {{development}} {{introduced in}} the 1950s was the direct admission valve, fitted to every <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> These valves responded to a rise in train pipe pressure as the brake was applied, and admitted atmospheric air directly to {{the underside of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|In EP operation, a distributor, {{performing}} functions {{similar to}} those of the triple valve, is operated directly and instantly by electrical control from the driver’s brake valve.

50|$|The F1 is {{fitted with}} a {{semi-automatic}} vertical sliding wedge breechblock, though fitted without a muzzle brake. Unlike the similar 105mm L7 tank gun, the F1 uses a compressed air scavenging system instead of a bore evacuator. The recoil mechanism uses two symmetrically opposed hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> with a single hydropneumatic recuperator cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{locomotive}} is coupled to the vehicles, the driver moves the brake {{control to the}} [...] "release" [...] position and air is exhausted from the train pipe, creating a partial vacuum.

5000|$|The Westinghouse {{air brake}} system. In this system, air {{reservoirs}} are provided on every vehicle and the locomotive charges the train pipe {{with a positive}} air pressure, which releases the vehicle brakes and charges the air reservoirs on the vehicles. If the driver applies the brakes, his brake valve releases air from the train pipe, and triple valves at each vehicle detect the pressure loss and admit air from the air reservoirs to <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders,</b> applying the <b>brakes.</b> The Westinghouse system uses smaller air reservoirs and <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> than the corresponding vacuum equipment, because a moderately high air pressure can be used. However, an air compressor is required to generate the compressed air and in the earlier days of railways, this required a large reciprocating steam air compressor, and this was regarded by many engineers as highly undesirable.|$|R
