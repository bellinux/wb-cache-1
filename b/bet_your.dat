25|$|By {{the time}} You <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life debuted on TV on October 5, 1950, Groucho had grown a real {{mustache}} (which {{he had already}} sported earlier in the films Copacabana and Love Happy).|$|E

25|$|Marx {{was asked}} to apply the greasepaint {{mustache}} once more for You <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life {{when it came to}} television, but he refused, opting instead to grow a real one, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life. By this time, his eyesight had weakened enough for him actually to need corrective lenses; before then, his eyeglasses had merely been a stage prop. He debuted this new, and now much-older, appearance in Love Happy, the Marx Brothers's last film as a comedy team.|$|E

[...] Schirra, unfazed, {{announced}} that he was switching to the on-board voice recorder (rather than the broadcast radio circuit) to leave his answer; the mission communications transcript noted this as [...] "". The [...] "turtle club" [...] was a recurrent joke among the astronaut corps; on being challenged with this question, the correct response was [...] "you <b>bet</b> <b>your</b> sweet ass I am", with a failure to give the password being punishable by buying a round of drinks. Schirra noted later that he [...] "wasn't ready for all the world to hear it", and chose to use the on-board recorder to avoid saying the answer over the air.|$|E

500|$|Although the Mattachine Society {{had existed}} since the 1950s, {{many of their}} methods now seemed too mild for people who had {{witnessed}} or been inspired by the riots.

[...] When a Mattachine officer suggested an [...] "amicable and sweet" [...] candlelight vigil demonstration, {{a man in the}} audience fumed and shouted, [...] "Sweet! Bullshit! That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play." [...] With a flyer announcing: [...] "Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Sweet Ass We Are!", the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use [...] "gay" [...] in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the Daughters of Bilitis, and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.|$|E
