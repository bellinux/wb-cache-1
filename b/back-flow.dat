25|$|Water {{is drawn}} {{in through the}} mouth by closing the {{operculum}} (gill cover), and enlarging the mouth cavity (Fig. 23). Simultaneously the gill chambers enlarge, producing a lower pressure there than in the mouth causing water to flow over the gills. The mouth cavity then contracts inducing {{the closure of the}} passive oral valves, thereby preventing the <b>back-flow</b> of water from the mouth (Fig. 23). The water in the mouth is, instead, forced over the gills, while the gill chambers contract emptying the water they contain through the opercular openings (Fig. 23). <b>Back-flow</b> into the gill chamber during the inhalatory phase is prevented by a membrane along the ventroposterior border of the operculum (diagram on the left in Fig. 23). Thus the mouth cavity and gill chambers act alternately as suction pump and pressure pump to maintain a steady flow of water over the gills in one direction. Since the blood in the lamellar capillaries flows in the opposite direction to that of the water, the consequent countercurrent flow of blood and water maintains steep concentration gradients for oxygen and carbon dioxide along the entire length of each capillary (lower diagram in Fig.22). Oxygen is therefore able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water. Although countercurrent exchange systems theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas {{from one side of the}} exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.|$|E

60|$|Section 44. The {{beating of}} the heart is, of course, a {{succession}} of contractions and expansions of its muscular wall. The contraction, or systole, commences {{at the base of}} the venae cavae and passes to the auricles, driving the blood before it into the ventricles, which then contract sharply and drive it on into the aorta or pulmonary artery; a pause and then a dilatation, the diastole follows. The flow of the blood is determined in one direction by the various valves {{of the heart}}. No valves occur in the opening of the superior cavae but an imperfect one, the Eustachian valve, protects the inferior cava; the direction of the heart's contraction prevents any excessive <b>back-flow</b> into the veins, and the onward, tendency is encouraged by the suck of the diastole of the ventricles. Between the left ventricle and auricle is a valve made up of two flaps of skin, the mitral valve, the edges of the flaps being connected with the walls of the ventricle through the intermediation of small muscular threads, the chordae tendinae, which stretch across its cavity to little muscular pillars, the papillary muscles; these attachments prevent the mitral valve from flapping back into the auricle, and as the blood flows into and accumulates in the ventricle it gets behind the flaps of the valve and presses its edges together. When the systole of the ventricle occurs, the increased, tension of the blood only closes the aperture the tighter, and the current passes on into the aorta, where we find three watch-pocket valves, with the pocket turned away from the heart, which are also closed and tightened by any attempt at regurgitation (<b>back-flow).</b> A similar process occurs on the right side of the heart, but here, instead of a mitral valve of two flaps between auricle and ventricle, we have a tricuspid valve with three. The thickness of the muscular walls, in view of the lesser distance through which it has to force the blood, -are- [is] less for the right ventricle than the left.|$|E

However, when air source heat pumps with rotary compressors are applied in cold regions, {{a series of}} problems appear. The gas injection has been proved an effectiveÂ technology to enhance both the heating capacity and COP of scroll, screw, and rotary compressors. In the one-cylinder rotary compressor with gas injection, the compressor injection port is often opened on the cylinder wall. In order to extend the injection time for injecting more refrigerant, the injection port is settled {{as close as possible}} to the discharge port. However, the limited area of the injection port and the unavoidable <b>back-flowing</b> of the injection refrigerant into the suction tube diminish the merits of gas injection on the one-cylinder rotary compressor. A novel vapor injection structure on the blade for the rotary compressor has been proposed in this paper to overcome the <b>back-flowing</b> drawback of the traditional cylinder injection structure and increase the injection area. Based on a verified numerical model, the performance of a rotary compressor with the blade injection structure has been investigated. The results indicate that: the proposed vapor injection structure can eliminate the <b>back-flowing</b> of the injected refrigerant; compared to the traditional injection structure, the new structure can enhance the volumetric efficiency and mass flow-rate by 1. 8 ~ 2. 7 % and 26. 6 ~ 57. 2 %, respectively; and compared to the traditional injection structure, the new structure can increase the heating capacity and COP by 23. 1 ~ 48. 9 % and 3. 2 ~ 8. 0 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{mechanism}} for quasi-periodic oscillations of both coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flare loops as related to magnetic reconnection in eruptive solar flares. We perform two-dimensional numerical MHD simulations of magnetic flux rope eruption, with three different values of the global Lundquist number. In the low Lundquist number run, no oscillatory behavior is found. In the moderate Lunquist number run, on the other hand, quasi-periodic oscillations are excited both {{at the bottom of}} the flux rope and at the flare loop-top. In the high Lundquist number run, quasi-periodic oscillations are also excited; in the meanwhile, the dynamics become turbulent due to the formation of multiple plasmoids in the reconnection current sheet. In high and moderate Lundquist number runs, thin reconnection jet collide with the flux rope bottom or flare loop-top and dig them deeply. Steep oblique shocks are formed as termination shocks where reconnection jet is bent (rather than decelerated) in horizontal direction, resulting in supersonic <b>back-flows.</b> The structure becomes unstable, and quasi-periodic oscillation of supersonic <b>back-flows</b> appear at locally confined high-beta region at both the flux rope bottom and flare loop-top.

40|$|Taking a clue {{from their}} {{sharp-edged}} (strip-like) morphology observed in several cases, a new mechanism is {{proposed for the}} formation of the emission gaps seen between the radio lobes of many powerful extragalactic double radio sources. Canonical understanding of the radio gaps invokes either blocking of the <b>back-flowing</b> lobe plasma by the denser interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy, or "squeezing" of the radio bridge in the middle through buoyancy force exerted by either the ISM or the surrounding intra-cluster medium (ICM). These pictures encounter difficulties in explaining situations where the sharp-edged radio gaps associated with non-cluster radio galaxies have widths running into several tens (even hundreds) of kiloparsecs. More particularly, the required dense high-pressure ISM/ICM is likely to be lacking at least in the case of high-redshift radio galaxies. We propose here that radio emission gaps in at least such cases could arise from a dynamical interaction between the powerful thermal wind outflowing from the active galactic nucleus and the <b>back-flowing</b> synchrotron plasma in the two radio lobes, which occurs once the rapidly advancing jets have crossed out of the wind zone into the intergalactic medium. A simple analytical scheme is presented to explore the plausibility of the side-ways confinement of the thermal wind by the radio lobe pair, which would "freeze" pancake shaped conduits in the space, along which the hot, metal enriched wind from the AGN can escape (roughly orthogonal to the radio axis). Some other possible consequences of this scenario are pointed out. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures [one. jpg], official version published in MNRA...|$|R

We perform 2 D-axisymmetrical numerical simulations of fast and wide jets that interact with the previously ejected slow AGB wind. In each system there are two oppositely launched jets, but we use the symmetry of the problem and simulate only one jet. A large circularization-flow (vortex) is formed to the side of the jet which together with the thermal pressure of the shocked jet material accelerate cold slow-wind gas back to the center from distances of ~ 1000 - 10000 AU.

It includes about 1200 user loads, 70 km of MV lines, 6 feeders, a thyristor voltage regulator (TVR) and 6 distributed energy sources (5 generator sets and 1 photovoltaic plant). Network topology can be changed by 106 breakers. The grid has been accurately modelled and simulated in the phasor domain by Matlab/Simulink, relying on the SimPowerSystems ToolBox, following a Multi-Level Hierarchical and Modular approach. Network optimization is faced by defining and solving a suited multi-objective optimization problem, considering suited constraints on nominal operative ranges on voltages and currents, as well as on generator's capability functions, in order to take into account safety and quality of service issues. To this aim it is adopted a genetic algorithm, defining a suited fitness function. Tests have been performed by feeding the simulation environment with real data concerning dissipated and generated active and reactive power values.

A circumferential groove may {{be added to the}} pump to reduce synchronous cavitation and subsequent bearing loads at a minimal performance cost. However, the energy may reappear as high order cavitation (HOC) that spans a relatively large frequency range. Thus, HOC may have implications for the full-scale OTP inducer in terms of reduced structural margin at higher mode frequencies. Simulations using the LOCI/Stream CFD program were conducted in order to explore the fluid dynamical impact of the groove on the low-pressure inducer and kicker. It was found that the circumferential groove has minimal head performance impact, but causes <b>back-flowing</b> high-swirl fluid to interact with the nearly-axial incoming fluid just above the inducer blades. The high-shear interface between the fluids is Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable, resulting in trains of low pressure regions or 'pearls' forming near the upstream edge of the groove. When the static pressure in these regions becomes low enough and they get cut by the blade leading edge, HOC is thought to occur. Although further work is required, the numerical models indicate that HOC will occur in the runbox of the AFRL/Aerojet HCB OTP. Comparisons to the ongoing water flow experiments will be discussed, as well as possible designs that may mitigate HOC while continuing to reduce synchronous cavitation.
