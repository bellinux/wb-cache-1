5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E

500|$|At the {{negotiations}} with the French, Warwick had intimated that King Edward was interested in a marriage arrangement with the French crown, the intended bride being Louis XI's sister-in-law, Bona, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy. This marriage was not to be, however, because in September 1464, Edward revealed that he was already married, to Elizabeth Woodville. The marriage caused great offence to Warwick: not only {{due to the fact}} that his plans had been sabotaged, but also the secrecy with which the king had acted. The marriage – contracted on 1May of the same year – was not made public before Warwick pressed Edward on the issue at a council meeting, and in the meanwhile Warwick had been unknowingly deceiving the French into believing the king was serious about the marriage proposal. For Edward the marriage may very well have been a love match, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> he sought to build the Woodville family into a powerhouse independent of Warwick's influence.

This worked for a while, as Taylor had angrily berated Khánh's generals, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> it failed, as South Vietnam and the generals' careers and advancement were dependent on US aid. Taylor hoped Khánh's appeals to nationalism might backfire by causing his colleagues to fear a future without US funding. On occasions during the December stand-off, Khánh had appealed to his colleagues to support the expulsion of Taylor from the country. The ambassador said that US support for South Vietnam would end if he was expelled, and the generals backed down, but Khánh said the military did not need US aid. The Americans were aware of Khánh's tactics and exploited it by persistently trying to scare his colleagues with the prospect of a military heavily restricted by the absence of US funding. After the December coup, Taylor credited the fear of US abandonment for having [...] "raised the courage level of the other generals to the point of sacking him", as many were seen as beholden to their desire for personal advancement above all.|$|E

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{availability}} {{and use of}} copper based nanomaterials (Cu-NMs), there is increasing concern regarding their release and potential impact on <b>the</b> environment. <b>In</b> this study, <b>the</b> short term (≤ 5 days) ageing profile and <b>the</b> <b>long</b> term (4 months) speciation of dissolved Cu, copper oxide (CuO-) and copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS-NPs) were investigated in five different soils using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Soil pH was found to strongly influence the short term chemistry of the Cu-NMs added at 100 mg/kg above background. Low pH soils promoted rapid dissolution of CuO-NPs that effectively aligned their behaviour to that of dissolved Cu within 3 days. In higher pH soils, CuO-NPs persisted longer due to slower dissolution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil and resulted in contrasting short term speciation compared to dissolved Cu, which formed copper hydroxides and carbonates that were reflective of the soil chemistry.
