5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the <b>base</b> <b>sequence</b> of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E

5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's <b>base</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
5|$|After any of {{the above}} {{approaches}} are used to design the secondary structure of a target complex, an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised. Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid <b>base</b> <b>sequence</b> to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the <b>base</b> <b>sequence.</b> Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E

25|$|The genome sizes {{range from}} 4.5–6kb and is circular. It encodes 11 genes (in order: A, A*, B, C, K, D, E, J, F, G, and H), nine {{of which are}} essential. The nonessential genes are E and K. Several of the genes have {{overlapping}} reading frames. Protein A* is encoded within protein A. It lacks ~1/3 of the amino acids from the N terminal of the A protein and is encoded in the same frame as the A protein. It is translated from an internal start site within the messenger RNA. Gene E is encoded with gene D with a +1 frameshift. Gene K overlaps genes A, B, and C.

25|$|During mitosis, microtubules {{grow from}} centrosomes located at {{opposite}} ends of the cell and also attach to the centromere at specialized structures called kinetochores, one of which is present on each sister chromatid. A special DNA <b>base</b> <b>sequence</b> in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus.|$|E

25|$|Changes in DNA {{caused by}} {{mutation}} can cause errors in protein sequence, creating partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, {{in order to}} function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function {{in the right places}} at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA <b>base</b> <b>sequence</b> but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of Drosophila suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, this will probably be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial. Studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial.|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{efforts in}} {{computational}} biology have been {{directed toward the}} design of successful dsRNA reagents that maximize gene knockdown but minimize [...] "off-target" [...] effects.

500|$|The {{complexes}} {{constructed in}} structural DNA nanotechnology use topologically branched nucleic acid structures containing junctions. (In contrast, most biological DNA exists as an unbranched double helix.) One {{of the simplest}} branched structures is a four-arm junction that consists of four individual DNA strands, portions of which are complementary in a specific pattern. Unlike in natural Holliday junctions, each arm in the artificial immobile four-arm junction has a different <b>base</b> <b>sequence,</b> causing the junction point to be fixed at a certain position. [...] Multiple junctions can be combined in the same complex, {{such as in the}} widely used double-crossover (DX) structural motif, which contains two parallel double helical domains with individual strands crossing between the domains at two crossover points. Each crossover point is, topologically, a four-arm junction, but is constrained to one orientation, in contrast to the flexible single four-arm junction, providing a rigidity that makes the DX motif suitable as a structural building block for larger DNA complexes.|$|E
500|$|Nanostructures of arbitrary, {{non-regular}} shapes {{are usually}} made using the DNA origami method. [...] These structures {{consist of a}} long, natural virus strand as a [...] "scaffold", which is made to fold into the desired shape by computationally designed short [...] "staple" [...] strands. This method has the advantages of being easy to design, as the <b>base</b> <b>sequence</b> is predetermined by the scaffold strand sequence, and not requiring high strand purity and accurate stoichiometry, as most other DNA nanotechnology methods do. DNA origami was first demonstrated for two-dimensional shapes, such as a smiley face and a coarse map of the Western Hemisphere. Solid three-dimensional structures {{can be made by}} using parallel DNA helices arranged in a honeycomb pattern, and structures with two-dimensional faces can be made to fold into a hollow overall three-dimensional shape, akin to a cardboard box. These can be programmed to open and reveal or release a molecular cargo in response to a stimulus, making them potentially useful as programmable molecular cages.|$|E
500|$|In {{the study}} of how RNA {{molecules}} fold to form their structure, the standard form of nucleic acid secondary structure can be described diagrammatically as a chain of bases (the RNA sequence itself), drawn along a line, together {{with a collection of}} arcs above the line describing the basepairs of the structure. That is, although these structures actually have a complicated three-dimensional shape, their connectivity (when a secondary structure exists) can be described by a more abstract structure, a one-page book embedding. However, not all RNA folds behave in this simple way. [...] have proposed a so-called [...] "bi-secondary structure" [...] for certain RNA pseudoknots that {{takes the form of a}} two-page book embedding: the RNA sequence is again drawn along a line, but the basepairs are drawn as arcs both above and below this line. In order to form a bi-secondary structure, a graph must have maximum degree at most three: each base can only participate in one arc of the diagram, in addition to the two links to its neighbors in the <b>base</b> <b>sequence.</b> Advantages of this formulation include the facts that it excludes structures that are actually knotted in space, and that it matches most known RNA pseudoknots.|$|E

40|$|Peptide {{nucleic acid}} {{oligomers}} (PNAs) have a remarkable ability to invade duplex DNA at polypurine–polypyrimidine target sequences. Applications for PNAs {{in medicine and}} biotechnology would increase if the rules governing their hybridization to mixed <b>base</b> <b>sequences</b> were also clear. Here we describe hybridization of PNAs to mixed <b>base</b> <b>sequences</b> and demonstrate that simple chemical modifications can enhance recognition. Easily synthesized and readily soluble eight and 10 base PNAs bind to plasmid DNA at an inverted repeat {{that is likely to}} form a cruciform structure, providing convenient tags for creating PNA–plasmid complexes. PNAs also bind to mixed <b>base</b> <b>sequences</b> that cannot form cruciforms, suggesting that recognition is a general phenomenon. Rates of strand invasion are temperature dependent and can be enhanced by attaching PNAs to positively charged peptides. Our results support use of PNAs to access the information within duplex DNA and demonstrate that simple chemical modifications can make PNAs even more powerful agents for strand invasion. Simple strategies for enhancing strand invasion should facilitate the use of PNAs: (i) as biophysical probes of double-stranded DNA; (ii) to target promoters to control gene expression; and (iii) to direct sequence-specific mutagenesis...|$|R
2500|$|DNA strands have a directionality, and the {{different}} ends of a single strand are called the [...] "3' (three-prime) end" [...] and the [...] "5' (five-prime) end". By convention, if the <b>base</b> <b>sequence</b> of a single strand of DNA is given, the left end of the sequence is the 5' end, while the right end of the sequence is the 3' end. The strands of the double helix are anti-parallel with one being 5' to 3', and the opposite strand 3' to 5'. These terms refer to the carbon atom in deoxyribose to which the next phosphate in the chain attaches. Directionality has consequences in DNA synthesis, because DNA polymerase can synthesize DNA in only one direction by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of a DNA strand.|$|E
2500|$|Hybridization is {{the process}} of {{establishing}} a non-covalent, sequence-specific interaction between two or more complementary strands of nucleic acids into a single complex, which in the case of two strands is referred to as a duplex. [...] Oligonucleotides, DNA, or RNA will bind to their complement under normal conditions, so two perfectly complementary strands will bind to each other readily. In order to reduce the diversity and obtain the most energetically preferred complexes, a technique called annealing is used in laboratory practice. However, due to the different molecular geometries of the nucleotides, a single inconsistency between the two strands will make binding between them less energetically favorable. Measuring the effects of base incompatibility by quantifying the temperature at which two strands anneal can provide information as to the similarity in <b>base</b> <b>sequence</b> between the two strands being annealed. The complexes may be dissociated by thermal denaturation, also referred to as melting. In the absence of external negative factors, the processes of hybridization and melting may be repeated in succession indefinitely, which lays the ground for polymerase chain reaction.
