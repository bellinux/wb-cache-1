5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy {{for a man to}} carry and fire, but if he supported the <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of the}} gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E

25|$|In The Horse and His Boy, Lewis {{uses the}} {{cultural}} settings of Narnia, Archenland, and Calormen {{to develop a}} theme of freedom in contrast to slavery. Lewis depicts the Calormene culture as one in which a primary guiding principle is that the weak must {{make way for the}} strong: For in Tashbaan there is only one traffic regulation, which is that everyone who is less important has {{to get out of the}} way for everyone who is more important; unless you want a cut from a whip or a punch from the <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> of a spear.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{extrusion}}, {{also known}} as forward extrusion, {{is the most common}} extrusion process. It works by placing the billet in a heavy walled container. The billet is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude the billet is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the frictional forces introduced by the need for the billet to travel {{the entire length of the}} container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up. At the end of the billet the force greatly increases because the billet is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of the billet (called the <b>butt</b> <b>end)</b> is not used for this reason.|$|E
500|$|NHL President Clarence Campbell was at {{the game}} and was seated near where the {{incident}} occurred. After receiving {{a report from the}} game's officials, Campbell called a news conference and said the injury was not Kennedy's fault. Campbell also publicly rebuked Ivan for his accusation, saying, [...] "That is a pretty serious business and a very vicious charge." [...] It was also argued that since Kennedy was a right-handed shot, the butt-end of his stick was towards the boards and away from Howe. Sportswriter Ted Reeve of the Toronto Telegram quipped, [...] "How would a right-handed stickhandler going down the left boards give anyone a <b>butt</b> <b>end?</b> Unless he wanted to lift the snappers out of someone in the rail seats." [...] Howe was lost from the playoffs, but the incident influenced the momentum of the series. Detroit won the second game of the series 3–1, a violent and fight-filled affair which included a stick-swinging incident between the Leafs' Jimmy Thomson and Detroit's Leo Reise and a fight between Kennedy and Ted Lindsay. After the game, Campbell threatened the players with fines if the violent play continued, and both teams continued to play hockey {{for the remainder of the}} series. However, Detroit was now determined to [...] "win the series for Gordie" [...] and defeated the Leafs in seven strongly-contested games to eliminate them from the playoffs, going on to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E
30|$|Discs {{from the}} top and <b>butt</b> <b>ends</b> of all 35 logs were cut to {{determine}} the wood properties, whereupon the remaining logs 3  m long {{were used for the}} sawing test. After debarking, the lengths, short and long diameter of the top and <b>butt</b> <b>ends,</b> heartwood percentage, number of growth rings, warp, taper, and eccentricity of the 24 logs used for the sawing test were all measured. The heartwood percentage was the ratio of the heartwood radius to the short radius through the pith on the top end, while the number of growth rings was counted on the top end. Warp was calculated as the chord height per short diameter of the top end, while taper was calculated as the difference between the top- and butt-end diameters per log length. Eccentricity was calculated as the distance between the pith and the geometric center per short diameter.|$|R

2500|$|When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and [...] asked American Horse {{again if}} they {{would come out of}} the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. “After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a {{handsome}} face and a neck like a bull, showed himself {{at the mouth of the}} cave, presenting the <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> of his rifle toward the General.

2500|$|The Royalist centre {{attacked}} first, with Rupert {{keeping his}} own wing of cavalry in hand {{so that the}} horse and foot could hit the enemy simultaneously. Skippon's infantry moved forward over {{the crest of the}} ridge to meet the Royalist foot. There was time for only one volley of musketry before both sides were fighting hand-to-hand, the veteran Royalist infantry using their swords and the butt ends of their muskets. Sir Edward Walker, Charles's secretary of war, stated [...] "The Foot on either side hardly saw each other until they were within Carabine Shot, and so made only one Volley; our falling in with Sword and <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> of the Musquet did notable Execution, so much as I saw their Colours fall and their Foot in great Disorder." [...] Skippon was wounded by a bullet which splintered his armour and struck him under the ribs, although he stayed on the field to prevent panic spreading.

2500|$|After its {{introduction}} to service, reports of unserviceability of the M3 commenced in February 1944 with stateside units in training, who reported early {{failure of the}} cocking handle/bolt retraction mechanism on some weapons. [...] Similar reports later came from U.S. forces in Britain who were issued the M3. [...] An investigation revealed several deficiencies {{in the construction of}} the M3's bolt retraction mechanism, together with issues concerning barrel removal and retention as well as easily bent rear sights. [...] As a result, several product improvements were incorporated into all new M3 production, including a new design retracting pawl with improved heat treatment, a new spring stop fitted to the right-hand brace of the retracting lever, a modified ejector featuring a cocking lever trip, a larger ratchet pad with improved heat treatment to more securely retain the barrel assembly, and strengthening gussets fitted to the sides of the fixed 'L' rear sight. [...] After new complaints were raised about accidental magazine releases and failure of the wire buttstock to remain in place in the collapsed position, two additional changes were made to M3 production and approved by Ordnance on 31 August 1944.

2500|$|Yudhishthira {{is said to}} be {{a master}} in spearplay warfare in Mahabharata, while Shalya is also noted be an {{excellent}} warrior in the field of spearplay. Also according to Indian Hindu myths, Kartikeya, the son of Lord Shiva {{is said to be}} skilled in spear-fighting, by holding his divine spear called as Vel. The South Asian spear is typically made of bamboo with a steel blade. It can be used in hand-to-hand combat or thrown when the fighters are farther apart. Despite primarily being a thrusting weapon, the wide spearhead also allows for many slashing techniques. By the 17th century, Rajput mercenaries in the Mughal army were using a type of spear which integrated a pointed spear butt and a club near the head, making it similar to a mace. On the other hand, the longer cavalry spear was made of wood, with red cloth attached near the blade to prevent the opponent's blood from dripping to the shaft. The Marathas were revered for their skill of wielding a ten-foot spear called bothati (...) from horseback. Bothati fighting is practiced with a ball-tipped lance, the end of which is covered in dye so that hits may easily be confirmed. In solo training, the spear is aimed at a pile of stones. From this was eventually developed the uniquely Indian vita which has a five-foot length of cord attached to the <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> of the weapon and tied around the spearman's wrist. Using this cord the spear can be pulled back after it has been thrown.|$|E
