40|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are {{subjected}} to both large natural variability and increasing anthropogenic impact on environmental parameters such as changes in salinity, temperature, and pH. This study documents the distribution of living benthic foraminifera {{under the influence of}} multiple environmental stressors in the Skagerrak-Baltic Sea region. Sediment core tops were studied at five sites along a transect from the Skagerrak to the Baltic Sea, with strong environmental gradients, especially in terms of salinity, pH, calcium carbonate saturation and dissolved oxygen concentration in the bottom water and pore water. We found that living foraminiferal densities and species richness were higher at the Skagerrak station, where the general living conditions were relatively beneficial for Foraminifera, with higher salinity and Ωcalc in the water column and higher pH and oxygen concentration in the bottom and pore water. The most common species reported at each station reflect the differences in the environmental conditions between the stations. The dominant species were Cassidulina laevigata and Hyalinea balthica in the Skagerrak, Stainforthia fusiformis, Nonionella aff. stella and Nonionoides turgida in the Kattegat and N. aff. stella and Nonionellina labradorica in the Öresund. The most adverse conditions, such as low salinity, low Ωcalc, low dissolved oxygen concentrations and low pH, were noted at the Baltic Sea stations, where the calcareous tests of the dominant living taxa Ammonia spp. and Elphidium spp. were partially to completely dissolved, probably due to a combination of different stressors affecting the required energy for biomineralization. Even though Foraminifera are able to live in extremely varying environmental conditions, the present results suggest that the <b>benthic</b> <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in the studied region, which are apparently affected by an increase in the range of environmental variability, will probably be even more influenced by a future increase in anthropogenic impacts, including coastal ocean acidification and deoxygenation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> marine <b>ecosystems,</b> such as coral reefs, {{seagrass}} beds, and kelp {{forests are}} highly productive {{as well as}} ecologically and commercially important resources. These systems are vulnerable to degraded water quality due to coastal development, terrestrial run-off, and harmful algal blooms. Measurements of these features are important for understanding linkages with land-based sources of pollution and impacts to <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Challenges for accurate remote sensing of <b>coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> (shallow water) <b>ecosystems</b> and water quality are complicated by atmospheric scattering/absorption (approximately 80 +% of the signal), sun glint from the sea surface, and water column scattering (e. g., turbidity). Further, sensor challenges related to signal to noise (SNR) over optically dark targets as well as insufficient radiometric calibration thwart the value of coastal remotely-sensed data. Atmospheric correction of satellite and airborne remotely-sensed radiance data is crucial for deriving accurate water-leaving radiance in coastal waters. C-HORSE seeks to optimize coastal remote sensing measurements by using a novel airborne instrument suite that will bridge calibration, validation, and research capabilities of bio-optical measurements from the sea to the high altitude remote sensing platform. The primary goal of C-HORSE is to facilitate enhanced optical observations of <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> using {{state of the art}} portable microradiometers with 19 targeted spectral channels and flight planning to optimize measurements further supporting current and future remote sensing missions...|$|R

This thesis assessed pre- and post-capture particle processes to better understand passive and active selection mechanisms of bivalves. Several questions were posited, including: 1) How do physicochemical interactions affect particle capture and selection; 2) Why are some particles more likely to be rejected or ingested than others; and 3) Is a chemosensory response mechanism involved? Using flow-through chambers and natural suspended matter, capture efficiency (CE) of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) was determined seasonally over a one-year period.

Relationships linking continental inputs from the Rhone River to biodiversity of the <b>coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> and fishery production were investigated in the Golfe du Lion (NW Mediterranean Sea). Macrobenthic community diversity decreased when continen¬tal inputs of organic matter increased, whereas ecosystem production, measured by common sole (Solea solea) fishery yields in the area, increased. Decreases in macrobenthic diversity were mainly related to an increasing abundance of species with specific functional traits, particularly deposit-feeding polychaetes. The decrease in macrobenthic diversity did not result in a decrease, but an increase in ecosystem production, as it enhanced the transfer of continental POM into marine food webs. The present study showed that it is necessary to consider functional traits of species, direct and indirect links between species, and feedback loops to understand the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and productivity...|$|R

40|$|Marine <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{are among}} the most {{productive}} and diverse communities on Earth and are of global importance to climate, nutrient budgets, and primary productivity. Yet, these ecosystems, and in particular sedentary benthic (bottom-living) invertebrate communities at their base, are compromised by human-induced stresses, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Emerging environmental legislation such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD) has the potential to significantly improve the ecological status of Europes aquatic ecosystems, from rivers to the sea. However, depending upon how it is interpreted and implemented, {{it has the potential to}} impact many activities in coastal systems, including flood defence, coastal development, dredging, aquaculture and fishing.

40|$|The coastal {{ocean is}} a {{marginal}} {{region of the}} global ocean, but is home to metabolically intense ecosystems which increase the structural complexity of the benthos. These ecosystems {{have the ability to}} alter the carbon chemistry of surrounding waters through their metabolism, mainly through processes which directly release or consume carbon dioxide. In this way, coastal habitats can engineer their environment by acting as sources or sinks of carbon dioxide and altering their environmental chemistry from the regional norm. In most coastal water masses, it is difficult to resolve the <b>ecosystem</b> effect on <b>coastal</b> carbon biogeochemistry due to the mixing of multiple offshore end members, complex geography or the influence of variable freshwater inputs. The Red Sea provides a simple environment for the study of ecosystem processes at a coastal scale as it contains only one offshore end-member and negligible freshwater inputs due to the arid climate of adjacent land. This work explores the ability of three Red Sea <b>benthic</b> <b>coastal</b> habitats (coral reefs, seagrass meadows and mangrove forests) to create characteristic ecosystem end-members, which deviate from the biogeochemistry of offshore source waters. This is done by both calculating non-conservative deviations in carbonate stocks collected over each ecosystem, and by quantifying net carbonate fluxes (in seagrass meadows and mangrove forests only) using 24 hour incubations. Results illustrate that carbonate stocks over ecosystems conform to broad ecosystem trends, which are different to the offshore end-member, and are influenced by inherited properties from surrounding ecosystems. Carbonate fluxes also show ecosystem dependent trends and further illustrate the importance of sediment processes in influencing CaCO 3 fluxes in blue carbon benthic habitats, which warrants further attention.

40|$|AbstractRegime {{shifts in}} <b>benthic</b> {{invertebrates}} within <b>coastal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> threaten {{the survival of}} wading birds (Charadrii). Predicting how invertebrate regime shifts will affect wading birds allows conservation management and mitigation measures to be implemented, including protection of terrestrial feeding areas. An individual-based model was used to investigate the impact of regime shifts on wading birds through their prey (marine worms and bivalves) in the estuarine system Poole Harbour, (UK). The model predicted the number of curlew (Numenius arquata), oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), redshank (Tringa totanus) and dunlin (Calidris alpina) supported in the Harbour during the non-breeding season (autumn and winter months). The most dramatic declines in bird numbers were for regime shifts that reduced the abundance of the largest invertebrates, particularly marine worms. The least adaptable bird species (those with the most restrictive diets) were unable to compensate by consuming other prey. Generally, as birds adapt to changes by switching to alternative prey species and size classes, changes in invertebrate size and species distribution do not necessarily affect the number of birds that the Harbour can support. Our predictions reveal a weakness in using birds as indicators of site health and invertebrate regime shifts. Differences in bird populations would not necessarily be detected by standard survey methods until extreme changes in invertebrate communities had occurred, potentially beyond {{the point at which}} these changes could be reversed. Therefore, population size of wading birds should not be used in isolation when assessing the conservation status of coastal sites...|$|R
