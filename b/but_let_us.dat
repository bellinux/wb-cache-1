25|$|Roads are, {{by their}} nature, used by {{vehicles}} {{and it is}} clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is {{at risk of being}} further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more proximate cause. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. <b>But</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be imputed objectively.|$|E

500|$|Not {{everything}} she encounters is beautiful, however, and she juxtaposes her distaste for the German working class with her delight with French servants. Although politically liberal, Mary Shelley is aesthetically repelled by the Germans and therefore excludes them. Unlike the non-discriminating Claire Clairmont, Shelley feels {{free to make}} judgments of the scenes around her; Shelley writes that Claire [...] "on looking at this scene...exclaimed, 'Oh! this is beautiful enough; let us live here.' This was her exclamation on every new scene, and as each surpassed the one before, she cried, 'I am glad we did not stay at Charenton, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> live here'". Shelley also compares herself positively to the French peasants who are unaware that Napoleon has been deposed. As scholar Angela Jones contends, [...] "Shelley {{may be said to}} figure herself as a more knowledgeable, disinterested English outsider capable of rendering impartial judgment"—an Enlightenment value.|$|E

2500|$|Among the composers whom Grove {{sought to}} popularise was Schubert, whose music was largely {{neglected}} in England. Grove and Manns presented the first performance in England of the Great C major Symphony. Together {{with his friend}} Arthur Sullivan, Grove went to Vienna in 1867 in search of Schubert manuscripts. They found and copied several, and were particularly excited about their final discovery, which Grove described thus: [...] "I found, {{at the bottom of}} the cupboard, and in its farthest corner, a bundle of music-books two feet high, carefully tied round, and black with the undisturbed dust of nearly half-a-century. … These were the part-books of the whole of the music in Rosamunde, tied up after the second performance in December, 1823, and probably never disturbed since. Dr. Schneider [...] must have been amused at our excitement; <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> hope that he recollected his own days of rapture; at any rate, he kindly overlooked it, and gave us permission to take away with us and copy what we wanted." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ode, {{like others}} of Wordsworth's poetry, was favoured by Victorians for its biographical aspects {{and the way}} Wordsworth {{approached}} feelings of despondency. The American Romantic poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his 1856 work English Traits, claimed that the poem [...] "There are torpid places in his mind, there is something hard and sterile in his poetry, want of grace and variety, want of due catholicity and cosmopolitan scope: he had conformities to English politics and tradition; he had egotistic puerilities in the choice and treatment of his subjects; <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> say of him, that, alone in his time he treated the human mind well, and with an absolute trust. His adherence to his poetic creed rested on real inspirations." [...] The editor of Harper's New Monthly Magazine, George William Curtis, praised the ode in his December 1859 column [...] "Editor's Easy Chair" [...] and claimed that [...] "it was Wordsworth who has written {{one of the greatest}} English poets... For sustained splendor of imagination, deep, solemn, and progressive thought, and exquisite variety of music, that poem is unsurpassed. Since Milton's 'Ode upon the Nativity' there is nothing so fine, not forgetting Dryden, Pope, Collins, and the rest, who have written odes." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That {{is the one thing}} we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst the {{reviewer}} in The Guardian of 16 May 1928 {{seemed to}} feel that the play itself showed no great originality, he was impressed with Laughton, saying [...] "we can hardly resist the play despite its wheezy start and inability to accelerate, because M. Poirot is presented in the flesh by Mr. Charles Laughton, who, unlike much youth of brilliant hopes, continues to perform almost more than he so lavishly promised.” The reviewer concluded, [...] "M. Poirot sifts the alibis of the assembled company, finds a scent and hunts it close. None of the other characters appears to have any more personality than is necessary for a human fragment of the puzzle. It is hardly needed. Mr. Laughton is there, and he cannot fail to entertain, whether he is in the supreme frenzy of vigilance, or relaxing over the oldest of old brandies, or making a tender gesture to a charming young lady who is as English as a rose and not, it seems, more talkative or intellectual. Scarcely the wife for Poirot, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> not be fussy and make difficulties. Mr. Laughton is an important arrival in Crookery Nook, yet we trust he will not stay there too long. We have other uses for such an actor than to brood over the fingermarks on the dagger and discover why the parlourmaid was in the garden at the moment of the crime.” ...|$|E
