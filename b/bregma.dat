50|$|Two {{anatomical}} landmarks {{are found}} on the sagittal suture: the <b>bregma,</b> and the vertex of the skull. The <b>bregma</b> is formed by {{the intersection of the}} sagittal and coronal sutures. The vertex is the highest point on the skull and is often near the midpoint of the sagittal suture.|$|E
50|$|During infancy, the {{anterior}} fontanelle {{is known as}} the <b>bregma.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>bregma</b> {{is often}} used as a {{reference}} point for stereotactic surgery of the brain.|$|E
50|$|In the {{congenital}} disorder cleidocranial dysostosis, {{the anterior}} fontanelle never closes {{to form the}} <b>bregma.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>bregma</b> is the {{anatomical}} {{point on the}} skull at which the coronal suture is intersected perpendicularly by the sagittal suture.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bregma</b> {{is known}} as the {{anterior}} fontanelle during infancy. The anterior fontanelle is membranous and closes in the first 36 months of life (according to Thieme atlas of anatomy).|$|E
50|$|Commencing at the foramen cecum, {{through which}} it {{receives}} emissary veins from the nasal cavity, it runs from anterior to posterior, grooving the inner {{surface of the}} frontal, the adjacent margins of the two parietal lobes, and the superior division of the cruciate eminence of the occipital lobe. Near the internal occipital protuberance, it drains into the confluence of sinuses and deviates to either side (usually the right). At this point it is continued as the corresponding transverse sinus. The superior sagittal sinus is usually divided into three parts: anterior (foramen cecum to <b>bregma),</b> middle (<b>bregma</b> to lambda), posterior (lambda to confluence).|$|E

50|$|The <b>bregma</b> {{is located}} at the {{intersection}} of the coronal suture and the sagittal suture on the superior middle portion of the calvaria. It is the point where the frontal bone and parietal bones meet.|$|E
50|$|In some {{individuals}} the suture can persist (totally or partly) into adulthood, {{and in these}} cases it {{is referred to as}} a persistent metopic suture. The suture can either bisect the frontal bone and run from nasion to <b>bregma</b> or persist as a partial metopic suture (see image of frontal bone) (where part of the suture survives and is connected to either <b>bregma</b> or nasion) or as an isolated metopic fissure. Persistent frontal sutures are of no clinical significance, although they can be mistaken for cranial fractures. As persistent frontal sutures are visible in radiographs, they can be useful for the forensic identification of human skeletal remains. Persistent frontal sutures {{should not be confused with}} supranasal sutures (a small zig-zag shaped suture located at and/or immediately superior to the glabella).|$|E
5000|$|The frontal {{border is}} deeply serrated, and {{bevelled}} {{at the expense}} of the outer surface above and of the inner below; it articulates with the frontal bone, forming half of the coronal suture. The point where the coronal suture intersects with the sagittal suture forms a T-shape and is called the <b>bregma.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bathymunida eurybregma is {{a species}} of squat lobster in the family Munididae. The name is from the Greek eurys, meaning [...] "broad", and <b>bregma,</b> meaning [...] "front of the head", in {{reference}} to its broad rostrum. The males usually measure between 3.1 and 4.9 mm. It is found off of the Chesterfield Islands and Loyalty Islands, at depths between about 270 and 380 m.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stereotactic}} apparatus uses a set {{of three}} coordinates (x, y and z) in an orthogonal frame of reference (cartesian coordinates), or, alternatively, a cylindrical coordinates system, also with three coordinates: angle, depth and antero-posterior (or axial) location. The mechanical device has head-holding clamps and bars which puts the head in a fixed position {{in reference to the}} coordinate system (the so-called zero or origin). In small laboratory animals, these are usually bone landmarks which are known to bear a constant spatial relation to soft tissue. For example, brain atlases often use the external auditory meatus, the inferior orbital ridges, the median point of the maxilla between the incisive teeth. or the <b>bregma</b> (confluence of sutures of frontal and parietal bones), as such landmarks. In humans, the reference points, as described above, are intracerebral structures which are clearly discernible in a radiograph or tomograph. In newborn human babies, the [...] "soft spot" [...] where the coronal and sagittal sutures meet (known as the fontanelle) becomes the <b>bregma</b> when this gap closes.|$|E
50|$|Bregma: Hideous in {{appearance}} and behavior, the <b>Bregma</b> are more related to insects and, most importantly, mutating {{them into a}} fighting form. They're the weakest of Frythan races, but are fast in movement and combat and breed faster, thus favouring swarming tactics and attacking from all directions. They can build Beema Hyfes, where the namesake creature delivers a powerful attack, but dies in the process, or Tarmes Mownds, where the bred Tarmes are slow, but effective in attacking buildings and town walls.|$|E
50|$|Minotauros: Very {{different}} from the same Minotaurs depicted in Greek Mythology, the Minotaur Frythans base themselves on Alchemy, meaning they can convert Money into Life Points and vice versa. However, if placed atop a natural resource, the Alchemist Tor can also convert these resources into Money or Life Points, {{rather than the other}} way around. Minotaurs are also easy to train, but not as quick to amass as the <b>Bregma.</b> They have no ranged units, but compensate with their heightened speed, but fragile bodily defense.|$|E

This work was carried out using Image-J (NIH Research Services Branch, Bethesda, MD, USA). OD values ranged on an arbitrary scale from 0 (lowest density) to 3 (highest density). The two brain regions of interest (ROI) used to measure OD were the whole cortical mantle between the prefrontal (+ 4.20 mm from the <b>bregma)</b> and parietal (− 1.44 mm from the <b>bregma)</b> areas, and a subregion of this territory defined as the anterior primary sensorimotor cortex (top half of the dorsolateral convexity, between + 4.20 and + 0.24 mm from the <b>bregma),</b> where [18 F]FEOBV DVR {{was found to be}} particularly reduced following the immunotoxic lesions.

40|$|First, an {{aseptic surgery}} was {{performed}} to stereotaxically mark recording locations and implant a head post. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2 - 5 %, with O 2), placed on a homeothermic heating pad (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) set to 37 °C, and secured by a sliding nose clamp in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). After topical application of lidocaine jelly (5 %) along the midline of the head, an incision was made to expose the skull. Head angle was adjusted until the <b>Bregma</b> and Lambda points on the skull were at the same height. The <b>Bregma</b> to Lambda distance varied from 3. 8 to 4. 6 mm across the animal population. The left temporal muscle was separated from the bone {{to gain access to}} the auditory cortex (AC). Small dots (~ 100 um) of India ink, delivered by a stiff wire or needle mounted on the stereotaxic manipulator, were used to mark a 5 column x 3 row grid on the skull over the AC. The columns were located at 50 % to 90 % of the Bregma-Lambda distance, measured from <b>Bregma,</b> in 10 % steps (equivalent to ~ 360 - 460 um).

30|$|The anesthetized rabbit was {{fastened}} to the stereotaxic apparatus, and the skin in the operation field was disinfected with 75 % alcohol. A 3 -cm incision was made along the mid-line between the two post-orbital margins, and the subcutaneous fascia was stripped to expose the skull. A 3 % H 2 O 2 solution was used to open the periosteum and expose the <b>bregma</b> and lambdoid sutures. The head was then adjusted to make the <b>bregma</b> 1.5  mm higher than the lambdoid suture. The position of the internal capsule was located according to the rabbit stereotaxic atlas. The coronal plane crossing the center of <b>bregma</b> {{was used as the}} coronal zero plane (AP 0); A 1 represented the coronal plane 1  mm rostral to the AP 0, and the internal capsule was estimated to be between A 5 and P 2. The present experiment used the A 1 level and the <b>bregma</b> as base points, with the puncture point 6  mm left of the coronal suture and 1  mm parallel to the sagittal suture. A hole was drilled in the skull, and a # 12 needle and a 1 -ml syringe were used to deliver 0.8  ml autologous arterial blood taken from the central ear artery.

The rostral RNT showed specific topographical organization of its cerebellar connections. Microinjections into the rostral RNT, 1. 6 mm caudal to <b>bregma,</b> produced numerous HRP-labelled neurones within the anterior interposed (emboliform nucleus) and scarce HRP-labelled neurones within the lateral (dentate nucleus) cerebellar nuclei, whereas injections into the rostral RNT, 1. 8 mm caudal to <b>bregma,</b> produced numerous HRP-labelled neurones within the posterior interposed (globose nucleus) and scarce lightly HRP-labelled neurones within the lateral (dentate nucleus) cerebellar nuclei. Cerebellar connections with the rostral RNT were exclusively ipsilateral to the injection site. No HRP-labelled cells were detected in the medial (fastigial nucleus) cerebellar nucleus. The cerebellar connections reach the RNT via the superior cerebellar peduncle. By contrast, HRP injections into the anterior, posterior interposed and lateral cerebellar nuclei produced no labelled cells within the RNT. This study demonstrates the existence of direct cerebello-RNT but not RNT-cerebellar connections.

A second group ran voluntarily in exercise wheels attached to their home cage but had little opportunity for skill learning. The third group was handled daily but received no opportunity for learning or exercise. Each condition lasted 26 – 29 d.

40|$|Abstract- Persistence of frontal suture {{separating}} the two frontal {{bones in the}} adults is called metopism and the suture is called metopic suture. The fusion of metopic suture starts at around 18 months after birth and is completed by 8 - 9 years of age. The present study aims at the presence of persistent metopic suture in the adult skulls in various forms between glabella and <b>bregma</b> which may be misinterpreted as radiological fracture. 180 adult skulls ranging from 30 - 60 years of age group {{from the department of}} Anatomy RIMS, Ongole were studied for the presence of metopic suture and their shapes and measurements were tabulated. 103 skulls were found to have no metopic suture, 9 skulls showed complete metopic suture extending from glabella up to <b>bregma,</b> 18 skulls revealed ‘V ’ shaped, 14 skulls manifested to have ‘H ’ shape, 16 skulls were discovered to have linear metopic suture in the midline, 7 ‘Y ’ shape, 11 had inverted ‘U ’ shaped metopic suture, 2 skulls showed ‘U ’ shaped metopic suture with extension on to the right. To conclude, 42. 5 % of skulls revealed the presence of metopic suture in various forms and 57. 2 % showed no metopism. Index Terms- Adult skulls, <b>bregma,</b> frontal bone, glabella, metopic suture replaced by bone at about 2 years. Remnants of metopic suture may persist in some skulls at the glabella. According to Warwick & Williams metopic suture is obliterated by 8 th year. G. J. Romanes 5 declared that the metopic suture closes by 5 th or 6 th year leaving traces above or below. Henry Gray 1 postulated that the median suture usually disappears by about 8 years but may persist as metopic suture.
