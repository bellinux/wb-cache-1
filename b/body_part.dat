5|$|Despite Kabuto {{claiming}} that the technique is flawless, it does have several flaws, including that the reanimated can choose to leave their vessels to willingly drift back to the afterlife. Those who are paralyzed, sealed, or subjected to certain genjutsu, such as Komo Amatsukami: Koto, cannot take further action to free themselves until the technique is canceled. Also, the reanimated can sever their link to the jutsu so they will remain among the living even after the jutsu is canceled, as shown by Madara Uchiha. Furthermore, if such a ninja who lost a <b>body</b> <b>part</b> while alive is brought back to true life with the Rinnegan's Samsara of Heavenly Life Jutsu, the living equivalent of that ninja's <b>body</b> <b>part</b> is absent.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} part of the 20th century, {{piercing}} of any <b>body</b> <b>part</b> had become uncommon in the West. After World War II, it began increasing in popularity among the gay male subculture. Even ear piercing for a time was culturally unacceptable for women, but that relatively common form of piercing began growing in popularity from the 1960s. In the 1970s, piercing began to expand, as the punk movement embraced it, featuring nontraditional adornment such as safety pins; and Fakir Musafar began popularizing it as a form of Modern Primitivism, which incorporated piercing elements from other cultures, such as stretching.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of {{autotomy}} (self-amputation), shedding {{one of their own}} appendages in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost <b>body</b> <b>part</b> may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.|$|E

5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E
5|$|Hack, Starflight and the Ultima series were Adams' main influences. The roguelike Hack (1985) {{because of}} its {{randomly}} generated levels, deceased character persistence and detailed mechanics. Adams cited Ultima series as the inspiration for his generated worlds. The <b>body</b> <b>part</b> and wound system was inspired by 1990 role-playing game Cyberpunk 2020. He prefers modeling on individual elements, rather than entire systems, for better simulations with the outcomes being under his control. He said midpoint displacement generates the elevation {{of the world and}} its initial basic elements use fractals, which give it an overall natural look. He further explained that he made an algorithm to simulate rain shadows which occur in areas at the side of mountain deserts. For the distinct personalities of each unit, he took it from NEO PI-R test of which he admitted knowing little about. The feature of carps eating dwarves was unexpected when the game was released. He had written them having the same size and carps were designed to be carnivorous. A part of the game he felt tough, was implementing an A* search algorithm for pathfinding in any in-game character which, depending on their numbers and complexity of the path, can cause a heavy load on a computer. Adams composed the game's flamenco-inspired music.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific <b>body</b> <b>part</b> independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Body dissatisfaction plays a {{key role}} in the {{maintenance}} of eating disorders, and selective attention might be crucial for the origin of body dissatisfaction. A. Jansen, C. Nederkoorn, and S. Mulkens (2005) showed that eating disorder patients attend relatively more to their own unattractive <b>body</b> <b>parts,</b> whereas healthy controls attend relatively more to their own attractive <b>body</b> <b>parts.</b> In 2 studies, we investigated whether this bias in selective attention is causal to body dissatisfaction and whether an experimentally induced bias for attractive <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> might lead to increased body satisfaction in women who are highly dissatisfied with their bodies. Design: We used a between-subjects design in which participants were trained to attend to either their self-defined unattractive <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> or their self-defined attractive <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> by use of an eye tracker. Main Outcome Measures: State body and weight satisfaction. Results: Inducing a temporary attentional bias for self-defined unattractive <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> led to a significant decrease in body satisfaction and teaching body-dissatisfied women to attend to their own attractive <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> led to a significant increase in body satisfaction. Conclusion: Selective attention for unattractive <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> can play a role in the development of body dissatisfaction, and changing the way one looks may be a new way for improving body dissatisfaction in women.

5|$|The {{arsenal of}} weapons {{includes}} pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, grenades, and throwing knives, among others. Guns have a finite magazine {{and must be}} reloaded after {{a certain number of}} shots, but the player may acquire and carry as many weapons as can be found in each mission. The player's initial weapon in most missions is James Bond's Walther PPK, called the PP7 special issue in-game. Most of the game's firearms are modelled on real-life counterparts (although their names are altered), while others are based on fictitious devices featured in the Bond films, such as the Golden Gun and Moonraker laser. The weapons vary in characteristics such as rate of fire, degree of penetration, and type of ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which <b>body</b> <b>part</b> they hit.|$|E
5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the <b>body</b> <b>part</b> being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E
5|$|The redback spider {{has been}} {{historically}} {{responsible for more}} envenomations requiring antivenom than any other creature in Australia, however by 2017 the spider was blamed for only 250 envenomations requiring antivenom annually. Estimates {{of the number of}} people thought to be bitten by redback spiders each year across Australia range from 2,000 to 10,000. The larger female spider is responsible for almost all cases of redback spider bites. The smaller male was thought to be unable to envenomate a human, although some cases have been reported; their rarity is probably due to the male's smaller size and proportionally smaller fangs, rather than the male being incapable of biting or lacking potent venom. The bite from both juvenile and mature females appears to have similar potency. The male bite usually only produces short-lived, mild pain. Most bites occur in the warmer months between December and April, in the afternoon or evening. As the female redback is slow-moving and rarely leaves her web, bites generally occur as a result of placing a hand or other <b>body</b> <b>part</b> too close to the spider, such as when reaching into dark holes or wall cavities. Bites often also occur when a hidden spider is disturbed in items such as clothes, shoes, gloves, building materials, garden tools or children's outdoor toys.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focused on}} the way names of <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> are artistically used to convey {{meanings}} and messages in Kifipa, a Bantu language spoken in Tanzania. Since the <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> metaphors are used by people to portray meanings in their daily conversations (Kovecses, 2004; Vierke, 2012), the paper investigated such linguistic richness in the language. Methodologically, the study identified names of <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> expressed in Kifipa and analysed their metaphoric use. Results showed that metaphoric use of names of <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> in Kifipa relies on politeness (Watts, 2003), stylistic, and cognitive hypotheses (Jilala, 2012) as well as helping in word economy. It was argued herein that, before interpreting metaphors related to names of <b>body</b> <b>parts,</b> the context of use {{must be taken into}} account so as to arrive at the intended meanings. Thus, meanings and functions of the metaphors originating from names of <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> in Kifipa do not create universal terms that can be applied everywhere, at every time in every socio-cultural group, rather they are context-based...|$|R

Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E
25|$|By type of procedure: Amputation {{involves}} {{cutting off}} a <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> usually a limb or digit; castration {{is also an}} example. Resection is the removal of all of an internal organ or <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> or a key part (lung lobe; liver quadrant) of such an organ or <b>body</b> <b>part</b> that has its own name or code designation. Replantation involves reattaching a severed <b>body</b> <b>part.</b> Reconstructive surgery involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. Excision is the cutting out or removal of only part of an organ, tissue, or other <b>body</b> <b>part</b> from the patient. Transplant surgery is the replacement of an organ or <b>body</b> <b>part</b> by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the patient.

40|$|International audienceHumans usually {{point at}} objects to {{communicate}} with other persons, although they generally avoid pointing at the other's body. Moreover, patients with heterotopagnosia after left parietal damage cannot point at another person's <b>body</b> <b>parts,</b> although they can point at objects and at their own <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> and although they can grasp the others' <b>body</b> <b>parts.</b> Strikingly, their performance gradually improves for figurative human body targets. Altogether, {{this suggests that the}} body of another real person holds a specific status in communicative pointing. Here, we test in healthy individuals whether performance for communicative pointing is influenced by the communicative capacity of the target. In Experiment 1, pointing at another real person's <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> was compared to pointing at objects, and in Experiment 2, the person was replaced by a manikin. While reaction times for pointing at objects were shorter compared to pointing at other person's <b>body</b> <b>parts,</b> they were similar for objects and manikin <b>body</b> <b>parts.</b> By adapting Experiment 1 to PET-scan imaging (Experiment 3), we showed that, compared to pointing at objects, the brain network for pointing at other person's <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> involves the left posterior intraparietal sulcus, lesion of which could cause heterotopagnosia. Taken together, our results indicate that the specificity of pointing at another person's body goes beyond the visuo-spatial features of the human body and might rather rely on its communicative capacity...|$|R
