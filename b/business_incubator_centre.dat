40|$|Startups play a {{vital role}} in {{economic}} development, however, have a high rate of failure, partly due to insufficient knowledge resources. A <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> is an institution aimed to assist startups with services and resources in order to facilitate their development. There is, however, a gap in previous research regarding knowledge flows and acquisition in <b>business</b> <b>incubators.</b> Furthermore, few scholars have conducted research from the startup perspective in this context. This study, therefore, aims to explore how startups acquire knowledge in a <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> from the perspective of a startup. This has been investigated through a qualitative study of the <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> Uppsala Innovation <b>Centre</b> where a selection of startups has been interviewed regarding their participation and potential knowledge acquisition. The empirical findings reveal that startups acquire knowledge from several sources e. g. business coaches, other startups; however, the extent of knowledge acquisition and nature of knowledge differs.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify some of the key issues encountered by tsunami-affected small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the process of rehabilitation and re-establishment in Sri Lanka. The second objective is to assess how far these affected industries have received various benefits and supports from bodies such as government agencies, private sector firms, donors and NGOs to help them get back into business. The final objective is to recommend policies and strategies to develop the tsunami-affected SMEs in a self-sustaining manner and within a certain time period. The main database of firms for this research has been obtained from the Industrial Development Board, which conducted a survey covering 4, 389 tsunami-affected micro- and SMEs. In addition to this, information from various state organizations and NGOs-based sources has been used. This paper identifies the main issues related to tsunami-affected SMEs ranging from basic infrastructure provision up to finance, marketing, machinery, technology, training, product identification and development and so forth. In fact, it is shown that there are no significant differences between issues faced by SMEs in general and tsunami-affected SMEs, apart of course from the effects of a sudden disaster (the tidal wave). Consequently, these issues can be generalized as issues relevant to SMEs in Sri Lanka as a whole. However, under the flood and rain of local and foreign assistance, there have been more pledges and promises than actual deliveries and, so, tsunami-affected SMEs have received comparatively little support and assistance in recovering and no records can be found as to where the colossal amount of foreign assistance received has actually gone. Finally, this paper recommends various types of <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> <b>centres</b> and entrepreneurial enhancing skill programmes for the revamping of tsunami-affected SMEs in addition to the normal disaster risk management plan...|$|R
40|$|Innovative {{businesses}} {{are often the}} result of collective action of organisations involved in many-sided market structures, {{which can be found}} in and around <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> or tech¬no¬logy <b>centres.</b> Within such frame environments, many group interests beyond those of single producers and their immediate clients exist and interfere. Rather generically, important economic outcomes of innovations are se¬quen¬ces of cost reduc¬¬tion events at the level of econo¬mic sectors, where the na¬ture of (sector-wise) technology is influencing the pace of these events.

40|$|Business Incubation has {{recently}} attracted increased attention {{as a model}} of start-up facilitation. Venture capitalists see incubators as a means to diversify risky investment portfolios, and would-be entrepreneurs approach incubators for start-up support. More than a thousand incubators have been established in the last few years, most of them as regional <b>business</b> <b>incubators.</b> But new types of incubators are emerging. These incubators pursue different strategic objectives, apply different skills and competencies, and serve different markets. As a consequence, they have developed a new understanding of their sources of competitive advantage and business models which are able to satisfy some of the needs of the entrepreneur. Based on the results from some interviews to some entrepreneurs under the Blekinge <b>Business</b> <b>Incubator</b> and the <b>Centre</b> for Advanced Technology Incubator, some of the problems/needs of the entrepreneur were identified.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to business incubation research, focused on business environments in Uganda and Tanzania. Business incubation {{is not a}} new phenomenon and research began in earnest in the 1980 s. Thus, there is a broad range of studies on <b>business</b> <b>incubators,</b> how they are defined and what they do to support entrepreneurs. Establishment of <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> has also been increasingly common as a method of supporting entrepreneurs who are expected to increase regional and national economic growth through their activities. The phenomenon of business incubation originates in the US and Europe but has an increasing prevalence {{in the rest of the}} world. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the understanding of how context impacts the establishment of <b>business</b> <b>incubators,</b> especially in African countries. The aim of this thesis is to develop a deeper understanding of <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> establishment in selected African settings. Moreover, this thesis is based on a perspective of entrepreneurship as embedded in social and economic contexts. The aim is approached through three questions, delving into the expectations on and embodiments of the entrepreneurs, the role of context, and how theories of business incubation and its propagation may be adjusted based on the findings from this research. The theories chosen to understand <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> propagation are institutional theory, actor network theory and a transfer model. The research conducted is qualitative with a design based on an interpretative approach. This approach is deemed appropriate as the research questions aim to explore business incubation and have developed over time through the process of the research. The empirical settings of Uganda and Tanzania are suitable for the study because they include a mix of formal and informal institutional environments and show a current increasing trend of <b>business</b> <b>incubators.</b> Other characteristics for these environments are a small private sector and an abundance of entrepreneurs. The thesis builds on empirical material from two field studies including interviews, participant observations, and secondary data. The findings indicate that a <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> may be seen as a complement to a broader system of entrepreneurship support. However, <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> establishment needs to include an increased awareness of prerequisites, limitations and consequences of such establishment. Prerequisites include how embeddedness in a mix of formal and informal institutions influences the performance of economic transactions for the entrepreneurs. Furthermore, <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> have capacity limitations creating a difficult task for managers responsible for identifying promising entrepreneurs from the large variety of entrepreneurs found in the studied settings. These findings are consequential since the funding of <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> could possibly be spent elsewhere. This thesis {{contributes to}} <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> theories through an understanding of how <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> are embedded in the studied contexts. Furthermore, the theories of propagation included in this thesis facilitate the understanding of how <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> travel around the world, but need to be sensitised towards power asymmetries between countries. The analysis of managerial practices of <b>business</b> <b>incubators</b> contributes to <b>business</b> <b>incubator</b> policy by suggesting a deeper analysis of local needs and of how to compensate for contextual constraints...|$|R
