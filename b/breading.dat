5|$|Deep-fried {{butter is}} a snack food {{comprising}} butter that is {{coated with a}} batter or <b>breading</b> and then deep-fried. The dish has been served at several fairs in the United States; among them, the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Texas, and the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa; {{and now it is}} served worldwide. It has a significant buttery flavor, which has been compared to that of French toast. Fried butter is a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Early {{improvement}} {{was carried out}} with the traditional tools, but new technology was increasingly important. Lighter ploughs were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board. It was first adopted in the south-east and spread to {{rest of the country}} in the 1770s. From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated threshing mill speeded up {{a vital part of the}} harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation.

5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The <b>breading</b> adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

They are tea <b>bread</b> (similar to the baguette), sugar <b>bread</b> (which is a sweet <b>bread),</b> brown (whole wheat) <b>bread,</b> and butter <b>bread.</b> Rye <b>bread,</b> oat <b>bread</b> and malt <b>bread</b> are also quite common.|$|R

5|$|The English {{enjoyed a}} marked superiority over the Scots in cavalry, {{particularly}} with the resurgence of heavy cavalry with their use of demi-lancers. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies after Bannockburn in 1314. It was limited by the shortage of suitable horses. James V imported great horses and mares from Denmark {{in an attempt to}} improve the quality of Scottish <b>breading</b> stock. In the mid-sixteenth century the Scots still lacked sufficient heavy cavalry. In their place they fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the Borders and usually wearing jacks of leather or mail, mounted on small horses and using light lances. As firearms became available they began to field relatively large numbers of mounted arquebusiers.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK Big Fish, the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's <b>breading</b> to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big Fish in its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the Big Fish in 2005.|$|E
5|$|At the Union of 1707 England {{had about}} five times the {{population}} of Scotland, and about 36 times as much wealth, however, Scotland began to experience the beginnings of economic expansion that would begin {{to allow it to}} close this gap. Contacts with England led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. There was increasing regional specialisation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} {{addition}} of gelatinized rice porridge to <b>bread</b> {{has been investigated}} on loaf volume, viscoelastic properties and air-bubble structure. We prepared four variety of bread: <b>bread</b> containing rice porridge (rice porridge <b>bread),</b> <b>bread</b> containing gelatinized rice flour (gelatinized rice flour <b>bread),</b> and wheat flour and rice flour <b>breads</b> for references. Instrumental analyses the <b>bread</b> samples were carried out by volume measurement of loaf samples, creep test and digital image analysis of crumb samples. Rice porridge <b>bread</b> showed the maximum specific volume of 4. 51 cm 3 /g, and even gelatinized rice flour <b>bread</b> showed 4. 30 cm 3 /g, which was larger than the reference <b>bread</b> samples (wheat and rice flour <b>breads).</b> The values of viscoelastic moduli of gelatinized rice flour <b>bread</b> and rice porridge <b>bread</b> were significantly smaller (p < 0. 05) than those of wheat flour and rice flour <b>breads,</b> which indicates addition of gelatinized rice flour or rice porridge to <b>bread</b> dough encouraged <b>breads</b> softer.

Therefore, the bubble structures of the <b>bread</b> samples seemed to similar, which implied that difference of viscoelasticity was attributed to air-bubble wall (solid phase of <b>bread</b> crumb) rather than air-bubble.

Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters.

25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{was sometimes}} used in cooking green vegetables, as {{it gives them}} a bright green colour—which has been described as artificial-looking—due to its reacting with chlorophyll to produce chlorophyllin. However, this tends to affect taste, texture and nutritional content, and is no longer common. Baking soda is still used, though, in the traditional British mushy peas recipe for soaking the peas. It is also used in Asian and Latin American cuisine to tenderize meats. Baking soda may react with acids in food, including vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid). It is also used in <b>breading</b> such as for fried foods to enhance crispness and allow passages for steam to escape, so the <b>breading</b> is not blown off during cooking.|$|E

These rye <b>breads</b> are made entirely from rye flour and are the most common <b>breads</b> in the Finnish diet. Other types of sour <b>bread</b> are still baked in the residual heat of ovens and the longer baking time at low temperature gives the <b>bread</b> both a darker colour and a higher density and hardness than ordinary rye <b>bread.</b> A few wheat <b>breads</b> are still made in Finland, although most are simple buns or loaves of sliced or unsliced <b>bread.</b> Vesirinkeli, water rings, are small, almost tasteless rings of yeast-leavened wheat <b>bread,</b> which resemble bagels.
