Sustained anti-Pseudomonas activities in <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretions</b> were achieved only in patients with very high aminoglycoside levels in serum.

Serum and <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretion</b> concentrations obtained between 1. 5 and 2. 0 h after the final dose ranged from 17 to 40 μg/ml and 2. 3 to 8. 4 μg/ml {{with a mean of}} 23. 7 ± 2. 9 and 5. 23 ± 1. 5 μg/ml, ± 1 standard error of the mean, respectively. The highest <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretion</b> concentration in each subject correlated with the highest serum concentration (r = 0. 83, P 0. 5). The mean <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretion</b> concentration of the 15 specimens obtained more than 7 h after the final dose was less than 1. 0 μg/ml, with a range from 0. 3 to 1. 6 μg/ml.

40|$|The {{positive}} correlation between the protein concentration in <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretions</b> and the penetration of amikacin and tobramycin {{in the present study}} suggests that inflammation favorably affects the penetration of aminoglycosides into these secretions. As shown in this and other studies, local inactivation of aminoglycosides might counterbalance this effect to some extent. The relatively low penetration of aminoglycosides into the <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretions</b> (- 200 %) probably accounts for the poor antibacterial activity of <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretions</b> of aminoglycoside-treated patients and, possibly, for the poor clinical outcome of bronchopneumonia due to gram-negative bacteria. Continuous infusion of these antibiotics, even at high dosage, does not appear to solve the problem; it does not achieve at any time satisfactory inhibitory activity against Enterobacteriacae or Pseumodomanas aeruginosa in the <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretions.</b> Although intermittent injections can result in higher levels of aminogtycosides within the <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretions,</b> such levels cannot be maintained for prolonged periods unless the dosage is increased.

40|$|Purpose: {{patients}} with neuromuscular diseases presents an {{high incidence of}} respiratory infections favoured by stagnation of deep <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretions</b> and deficit of cough.

40|$|The {{effect on}} mucin output of placing dilute serum from healthy donors {{in contact with}} the luminal surface of human airway has been studied.

40|$|In cystic fibrosis, {{colonization}} of the airways with Pseudomonas aeruginosa follows colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and {{is related to}} accelerated deterioration of pulmonary function.

40|$|Background: Post-operative {{pulmonary}} infection often {{appears to}} result from aspiration of pathogens colonizing the oral cavity. It was hypothesized that impaired periodontal status and pathogenic oral bacteria significantly contribute to development of aspiration pneumonia following neurosurgical operations. Further, the prophylactic effects of a single dose preoperative cefazolin on the oral bacteria were investigated. Methods: A matched cohort of 18 patients without postoperative lung complications was compared to 5 patients who developed pneumonia within 48 hours after brain surgery. Patients waiting for elective operation of a single brain tumor underwent dental examination and saliva collection before surgery. Bacteria from saliva cultures were isolated and periodontal disease was scored according to type and severity. Patients received 15 mg/kg cefazolin intravenously {{at the beginning of}} surgery. Serum, saliva and <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretion</b> were collected promptly after the operation. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefazolin regarding the isolated bacteria were determined. The actual antibiotic concentrations in serum, saliva and <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretion</b> were measured by capillary electrophoresis upon completion of surgery. Bacteria were isolated again from the sputum of postoperative pneumonia patients. Results: The number and severity of coexisting periodontal diseases were significantly greater in patients with postoperative pneumonia in comparison to the control group (p = 0. 031 and p = 0. 002, respectively). The relative risk of developing postoperative pneumonia in high periodontal score patients was 3. 5 greater than in patients who had low periodontal score (p < 0. 0001). Cefazolin concentration in saliva and <b>bronchial</b> <b>secretion</b> remained below detectable levels in every patient. Conclusion: Presence of multiple periodontal diseases and pathogenic bacteria in the saliva are important predisposing factors of postoperative aspiration pneumonia in patients after brain surgery. The low penetration rate of cefazolin into the saliva indicates that its prophylactic administration may not be sufficient to prevent postoperative aspiration pneumonia. Our study suggests that dental examination may be warranted in order to identify patients at high risk of developing postoperative respiratory infections...|$|E
