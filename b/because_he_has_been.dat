25|$|Manhattan {{homicide}} detective Leo McCarthy becomes {{interested in the}} case <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> pursuing DeFranco for years. He discovers that the assassination was faked and that Mason planned it. When he is suspended by his captain for his reckless methods, McCarthy manages to steal his boss's badge and gun.|$|E
25|$|According to the Wall Street Journal, Shahzad {{received}} bomb-making training {{from the}} Pakistani Taliban. The Pakistani Taliban {{are made up}} overwhelmingly of Pashtun tribesmen. According to CBS News, Shahzad {{has been on the}} Department of Homeland Security travel lookout list since 1999 <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> bringing in large amounts of cash (approximately $80,000) into the United States.|$|E
25|$|Maury Chaykin as Accountant, {{who helps}} the King of Ward 3 bully {{the members of}} the other wards. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> blind since birth, the Accountant is much more used to relying on his other senses, which gives him a major {{advantage}} over the other prisoners; he assumes control over Ward 3 and the food supplies for the community after the King is murdered.|$|E

50|$|According to Clancy Lyall, Dike stopped <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{wounded in}} the right {{shoulder}} (which Lyall saw), not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> panicked.|$|R
25|$|The {{law in the}} UAE {{provides}} that a man may unilaterally divorce his wife, whereas a woman who wishes to seek a divorce must apply for a court order which is only granted on limited grounds. These include failure of the husband to provide maintenance, his disappearance, or sexual desertion of his wife, or <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> sentenced to imprisonment for a term that exceeds three years.|$|E
25|$|The {{same goes}} for {{readings}} of literary texts says Pommier. For example, Molière's Don Juan only pursues one love object for mediated reasons, not all of them, as Girard claims. Or again, Sancho Panza wants an island not because he is catching the bug of romanticism from Don Quixote, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> promised one. And Pavel Pavlovitch, in Dostoevsky's Eternal Husband, has been married for ten years before Veltchaninov becomes his rival, so Veltchaninov is not in fact essential to Pavel's desire.|$|E
25|$|In the 1996 {{television}} movie, Chang Lee {{helps the}} Master <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> duped {{into believing that}} the Doctor had stolen his body. When Lee begins to realise the truth behind the Master, his loyalty begins to falter, therefore the Master attempts to kill him without hesitation. In promotional media surrounding the movie, Lee is depicted more as a companion to the Eighth Doctor (alongside Grace Holloway), and {{was referred to as}} such in a documentary series released as part of the 50 year anniversary celebrations, The Doctors Revisited - The Eighth Doctor.|$|E

25|$|In September, the candidacies of Victor Ponta and Monica Macovei were contested at the Constitutional Court, but the {{complaints}} were {{rejected by the}} court. On the other hand, the National Integrity Agency (ANI) announced in April 2013 that it believed Klaus Iohannis was in a 'state of incompatibility', <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the representative of Sibiu in the General Meeting of Shareholders of SC Apă Canal SA Sibiu (since 5 August 2010) and of SC Piețe SA (since 30 April 2009), which contravenes legal provisions governing conflicts of interest. Iohannis repeatedly said that ANI's claims to that effect were mistaken.|$|E
25|$|Florinda, Hellena, and Valeria enter, in {{different}} disguises. Hellena {{says that she}} is not in love, but she cannot stop thinking about Willmore. The women see Belvile, Blunt, and Frederick approach, but the fact that Willmore is not with them causes the women to hide and to eavesdrop on the men. Belvile, Blunt and Frederick have come to retrieve Willmore from Angellica <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> inside with her for two hours. Willmore comes out and brags about having enjoyed Angellica's charms for free. A servant of Lucetta's enters and takes Blunt back with him to Lucetta's lodgings.|$|E
25|$|This {{work has}} been avoided in some {{discourse}} on Beuys <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> put in artistically sacrosanct position {{and this is not}} in conformance with Beuys' other work. In choosing to do a piece in the form of popular music, Beuys demonstrated a commitment to his views and the most expansive ways of having them reach people. While it is easy to resist and ridicule Beuys' efforts in the pop arena, it does not change {{the fact that this is}} an important part of his collected works that needs to be acknowledged to better understand his scope, intention and own views of art.|$|E

60|$|They <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hard words--quite unjustifiable unless <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{made himself}} guilty of {{something}} worse than conduct that was simply despicable. Not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a poor creature, not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> tormented the old man's last days by {{an absence of}} all generous feeling, not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> altogether unlike what, to her thinking, a Squire of Llanfeare should <b>be,</b> <b>had</b> she answered him with those crushing words. It was because at the moment she had believed him to be something infinitely worse than that.|$|R
25|$|Tatsuya is {{the main}} male protagonist in the story. He is very {{knowledgeable}} about {{the moon and the}} Kingdom of Sphere <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> interested in it since he was very young. He has this odd unconscious habit of pinching girls on the nose as a sign of affection. Tatsuya constantly finds enjoyment in teasing Natsuki about random things. He is quite loyal toward Feena and her aim to fulfill her mother's dream to reunite the Earth and Moon. Though somewhat apprehensive about the homestay, Tatsuya eventually falls in love with the princess and their union cements the alliance between the two worlds.|$|E
25|$|Tarkan {{has three}} step-siblings named Adnan, Gülay and Nuray from his mother's first {{marriage}}, and a brother, Hakan, and younger sister, Handan from {{her marriage to}} his father. Although Tarkan was raised in Alzey {{until the age of}} 13, his father Ali decided to move the family back to Turkey in 1986. His father {{died of a heart attack}} in 1995 at the age of 49 and was buried in his home village of Rüzgarlı Köy, in the Turkish district of Ikizdere in the Rize Province of the Turkish Black Sea region. His mother later married an architect, Seyhun Kahraman. Tarkan keeps close ties with his family in Turkey and Germany. Other than his native Turkish, he speaks English fluently. Although he still understands German, he speaks little, primarily <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> living in the U.S. and Turkey for the last 20 years.|$|E
500|$|At {{the police}} station, Mulder tests Bruckman's ability by having him handle various objects {{to see what}} they [...] "tell" [...] him. It becomes {{apparent}} that Bruckman's only real psychic talent is an ability to see details of people's deaths. Scully arrives with a key chain bearing the insignia of an investment company that uses astrology to make financial predictions, taken from the doll collector's body - the same key chain was found on two of the other dead fortunetellers. Bruckman knows that the firm is owned by one Claude Dukenfield, not through a psychic revelation but because he coincidentally sold the man an insurance policy recently. He says that Mulder and Scully {{will not be able to}} talk to Dukenfield though, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> murdered.|$|E

500|$|In the Dunder Mifflin office, Charles asks Jim (John Krasinski) for a [...] "rundown" [...] of {{his client}} information. Jim {{does not know}} what a rundown is, but is too embarrassed to ask <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> making such a poor {{impression}} with Charles. Jim spends much of the day {{trying to figure out what}} a rundown is, making several failed attempts to figure it out by chatting vaguely about it with Charles and other coworkers. When he finally finishes what he believes is a rundown, Charles does not look at it and simply asks Jim to fax it to everyone on the distribution list. Jim {{does not know what}} the distribution list is either, but rather than asking Charles, he simply faxes the rundown to his father.|$|E
500|$|Connor {{undergoes}} {{dramatic changes}} in season five. Very much an opposite to his earlier persona, the only features common with his previous self are his protectiveness of loved ones, attraction to older women, and later his fighting prowess. Otherwise he's a prosperous, sweet young man, due to his fake memories of a happy childhood. Jeffrey Bell wanted to highlight Connor's [...] "well-adjusted" [...] mentality for this season. Vincent calls him a [...] "happy" [...] person and liked playing this version more <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> playing the [...] "brooding" [...] version {{for a year and}} a half year. The comic book Connor develops in the same direction as he starts emerging a hero still keeping his pleasant personality. Joss Whedon characterizes the comic book Connor as [...] "the closest thing to a superhero hell has' because he has powers without any of the weaknesses of the vampire, and is well adjusted. Brain considers him [...] "one of the coolest characters in any series or comics".|$|E
500|$|Lulla Rosenfeld {{writes that}} Henry Irving, the great Shylock before that time, played Shylock as [...] "morally {{superior}} to the Christians around him... driven to cruelty only by their more cruel persecutions." [...] In contrast, [...] "Adler scorned justification. Total vindication was his aim." [...] In Adler's own words, [...] "Shylock from the first was governed by pride rather than revenge. He wishes to humble and terrify Antonio for the insult and humiliation he has suffered at his hands. This is why he {{goes so far as}} to bring his knife and scales into the court. For Shylock, however, the desired climax was to refuse the pound of flesh with a gesture of divine compassion. When the verdict goes against him, he is crushed <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> robbed of this opportunity, not because he lusts for Antonio's death. This was my interpretation. This is the Shylock I have tried to show." [...] The road from this to method acting is clear.|$|E
5000|$|Bernard {{answered}} the letter by saying that, if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> assisted at the council, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> dragged {{to it by}} force. In his response Bernard wrote, ...|$|R

500|$|In {{the writing}} of {{previous}} albums by Rolo Tomassi {{a majority of the}} music was written by James and Eva Spence wrote most of the lyrics. For Astraea, the band treated it as a collaboration between all five members; however James and Cayford were the [...] "main brains". In January 2012, in an interview with Kerrang!, Eva Spence confirmed that the band are self-producing their third full-length with Hysterics producer Jason Sanderson. The choice of returning to Sanderson was <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a close friend of the band members for a long time. Regarding the sound of the album, she stated that it will be [...] "more direct and heavier", but also noted that the band [...] "will never shy away from being experimental". However, James Spence went on record saying that during the actual production of the album the band did not consider themselves as part of the overall production; rather just having a say in every aspect of the album progress. In April 2012, the NME did a studio update with on the album with James Spence stating that the band's writing was [...] "70% complete". He credited how the new members Chris and Nathan [...] "breathed new life" [...] into the band's writing as the original three members had become [...] "too set in their ways". The band members have commented that this has made the writing a lot more fun as the band no longer writes a song then learns it. As the band wrote Astraea they decided to contrast with their typical style more with the clean and ethereal parts, which led to an increase of Eva's singing.|$|E
