40|$|Intermediate turbine ducts {{are used}} in modern multi-spool jet engines for guiding the flow from the {{high-pressure}} turbine to the low-pressure turbine. The demand for lighter, more efficient and more environmentally friendly aircraft engines requires the new jet engines to have higher <b>by-pass</b> <b>ratios.</b> This leads to a demand on the intermediate turbine ducts to be more "aggressive", i. e. to have larger radial offset, and to be shorter and more diffusing. Unfortunately the flow phenomena that occur in such ducts are both complicated and poorly understood, and current numerical tools are of limited value. Therefore, {{in order to make}} these ducts more aggressive, {{a better understanding of the}} flow inside intermediate turbine ducts is necessary. As part of an effort to overcome this problem a new, large-scale, low-speed turbine facility has been design and constructed at Chalmers University of Technology.

40|$|Demands on {{improved}} efficiency, reduced {{emissions and}} lowered noise levels cause a strive towards high <b>by-pass</b> <b>ratios</b> of commercial turbofan engines. This {{results in an}} increased radial offset between the high- and low-pressure turbines. Thus {{the design of the}} intermediate turbine duct connecting the two turbines becomes more challenging. In this thesis the main focus is to explore techniques that enable design of turbine ducts with reduced length, larger radial offset or increased diffusion, so-called aggressive ducts. Response surface methodology and design of experiments techniques have been adopted to perform duct shape optimization based on CFD. A novel geometry parameterization suitable for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric endwalls, based on axial orthogonal polynomials and circumferential harmonics, has been introduced. Results show that shape optimization has the potential to reduce duct loss significantly. Flow control could be applied to avoid separation in highly aggressive ducts. Vortex generators are well-known, reliable and cost-effective passive flow control devices and have therefore been used in this work. Resolving the small scales of vortex generators requires fine grids and time consuming computations. Therefore a computational body-force model was developed and validated. The baseline separation in a very aggressive turbine duct was suppressed by an optimized vortex generator installation, defined using the body-force model. Steady RANS analyzes with different two-equation eddy viscosity models have been used to assess the aerothermal behavior of a state-of-the-art turbine duct.

The body of literature dedicated to the latter is, however, not as considerable as that dealing with by-pass transition. This {{is one of the reasons}} why this article sometimes is biased towards by-pass transition modelling. The other reason is that this is the transition mode best suited to be described with a statistical approach, which has tempted many authors to apply well established ideas from the vast field of turbulence modelling. After an introductory description of the different transition modes some early work on transition is discussed. The turbulent spot concept Emmons (1951), followed by a derivation of the Dhawan & Narasimha (1958) intermittency distribution, is of coarse included. With the introduction of intermittency, there was soon a need for a theoretical analogue to the experimental technique `conditional sampling', i. e. a measure to treat, or model, turbulent and laminar flow portions separately. Conditional averages were introduced by Libby (1974) and it was not long before full transport equations for the intermittency factor was derived. Discussed is also the prospect of using so called low Reynolds number modelling of both near wall turbulence and transition. Thereafter follows a description of two recent transition modelling approaches and the review ends with a section collecting numerous modelling attempts, ranging from simple algebraic correlations to complex transport equations for the intermittency factor, all aiming to improve predictions of the intriguing physics of transitional flows...|$|R

40|$|Intermediate turbine ducts {{are used}} to guide the flow in {{turbofan}} engines from the short-radius high-pressure turbine to the large-radius low-pressure turbine. The demand for more efficient and silent jet engines and with a reduced environmental impact requires turbofans with increasingly higher <b>by-pass</b> <b>ratios.</b> Intermediate turbine ducts that could provide a greater radial offset in shorter length would contribute greatly to achieving this goal, especially if they maintained low pressure losses and avoided non-uniformities in the outlet flow that might affect the downstream low-pressure turbine. This thesis presents an experimental study of the flowfield and the heat transfer in an aggressive intermediate turbine duct. The goals of this research were to obtain {{an understanding of the}} mechanisms governing the heat transfer in intermediate turbine ducts; and as well, to provide detailed high-quality flow and heat transfer experimental data for CFD validation purposes. The experiments were carried out in a state-of-the-art aggressive intermediate turbine duct with structural struts in a large-scale low-speed turbine facility at realistic engine Reynolds numbers and inlet conditions. For the flow measurements, oil-film visualization, static pressure measurements, 5 -hole pressure probe and hot-wire anemometry were used. The heat transfer measurements were performed using a technique based on IR-thermography. The experiments were performed for three different turbine operating points in order to evaluate the effect of inlet swirl on the flow and heat transfer in the duct. The results showed that the stationary flow features arising from the upstream turbine had a large effect on both the flowfield and the heat transfer in the duct. The combination of tip leakage flow and structural struts gave rise to a large vortex with changing relative strength for different inlet swirl. This vortex locally dominated the heat transfer in the neighborhood of the suction side of the vane. Also, counter-rotating vortex pairs near the hub created streaks of low and high heat transfer coefficient that varied ± 20 % on the hub. For a lower inlet swirl angle, flow separation occurred at the corner between the shroud endwall and the strut pressure side due to the mismatch of the strut and flow angles in the tip leakage region. These flow separations created large circumferential variations in the duct outflow, and significantly modified the flowfield and heat transfer on the endwalls where an increase in the heat transfer coefficient of up to 25 % was seen. These and other important effects of the flowfield on the heat transfer distributions have been identified. The results provide valuable insights into duct flow phenomena and how they are coupled to the heat transfer. Together they represent a first step towards understanding the heat transfer phenomena in the duct. The results are already being used to improve design methods in industry.

The description procedure of bypass turbojet characteristics with mixig chamber and with low <b>by-pass</b> <b>ratio</b> concerning a maximum bench mode was developed; for bypass turbojet with high <b>by-pass</b> <b>ratio</b> for a calculation of characteristics as a basic mode was offered to use a theoretical mode of the critical efflux that provides similarity of an engine module on speed of flight. It was theoretically found out, that on a mode of similarity of an engine module change of relative hourly fuel consumption by an altitude and speeds of flight does not depend on type of the gas-turbine engine. On the basis of statistical relative mass characteristics of units of engines the calculation model of the inertia moments of rotors of two-shaft bypass turbojet with retaining stages was developed. The engineering calculation procedure of transient characteristics of these engines was developed with use of change of unitary temperature criterion of engine acceleration or drop of revolutions.

40|$|A new {{refrigeration}} {{solution for}} high <b>by-pass</b> <b>ratio</b> engines {{is the main}} objective of the Intelligent Cooling System project. This study {{is based on a}} surface integrated air-oil heat exchanger placed at the location of the air separator nose within the bypass flow of a turbofan. The aim is to help the cooling of the oil circuit without disturbing the air stream and decreasing the overall efficiency of the engine. The present work focuses on the aerodynamic characterization of the interaction between the three dimensional bypass flow and different configurations of finned heat exchangers. This research is done in von Karman Institute in a new blowdown wind tunnel characterized by an helicoidal test section specifically design within this project in order to reproduce the engine bypass flow in the region of interest. This report presents the work performed for the calibration and implementation of the thermocouples and hot wire anemometers used for total temperature and turbulence measurements, as well as part of the flow results, with the relative postprocessing methodology. Finally the uncertainties analysis was done in order to estimate the goodness of the results and to identify the major sources of errors...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 8 th March 2018. This paper {{examines}} the aerodynamic design {{requirements of a}} cooled cooling air system for a large, high <b>by-pass</b> <b>ratio,</b> high overall pressure ratio aero-engine. This can be broken into aerodynamic sub-systems each with their own set of requirements and challenges. A low pressure system is required to deliver air bled from the bypass duct to a heat exchanger {{for use as a}} heat sink. Similarly, a high pressure system removes a portion of the hot core engine air from a location downstream of the compressor and ducts this to-and-from the HX for cooling. This cooled air must then be returned, across the main gas path, for use in component cooling. The challenge is to design these sub-systems such that satisfactorily perform their own function whilst integrating into the existing engine architecture. This paper presents an overview of a number of studies which use CFD to explore the design space and develop appropriate designs which were subsequently experimentally validated on several isothermal test facilities. Ultimately the feasibility of designing the aerodynamic sub-systems was demonstrated and a future design strategy established...|$|E
