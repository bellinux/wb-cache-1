500|$|With three races {{remaining}} in the Championship and a fourteen-point advantage, Webber said he would continue his pursuit of the title; [...] "I need to keep racing hard and going for victories. Clearly, if my rivals have a rough weekend {{it makes it a}} bit harder for them and it gives me a bit more scope, but I'm not looking to abuse that because it can all go pear-shaped very fast." [...] Vettel said his season had been fraught with car problems but he remained positive about his chances; [...] "I think it's normal to have ups and downs – and sometimes you have more, sometimes less – <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> the expectation was probably {{to be in a position}} to fight for the championship and I think we're in a very strong and very good position." [...] Alonso urged his teammate Massa to help him in his title bid and said the Korean Grand Prix could become [...] "decisive" [...] for his championship rivals. He favoured Hamilton to win the Korean Grand Prix. With Hamilton twenty-eight points behind Webber and with Button a further three points behind his teammate, McLaren's team principal Martin Whitmarsh said his drivers would keep their focus in the season's remaining three races and produce consistent performances. Karun Chandhok, who raced for Hispania in the first ten races of the season, said Red Bull were the favourites to win, and that he thought the circuit's three long straights would suit the McLaren cars.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2015, radio {{broadcaster}} Alan Jones {{commented on}} the push to legalise same-sex marriage saying, [...] "my view is that when people find love, {{they should be able}} to celebrate it. And they shouldn't be discriminated against according to the nature of that love. To deny people the recognition for a relationship which is based on love is to deny, in my opinion, one of humankind's most basic, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> elusive, qualities. Let the Parliament vote. It makes the laws of the land... we shouldn't be frightened about celebrating the love of one person for another." [...] Prime Minister Abbott said [...] "I deeply respect his views and I’m confident that he would respect mine, he would respect my sister’s, he would respect Bill Shorten’s and Tanya Plibersek’s and Warren Entsch’s, and that’s what we need – we need to see mutual respect of all the different views on this debate because as I said, decent people can differ on this subject." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{the morning}} was sunny, the bells were ringing, the ladies of Milby were dressed in their Sunday garments.|$|E
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> {{our hero}} {{was too far}} gone now to contain himself until all {{that he had to}} say was out.|$|R
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> in that spirit-land wither I had journeyed is to {{be found}} neither time nor space nor any other {{familiar}} thing.|$|R
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> {{these are}} things too long to bring in here, so neither can I make a promise of the coming out by themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... 1ST HAYMAKER. Well <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> afoor, it be {{the last}} loäd hoäm; do thou and thy sweet'art sing us hoäm to supper--'The Last Loäd Hoäm.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{that every}} Devil has not a Cloven-Foot, so I must add {{now for the}} present Purpose, that every Cloven-Foot is not the Devil.|$|E
6000|$|Here {{he paused}} to take some more snuff, {{watching}} me over the spoon as he drew it up his great nostrils, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing, went on-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But,</b> Lord! (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before) {{you smile}} pityingly, not bitterly, at this hubbub, and moralise upon it, in the calm evenings {{when there is}} no school at Sherborne.|$|R
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> {{the mistake}} was in pinning the card to the {{tablecloth}} {{instead of to}} the coat. And error in this world is always severely punished.|$|R
60|$|So {{everything}} must be begun afresh: and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{walked with}} the impi towards the Ghost Mountain, I thought much and often of {{the manner in}} which this might be done. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary Armat {{was not an}} ill-natured girl, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, she was a high-spirited one, and was at {{the time}} in a state of justifiable irritation.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not want}} to sit down, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, I felt that I must be politic, and so took a seat {{on the other end of}} the sofa.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose, {{when you}} think of it, it is; <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> it is a way we have {{in this part of the}} country. Well, mother, have you got that fish nearly fried?" ...|$|E
60|$|I beg {{leave to}} say that my {{resignation}} is not sent in in any spirit of insubordination, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> before <b>said,</b> simply to relieve you from any embarrassment in changing commanders where lack of confidence may have rendered it necessary.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it doesn't come in there," [...] Bathurst laughed. [...] "Morally I am not nervous so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> know, {{physically}} I am. I {{would give}} a great deal if I could get over it, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> it is constitutional." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand, Sir John; <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> do {{not think}} {{we should all be}} told until the blow is ready to be struck, as they would be afraid that some one might inform against them, if time and {{opportunity}} were granted them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm prepared, if necessary," [...] Madame de Mauves {{continued}} after a pause, [...] "to {{fall back}} on my strict right. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, I shall be greatly disappointed if I'm obliged to do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a goose!" [...] {{said his}} aunt. [...] "They wouldn't eat you. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> please yourself. Anyhow, hold your tongue {{about it to}} William John, or you'll have him crying and bawling to go too." ...|$|E
60|$|Now we were {{standing}} in the clear sunlight, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> the words a wind stirred the palm-trees and the shadow from one of them fell full upon me, and she who was very quick, noted it.|$|E
60|$|The wizard {{suddenly}} seemed {{to become aware}} of our presence, for, ceasing his contemplation of the sinking sun, he scanned us both with his slow, thoughtful eyes, which somehow reminded me of those of a chameleon, although they were not prominent, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> sunken.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will walk}} round presently," [...] Cyril said, [...] "and gather, <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can, {{who they are}} that live there; <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> fancy it is over that wall and into the alley that your goods have departed. The apprentices' room is {{this side of the}} house, is it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{agree with}} you," [...] said Eric carelessly. [...] "I could not marry {{any woman who}} did not fulfill those conditions. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> am {{not in love with}} Agnes Campion--and it wouldn't be of any use if I were. She is as good as engaged to Larry West. You {{remember}} West?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 6. In church matters Herbert, Newcastle, and I are {{the most}} {{conservative}} and the most church-like; with a sympathy from Argyll. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> there is no struggle here: patronage, the sore subject, not being a cabinet affair.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{my private}} affair," [...] said Asaph, [...] "but there's no debt in it. It is all fair and square--cash down, so to speak; though, of course, it's not cash, but work. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, that isn't settled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come, my friend," [...] said Little Tim, with a laugh; [...] "I'm {{no match}} for you in argiment, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, I don't {{understand}} Manitou, an' I don't see, or feel, or hear him, so it's of no use tryin'." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> {{my views}} lay another way, {{and my head}} had been long working upon the {{discourse}} my men had had with the Spaniards at Baldavia. I frequently talked with the two Chilian Indians whom I had on board, and who spoke Spanish pretty well, and whom we had taught to speak a little English.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{after that}} feast {{was over and}} done, Sir Tristram said: [...] "Lady, will you not of your {{courtesy}} {{tell me why you}} wear the weeds of sorrow in which you are clad? This I ask, not from idle humor, <b>but</b> because, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, <b>I</b> may haply be able to aid you in whatever trouble it is under which you lie." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} briefly I would ask no better, for I was transpierced with this display of fatherly emotion; <b>but</b> even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> the words, the most insolent revolt surged through my arteries. I held him in horror, him, his portrait, and his son; and {{had there been}} any choice but death or a Mormon marriage, I declare before Heaven I had embraced it.|$|R
60|$|If {{you are not}} tired {{with all}} this close reasoning, I will tell you.--If you are, say so: <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> at first, I {{want to show you}} what steady and sharp head-work this same geology requires, even in the nearest gravel-pit.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, nor did she. Nor did I {{definitely}} {{wish her}} to just yet; for your playing is very good. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{one of the}} churchwardens has been so anxious for a change, that, as matters stand, I couldn't consistently refuse my consent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, but a {{woman is}} so different. That is just what I have, and of course I don't spend {{anything}} like all of it; <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> it is so different with you, who have been accustomed to spend ever so much more." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{reflected}} {{a little on}} it at first as unkind to him, having had so many considerable presents from him, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> was sick of him, and that on some accounts which, if I could suffer myself to publish them, would fully justify my conduct. But {{that part of the}} story will not bear telling, so I must leave it, and proceed.|$|R
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> the {{question}} does not impress me as one demanding my particular attention. I {{also like the}} woman who does not smoke. I have met in my time some very charming women who do not smoke. It {{may be a sign}} of degeneracy, but I am prepared to abdicate my position of woman's god, leaving her free to lead her own life.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Gamman knew no {{village where}} {{it took them}} less than ten days out of fifteen to satisfy {{the demands of the}} A.B.I.R. As a rule, the people had four days in a month to themselves. By law the maximum of forced labour was forty hours in a month. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> there is no {{relation}} at all between law and practice in the Congo.|$|R
