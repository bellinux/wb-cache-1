25|$|Identification of Japanese {{knotweed}} is {{not always}} easy. Many other plants are suspected of being knotweed, due often to the similar appearance of leaves and stems. Dogwood, lilac, Houttuynia (Houttuynia cordata), ornamental Bistorts such as Red <b>Bistort</b> (Persicaria amplexicaulis), lesser knotweed (Persicaria campanulata), Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), Broadleaved Dock (Rumex obtusifolius), Bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), bamboo, Himalayan Honeysuckle (Leycesteria formosa), and Russian Vine (Fallopia baldschuanica) have been suspected of being Fallopia japonica.|$|E

25|$|Illustrations are {{rife with}} models from Potter's real life. Potter's farm horse Diamond was {{the model for}} the carrier's horse and her husband's friend Dr. Parsons was the {{inspiration}} for Johnny Town-Mouse. The two men had a private golf course built at Sawrey and Johnny Town-Mouse is shown toting a bag of golf clubs in the book's cover picture. The town mice live in the house of a Mr. Bolton at Hawkshead, a village two miles distant from Sawrey. Bolton received vegetables every week from Sawrey and sent back laundry. A Mrs. Rogerson of Sawrey was {{the model for the}} housemaid and the illustration of the archway was drawn from life. Potter owned an early edition of Gerard's Herbal and Timmy Willie's herb pudding was probably Easter Ledger Pudding of <b>bistort,</b> dandelion, lady's mantle and other springtime herbs. The dish remained popular in the Lake District well into modern days. Potter's failing eyesight forced her to discontinue painting after Johnny Town-Mouse.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious <b>bistort,</b> water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cooling effect}} of Lake Superior makes the Slate Islands a {{particularly}} harsh habitat for its latitude. [...] As a result, islands harbour arctic and alpine plant {{species such as}} alpine chickweed (at its most southerly occurrence), Dryas drummondii (not found again for 1600km (1000mi) north), and alpine <b>bistort,</b> an Inuit delicacy eaten with seal oil.

There are far fewer rhododendrons here than in the damper Zemu valley at equal elevations, and more Siberian, or dry country types of vegetation, as Astragali of several kinds, Habenaria, Epipactis, dandelion, and a caraway, whose stems (called in Tibet [...] "Gzira") are much sought for as a condiment.* [Umbelliferae abound here; with sage, Ranunculus, Anemone, Aconites, Halenia, Gentians, Panax, Euphrasia, speedwell, Prunella vulgaris, thistles, <b>bistort,</b> Parnassia, purple orchis, Prenanthes, and Lactuca.
