5|$|St. Louis scored {{first on}} Austin's 65-yard run, and would reclaim the ball after James Laurinitis {{stripped}} Matt Forté, leading to Stacy's one-yard touchdown run. The Bears would then score on McCown's seven-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Bennett, but the Rams ended the quarter with a 21–7 lead after Clemens' six-yard touchdown pass to Jared Cook. In the second quarter, McCown threw an incomplete pass, which {{appeared to be a}} fumble, and after Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson picked up the ball, Bears fullback Tony Fiammetta pulled him to the ground by the facemask. Kyle Long would then be involved in an incident with Rams defensive lineman William Hayes, which led to Long kicking Hayes, causing Long's brother Chris Long to restrain Kyle, who would then <b>be</b> <b>penalized</b> for a personal foul. McCown and Fiammetta would also <b>be</b> <b>penalized,</b> for intentional grounding and facemasking, respectively. Halfway through the quarter, Chicago scored after McCown threw a three-yard pass to Marshall, but Greg Zuerlein would score on a 29-yard field goal to give the Rams a 24–14 lead at halftime. The lone score of the third quarter was Zuerlein's 40-yard kick. Early in the fourth quarter, Hester recorded a 62-yard punt return for a touchdown, which was overruled by Craig Steltz's holding penalty. the Bears reached the Rams' one-yard line, but required eight plays: Michael Bush's run went for no gain; McCown's pass to Jeffery was incomplete, but a holding penalty on Brandon McGee gave the Bears a first down; Bush lost two yards on the following run; McCown's touchdown pass to Bennett was nullified by Jermon Bushrod's holding penalty; McCown's 13-yard touchdown pass to Forté was also nullified, after Forté failed to break the plane, instead placing the Bears back on the one-yard line; McCown was then sacked by Michael Brockers, but Brockers was penalized for roughing the passer; Bush failed to gain a yard on the next play; the Bears finally scored on the drive on Bush's one-yard run. On the Rams' ensuing drive, Benny Cunningham gained 27 yards, while the offense gained 48 yards from Clemens' 19 and 29 yards passes to Chris Givens and Cook, respectively. Four plays later, Cunningham scored on a nine-yard run, while Isaiah Pead scored on the two-point conversion. Devin Hester would fumble on the following kickoff, but recovered at the Bears' ten-yard line. After the Bears' offense reached their own 39-yard line, Quinn stripped McCown, and scored on the following fumble return. The game marked the third time the Bears allowed 40 points during the season {{for the first time since}} 1964.|$|E

25|$|The {{offended}} team, if {{in control}} of the puck, will pull their goaltender for an extra man. This is safe since as soon as a player on the team to <b>be</b> <b>penalized</b> touches the puck, the whistle is called, so they cannot score on the empty net. This effectively increases the one-man disadvantage beyond the standard penalty time. It is possible, however, for a team to accidentally score on their own empty net.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{errors are}} {{attributed}} to mistakes made by individuals who may <b>be</b> <b>penalized</b> for these mistakes. The usual approach to correct the errors is to create new rules with additional checking steps in the system, aiming to prevent further errors. As an example, an error of free flow IV administration of heparin is approached by teaching staff {{how to use the}} IV systems and to use special care in setting the IV pump. While overall errors become less likely, the checks add to workload and may in themselves be a cause of additional errors.|$|E
25|$|From a legal standpoint, the Moroccan {{penal code}} {{still does not}} reflect the {{principles}} of gender equality established within the provisions of the Mudawana. For example, a woman still needs her husband’s permission to obtain a passport and can <b>be</b> <b>penalized</b> for having a child out of wedlock, and there is no legislation addressing or criminalizing violence against women. Judges also retain the right to oversee mandatory reconciliation in the case of divorce, which many women's organizations fear will be used to limit women's autonomy during divorce proceedings.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} a fair hearing {{requires}} that individuals should not <b>be</b> <b>penalized</b> by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, {{and the opportunity to}} present their own case. The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the {{right to a}} fair hearing is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it.|$|E

25|$|The goaltender {{has special}} {{privileges}} and training that other players do not. He or she wears special goaltending equipment {{that is different}} from that worn by other players and is subject to specific regulations. Goalies may use any part of their bodies to block shots. The goalie may legally hold (or freeze) the puck with his hands to cause a stoppage of play. If a player from the other team hits the goaltender without making an attempt to get out of his way, the offending player may <b>be</b> <b>penalized.</b> In some leagues (including the NHL), if a goalie's stick breaks, he can continue playing with a broken stick until the play is stopped, unlike other players who must drop any broken sticks immediately.|$|E
25|$|With a few limited exceptions, the High Court has the {{jurisdiction}} {{to hear and}} try any action in personam (that is, directed towards a particular person) where the defendant is served with a writ of summons or other originating process in or outside Singapore, or where the defendant submits to the Court's jurisdiction. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction – it can hear any type of case no matter how trivial or serious. In practice, though, parties may <b>be</b> <b>penalized</b> by having to pay higher costs (legal fees) {{if they choose to}} bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. Generally, except in probate matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are commenced in the High Court only if the value of the deceased's estate exceeds $3 million, or if the case involves the resealing of a foreign grant of probate or letters of administration.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{exercises}} both original jurisdiction and {{appellate jurisdiction}} in {{civil and criminal}} matters. By possessing original jurisdiction, the Court is able to hear cases at first instance; in other words, it can deal with trials of matters coming before the courts for the first time. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction – it can hear any type of civil or criminal case, no matter how trivial or serious. However, in practice, parties may <b>be</b> <b>penalized</b> by having to pay higher costs (legal fees) {{if they choose to}} bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. For example, a Magistrate's Court may hear civil cases where the amount claimed does not exceed S$60,000. If a plaintiff commences an action in the High Court to recover a sum of money based on contract, tort or any written law, and the suit could have been filed in a Magistrate's Court, if the plaintiff eventually succeeds in recovering a sum that does not exceed $60,000, she is not entitled to receive any more costs – legal expenses payable to her by the defendant – than a Magistrate's Court would have ordered. Generally, except in probate matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are commenced in the High Court only if the value of the deceased's estate exceeds $3 million, or if the case involves the resealing of a foreign grant of probate or letters of administration.|$|E
