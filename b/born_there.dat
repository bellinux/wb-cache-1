5|$|In 1720, Squire Boone, {{who worked}} {{primarily}} as a weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700–77). Sarah's family were Quakers from Wales, and had settled in 1708 in the area which became Towamencin Township of Montgomery County. In 1731, the Boones moved to the Oley Valley, near the modern city of Reading. There they built a log cabin, partially preserved today as the Daniel Boone Homestead.

At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and dumb, and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.|$|E

He served in this capacity until 1860, when the Guard was incorporated into the Kentucky State Guard's Second Regiment. He was appointed inspector general of Kentucky in 1860.|$|E

Louis Riel was <b>born</b> <b>there</b> in 1844, near modern Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Louis Riel, Sr. and Julie Lagimodière.|$|E
5|$|The {{delegated}} form {{of governance}} {{in the existing}} or acquired provinces is recommended by the text, with the qualification that the province should be ruled by someone <b>born</b> <b>there.</b> However, all ministers in immediate vicinity of the king must be born in the long established state. The king, states the text, must watch out and act against bureaucrats and officials who torment his subjects. The text cautions that the king should prevent abuse of his subjects from officials, robbers, enemies, king's favorites and his own greed.|$|E

The Wodehouses, who traced their ancestry back to the 13th century, belonged to a collateral branch {{of the family of}} the earls of Kimberley. Eleanor Wodehouse was also of ancient aristocratic ancestry. She was visiting her sister in Guildford when Wodehouse was <b>born</b> <b>there</b> prematurely.|$|E
60|$|Do {{you know}} those little books called When were you <b>Born?</b> <b>There's</b> one for each month. They tell you your character, your talents, your strong points, and your weak points at fourpence halfpenny a go. Bobbie's idea was to buy the whole twelve, and go through them till we found out which month hit off Mary's character. That would give us the month, and narrow it down a whole lot.|$|R

Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford was <b>born</b> <b>there</b> in 1661. Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset lived here around 1685. The woodcarver Grinling Gibbons had premises on Bow Street between 1678 and 1721, while the physician John Radcliffe stayed on the street in the 1680s.

He served there as a flight instructor, and was joined by his wife and son. His second child was <b>born</b> <b>there</b> in 1953. During a training exercise with a cadet, a trainee pilot caused a flap to break off the plane, sending it spinning out of control. Grissom climbed from the rear seat of the small craft {{to take over the}} controls and safely land the jet.|$|E
5|$|Monson {{became the}} 16th {{president}} of the LDS Church on February 3, 2008, succeeding Hinckley, who had died seven days earlier. Monson selected Henry B. Eyring and Dieter F. Uchtdorf as his first and second counselors, respectively. When Monson was <b>born,</b> <b>there</b> were fewer than 650,000 church members in the world, most of them living in the western United States.

His grandmother had been married there and his mother was <b>born</b> <b>there.</b> In 1971, the family moved to a larger, modern house on the new estates at Knotty Ash, and Seldon Street was later demolished.|$|E
5|$|Several legends about Jovan Vladimir {{have been}} {{recorded}} in western Macedonia. One has it that, after he was beheaded, he brought {{his head to the}} Monastery of StJohn of Bigor. On a hill above the village of Pesočani in the Municipality of Debarca, there is a locality called Vladimirovo, at which some ruins can be seen. The locals claimed that Vladimir was <b>born</b> <b>there,</b> and brought his severed head there. The Church of StAthanasius near Pesočani, now in ruins, is reputed to have been built by Vladimir. People from the region gathered there each year {{on the eve of his}} feast day. They lit candles on the remains of the church's walls, and prayed to the saint. Tradition has it that the Monastery of StNaum had a bell tower named after the saint, in the foundation of which a portion of his relics was placed.|$|E
5|$|The Togolese {{team for}} the 2004 Athens Games {{featured}} canoeist Boukpeti competing in the men's K-1. This was his debut at an Olympic Games, although he would later return for both the 2008 and 2012 Games. Boukpeti had competed for France as a junior, but switched allegiance in adulthood to Togo since his father was <b>born</b> <b>there.</b> Boukpeti had only ever visited the country once, as a child. Boukpeti had changed his national allegiance {{in order to make}} Olympic qualification easier. He was the only competitor for an African national at the 2004 Games in the events held at the Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium.|$|E

5|$|The Yorkist Edward IV gave Farleigh Hungerford Castle to {{his brother}} Richard, then Duke of Gloucester, in 1462. Edward and Richard's brother George Plantagenet may have taken up {{residence}} at the castle; his daughter Margaret was certainly <b>born</b> <b>there.</b> Richard became king in 1483 and gave the castle to John Howard, the Duke of Norfolk. Meanwhile, the late Robert's youngest son, Sir Walter, had become a close supporter of Edward IV; nonetheless, he joined the failed revolt of 1483 against Richard and ended up detained in the Tower of London. When Henry Tudor invaded England in 1485, Walter escaped custody and joined the invading Lancastrian army, fighting alongside Henry at the Battle of Bosworth. Victorious, the newly crowned Henry VII returned Farleigh Hungerford to Walter in 1486.|$|E
5|$|Among those {{held and}} {{executed}} at the Tower was Anne Boleyn. Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17thcenturies their main duty had become {{to look after}} the prisoners. The Tower was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the Fleet, where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was <b>born</b> <b>there</b> in 1605. Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself, and 112people were executed on the hill over 400years. Before the 20thcentury, there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green; {{as was the case with}} Lady Jane Grey, this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous. After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554, Queen MaryI imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen ElizabethI, in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name.|$|E
5|$|D. s. sumatrensis, {{known as}} the Western Sumatran rhinoceros, which has only 75 to 85 rhinos remaining, mostly in the {{national}} parks of Bukit Barisan Selatan and Kerinci Seblat, Gunung Leuser in Sumatra, but also in Way Kambas National Park in small numbers. They have recently gone extinct in Peninsular Malaysia. The main threats against this subspecies are habitat loss and poaching. A slight genetic difference is noted between the Western Sumatran and Bornean rhinos. The rhinos in Peninsular Malaysia were once known as D. s. niger, but were later recognized to be a synonym of D. s. sumatrensis. Three males and four females currently live in captivity at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary at Way Kambas, the youngest male having been bred and <b>born</b> <b>there</b> in 2012. Another calf, a female, was born at the sanctuary in May 2016. The sanctuary's two males were born at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album is}} partly {{inspired}} {{by the death of}} Hay's father in 2010. On the album's release, Hay noted, [...] "The loss of my father last year brought an unavoidable emotional contingent to writing and recording. I don’t have a definitive belief in an afterlife, but I do feel like I had his help when I was working on this album, especially alone late at night, in the studio. ... The night my father died, I was in Glasgow on the River Clyde, about twenty streets away from where he was <b>born.</b> <b>There’s</b> some kind of bleak poetry in that, very bleak." ...|$|R
