50|$|In the United States, {{there are}} {{currently}} three methods of procuring <b>black</b> <b>start.</b> The most common is cost-of-service, {{as it is the}} simplest and is the traditional method. It is currently used by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the PJM Interconnection and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). Although the exact mechanisms differ somewhat the same approach is used, namely that units are identified for <b>black</b> <b>start</b> and their documented costs are then funded and rolled into a tariff for cost recovery. The second method is a new method used by the Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE). The new methodology is a flat rate payment which increases <b>black</b> <b>start</b> remuneration to encourage provision. The monthly compensation paid to a generator is determined by multiplying a flat rate (in $/KWyr and referred to as the $Y value) by the unit's Monthly Claimed Capability for that month. The purpose of this change was to simplify procurement and encourage provision of the <b>black</b> <b>start</b> service. The final method of procurement is competitive procurement as used by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Under this approach ERCOT runs a market for <b>black</b> <b>start</b> services. Interested participants submit an hourly standby cost in $/hr (e.g. $70 per hour), often termed an availability bid, that is unrelated to the capacity of the unit. Using various criteria ERCOT evaluates these bids and the selected units are paid as bid, presuming an 85% availability. Each <b>black</b> <b>start</b> unit must be able to demonstrate that it can startup another unit in close proximity to begin the islanding and synchronization of the grid.|$|E

50|$|Battery {{rooms are}} also found in {{electric}} power plants and substations where reliable power is required for operation of switchgear, critical standby systems, and possibly <b>black</b> <b>start</b> of the station. Often batteries for large switchgear line-ups are 125 V or 250 V nominal systems, and feature redundant battery chargers with independent power sources. Separate battery rooms may be provided to protect against loss of the station due to a fire in a battery bank. For stations {{that are capable of}} <b>black</b> <b>start,</b> power from the battery system may be required for many purposes including switchgear operations.|$|E
50|$|In the North American {{independent}} system operators, {{the procurement}} of <b>black</b> <b>start</b> varies somewhat. Traditionally, <b>black</b> <b>start</b> {{was provided by}} integrated utilities and the costs were rolled into a broad tariff for cost recovery from ratepayers. In those areas which {{are not part of}} organized electricity markets, this is still the usual procurement mechanism. In the deregulated environment, this legacy of cost-based provision has persisted, and even recent overhauls of black-start procurement practices, such as that by the ISO New England, have not necessarily shifted to competitive procurement, although deregulated jurisdictions have a bias for market solutions rather than cost-of-service (COS) solutions.|$|E

50|$|To {{provide a}} <b>black</b> <b>start,</b> some power {{stations}} have small diesel generators, normally called the <b>black</b> <b>start</b> diesel generator (BSDG), {{which can be}} used to start larger generators (of several megawatts capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for boiler feedwater pumps, boiler forced-draft combustion air blowers, and for fuel preparation. It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so black-start power must be provided over designated tie lines from another station. Often hydroelectric power plants are designated as the black-start sources to restore network interconnections. A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the intake gates and provide excitation current to the generator field coils), and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations. Certain types of combustion turbine can be configured for <b>black</b> <b>start,</b> providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants.|$|E
