2500|$|If {{the umpire}} is unsure of a [...] "line decision," [...] that is, a run out or stumped decision, {{or if the}} umpire is unsure that the ball is a four, six, or neither, he may refer the matter to the Third Umpire. The umpires may {{additionally}} refer decisions to the Third Umpire regarding Bump Balls and catches being taken cleanly (but only after the on-field umpires have consulted and both were unsighted). The Third Umpire is not used except in international or important domestic matches. The signal to refer a matter is using both hands to mime a TV screen by making a <b>box</b> <b>shape.</b> See [...]|$|E
2500|$|Cody's {{previous}} {{designs were}} pusher canard biplanes, {{but the new}} aircraft was a tractor high-winged monoplane powered by a single 120hp (89kW) Austro-Daimler engine which had been fitted to an Etrich Taube which had crashed during the 1911 Circuit of Britain, which Cody had purchased after the race. It had a deep fuselage that accommodated the crew of two side-by-side. The tail arrangement was unusual, with two elevators [...] and two rudders carried on four bamboo booms that led back from the fuselage, the all moving tail surfaces forming a <b>box</b> <b>shape.</b> Fabric was stretched between the tail booms giving a cruciform shape as seen in cross-section. Lateral control was by means of wing warping, and the aircraft was fitted with a nosewheel undercarriage.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{advent of}} {{high-performance}} terrestrial laser scanners {{has made it}} possible to capture dense point-clouds of engineering facilities. 3 D shape acquisition from engineering facilities is useful for supporting maintenance and repair tasks. In this paper, we discuss methods to reconstruct <b>box</b> <b>shapes</b> and polygonal prisms from large-scale point-clouds. Since many faces may be partly occluded by other objects in engineering plants, we estimate possible <b>box</b> <b>shapes</b> and polygonal prisms and verify their compatibility with measured point-clouds. We evaluate our method using actual point-clouds of engineering plants...|$|R

50|$|This was {{an early}} network method {{that has been used}} for some {{language}} analysis. It was originally developed for genetic sequences with more than one possible origin.

It generates a list of characters incompatible with a tree.|$|E
