40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{the use of}} the web as an {{environment}} for electronic commerce. In particular, we develop a novel mechanism that creates incentives for honesty in electronic marketplaces where human users are represented by buying and selling agents. In our mechanism, <b>buyers</b> model other <b>buyers</b> and select the most trustworthy ones as their neighbors from which they can ask advice about sellers. In addition, however, sellers model the reputation of <b>buyers.</b> Reputable <b>buyers</b> provide fair ratings of sellers, and are likely to be neighbors of many other <b>buyers.</b> Sellers will provide more attractive products to reputable <b>buyers,</b> in order to build their reputation. We discuss how a marketplace operating with our mechanism leads to better profit both for honest <b>buyers</b> and sellers. With honesty encouraged, our work promotes the acceptance of web-based agent-oriented e-commerce by human users...|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptive}} selling literature identifies effective salespeople {{as those}} who match their influence tactics to suit the characteristics of <b>buyers.</b> However, prior research is largely silent on the specific influence tactics that salespeople use {{and the effectiveness of}} these tactics across different types of <b>buyers.</b> The authors propose a theoretical model that uses Kelman’s (1961) underlying influence processes of internalization, compliance, and identification to identify the seller influence tactics that salespeople use and to assess which of these tactics will resonate with three types of buyers: task-oriented <b>buyers,</b> interaction-oriented <b>buyers,</b> and self-oriented <b>buyers.</b> The authors test their model with data from 193 bidirectionally matched buyer–seller dyads. The results strongly support the theoretical model and suggest that <b>buyers</b> are more complex than originally presumed. However, salespeople seem to recognize this complexity and use the combination of influence tactics prescribed by theory for persuading these types of <b>buyers.</b> Two widely accepted concepts in the sales literature are that (1) influence tactics are the mechanism through which salespeople persuade <b>buyers</b> in interactions (e. g., Brown 1990; Spiro and Perreault 1979) and (2) adapting sales tactics to different <b>buyers</b> is important for superior performance (e. g., Spiro and Weitz 1990; Suja...|$|R
