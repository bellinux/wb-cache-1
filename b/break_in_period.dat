The goal is to get the brake pads and brake discs hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the brake pressure and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or skidding the tires. There will likely be smells and a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the brake discs and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E

40|$|End-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) {{associated}} with pre-existing advanced liver disease (ALD) {{has increased the}} risk of morbidity and mortality. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the outcome following the use of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in ESRD patients with ALD. A retrospective case-controlled study was performed on 16 patients with ALD and ESRD (ESRD-ALD) and 27 control patients with ESRD but without liver disease (ESRD); both groups were started on CAPD during the same period. No major complications were observed in either group in the immediate post-surgical period and, after an average <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>period</b> of 11. 3 days, the cases and controls were started on regular CAPD. The average duration of follow-up was 8 ± 2. 3 months in the ESRD-ALD group compared with 20 ± 1. 3 months in the ESRD group. The overall peritonitis rates were 1. 26 /treatment year in the ESRD-ALD group and 0. 63 in the ESRD group. The 6 - and 12 -month survivals among ESRD-ALD patients were 63. 75 % and 38. 75 %, respectively. Patients with ESRD-ALD had significantly lower baseline serum protein and albumin levels at the time of initiation of CAPD. On follow-up, the hemoglobin levels improved in both the groups along with an improvement in the serum protein and albumin levels. Fourteen of the 16 ESRD-ALD patients died at the end of the 3 -year follow-up period; deaths were due to terminal liver failure in nine patients and peritonitis in five patients. Patients who died in the ESRD-ALD group had lower serum albumin, lower body mass index (BMI) (median BMI 18. 2 vs. 25. 6) and higher grades of liver disease [child Pugh grade B (8), grade C (6) vs. grade B (2) ] at initiation of CAPD. Our study suggests that CAPD is a safe modality in patients with ESRD-ALD and that it does not carry any major risk for bleeding tendencies, technique failure or worsening of nutritional status. Low serum albumin, lower BMI and higher grade of liver disease at initiation are associated with higher mortality in these patients...|$|E

Our empirical findings provide significant evidence that relative per capita CO 2 emissions for 21 OECD countries stochastically converge when we control for <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> the <b>period</b> 1960 – 2000. Structural <b>breaks</b> are identified <b>in</b> each country, and overall we find that most breakpoints occur around the two energy crises and in the 1990 s. The robust test clearly also indicates that most original per capita CO 2 emissions and average series are stationary. ...|$|R
