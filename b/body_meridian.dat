50|$|Expressed in {{simplified}} terms, Yuasa's {{scheme of}} the body consists in four systems: sensory-motor awareness (somesthesis, much like the sensory-motor apparatus of Bergson or the sensory-motor circuit of Merleau-Ponty), kinaesthetic awareness (kinesthesis), emotion-instinct (governing the autonomic nervous system) and an unconscious 'quasi-body' (exemplidied in the ki-energy flow through the <b>body's</b> <b>meridians).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{therapy is}} usually {{started with a}} {{traditional}} Chinese massage {{to open up the}} <b>body's</b> <b>meridians,</b> followed by a series of Bian stone treatments with pre-heated bian stone. This therapy can be coupled with other traditional Chinese medicine therapy, such as acupuncture, or cupping to achieve the optimal effect on cervical vertebra disease.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, some Zen temples {{include a}} taiso (exercise) period somewhere within their daily (or if not, retreat) schedule. Taiso practice routines differ from popular modern yoga classes. Rather than focussing on “sun salutations”, “warrior poses” and muscular flexibility, {{the quality of}} mindfulness and honing in on releasing energy in the <b>body’s</b> <b>meridian</b> lines is deliberately emphasised.|$|R
50|$|In TCM, {{symptoms}} of various illnesses {{are believed to}} be the product of disrupted, blocked, or unbalanced qi movement through the <b>body's</b> <b>meridians,</b> as well as deficiencies or imbalances of qi in the Zang Fu organs. Traditional Chinese medicine often seeks to relieve these imbalances by adjusting the circulation of qi using a variety of techniques including herbology, food therapy, physical training regimens (qigong, t'ai chi ch'uan, and other martial arts training), moxibustion, tui na, and acupuncture.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the making of}} homeostatic models of the bioenergetic informational acupunctural human’s system of the “Pentacube” and the “Hexagon” {{according}} to the Wu Xing rules and energy shifts dynamics is considering. The making of the meridional homeostatic model of the bioenergetic informational acupunctural human’s system based on the existing knowledges about the human <b>body</b> <b>meridians</b> is considering. Preference to choice of the homeostatic functional models {{of the human body}} organs energies interaction is substantiated. The meridional control submodel of homeostatic system is defined and constructed. The description of control submodel, perspectives of application and development are represented...|$|R
50|$|For many years, transit timings {{were the}} most {{accurate}} method of measuring the positions of heavenly <b>bodies,</b> and <b>meridian</b> instruments were relied upon to perform this painstaking work. Before spectroscopy, photography, and the perfection of reflecting telescopes, the measuring of positions (and the deriving of orbits and astronomical constants) was the major work of observatories.|$|R
50|$|Tibetan {{medicine}} borrows many concepts from Yoga {{through the}} influence of Tantric Buddhism. One of the Six Yogas of Naropa is a cleansing of the central channel called phowa, preparing the soul to leave the body through the sagittal suture. The Vajrayana practice of Trul Khor is another practice used to direct and control the flow of energy within the <b>body's</b> energetic <b>meridians</b> through breath control and physical postures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Earth {{and life}} {{sciences}} {{are at the}} forefront to successfully include computational simulations and modeling. Medical applications are often mentioned as the killer applications for the Grid. The complex methodology and models of Traditional Chinese Medicine offer different approaches to diagnose and treat a persons health condition than typical Western medicine. A possibility to make this often hidden knowledge ex-plicit and available to a broader audience will result in mutual synergies for Western and Chinese medicine as well as improved patient care. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a method to accurately estimate blood glucose values using a novel non-invasive method based on electro-transformation measures in human <b>body</b> <b>meridians.</b> The frame-work used for this scientific computing collaboration, namely the China-Austria Data Grid (CADGrid) framework, provides an Intelligence Base offering commonly used models and algorithms as Web/Grid-Services. The controlled execution of the Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Measure-ment Service and the management of scientific data that arise from model execution {{can be seen as}} the first application on top of the CADGrid...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Sounding the <b>Body’s</b> <b>Meridian</b> {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which notions of belonging are constructed through the display of bodies in performance, specifically the registers of private and public body that have been revealed in the theatre‟s attempts to locate a post-liberation notion of South African-ness in historical narrative. The author investigates various ideas of the imagined community constructed in postliberation performances of South African history as a form of embodied historical-social intervention. This investigation is undertaken with specific reference to claims that are made of South African identity in terms of its public culture, especially the inscription of nationalist ideology as a performative act that operates both upon and through the „citizen‟ bodies that it mediates. The study pursues a notion of the body so mediated, and (perceived) essential “characteristics” that describe its claims to authority and “authenticity”: the “meridian” or line of essential energy that activates its power to signify on behalf of other bodies like it in the debate and transaction of social values...|$|R
50|$|Acupuncture is {{an ancient}} form of {{medicine}} using small filiform needles placed at predetermined points on the body. The goal of acupuncture is to move Qi—the force that makes us alive. Western medicine has no equivocal term to describe Qi. Qi flows throughout the <b>body</b> along <b>meridians,</b> or paths that interconnect the external {{surface of the body}} with the internal organs. When needles are placed in points, Qi moves freely. As Qi moves freely, the body maintains its balance, or homeostasis.|$|R
40|$|Qi, the Chinese {{character}} for air, is a Chinese/Oriental term for an abstract form {{of energy that}} is considered vital to {{the mind and the}} body. Traditionally, Qi circulated through channels of the <b>body</b> known as <b>Meridians,</b> is referred to as Internal Qi. Proper flow of internal Qi is deemed to be important for good health, while blockage o...|$|R
50|$|Planetary {{co-ordinate}} {{systems are}} defined {{relative to their}} mean axis of rotation and various definitions of longitude depending on the body. The longitude systems of most of those bodies with observable rigid surfaces have been defined by references to a surface feature such as a crater. The north pole is that pole of rotation that lies {{on the north side}} of the invariable plane of the solar system (near the ecliptic). The location of the Prime Meridian as well as the position of body's north pole on the celestial sphere may vary with time due to precession of the axis of rotation of the planet (or satellite). If the position angle of the <b>body's</b> Prime <b>Meridian</b> increases with time, the body has a direct (or prograde) rotation; otherwise the rotation is said to be retrograde.|$|R
50|$|Based on the {{rotation}} of the Earth, time can be measured by observing celestial <b>bodies</b> crossing the <b>meridian</b> every day. Astronomers found that it was more accurate to establish time by observing stars as they crossed a meridian rather than by observing the position of the Sun in the sky. Nowadays, UT in relation to International Atomic Time (TAI) is determined by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of distant quasars, a method which can determine UT1 to within 4 milliseconds.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of kriyas and meditations in Kundalini Yoga {{are designed to}} raise complete body awareness to prepare the body, nervous system, and mind to handle the energy of Kundalini rising. The majority of the physical postures focus on navel activity, activity of the spine, and selective pressurization of <b>body</b> points and <b>meridians.</b> Breath work {{and the application of}} bandhas (3 yogic locks) aid to release, direct and control the flow of Kundalini energy from the lower centers to the higher energetic centers.|$|R
40|$|In the {{research}} are included 30 patients, 12 male and 18 female, on age from 29 to 79, who {{were treated with}} acupuncture treatment in our clinic {{in a period of}} one year. All patients had acupuncture treatment in a clinic for TCM and acupuncture in Skopje, Macedonia, by a doctor specialist in acupuncture. Acupuncture points that were treated are: Baihui-DU 20, Sishencong-EXHN 1, Yangbai-GB 14, Yintang-EX-HN 3, Taiyang-EX-HN 5, Hegu-LI 4, Zhongwan-RN 12, Zusanli-ST 36, Sanyinjiao-SP 6, Taichong-LR 3, Fengchi-GB 20, Dazhui-DU 14, Pishu-BL 20, Weishu-BL 21, GanshuBL 18. After the acupuncture treatment the effect was achieved in all patients with certain number of treatments and all the symptoms that they complained about before were gone afterwards. There were more female than male patients, with average age of 49. In most of the patients effect was achieved with 5 to 10 treatments. Acupuncture treatment as part of the 5000 year old Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can successfully relieve the migraine symptoms, decrease the pain, reduce inflammation and improve the blood and Qi circulation through the <b>body</b> and <b>meridians</b> Acupuncture as a treatment for migraine gives positive results and can successfully improve the health and wellbeing of the patients...|$|R
50|$|For these gods, the Tagbanwa celebrated a big feast each year, {{right after}} harvest, {{when there is}} much singing, dancing, courting, and {{conclusion}} of blood compacts. The babaylan (shaman) called for the people to converge at the seashore, carrying food offering of all kinds. The babaylan took the chickens and roosters brought for the ceremony, and hung them by their legs on tree branches, killing them by beating with a stick. They were allowed only one blow for each animal, and those who survive went free, never to be harmed again, because Polo, the sea god, took them under his protection. The fowl that died were seasoned, cooked and eaten. After eating, they danced and drank rice wine. At midnight, as Buntala, a heavenly <b>body,</b> passed the <b>meridian,</b> the babaylan entered the sea waist dipped, all the while dancing and pushing a raft made of bamboo, which had offering on it. If the offering was returned to the shore by waves and winds, it meant the sea god refused the people's offering. But if the raft disappeared, there was rejoicing. Their offering was accepted and their year would be a happy one.|$|R
