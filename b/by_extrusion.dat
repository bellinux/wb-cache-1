40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to improve {{dissolution}} behavior of poorly water-soluble drugs by application of cyclodextrin in extrusion processes, which were melt extrusion process and wet extrusion process. Indomethacin (IM) was employed as a model drug. Extrudates containing IM and 2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CyD) in 1 : 1 w/w ratio were manufactured <b>by</b> both melt <b>extrusion</b> process and wet extrusion process. In vitro drug release properties of IM from extrudates and physiochemical properties of extrudates were investigated. The dissolution rates of IM from extrudates manufactured <b>by</b> melt <b>extrusion</b> and wet extrusion with HP-β-CyD were significantly higher than that of the physical mixture of IM and HP-β-CyD. In extrudate manufactured <b>by</b> melt <b>extrusion,</b> γ-form of IM changed to amorphous completely during melt extrusion due to heating above melting point of IM. On the other hand, in extrudate manufactured <b>by</b> wet <b>extrusion,</b> γ-form of IM changed to amorphous partially due to interaction between IM and HP-β-CyD and mechanical agitating force during process. Application of HP-β-CyD in extrusion process is useful for the enhancement of dissolution rate for poorly water-soluble drugs...|$|R

25|$|Phages may be {{released}} via cell lysis, <b>by</b> <b>extrusion,</b> or, {{in a few}} cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called endolysin, which attacks and breaks down the cell wall peptidoglycan. An altogether different phage type, the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain Mycoplasma phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a lysogenic cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as prophage.|$|E
25|$|For use in {{pharmaceutical}} products, extrusion through nano-porous, polymeric filters {{is being}} used to produce suspensions of lipid vesicles liposomes or transfersomes with a particular size of a narrow size distribution. The anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin in liposome delivery system is formulated <b>by</b> <b>extrusion,</b> for example. Hot melt extrusion is also utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and ‘extrude’ them through a die. Twin-screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles. The resulting particle can be blended with compression aids and compressed into tablets or filled into unit dose capsules.|$|E

[...] The main role of extrusion was originally developed for conveying and shaping fluid forms of processed raw materials.
