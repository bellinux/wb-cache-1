Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct throttle control linkage to fuel metering unit and mechanical governor allowing for a MANUAL mode, two fuel tank boost pumps in addition to engine driven fuel pump, two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated fuel <b>bladder</b> <b>tank</b> setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bladder</b> <b>tank</b> is a large, {{flexible}} container used to store {{many types of}} liquids. When maximum capacity is reached, the <b>bladder</b> <b>tank</b> {{takes the form of}} a large pillow, hence it is also called a pillow tank.|$|E

5000|$|Installation of a <b>bladder</b> <b>tank</b> is {{fast and}} simple, but {{requires}} a large, flat, open surface free of rocks or other materials that might damage the walls. A fine layer of sand or a special ground cloth {{is often used}} to minimize surface irregularities. Ground cloths are generally made from a geotextile fabric designed to minimize the chance of abrasion and tank failure.|$|E
50|$|Bladder {{tanks are}} lightweight, flexible, mobile and {{can last for}} many years. The {{materials}} used to make bladder walls are recyclable and can be re-used for other purposes. Bladder tanks have capacities up to 1,000 cubic meters. Liquid stored in a flexible <b>bladder</b> <b>tank</b> does not evaporate and any odor it may produce is completely sealed within the tank. Contaminants cannot enter a properly sealed tank. Bladder tanks have many practical applications {{and can be found}} in agriculture, industry, civil protection, military and humanitarian organisations.|$|E

40|$|A Vapor Compression Distillation (VCD) module was {{developed}} and evaluated {{as part of a}} Space Station Prototype (SSP) environmental control and life support system. The VCD module includes the waste tankage, pumps, post-treatment cells, automatic controls and fault detection instrumentation. Development problems were encountered with two components: the liquid pumps, and the waste tank and quantity gauge. Peristaltic pumps were selected instead of gear pumps, and a sub-program of materials and design optimization was undertaken leading to a projected life greater than 10, 000 hours of continuous operation. A <b>bladder</b> <b>tank</b> was designed and built to contain the waste liquids and deliver it to the processor. A detrimental pressure pattern imposed upon the bladder by a force-operated quantity gauge was corrected by rearranging the force application, and design goals were achieved. System testing has demonstrated that all performance goals have been fulfilled...|$|E
40|$|The Orbital Refueling System was an {{experiment}} flown on Shuttle Mission STS 41 -G in October, 1984. Liquid hydrazine fuel was transferred {{back and forth}} from one spherical <b>bladder</b> <b>tank</b> to another using pressurized nitrogen as the driving force. Compressive heating of the ullage gas in the receiving tank could lead to a hazardous situation if any hydrazine leaked through to the ullage side of the bladder and was heated above about 175 F, where it can undergo spontaneous exothermic decomposition. Early analysis of the flight data indicated that the ullage compression process was much closer to an isothermal than an adiabatic one. In this study, a thorough review of the pertinent literature was used to make an a priori best-estimate for the ullage gas heat transfer coefficient (defining the Nusselt Number as a function of Reynolds and Rayleigh Numbers). Experimental data from the flight were analyzed in detail. It is evident that there is considerably more heat transfer than can be accounted for by conduction alone, but the observed increases do not correlate well with Reynolds Number, Rayleigh Number or vehicle acceleration. There are large gaps in the present understanding of convective heat transfer in closed containers with internal heat generation, especially in the presence of vibrations or other random disturbances. A program of experiments to fill in these gaps is suggested, covering both ground and orbital environments...|$|E
40|$|Total and Doris have {{announced}} {{that they want to}} challenge the way of thinking of how to supply subsea field developments with chemicals. With a Subsea Chemicals Storage & Injection-station (SCS&I) the chemicals are injected much closer to their injection points compared to a conventional solution, where they are injected from a topside facility. This reduces the response time of hydrate inhibitors which leads to a shorter well shutdown/start-up operation. Also, dosing of production chemicals can be done more accurately, and valuable space topside is made available for other equipment. This thesis challenges some of the design solutions proposed by Total and Doris for the SCS&I-station. The main topics investigated in this thesis are; total storage volume and tank design, system architecture, distribution schematics and an economic assessment of the SCS&I-station. The research method used in this thesis is Concept Scoring. This research method enables screening of several concepts, and singles out the most suited concept for its designated application. Preferred architecture systems of the SCS&I-station and pressure-balanced tank design was found by applying this Concept Scoring. It was concluded that the best suited pressure-balanced tank design was the <b>bladder</b> <b>tank.</b> Interestingly, this deviates from the piston tank design proposed by Total and Doris. It was found that methanol occupies approximately 60 % of the total storage tank volume of the SCS&I-station. This means that the impact methanol has on the total storage capacity required is large. The economic assessment indicated that a solution with methanol stored and injected topside is more beneficial compared to a subsea storage solution...|$|E

Trans Florida marketed and sold these aircraft, trained the new owners to fly them, and maintained them for customers after purchase. Lindsay also accumulated an immense stockpile of P-51 spare parts and sold these to Mustang owners worldwide. Many of the spares and entire aircraft were purchased from scrap dealers intending to melt them down. Lindsay also developed and received FAA approval for several improvements to the P-51D including: avionics, autopilot, baggage door, fresh air system, rear passenger seat, additional wing <b>bladder</b> <b>tanks,</b> high pressure oxygen system, and wingtip tanks of 110 gal.|$|R

500|$|In 1944, the Sukhoi design bureau (OKB) began {{designing}} a twin-engined fighter powered by two Lyulka TR-1 turbojets, known internally as the Samolyet or Izdeliye (item or product) K. The ultimate design was very probably {{influenced by a}} captured Messerschmitt Me 262, but the Su-9 was not {{a copy of the}} German aircraft. The Su-9 had an oval cross-section, all-metal stressed skin monocoque fuselage that housed a single cockpit. The pilot was protected by armor plates to his front, an armored seat back and a bulletproof windscreen for the bubble canopy. He was provided with an ejection seat, copied from that used in the Heinkel He 162 [...] The aircraft carried a total of [...] of fuel in two <b>bladder</b> <b>tanks,</b> one each ahead and behind the pilot. The low-mounted, straight wing had a single-spar and a slight dihedral of 4°20'. The outer flaps were split and could act as air brakes. The Su-9 was the first Soviet aircraft to use hydraulic powered controls. A Soviet copy of the Junkers Jumo 004B turbojet, known as the RD-10, was hung under each wing in a streamlined nacelle. The aircraft had a tricycle undercarriage that retracted into the fuselage. The Su-9 was designed with a very high wing loading which increased the aircraft's speed and reduced its dimensions. This consequently increased the take-off and landing speeds so it was equipped with a provision for two JATO bottles (11.27kN (530lbf) thrust for 8 seconds) mounted {{on the sides of the}} fuselage. These reduced the take-off distance by nearly 50 percent and a braking parachute was fitted to reduce the landing distance.|$|R

40|$|Diesel {{fuel oil}} (DFO) spills at fueling {{platforms}} increase railroad operating costs by decreasing the locomotive miles traveled per gallon of DFO dispensed {{and increasing the}} cost of recovering and treating spilled DFO. Pressure fluctuations in the fuel system can trigger inadvertent dispensing nozzle shut off before a locomotive fuel tank is full. Fuel tanks occasionally overflow after the automatic shut-off mechanism on a nozzle is disabled to prevent subsequent inadvertent nozzle shut off. A hydraulic pressure surge analysis of two fueling yards suggests a correlation between the magnitude of these pressure fluctuations {{and the amount of}} DFO lost from fuel tank overflows. For example, at a fueling yard with a history of high DFO spillage, system pressure fluctuations are predicted to be large enough to trigger inadvertent shut off and potential fuel tank overflow following closure of one nozzle. In contrast, at a fueling yard with a history of low DFO spillage, pressure fluctuations insufficient to cause inadvertent shut off and potential overflow are predicted following the simultaneous closure of up to four (4) nozzles.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{shows how}} water and ice can enable exceptionally simple ways to construct structures in deep space. Practicality is underscored by applying advanced tank methods being developed for Mars missions. Water or ice {{is now known}} to be present or abundant on most objects in the solar system, starting with the planet Mercury. Thermal processes alone {{can be used to}} melt ice. The cold of space can refreeze water back into ice. The anomalous low vapor pressure of water, about 7 mm Hg, permits <b>bladder</b> containers. <b>Tanks</b> or <b>bladders</b> made with modern polymer fiber and film can exhibit very small (< 0. 1 %) equivalent tankage and ullage fractions and thus hold thousands of tons of water per ton bladder. Injecting water into a bladder whose shape when inflated is the desired final shape, such as a space vehicle, provides a convenient way to construct large structures. In space, structures of 1 O,OOO-T mass become feasible because the bladder mass is low enough to be launched. The bladder can weigh 1 OOO times less than its contents, or 10 T. The bladder would be packed like a parachute. Shaped memory materials and/or gas inflation could reestablish the desired structure shape after unpacking. The water comes from space resources. An example examines construction of torus space vehicle with 100 -m nominal dimension. People would live inside the torus. A torus, like a tire on an automobile, would spin and provide synthetic gravity at its inner surface. A torus of order 100 m across would provide a gravity with gradients low enough to mitigate against vertigo...|$|R

40|$|Bladder {{cancer is}} the fifth most common cancer in the United States and, on a per capita basis, is the most {{expensive}} cancer from diagnosis to death. Unfortunately, National Cancer Institute funding for bladder cancer is quite low when compared with other common malignancies. Limited funding has stifled research opportunities for new and established investigators, ultimately encouraging them to redirect research efforts to other organ sites. Waning interest of scientists has further fueled the cycle of modest funding for bladder cancer. One important consequence of this has been a lack of scientific advancement in the field. Patient advocates have decidedly advanced research efforts in many cancer sites. Breast, prostate, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer advocates have organized highly successful campaigns to lobby {{the federal government and the}} medical community to devote increased attention and funding to understudied malignancies and to conduct relevant studies to better understand the therapy, diagnosis, and prevention of these diseases.
