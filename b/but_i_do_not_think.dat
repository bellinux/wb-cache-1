500|$|Bond was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} idea that the murderer possessed any kind of scientific or anatomical knowledge, or even [...] "the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer". In his opinion, the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to [...] "periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic mania", with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating [...] "satyriasis". Bond also stated that [...] "the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> either hypothesis is likely".|$|E
500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest {{into the}} death of the Princess, on 13 February 2008, {{speaking}} by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he [...] "could not remember specifically" [...] whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it [...] "would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, <b>but...</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> the fact that they did not manage to find a file rules out anything either". He said he believed MI6 had an informant at the Paris Ritz but he could not be certain that this person was necessarily Henri Paul.|$|E

500|$|On 15 July 2015, he {{was found}} guilty of being an {{accessory}} to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews. Reacting to the sentence, Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor said that she was [...] "disappointed" [...] adding: [...] "They are trying to teach a lesson that if you commit such a crime, you will be punished. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> the court has acted properly in sentencing him to four years in jail. It is too late for that kind of sentence... My preference would have been to sentence him to community service by speaking out against neo-Nazis. I would like the court to prove to me, a survivor, how four years in jail will benefit anybody." [...] Gröning's defence lawyer, Hans Holtermann, was quoted as saying that he would review the verdict before deciding whether to appeal. On 28 November 2016, the appeal was declined by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH). In August 2017 Oskar Gröning was considered to be fit for prison.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Agnew {{announced}} that he was establishing a charitable foundation [...] "Education for Democracy", but nothing more was heard of this after B'nai B'rith accused it of being a front for Agnew's anti-Israeli views. Agnew was now wealthy enough to move in 1977 to a new home in Rancho Mirage, California, and shortly afterwards to repay the Sinatra loan. That year, in a series of televised interviews with British TV host David Frost, Nixon claimed that he had had no direct role in the processes that had led to Agnew's resignation and implied that his vice president had been hounded by the liberal media: [...] "He made mistakes ... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> for one minute that Spiro Agnew consciously felt that he was violating the law". In 1980, Agnew published a memoir, Go Quietly ... or Else. In it, he protested his total innocence of the charges that had brought his resignation, and claimed that he had been coerced by the White House to [...] "go quietly" [...] or face an unspoken threat of possible assassination, a suggestion that Coffey describes as [...] "absurd". Agnew's assertions of innocence were undermined when his former lawyer George White testified that his client had admitted statehouse bribery to him, saying it had been going on [...] "for a thousand years." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do have things I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. I acknowledge that this is an agenda, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E

However, I must point out that the assistance voted by this House in the Shipbuilding Industry Act was meant to be used not to save uneconomic yards but to assist reorganisation with a view to promoting competitiveness in the industry.

2500|$|Nine {{days after}} the {{shipwreck}} Anna landed in Cardiff, Wales, and cabled Horatio, [...] "Saved alone. What shall I do [...] [...] [...]". After receiving Anna's telegram, Horatio immediately left Chicago to bring his wife home. On the Atlantic crossing, the captain of his ship called Horatio to his cabin {{to tell him that}} they were passing over the spot where his four daughters had perished. He wrote to Rachel, his wife's half-sister, [...] "On Thursday last we passed over the spot where she went down, in mid-ocean, the waters three miles deep. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of our dear ones there. They are safe, folded, the dear lambs". Horatio later wrote the famous hymn [...] "It Is Well with My Soul", commemorating his daughters. Philip Bliss, who composed the music for the hymn, called his tune Ville du Havre, after the name of the stricken vessel.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{accounts}} of the Spix in captivity was given by Rev. F.G. Dutton, president of the Avicultural Society U.K. in 1900: [...] "I have not yet seen a good-tempered Spix... My Spix, which is really more a Conure than a Macaw, will not look at sop of any sort, except sponge cake given from one's fingers, only drinks plain water, and lives mainly on sunflower seed. It has hemp, millet, and canary, and peanuts, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it eats much of any of them. It barks {{the branches of the}} tree in which it is loose, and may eat the bark. It would very likely be all the better if it would eat bread and milk, as it might then produce some flight feathers, which it never yet has had. But I expect it would not eat any sop, even if I gave it nothing else." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 24 August 2009, Lockerbie campaigner Dr Jim Swire {{wrote to}} Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, {{calling for a}} full inquiry, {{including}} the question of suppression of the Heathrow evidence. This was backed up by a delegation of Lockerbie relatives, led by Pamela Dix, who went to 10 Downing Street on 24 October 2009 and handed over a letter addressed to Gordon Brown calling {{for a meeting with}} the Prime Minister to discuss the need for a public inquiry and the main issues that it should address. An op-ed article by Pamela Dix, subtitled [...] "The families of those killed in the bombing have not given up hope of an inquiry to help us learn the lessons of this tragedy", was published in The Guardian on 26 October 2009. On 1 November 2009, it was reported that Gordon Brown had ruled out a public inquiry into Lockerbie, saying in response to Dr Swire's letter: [...] "I understand your desire to understand the events surrounding the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it would be appropriate for the UK government to open an inquiry of this sort." [...] UK ministers explained that it was for the Scottish government to decide if it wants to hold its own, more limited, inquiry into the worst terrorist attack on British soil. The Scottish government had already rejected an independent inquiry, saying it lacks the constitutional power to examine the international dimensions of the case.|$|E
