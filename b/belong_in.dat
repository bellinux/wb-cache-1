5|$|Exile was {{received}} well by critics; The Daily Telegraph {{called it the}} best game in the Myst series. Conversely, long-time critics of the series complained that Exile continued to prove that Mysts slower gameplay did not <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> the fast-paced modern game market; GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin described the Myst series as having lost its relevance. Despite selling {{more than one million}} copies within the first year of release, Exile fared poorer commercially than Myst and Riven, which had sold more than 10million copies combined. , the fourth game in the series, was developed and published solely by Ubisoft.|$|E
5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, but it is not agreed what elements <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> the group. Scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium. When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its trivial name is the rare-earth metals.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the revision by Lucas and Sobus, a 2003 paper by Chinese researchers suggested that Indricotherium and Dzungariotherium were valid genera, and that P. prohorovi did not <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> Paraceratherium. They also recognised the validity of species such as P. lipidus, P. tienshanensis, and P. sui. A 2004 paper by Chinese paleontologist Tao Deng and colleagues also recognised three distinct genera. Some western writers have similarly used names otherwise considered invalid since the 1989 revision, but without providing detailed analysis and justification.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{based on}} evidence from ITS and large subunit ribosomal RNA sequence data have not confirmed that Leucopholiota decorosa belongs in the Tricholomataceae family. However, the analysis does show it to be phylogenetically related to Phaeolepiota aurea, a species of unclear status in the Agaricales, and it confirms that L.decorosa does not <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> the family Agaricaceae. According to the species authors, L.decorosa would fit best in the Biannularieae tribe of the Tricholomataceae as described by Rolf Singer in his comprehensive monograph on the Agaricales. This tribe also contains the genera Catathelasma and Armillaria.|$|E
5|$|Roy E. Halling {{designated}} a lectotype specimen in 1983 from Frost's original collections. Early molecular evidence {{suggested that the}} lilac-brown bolete was genetically distinct from the genera in which it had formerly been placed. In 2012, Halling and colleagues published molecular evidence indicating that the species did not <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> either Tylopilus or Leccinum as it does not share a recent common ancestor with either of those genera. Recognizing its genetic and morphological distinctiveness, they created the genus Sutorius, with S.eximius as the type species. As of 2015, the only other species in Sutorius is S.australiensis, found in Australia.|$|E

30|$|Sense of {{belonging}} refers to “students’ {{sense of being}} accepted, valued, included, and encouraged by others (teachers and peers) in the academic classroom setting and of feeling oneself {{to be an important}} part of the life and activity of the class” (Goodenow 1993, p. 80). Previous work indicates that sense of <b>belonging</b> <b>in</b> STEM has a significant impact on educational success and persistence, especially for women and students of color.

After leaving the army, Vainio befriended composer and music journalist Sauvo Puhtila (known to the Finnish public by the pseudonym Saukki), who told him that Yleisradio {{was in need of}} lyricists. Eager to leave his job as a teacher, Vainio quit and started collaborating with musician Reino Markkula. Their song Sä kuulut päivään jokaiseen ("You <b>Belong</b> <b>in</b> Every Day"), composed by Markkula with lyrics by Vainio, was given to Eino Grön who made it into a hit.|$|E
5|$|Whether the bigeye and {{smalltooth}} sand tigers <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> {{the same}} family as the superficially similar sand tiger shark (C. taurus) has been debated among systematists, with morphological and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis {{was found to be}} closer to the crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), suggesting that it and Carcharias should be placed in separate families.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, the English {{scientist}} George Ernest Shelley {{used the}} spelling Necrospa in a book, thereby creating a junior synonym; however, he attributed {{the name to}} zoologist Philip Sclater. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that the Rodrigues starling should <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> the same genus as the hoopoe starling, Fregilupus, due to the similarity of the species. More subfossils found in 1974 added support to {{the claim that the}} Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling. The stouter bill is mainly what warrants generic separation from Fregilupus. In 2014, the British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume described a new extinct species, the Mauritius starling (Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus), based on subfossils from Mauritius. It was shown to be closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling, due to the features of its skull, sternum and humerus. Until then, the Rodrigues starling was the only Mascarene passerine bird named from fossil material.|$|E

5|$|Moroccan {{collections}} {{under the}} cork oak (Quercus suber) that were initially regarded as B.aereus {{were described as}} a separate species—Boletus mamorensis—in 1978, {{on the basis of}} a rufous chestnut cap and a rooting stipe, or stem, with a reticulation often limited to the top (apex). In 2010 however, molecular phylogenetic studies by Bryn Dentinger and colleagues placed these collections close to B.aereus, likely suggesting an ecological variant or subspecies rather than a distinct species. American mycologist Harry Thiers reported Boletus aereus from California in 1975; however, a taxonomic revision of western North American porcini boletes in 2008 formally established them as a separate species, Boletus regineus. These differ from B.aereus by nature of their more gelatinous cap skin (pileipellis), and <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> a different porcini lineage.|$|E
5|$|Player-run guilds come in {{the form}} of Free Companies, {{organized}} bands of adventurers under the auspices of one of the three Grand Companies of Eorzea. Free Company members may gain access to a shared company chest, a private chat channel, and Company Actions which are 24-hour buffs to certain aspects of gameplay, such as increased EXP or reduced gear damage. Free Company members may also pool their resources to purchase a house in one of the residential districts. In addition to decorating the house, players may use the grounds to grow unique items through the gardening system, train their chocobo companion, embark on airship expeditions, and purchase a private room for personal use. Linkshells are another form of in-game networking; whereas players may only <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> one Free Company, they may join up to eight linkshells which act as private chat channels for interested sub-groups.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Post Office {{has never}} publicised an {{official}} stamp numbering {{system for the}} postage stamps they issued, so collectors use a stamp numbering system {{from one of the}} most popular stamp catalogues, such as Stanley Gibbons, Scott, MacDonnell Whyte, MDW (last edition 1991), Hibernian or Michel. There are differences between these numbering systems that result in a varying sequence of stamps in each listing, with some stamps included on some lists but not on others—usually varieties that the publishers think do not <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> a general catalogue. For instance, Ireland's first postage stamp, the 2d Map of Ireland, issued in 1922 is numbered 68 by Scott, 43 by Michel, D4 by Hibernian and MacDonnell Whyte and 74 by Stanley Gibbons.|$|E

5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow was {{described}} by Edgardo Moltoni in 1938. This species has been placed in several bird families since its description. It has long been considered {{a member of the}} crow family Corvidae; however, several atypical features, such as its lice being from the suborder Mallophaga, its bare facial skin being capable of movement, and the structure of its palate, have suggested that it may <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> another family. Some authors placed the species within the starling family Sturnidae due to the bushcrow's similarities in behavior and size with the wattled starling. Other authors have placed it in its own monotypic family, Zavattariornithidae. DNA-sequencing analysis supports its placement in the corvids, with its closest relatives being the ground jays, magpies, and the piapiac. It has been suggested that the bushcrow is a surviving relict ancestor to several of these relatives. However, its taxonomic situation is still considered to be in flux.|$|E
5|$|The genus Carcharocles may be invalid, and {{the shark}} may {{actually}} <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> the genus Otodus, making it Otodus megalodon. A 1974 study on Paleogene sharks by Henri Cappetta erected the subgenus Megaselachus, classifying the shark as Otodus (Megaselachus) megalodon, along with O. (M.) chubutensis. A 2006 review of Chondrichthyes elevated Megaselachus to genus, and classified the sharks as Megaselachus megalodon and M. chubutensis. The discovery of fossils {{assigned to the}} genus Megalolamna in 2016 led to a re-evaluation of Otodus, which concluded that it is paraphyletic, that is, it consists of a last common ancestor {{but it does not}} include all of its descendants. The inclusion of the Carcharocles sharks in Otodus would make it monophyletic, with the sister clade being Megalolamna. There was one apparent description of the shark in 1881 classifying it as Selache manzonii.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} department comprises work created before 1850 {{that does}} not <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> the Etruscan, Greek, and Roman department. The Louvre has been a repository of sculpted material since its time as a palace; however, only ancient architecture was displayed until 1824, except for Michelangelo's Dying Slave and Rebellious Slave. Initially the collection included only 100pieces, {{the rest of the}} royal sculpture collection being at Versailles. It remained small until 1847, when Léon Laborde was given control of the department. Laborde developed the medieval section and purchased the first such statues and sculptures in the collection, King Childebert and stanga door, respectively. The collection was part of the Department of Antiquities but was given autonomy in 1871 under Louis Courajod, a director who organized a wider representation of French works. In 1986, all post-1850 works were relocated to the new Musée d'Orsay. The Grand Louvre project separated the department into two exhibition spaces; the French collection is displayed in the Richelieu wing, and foreign works in the Denon wing.|$|E
