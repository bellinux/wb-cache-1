40|$|March 15, 2015 An {{attempt was}} made to analyze the {{relationship}} between the change in the quantity of fishery resources and the change of phosphorus load deposited into Osaka Bay. The phosphorus load had steadily increased from 1955 to 1975, then decreased slowly towards the 2000 s. The major <b>benthic</b> <b>fishery</b> organisms, such as octopus, shrimp and crab, mantis shrimp, tongue-fish and right-eye flounder, were employed to examine the characteristics of change in fishery resources in relation to water environments of Osaka Bay. Excluding shrimp and crab, catch amounts showed a largely equivalent response to phosphorus load in the bay. The results presented here demonstrate that a close relationship exists between phosphorus emissions and <b>benthic</b> <b>fishery</b> resources in Osaka Bay...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to {{quantify}} the impacts of artisanal fisheries and define management practices that allow for the recovery and conservation of exploited stocks. The extent of illegal catch is particularly critical as a driver of overexploitation in artisanal fisheries. However, the lack of data at proper spatial scales limits the evaluation of illegal fishing and effectiveness of management practices. We used a catch curve analysis to estimate total instantaneous mortality as a proxy of fishing pressure in the artisanal <b>benthic</b> <b>fishery</b> in central Chile. We compared the patterns of total mortality in fishing grounds under the well-studied territorial use rights for fisheries system (TURF) immersed in a landscape of open access areas (OAA; no access restriction), and from these patterns determined the extent of illegal fishing in open access areas focusing on the two most frequently extracted resources: locos (Concholepas concholepas) and keyhole limpets (Fissurella spp.). The beauty of this seascape {{is the presence of}} the no-take (NT) area of Las Cruces as control (no fishing), allowing us to estimate natural mortality. Loco exploitation is banned in OAAs. However, loco mortality in OAAs was 92 % higher than in the NT, and 42 % higher than in TURFs. Keyhole limpet mortality was similar between TURFs and the NT, but doubled in OAAs. We also found strong differences in mortality among fishing grounds with the same level of protection (i. e. TURFs), and over time. Our results highlight (a) the high level of illegal fishing that may occur in artisanal fisheries under traditional management regimes, and (b) that TURFs can be effective to reduce fishing mortality. However, large variability among TURFs suggests the need for {{a deeper understanding of the}} drivers of success of TURFs...|$|E

It was {{known for a long}} time before, that Semarang coastal water is a very good fishing ground especially for some valuable demersal species, such as white shrimp (Penaeus merguiensis), (Metapeneus. sp); flat fishes (3 species); Gastropods : Tiger snails (Babylonia. sp) and Bivalves : Anadara. sp. Some study that had been developed earlier in transforming from individual station data at coastal and seas, into visual-spatial layer in order to give more accurate spatial analysis of multiple parameters in the invisible coastal waters. This study present further development in the analysis of multi-layer spatial analysis. The samples of demersal coastal shrimp fishery and its closely related ecosystem parameters (depth; sediment; salinity) were taken randomly to represent the area of Semarang coastal zone. Field ecosystem and fishery samples data then processed using spatial method known as Kriging, and overlaid on a Landsat_TM satellite data. The study develops especially a multi layer of the field variables approach in order to analyze possible spatial multiple correlations between ecosystem parameter, such as type of bottom sediment, depth, and salinity to spatial distribution of shrimps spatial distribution as to represent demersal coastal fishery.

Variables representing seafloor structure, generated from airborne bathymetric LiDAR were combined with spatially-explicit fishing event data, to characterize {{the geographic}} footprint of the western Victorian abalone fishery, in south-east Australia. A MaxEnt modeling approach determined that bathymetry, rugosity and complexity were the three most important predictors in defining suitable fishing grounds (AUC = 0. 89).

40|$|Assessing {{patterns}} of fisheries activity at a scale related to resource exploitation has re-ceived particular attention in recent times. However, acquiring {{data about the}} distribution and spatiotemporal allocation of catch and fishing effort in small scale <b>benthic</b> <b>fisheries</b> re-mains challenging. Here, we used GIS-based spatio-statistical models to investigate the footprint of commercial diving events on blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) stocks along the south-west coast of Victoria, Australia from 2008 to 2011. Using abalone catch data matched with GPS location we found catch per unit of fishing effort (CPUE) was not uniform-ly spatially and temporally distributed across the study area. Spatial autocorrelation and hotspot analysis revealed significant spatiotemporal clusters of CPUE (with distance thresh-olds of 100 ’s of meters) among years, indicating the presence of CPUE hotspots focused on specific reefs. Cumulative hotspot maps indicated that certain reef complexes were con-sistently targeted across years but with varying intensity, however often a relatively small proportion of the full reef extent was targeted. Integrating CPUE with remotely-sensed {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) derived bathymetry data using generalized additive mixed model corroborated that fishing pressure primarily coincided with shallow, rugose and com-plex components of reef structures.

40|$|In Chile, a Territorial User Rights for Fisheries {{system was}} {{developed}} to manage <b>benthic</b> <b>fisheries.</b> This system {{is referred to as}} Management Areas for the Exploitation of Benthic Resources. Management areas involved a shift from top-down control by governments to comanagement. We have analyzed the effects of a highly variable fishery, characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, on the governance of local institutions designed for resource management. We focused on a case study in north central Chile, in which the surf clam fishery experienced high levels of variability when the fishery was in an open access system. The management areas were established for the fishery in 1999. As a result, a set of rules for the fishery were created and enforced by fishers and local fishery authorities. Despite intense efforts on the part of all stakeholders, the fishery collapsed after three years of management area policy. This approach {{has been shown to be}} an effective management option for other species; however, for resources with boom-and-bust cycles, it is important to understand the response pattern of users confronting this spatial and temporal variability before the establishment of territorial user rights. Defining the appropriate spatial scale of the territorial rights could allow fishers to switch among different surf clam beds to maintain their livelihood and support the sustainability of local institutions for resource management...|$|R

40|$|This study {{documents}} {{the distribution and}} habitat preferences of the golden crab, a commercially fished species, in relation to deep-sea coral/sponge ecosystems (DSCEs) at 200 - 900 m depths off eastern Florida. A total of 386 h of videotapes from 94 submersible and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives from 1999 to 2009, covering a total distance of 376 km, were reviewed and characterized for habitat type and presence of crabs. The DSCEs surveyed included Lophelia coral mounds, Miami Terrace, Pourtalès Terrace, and Tortugas Valleys. Video transect data also included environmental surveys of proposed deep-water routes for Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) pipelines, LNG port, and telecommunications fiber-optic cable. A total of 351 golden crabs (Chaceon fenneri) were counted and observed {{on a wide variety}} of habitat types, including coral thickets, rock escarpments, rock pavement, boulders, and soft bottom. The mean density of golden crabs was greater on soft bottom than on hard bottom habitat (0. 342 ± 0. 234 vs 0. 190 ± 0. 121 crabs / 1000 m 2); within the hard bottom regions, mean density was greater on rock substrate than coral substrate (0. 206 ± 0. 120 and 0. 040 ± 0. 035 crabs / 1000 m 2). The current golden crab fishery operates off eastern Florida in Allowable Crab Fishing Areas (ACFAs) within the deep-water Coral Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (CHAPCs); however, we have documented at least 8 regions within the CHAPCs where the ACFAs overlap probable DSCE habitat. Resource managers should adjust the boundaries of the ACFAs to protect and preserve vulnerable DSCE habitat while allowing <b>benthic</b> <b>fisheries</b> to operate in areas of soft bottom habitat...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of {{internal}} tides in driving the sedimentation and re-suspension of biogenic POM on the Namibian shelf and give rise to stable 500 – 800 km long shore alternating bands {{of high and low}} POM concentrations. Temperature time series data (September 2000 –March 2001) from the benthic boundary layer at three sites are used to hypothesise that the dominant forcing mechanism are internal tides and their interaction with the shelf break zones. Vertical displacements of the temperature structure by 100 – 150 m at the outer shelf break (depth 450 m) are shown to occur through out the 6 -month time series. In contrast at non-shelf break sites the vertical displacements of temperature are negligible. The shear–stresses predicted landward of the shelf break zone from 100 – 150 m vertical displacements of the temperature structure are significantly higher (40. 1 Pa) than the critical shear–stresses which govern the re-suspension of biogenic particles and fine sediments (0. 05 – 0. 1 Pa). Short-term ADCP data was used to show that critical shear–stress distribution at the different POM areas is consistent with the predicted net accumulation and net erosional zones of POM across the Namibian shelf. This study hypothesises that the barotropic–baroclinic tidal coupling governs vertical particle flux dynamics whereas Ekman and inertial flows are thought to govern the horizontal advection scales that result in the observed POM distribution.

The present paper demonstrated that by-catch rates in the Queensland (Australia) saucer scallop (Amusium balloti) trawl fishery can be reduced by 77 % (by weight) using nets fitted with a turtle excluder device (TED) and a square-mesh codend, compared with a standard diamond-mesh codend with no TED. This large reduction was achieved with no {{significant effect on the}} legal size scallop catch rate and 39 % fewer undersize scallops were caught. In total, 382 taxa were recorded in the by-catch, which was dominated by sponges, portunid crabs, small demersal and benthic fish (e. g. leatherjackets, stingerfish, bearded ghouls, nemipterids, longspine emperors, lizard fish, triggerfish, flounders and rabbitfish), elasmobranchs (e. g. mainly rays) and invertebrates (e. g. sea stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and bivalve molluscs). Extremely high reductions in catch rate (i. e. ≥ 85 %) were demonstrated for several by-catch species owing to the square-mesh codend.

The cpue in the commercial ﬁshery was very seasonal and dominated by females during autumn, when both cpue and spawning periods peaked, so increasing the potential for negative ﬁshery impacts on egg production. The inability of cpue to account for the effects of continual ﬁshing pressure on recruitment or seasonal changes in sex-speciﬁc catchability, however, indicates that cpue alone cannot provide sufﬁcient information on the status of a holobenthic octopus ﬁshery...|$|R

Macrobenthic community diversity decreased when continen¬tal inputs of organic matter increased, whereas ecosystem production, measured by common sole (Solea solea) fishery yields in the area, increased. Decreases in macrobenthic diversity were mainly related to an increasing abundance of species with specific functional traits, particularly deposit-feeding polychaetes. The decrease in macrobenthic diversity did not result in a decrease, but an increase in ecosystem production, as it enhanced the transfer of continental POM into marine food webs.

40|$|To {{ensure that}} {{destructive}} bottom fishing activities {{do not have}} significant adverse impacts on Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) in high seas areas of the World Ocean, as required by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 61 - 105, knowledge of the locations of VMEs is required. Quantifying the occurrence and abundance of VME indicator taxa in research bottom-trawl samples, {{as well as from}} in situ observations with underwater photography, provides methods for detecting these ecosystems. A case study is presented in which a threshold density of indicator taxa was used as the basis for VME designation. In 2009, high densities of VME indicator taxa were encountered at 11 sites off th`e South Orkney Islands in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. In most cases, thresholds were exceeded by a limited number of VME indicator taxa, primarily representatives of the class Demospongiae (siliceous sponges), Hexactinellida (glass sponges) and Ascidiacea (tunicates). In situ imagery further showed the importance of bryozoans (lace corals), scleractinians (stony corals) and stylastrids (hydrocorals) in the study region. The approach outlined here, which relies on widely used sampling techniques, could be employed throughout the World Ocean to detect and document the presence of VMEs from existing datasets. To illustrate this point, the method was applied to a separate dataset, collected in 2006, from a research cruise off the northern Antarctic Peninsula, which led to the detection of 17 VMEs.

Each case specifies the main attributes of the access rights (in a broad sense, including privileges), whether formal or informal. The study also explores and discusses the following questions: How can, the property rights systems illustrated in the case studies, improve the incentives for stewardship, conservation and sustained profitability? What sorts of distributional implications are there {{in each of the}} rights-based finfish fisheries reported? What sorts of operational requirements do the different types of property rights documented demand in terms of research, enforcement, administration and actual fishing operations? The diversity of rights-based management schemes reported for <b>benthic</b> and finfish <b>fisheries</b> in Latin America seems to respond to (i) local fishery contexts, (ii) institutional, resource and ecosystem dynamics, and (iii) governance capacities in place. At this stage of establishing rights-based schemes in Latin America, a commonality found in virtually all study cases is the non-transferability of formal privileges. It seems to reflect the concerns for potential concentration of fishing rights on a few hands were transferability introduced. In many of the cases discussed, non-divisibility of rights is also specified. In contrast, informal access privileges are effectively transferable and divisible in some customary tenure systems where seabed resources are targeted. Enforcement and compliance continues to be a challenge for many of the cases reported, particularly in artisanal fisheries. Community self-policing in fisheries with limited number of participants seems to facilitate compliance with regulations and granted rights. Because of the relatively short time span over which the reported formal right-based systems have been in place, the sustainability performance of most of them cannot yet be properly assessed.

The new usSEABED software system provides a mechanism for compiling diverse seabed datasets of U. S. margins from across the marine science community. The USGS is using usSEABED to map benthic habitats and conduct national assessments of offshore aggregates for use as potential sand sources for beach nourishment purposes.

40|$|Bloom-forming harmful {{cyanobacteria}} (CyanoHABs) are harmful from environmental, {{ecological and}} human health perspectives by outcompeting beneficial phytoplankton, creating low oxygen conditions (hypoxia, anoxia), and by producing cyanotoxins. Cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence, global warming {{plays a key role}} in their expansion and persistence. CyanoHABs are regulated by synergistic effects of nutrient (nitrogen:N and phosphorus:P) supplies, light, temperature, vertical stratification, water residence times, and biotic interactions. In most instances, nutrient control strategies should focus on reducing both N and P inputs. Strategies based on physical, chemical (nutrient) and biological manipulations can be effective in reducing CyanoHABs; however, these strategies are largely confined to relatively small systems, and some are prone to ecological and environmental drawbacks, including enhancing release of cyanotoxins, disruption of planktonic and <b>benthic</b> communities and <b>fisheries</b> habitat. All strategies should consider and be adaptive to climatic variability and change in order to be effective for long-term control of CyanoHABs.

The analysis revealed that the demand for secondary production placed on the ecosystem by fish declined from approximately 20 g Cm- 2 y- 1 in the 1970 s to 16 g C m- 2 y- 1 in the 1990 s. Over the same period, the proportion of demand provided by zooplankton production increased from around 70 % to 75 %. The overall decrease was mainly due {{to a reduction in}} piscivorous demersal fish. Average secondary production by omnivorous zooplankton was estimated to be 35 g Cm- 2 y- 1, and annual fluctuations were positively correlated with the gross production of planktivorous fish. The results suggest a ''bottom-up'' control of the pelagic foodweb. Individual planktivore species have been impacted by fishing, but the populations of other functionally similar species have expanded to fill the vacant niches, thus maintaining the planktivore role in the system. In contrast, the results indicate that benthos production was more "top-down" controlled. Overall, demersal fish species have been depleted by fishing, with no obvious species expansions to fill the vacant niche, releasing the benthos from predation pressure, and leading to an increase in <b>benthic</b> production and <b>fisheries</b> for invertebrates...|$|R

The piked dogfish Squalus acanthias {{is part of}} the bycatch {{of several}} South American {{longline}} fisheries, although in Argentina, it was only reported in the bycatch of <b>benthic</b> and demersal <b>fisheries</b> operating bottom nets. This communication represents the first record of S. acanthias bycatch in a commercial semi-pelagic longline fishery within Argentinean waters. In October-November 2005, 185 piked dogfish were captured (122 females and 63 males). The es-timated mean catch rate was 0. 37 sharks/ 1000 hooks (544, 320 hooks deployed). Nearly half of the captured females and over 50 % of captured males were morphometrically mature. The piked dogfish bycatch could have been influenced by the use of the Argentine shortfin squid Illex argentinus as bait; this squid {{is part of the}} shark’s natural diet. Although S. acanthias is abundant in the region, we believe that the bycatch species could be more vulnerable than the targeted ones since the signs indicating a declining population of non-target species in commercial catches and collapses in bycatch populations go unnoticed.

40|$|Abstract Polychaetes are an {{important}} component of benthic ecosystems, both from an environmental and from an economic perspective. Polychaetes {{play a role in the}} environment by assisting in nutrient cycles, bioturbation and aeration of the sediment. Polychaetes are strongly linked within food webs with birds, fish, crustaceans and gastropods all having been recorded feeding on them. Polychaetes are among the best indicators of pollution and disturbance in environmental management and monitoring. They are well known as first stage colonisers of anthropogenic and naturally damaged marine ecosystems. All these roles that polychaetes play in marine ecosystems make them important in sustainable fisheries, aquaculture and environmental monitoring research. In this thesis, data on the diversity, abundance and richness of polychaete communities in the Gulf of Carpentaria (GoC) are presented and correlated with environmental predictors. Correlations of feeding guild diversity and richness to environmental data are also presented. Data are collated from four surveys conducted over the past twenty years. These surveys are the Gulf of Carpentaria Fish and Megabenthos Project SS 03 / 1990 (GoCFM); the Northern Prawn <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Benthic</b> Spatial MSE Project SS 03 / 2005 (MPFB); Arafura Sea Biological Survey SS 05 / 2005; and the Northern Territory Museum (NTM) benthic baseline survey. Benthic samples were collected via different equipment for each survey, mainly a Smith-McIntyre, Box Core and Petersen Grab. Statistical analysis was conducted as part of three case studies: the 1990 dataset from the Gulf of Carpentaria Fish and Megabenthos Project; the 2005 dataset collected from the Southwest region of the GoC in the Northern Prawn <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Benthic</b> Spatial MSE Project; and the species level analysis of the Pilargidae family ecology, which combined data from the Northern Prawn <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Benthic</b> Spatial MSE Project SS 03 / 2005; Arafura Sea Biological Survey SS 05 / 2005; and the Northern Territory Museum (NTM) benthic baseline survey. Statistical analysis was conducted at the family level, due to time restrictions in the project. Only one family, the Pilargidae, was identified to the species level for a more detailed assessment of distribution and ecology. This detailed assessment found five new species to science and five new species records for Australia. A total of 10, 044 individual polychaetes from forty-four families were collected during all four surveys. All these families are commonly collected from waters around Australia. The density of polychaetes in the 1990 GoC ranged from 10 – 2, 010 ind/m 2, = 130 ind/m 2. In 2005 the density of polychaetes ranged from 100 – 2, 880 ind/m 2, = 820 ind/m 2. The three dominant families in the GoC have remained the same between 1990 and 2005. However the top ranked family has changed between the two surveys. In 1990 Eunicidae was the top ranked family, followed by Capitellidae and Spionidae, whereas in 2005 Capitellidae was the top ranked, followed by Spionidae and Eunicidae. This may be due to a seasonal effect on polychaete groups, as the GoCFM survey was conducted at the start of the wet-season (Nov-Dec) and the NPFB survey was conducted at the end of the wet season (Feb-Mar). In 1990 and 2005 the same pattern in polychaete diversity, abundance and richness was observed across the GoC. In general there was a distinctly higher diversity and richness in the south-eastern region of the GoC, with a trend of reduction in a diagonal direction to the north-west GoC and into the Arafura Sea. This same pattern was observed in the feeding guild diversity and richness, except for the filter feeding guild. This guild did not show a reduction in abundance across the GoC sites. The best predictor for the relationship of polychaete community composition to environmental predictors, for both 1990 and 2005 was firstly the percentage sand content of the sediments and secondly the salinity of surrounding water. Polychaetes guild showed the same correlation with sand being the best predictor for guild diversity and richness. Species level analyses of the Pilargidae suggest that individual species have sediment grain size preferences. Overall the findings demonstrate that within the GoC higher sand content of the sediments supports a higher polychaetes diversity, abundance and richness...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to human}} activities, marine and {{terrestrial}} ecosystems face a future where disturbances are predicted to occur at a frequency and severity unprecedented {{in the recent}} past. Of particular concern {{is the ability of}} systems to recover where multiple stressors act simultaneously. We examine this issue {{in the context of a}} coral reef ecosystem where increases in stressors, such as <b>fisheries,</b> <b>benthic</b> degradation, cyclones and coral bleaching, are occurring at global scales. By utilizing long-term (decadal) monitoring programs, we examined the combined effects of chronic (removal of sharks) and pulse (cyclones, bleaching) disturbances on the trophic structure of coral reef fishes at two isolated atoll systems off the coast of northwest Australia. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the loss of sharks can have an impact that propagates down the food chain, potentially contributing to mesopredator release and altering the numbers of primary consumers. Simultaneously, we show how the effects of bottom-up processes of bleaching and cyclones appear to propagate up the food chain through herbivores, planktivores and corallivores, but do not affect carnivores. Because their presence may promote the abundance of herbivores, the removal of sharks by fishing has implications for both natural and anthropogenic disturbances involving the loss of corals, as herbivores are critical to the progress and outcome of coral recovery...|$|R

The coastal state of Bahia hosts the most extensive and richest area of coral reefs in the South Atlantic Ocean. Assessment, planning and management of coral reef ecosystems are particularly challenging tasks. This work shows how the creation of a GIS improves the process of management, monitoring and conservation of the Bahian reef environments The initial data input started by the vectorization of 1) bathymetric data from the Bureau of Hydrography and Navigation (DHN), 2) shoreline and mangrove areas from Landsat 7 ETM + images, 3) near surface reefs from Quickbird images, and 4) coastal and marine protected areas of federal, state and local administrations. Geological, physical, biological and social information was then included {{in order to create a}} suitable marine GIS for conservation aims. The data includes information on sediment granulometry and transport patterns, rocky substrate outcrops, sea surface temperature, wave direction, rain precipitation, major contributing river discharge, artisanal <b>fishery,</b> <b>benthic</b> cover and bleaching data. ReefBahia GIS has provided essential information for a better understanding of coral reefs of the state of Bahia geological and ecological characteristics such as mapping, representation, connectivity and biodiversity of coral reefs, geological facies, Quaternary sedimentation, numeric modeling of wave refraction and monitoring of bleaching events...|$|R

These data may be used to remotely evaluate 1) water quality, 2) transport of sediments and adhered pollutants, 3) primary production, upon which commercial shellfish and finfish populations depend for food, and 4) harmful algal blooms which pose a threat to public health and economies of affected areas. Several US government agencies have recently expressed interest in monitoring U. S. coastal waters using optical remote sensing. This renewed interest is broadly driven by 1) resource management concerns over the impact of coastward shifts in population and land use on the ecosystems of estuaries, wetlands, nearshore <b>benthic</b> environments and <b>fisheries,</b> 2) recognition of the need to understand short time scale global change due to urbanization of sensitive land-margin ecosystems, and 3) national security issues. Satellite ocean color sensors have the potential to furnish data at the appropriate time and space scales to evaluate and resolve these concerns and problems. In this draft technical memorandum, we outline our progress during the first year of our SIMBIOS project to evaluate ocean color bio-optical algorithms and products generated using OCTS and SeaWiFS data in coastal US waters...|$|R
40|$|Over 5, 000 marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) exist around the world. Most are small (median size of ~ 2 km 2) and designed {{primarily for the}} conservation of a single flagship species. Internationally, there is an increasing focus on ecologically representative conservation; however the contribution of these small MPAs to the protection of regional biodiversity is often unknown. This paper presents a benthic habitat mapping exercise and reports on measures of biodiversity in the Eastport MPA and the nearby area of Newman Sound in Eastern Canada. The Eastport MPA is a 2. 1 km 2 no-take reserve designated in 2005, based on a voluntary fishery closure implemented by the local community in 1997. The primary goal of the Eastport MPA is to protect and sustain the American lobster (Homarus americanus) population, supporting a local commercial <b>fishery.</b> <b>Benthic</b> habitats were characterized and mapped using multibeam echosounder data and seafloor videos. Three statistically distinct benthic habitats were identified within the boundaries of the MPA: “shallow rocky,” “sand and cobble,” and “sand. ” The distribution of species is primarily driven by depth and substrate type. The shallow rocky habitat (48 % of the study area) contains complex bedrock and boulder features with high macroalgal cover. These characteristics are associated with juvenile and adult American lobster habitat. However, comparison of the MPA habitats to the surrounding Newman Sound area indicate that this small MPA contributes little to the conservation of the regional marine biodiversity. We recommend that adaptive management mechanisms be used to review such MPAs and expand them to better protect ecosystems representative of their regions...|$|R
40|$|An {{ecosystem}} modelling {{approach was}} used to understand and assess the whole 16 Mediterranean marine ecosystem structure and functioning. In particular, two food web 17 models for the 1950 s and 2000 s periods were built to investigate: 1) the main structural and 18 functional characteristics of the Mediterranean food-web during these time periods; 2) the key 19 species/functional groups and interactions; 3) the role of fisheries and its impact; and 4) the 20 ecosystem properties of the Mediterranean Sea in comparison with other European Regional 21 Seas. Results show that among all functional groups the highest trophic levels were observed 22 for marine mammals and large predatory fish. The ecosystem flows were mainly dominated by 23 lower trophic level organisms, as benthic invertebrates, zooplankton and phytoplankton while 24 small pelagic fish, mainly European sardines and anchovies, prevailed in terms of biomasses and 25 catches. Large pelagic fish, sharks and medium pelagic fish seemed to {{play a key role}} in the past 26 ecosystem, replaced in more recent year by large pelagic fish, benthopelagic and <b>benthic</b> 27 cephalopods. <b>Fisheries</b> showed large impacts on most living groups of the ecosystem in both 28 time periods. Also, when comparing the Mediterranean to the other European Regional Seas, 29 the Mediterranean stood alone in relation to the type of flows driving the system and the 30 cycling indices, suggesting higher levels of community stress induced by intensive fishing 31 activities. In the near future, effort should be dedicated to implement spatial and temporal 32 dynamic simulations to evaluate the exploitation status of the Mediterranean Sea and explore 33 different management policies and future scenarios.
