5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
25|$|For a climactic finale, De Palma {{staged a}} chase from the {{platform}} of the Harlem-125th Street (Metro-North) Station to the escalators of Grand Central Terminal. For the shoot, trains were re-routed and timed so that Pacino and his pursuers could dart from car to hurtling car. The {{length of the}} escalator scene during the climactic shoot out at Grand Central Station caused a headache for editor Pankow. He had {{to piece together the}} sequences so that the audience would be so tied up in the action that they would not <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how long the escalator was running.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, he should not <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she {{looks a lot like}} Hazumu.|$|E

50|$|He {{encounters}} the man {{who told}} him of his wife's letter, and he thinks briefly about how he hates travelling through the cursed forest. Josh then sees the student, who <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how her parents will hate her once they find out that she dropped out of school. When Josh sees the two ballerinas, they both <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> that without the other, they could be stars. Then he sees the four going to the rave. Aaron first thinks about how he doesn't like 'love and peace', Monica <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how she loves Europe and how lovely Max <b>is,</b> Max <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how to use Monica to smuggle drugs into America, and Katja is lamenting about how Monica is being used as Max's puppet. Josh then meets Jane, who <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> her next project, and how half- dead people can be used. She then snaps out of her dream, thinking that she might need counselling. Next, Josh sees the two Romanian generals. One <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how he lost his friends in war because his gun jammed, the other <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> marrying the woman he loves and setting up his own business. The next man he sees is the ticket collector, who <b>is</b> strangely <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the train derailing. Unable to see Yeli, Josh then sees the German businessman, who wants to embezzle his company's funds. Lastly, he sees Kate. She <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{the fact that she}} is pregnant, a fact Josh didn't know. Viktor then appears by her side, saying that she is the same as his wife Mary. Kate then turns into gas, Viktor sees Josh, and he runs away.|$|R

McCaw denied New Zealand's easy run into the quarter-finals played a part in the loss [...] "A lot of the guys have been through this before, they've played big test matches." [...] Graham Henry's policy of using squad rotation and resting key players during the Super 14 was [...] criticised. McCaw also came under attack. He was accused of not inspiring his team, lacking the ability to change policy when plan A was not working and not providing enough leadership on the field.|$|E
500|$|During {{his second}} run for president, Reagan's {{campaign}} advisor, George Will, tried to co-opt Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] for the campaign. Will wrote that if [...] "labor and management, who make steel or cars or shoes or textiles, made their products {{with as much}} energy and confidence as Springsteen and his merry band make music, {{there would be no}} need for Congress to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> protectionism". A week after Will's writing appeared in a column, Reagan praised Springsteen in a stump speech given in Hammonton, New Jersey. Soon after Reagan's speech, Springsteen expressed discontent with the president and his policies, and [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] was dropped from the campaign. Reagan's team then reached out to John Cougar Mellancamp to use his song [...] "Pink Houses" [...] and were turned down. The campaign then adopted [...] "God Bless the U.S.A." [...] by country singer Lee Greenwood. Greenwood played the song for the Second inauguration of Ronald Reagan and at the inaugurations of the next three Republican presidents.|$|E
500|$|British singer, Rita Ora, plays Drake's distant love {{interest}} in the video. It begins with Drake dressed sitting in a room on a bed, reflecting on his new life. Several images including explosions and cityscapes are shown on him and on the wall before the performance begins. Drake is later shown throughout the video {{in front of a}} gray backdrop, as he seems to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> two women in his visions, Ora, who seems to portray the good girl, and another woman, who remained yet to be seen fully, portrayed as dangerous as she dances provocatively in the background. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "artistically contradictory", however said that the scenes of Drake sitting [...] "alone in his bedroom as flashing images of busy streets and crowds of strangers float around him, pensive and rebellious", and called them [...] "controlled chaos", but said that it worked in the video. Wete also pointed out that [...] "He chose not to go the cliche rap-video route and fill his four-minute flick with nearly naked women, Ciroc bottles, and Beamers", and that he stuck with [...] "one leading lady".|$|E

500|$|Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe {{said that}} [...] "Bally's in Las Vegas set the Red Sox as 8â€“5 {{favorites}} {{to win the}} Series" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "some sentiment in St. Louis that the NL champions have been disrespected." [...] but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein [...] "Did not want to dis the Cardinals." [...] Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: [...] "There's a lot of good players in that [...] clubhouse over there. This isn't the time for us to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> history. If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty sure it will hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about how much people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural that she should <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{the two of them}} when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E
2500|$|The analogy he {{provides}} {{to explain his}} theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human is potentially thinking about a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it. Therefore, {{he says that the}} First Intellect must always <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's [...] "acquired intellect" [...] and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.|$|E

Its leader Brendan Nelson initially said that an apology would risk encouraging a [...] "culture of guilt" [...] in Australia. However, support for an apology was expressed by other senior Liberals, such as Malcolm Turnbull, Peter Costello, Bill Heffernan, and former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Former Liberal minister Judi Moylan said: [...] "I think as a nation we owe an apology. We shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it as an individual apologyâ€” it's an apology that {{is coming from the}} nation state because it was governments that did these things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Man Chong {{was not on}} {{good terms}} with his colleague, Wang Ling, who spread rumours that Man Chong was {{addicted}} to alcohol, physically unfit for his job, and unruly and defiant. When the rumours reached the Wei imperial capital Luoyang, an official Guo Mou (éƒ­è¬€) suggested to the emperor to summon Man Chong to Luoyang {{and see if the}} rumours were true, as opposed to immediately removing Man Chong from office. Cao Rui heeded the suggestion. When Man Chong met the emperor, he appeared to be in good health and remained sober after consuming one dan of alcohol. Cao Rui thus concluded that the rumours were untrue and ordered Man Chong to return to his post. Man Chong, however, wanted to remain in Luoyang so he repeatedly sought permission from Cao Rui but was denied. Cao Rui told him, [...] "In the past, Lian Po ate and drank heavily to show that he was in good health, while Ma Yuan turned his body to look backward while he was on horseback to show that he was still fit for battle. You aren't even old, yet you say you're old. Why don't you compare yourself with Lian Po and Ma Yuan?

[...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease.

2500|$|The {{character}} was eventually {{to make his}} return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer Diederick Santer {{as part of a}} storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy. After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured {{to the top of a}} deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven. For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy. Aaron Sidwell was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him. It was Sidwell's first television role, and he has described it as [...] "a bit daunting...but everyone was really welcoming...the first few directors I worked with were fantastic...After we did rehearsal, after we did a take, they'd always give me feedback...I needed it." [...] He added, [...] "I have been so lucky. Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was pretty impressive. I still wake up and think: 'Oh my God, I'm in EastEnders.' It's brilliant." [...] Describing the motives behind Steven's actions, Sidwell said [...] " [...] was raised for 13 years thinking he was Ian's son...but he wasn't...He sees Ian as the cause of Cindy's death, because Cindy died in prison, and she went to prison because Ian put her there...so that's how he kind of sees that it's Ian's fault...very narrow-minded... Steven is..a messed up kid and when I first got the part I was given a catchphrase that describes him as a person...'look at me'...he wants to be in the limelight 100%...he wants people to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> him ...that's why he got angry with Ian because Ian wasn't thinking about him... he's the most important person in the world." ...|$|E
