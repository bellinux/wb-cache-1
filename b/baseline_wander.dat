Quantifying pulse {{diagnosis is}} to acquire and record pulse waveforms {{by a set}} of sensor firstly, and then analyze these pulse waveforms. However, respiration and artifact motion during pulse waveform acquisition can introduce <b>baseline</b> <b>wander.</b> It is necessary, therefore, to remove the pulse waveform's <b>baseline</b> <b>wander</b> in order to perform accurate pulse waveform analysis. This paper presents a wavelet-based cascaded adaptive filter (CAF) to remove the <b>baseline</b> <b>wander</b> of pulse waveform. To evaluate the level of <b>baseline</b> <b>wander,</b> we introduce a criterion: energy ratio (ER) of pulse waveform to its <b>baseline</b> <b>wander.</b> If the ER is more than a given threshold, the <b>baseline</b> <b>wander</b> can be removed only by cubic spline estimation; otherwise it must be filtered by, in sequence, discrete Meyer wavelet filter and the cubic spline estimation. Compared with traditional methods such as cubic spline estimation, morphology filter and Linear-phase finite impulse response (FIR) least-squares-error digital filter, the experimental results on 50 simulated and 500 real pulse signals demonstrate the power of CAF filter both in removing <b>baseline</b> <b>wander</b> and in preserving the diagnostic information of pulse waveforms.

While analog high-pass filters introduce phase distortions, reliable offline filtering of the <b>baseline</b> <b>wander</b> implies a computational burden {{that has to be}} put in relation to the increase in signal-to-baseline ratio (SBR). Here we present a graphics processor unit (GPU) based parallelization method to speed up offline <b>baseline</b> <b>wander</b> filter algorithms, namely the wavelet, finite, and infinite impulse response, moving mean, and moving median filter. Individual filter parameters were optimized with respect to the SBR increase based on ECGs from the Physionet database superimposed to auto-regressive modeled, real <b>baseline</b> <b>wander.</b> A Monte-Carlo simulation showed that for low input SBR the moving median filter outperforms any other method but negatively affects ECG wave detection. In contrast, the infinite impulse response filter is preferred in case of high input SBR.

The present study was designed to test the effectiveness of our newly developed heart-rate adaptive match filter (AMF) to remove <b>baseline</b> <b>wanders</b> and improve TWA detection. To this aim, both simulated and experimental (10 Holter ECGs of patients with acute myocardial infarction, AMI) data were used. Performance of our AMF was compared with that of a third-order spline (TOS) interpolation. In simulated data, AMF allowed correct detection of TWA almost independently of baseline frequency components, when these were different from TWA own frequency, whereas the TOS interpolation allowed TWA detection only for baseline frequencies lower than TWA frequency. Application of AMF to AMI patients allowed detection of TWA in 2 out of 10, whereas 10 out of 10 were detected as TWA-positive after application of the TOS (p< 0. 05). The two patients that resulted TWA-positive after AMF application were characterized by a larger number (p< 0. 05) of beats involved in the TWA episodes than the number detected by the TOS. Detection of TWA in 100 % of AMI patients provided by the TOS-technique (suggesting the presence of false-positive), and presence of false-negative, as deduced from the simulation results, question the reliability of this method.
