5|$|Every September {{a handful}} of local men and women gather along the Ōku beach to sing and perform this dance, {{with the purpose of}} placating the dead spirit of a woman who is said to have <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> ashore in Ōku long, long ago.|$|E
5|$|Fossils from {{terrestrial}} dinosaurs {{also have}} been found in the Niobrara Chalk, suggesting that animals who died on shore must have <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> out to sea (one specimen of a hadrosaur appears to have been scavenged by a shark).|$|E
5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E

5|$|The {{explosive}} phreatomagmatic eruptions {{caused by}} the easy access of water to the erupting vents threw rocks up to a kilometre (0.6mi) away from the island, and sent ash clouds as high as 10km (6mi) up into the atmosphere. The loose pile of unconsolidated tephra would quickly have <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> away had the supply of fresh magma dwindled, and large clouds of dust were often seen blowing away from the island during {{this stage of the}} eruption.|$|E
5|$|The six {{survivors}} {{buried the}} bodies {{found on the}} beach, then travelled east along the beach, expecting to reach Cape Town. However, after {{four and a half}} days, they realised their error and returned {{to the site of the}} wreck. Here they subsisted off a cask of oatmeal, while trying to effect repairs to the ship's pinnace, which had <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> ashore. They were discovered six days later on 14 June by a farmer's son, who was out hunting.|$|E
5|$|By the 21st century {{many of the}} Device Forts {{had been}} damaged by, {{or in some cases}} lost entirely, to coastal erosion; the problem had existed at some {{locations}} since the 16th century and still persists, for example at Hurst. East Cowes Castle and East Tilbury Fort have been entirely lost, while the East Blockhouse, Mersea and Sandsfoot have been badly damaged, a third of Sandgate and most of St Andrews have <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> away. Other sites were demolished, built upon or simply eroded over time; almost no trace remains of the bulwarks along the Downs, for example. The remaining sites are protected by UK conservation law, either as scheduled monuments or listed buildings.|$|E

5|$|For 11days, the JTWC on Guam {{was unable}} to {{continue}} operations, relying on a backup agency. The damage to the airport radar prompted the NEXRADa network of high-resolution weather radarsto be installed earlier than scheduled, in February 1993, and limited incoming and outgoing flights to the daytime. On August30, a naval ship docked at Apra Harbor to provide a temporary mobile radar. By September15, both ships that had <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> ashore were refloated. In {{the aftermath of the}} destruction, insurance companies decided to stop issuing new policies for structures not made of concrete. In January 1996, former Governor Carl Gutierrez issued an executive order, mandating that homes or storm shutters on the island withstand winds of at least 250m/h (155mph).|$|E
5|$|In Nuevo León, fifteen {{people were}} {{confirmed}} to have died: one bricklayer who died after a housing unit under construction collapsed {{on top of}} him; two men {{and a woman who}} died after their vehicle rolled over and crashed into a semi-trailer truck due to the intense rainfall; a 25-year-old who was swept away by swift currents and pinned against a fence; an elderly man who died after a wall toppled over him, a woman who died after a large boulder from a rock slide fell on her home, and a young man who fell onto the Arroyo Topo Chico. Eight more bodies were found after floodwaters began receding, although one is believed to have <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> away from a cemetery. Twenty people in Nuevo León were reported missing.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} the storm, the bodies of {{drowning}} victims had been recovered by the hundreds, and it was suspected many of the deceased had <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> into the sea. One preliminary estimate placed the number of dead in the Jérémie area alone at 1,500, suggesting {{the worst of the}} tragedy occurred there. Indeed, some modern sources have unofficially referred to the storm as Hurricane Jérémie. The Haitian government worked to bring emergency supplies and relief workers, at least partially by way of ship, to the flood-stricken region. As little was known about the extent of losses, officials rushed to restore communications with the disaster area.|$|E

5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 1603 recorded that Upnor Castle had 20 guns of various calibres, plus another 11 guns split between two sconces or outworks, known as Bay and Warham Sconces. The castle's armament {{consisted of a}} demi-cannon, 7 culverin, 5 demi-culverin, a minion, a falconet, a saker, and four fowlers with two chambers each. Bay Sconce was armed with 4 demi-culverin, while Warham Sconce had 2 culverin and 5 demi-culverin. Eighteen guns were recorded as being mounted in the castle twenty years later. The garrison's armament included 34 longbows, an indication that archery was still of military value even at this late date. By this time, however, the castle {{was in a state}} of disrepair. The drawbridge and its raising mechanism were broken, the gun platforms needed repairs, and the courtyard wall had collapsed. A new curtain wall had to be built to protect the landward side of the castle. The foundations of Warham Sconce were reported to have <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> away by the tide, and it appears that both sconces were allowed to fall into ruin.|$|E
5|$|Amanita nothofagi {{mushrooms}} can {{be confused}} with A.australis if the warts have <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> off and the colour has been bleached. A reliable method to distinguish the two is to check {{for the presence of}} clamp connections at the bases of the basidia, which are present in A.australis and absent from A.nothofagi. Ridley notes that the type collection was made with a dark grey specimen, and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species. Paler specimens resemble A.excelsa, which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand. Amanita luteofusca is also similar in appearance, spore size, amyloid reaction, and lack of clamp connections in the basidia. It is distinguished from A.nothofagi largely on the basis of colour—it is a greyish-brown to yellowish-grey brown that fades to pinkish-buff as it gets older. Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and volvas may indicate that they share Gondwanan ancestors.|$|E
5|$|In Florida, {{waves of}} over 10feet (3m) in height capsized a boat near Lantana; the two {{occupants}} were rescued without injury. Additionally, the waves displaced a sailboat {{that had previously}} <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> ashore in Juno Beach. Large waves flooded a parking lot and destroyed several fences and tree branches at Jupiter Beach, which resulted in its temporary closure; nearby a maintenance shed was destroyed. Eight leatherback sea turtle nests in Boca Raton were destroyed after the surf reached the dunes. Due to high surf, the beach pier at Flagler Beach was closed for about a day. Minor to moderate beach erosion caused the Florida Department of Transportation to fill in areas near the seawall with sand. One death occurred when a surfer drowned in the rough waves off the coast at New Smyrna Beach in Volusia County. Outer rainbands produced light rainfall, with the highest report in the Jacksonville National Weather Service area of responsibility totaling 0.77inches (20mm); the bands also caused tropical storm force wind gusts in the northeastern portion of the state. The winds spread smoke from local brush fires through the Tampa Bay area to Miami. High winds from Andrea were reported as fueling severe wildfires in northern Florida and southern Georgia.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{allocated}} to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung. The group's {{task was to}} transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment (139. Gebirgsjäger Regiment) and {{the headquarters of the}} 3rd Mountain Division (3. Gebirgs-Division) to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and sailed the next day. Giese fell behind the rest of Group 1 as the result of oil leaks, machinery breakdowns, and contaminated fuel oil. She fell further behind when Lieutenant Commander (Korvettenkapitän) Karl Smidt turned the ship about to recover a soldier who had <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> overboard by the high seas. Giese had little usable fuel left by this time and was forced to continue at a slower speed to conserve fuel. When the ship arrived at her destination on 9 April, she landed her troops in the Herjangsfjord (a northern branch of the Ofotfjord) to reinforce the other troops previously landed there in order to capture the Norwegian Army armory at Elvegårdsmoen. Later in the day, Erich Giese moved to Narvik harbor, but was not able to refuel before she was ordered to return to the Herjangsfjord well before dawn together with her sisters Wolfgang Zenker and Erich Koellner.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{reached over}} 10inches (250mm) {{in the coastal}} region of Jalisco, and lighter amounts of {{precipitation}} extended further to the southeast and northeast. One person was reported missing in Jalisco. The heaviest 24‑hour rainfall total {{in the state of}} Sinaloa was 8.66inches (220mm), whereas in Sonora a maximum of 4.72inches (120mm) of rain were recorded. Strong waves from the hurricane struck the Mexican mainland, with four people injured at Mazatlán when their boat washed onto rocks and was destroyed. Rainfall from the storm flooded 15communities in and around Mazatlán, and the Army assisted residents in emergency evacuations. At Los Mochis, near the point where Isis made landfall, the hurricane resulted in the destruction of 300homes, as well as in seven fatalities. Throughout the city, strong winds from the hurricane downed street posts, tree limbs, and power lines, with one person seriously injured from a downed power line. Additionally, the roof of a gas station collapsed from the winds. More than 1,200bus passengers in Sinaloa were stranded due to road closures from the hurricane, including the closure of the coastal highway in the southern portion of Sinaloa as it had <b>been</b> <b>washed</b> out due to floodwaters. Rainfall from the storm caused severe river flooding in some locations, and authorities advised those living along the Fuerte River to be prepared for a possible evacuation. The winds from Isis left about 120,000people in the municipality of Ahome without power.|$|E
