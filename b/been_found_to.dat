40|$|This study {{tested a}} {{modified}} Tripartite Influence Model with 307 men (age M = 27. 05; SD = 6. 25). Sociocultural influences (media and male peers) were predicted {{to be associated}} with both internalisation of the muscular ideal and body comparisons, which in turn were predicted {{to be associated with}} muscle dissatisfaction and then drive for muscularity behaviours. The model was only partially supported. The results suggested that, contrary to what was predicted, muscle dissatisfaction was not related to drive for muscularity behaviours. Instead, internalisation of the muscular ideal <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lead to body comparisons, which in turn <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lead to drive for muscularity behaviours. In addition, internalisation and male peer influence <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lead to muscle dissatisfaction; male peer influence and internalisation <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lead to body comparisons; and both media and male peer influences <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lead to internalisation...|$|R
