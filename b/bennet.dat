5|$|As of 30 June 1854, {{the crew}} of Albany {{consisted}} of 18 officers, 156 seaman, and 23 Marines. It is likely the ship's complement was little changed when she was lost three months later. The crew included several sons and grandsons of prominent men: Commander James T. Gerry, youngest son of Elbridge Gerry, formerly Vice President of the United States, Lieutenant John Quincy Adams, grandson of the second president and nephew of the sixth, and Midshipman <b>Bennet</b> Israel Riley, son of Brevet General <b>Bennet</b> C.

5|$|Bob Bishop confronts Noah <b>Bennet</b> (Jack Coleman), {{telling him}} that his {{daughter}} Claire <b>Bennet</b> (Hayden Panettiere) is trying to expose The Company {{and that they will}} have to take drastic measures. Claire is packing up her father's files, when her boyfriend West Rosen arrives to try and stop her from revealing his secret. Angered, she gives him his file and breaks up with him.

50|$|Other {{members of}} the <b>Bennets</b> staged by Jane Austen are, {{on the one hand}} Mrs <b>Bennet's</b> brother and sister - Mr. Gardiner and Mrs. Philips, on the other hand the {{designated}} heir of Mr. <b>Bennet's</b> estate, his distant paternal second cousin, the pompous and foolish Mr. William Collins. Mr. Gardiner and Mrs. Philips contribute significantly to the progress and outcome of the story, but at a level and in a different register reflecting their respective social belonging. Collins's character serves as a link between the gentry of Hertfordshire, to which the <b>Bennets</b> belong, and the large property owners Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Mr. Darcy.|$|R

To the delight of other writers, Beltz interrupted and said, 'if {{you want to make a}} speech, hire a hall.' <b>Bennets</b> felt that Beltz reacted too strongly and asked him to meet with the writer. He concurred and met with his critic over lunch.|$|R
