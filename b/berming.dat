40|$|Based on the {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} method, the basic characters of road engineering reinforced with back <b>berm</b> are studied. It is {{found that there}} is no influence on maximal vertical settlement and distribution of vertical settlement in the scope of original embankment by back <b>berm,</b> only the vertical settlement of foundation under back <b>berm</b> enlarged by back <b>berm.</b> The lateral displacement of embankment could be reduced by back <b>berm,</b> which reduced further by width of back <b>berm</b> enlarged. The stability of embankment increased rapidly with the width of back <b>berm</b> enlarged. But when the width of back <b>berm</b> reach a critical value, the stability of embankment is no more increased with the width of back <b>berm</b> enlarged. In order to utilize land effectively, the width of back <b>berm</b> should not be bigger than the critical value. The critical value of width of back <b>berm</b> could be calculated with the corresponding parameters of road engineering. There is almost no influence on stability of embankment by gravity of back <b>berm.</b> It is suggested to fill the back <b>berm</b> by the soil with big cohesive strength and big internal friction angle...|$|R

50|$|In 1985, {{the firm}} {{received}} international acclaim for building the energy-efficient Liberty Elementary School in Boise introduced energy-saving {{concepts such as}} solar energy and controllable electronics that took advantage of daylighting. The revolutionary design also entailed <b>berming</b> the earth {{up to the window}} sills to conserve energy needed for heating and cooling the building.|$|E
50|$|Earth is {{piled up}} against {{exterior}} walls and packed, sloping down {{away from the}} house. The roof {{may or may not}} be fully earth covered, and windows/openings may occur on one or more sides of the shelter. Due to the building being above ground, fewer moisture problems are associated with earth <b>berming</b> in comparison to underground/fully recessed construction.|$|E
50|$|Historically, earth <b>berming</b> was {{a common}} {{building}} practice that combined heavy timber framing and rough stone work with stacking thick layers of sod or peat against the walls and on the roof. This served as excellent protection from the elements. In {{a relatively short period}} of time the earth layers grow together leaving the structure with an appearance of a hill with a door.|$|E
50|$|The <b>berm</b> is the {{relatively}} planar {{part of the}} swash zone where the accumulation of sediment occurs at the landward farthest of swash motion (Figure 2). The <b>berm</b> protects the backbeach and coastal dunes from waves but erosion can occur under high energy conditions such as storms. The <b>berm</b> is more easily defined on gravel beaches and there can be multiple <b>berms</b> at different elevations. On sandy beaches in contrast, the gradient of backbeach, <b>berm</b> and beachface can be similar. The height of the <b>berm</b> is governed by the maximum elevation of sediment transport during the uprush. The <b>berm</b> height can be predicted using the equation by Takeda and Sunamura (1982)where Hb is the breaker height, g is gravity and T is the wave period.|$|R
40|$|Dredging {{is often}} {{conducted}} to maintain authorized depths in coastal navigation channels. Placement of dredged sediment {{in the form}} of nearshore <b>berms</b> is becoming an increasingly popular option for disposal. Compared to direct beach placement, nearshore <b>berms</b> have fewer environmental impacts such as shore birds and turtle nesting, and have more lenient sediment compatibility restrictions. Understanding the potential morphological and sedimentological evolution is crucial to the design of a nearshore <b>berm.</b> Furthermore, the artificial perturbation generated by the <b>berm</b> installation provides a unique opportunity to understand the equilibrium process of coastal morphodynamics. Matanzas Pass and Bowditch Point, located on the northern tip of Estero Island in west-central Florida were dredged in October 2009. The dredged material was placed approximately 600 ft offshore of Fort Myers Beach and 1. 5 miles southeast of Matanzas Pass, {{in the form of}} an artificial <b>berm.</b> Time-series surveys and sediment sampling were conducted semi-annually in order to quantify sedimentological characteristics and morphological changes within the first year after construction of the <b>berm.</b> The artificial <b>berm</b> at Fort Myers Beach is composed mainly of fine sand. Patches of mud were found throughout the study area, with the highest concentrations being in the trough landward of the <b>berm,</b> and offshore southeast of the <b>berm</b> area. The highest concentration of carbonates was found in the swash zone, as well as at the landward toe of the <b>berm,</b> which coincides with the coarsest sediment. The overall mud content of the <b>berm</b> is lower than that of the dredged sediment, thus indicating a coarsening of the <b>berm</b> over time. The reduction in fines as compared to the original dredged sedimet could also indicate a selective transport mechanism that moves finer material offshore, and coarser material landward, a desirable trend for artificial <b>berm</b> nourishment. During the course of the first year, the <b>berm</b> migrated landward and increased in elevation. Onshore migration occurred mostly within the first 6 months. Along with onshore migration, the shape of the <b>berm</b> changed from a symmetrical bell curve to an asymmetrical shape with a steep landward slope. There is no clear spatial trend of volume change alongshore within the <b>berm</b> area, indicating that sediment transport is mostly cross-shore dominated. A salient was formed landward of the northern portion of the <b>berm.</b> Several gaps were created during <b>berm</b> construction due to dredging and placement techniques. These dynamic gaps are likely maintained by rip currents through them. This study showed that the Fort Myers Beach <b>berm</b> is active, due to its landward migration during the first year after construction...|$|R

50|$|Extensive {{areas of}} the {{historic}} marsh below the high tide line are isolated from tidal influence by berms and dikes. Tidal flooding {{is limited to the}} south-central portion of the slough, extending into several of the major tributaries. Tidal amplitude in {{the upper reaches of the}} slough is diminished. During the summer months the tidal amplitude may become attenuated and eventually eliminated by progressive <b>berming</b> of the mouth. The beach berm is mechanically breached to maintain water quality in the slough.|$|E
50|$|Earthen manure storages are {{engineered}} structures {{used for}} the storage of liquid livestock manure. Generally these structures are designed so that about {{fifty percent of the}} structure is below existing grade and fifty percent is above. Certain circumstances such a high water table will require the structure to be built nearly all above grade. Conversely, it may be provident to build a deeper storage to accommodate gravity flow of the manure from a barn that is built at grade. Deeper EMSes still require some form of <b>berming</b> around them to prevent surface run-on.|$|E
50|$|In {{these early}} structures, the heavy timber framing acted as {{structural}} support and added comfort and warmth to the interior. Rough stone was often stacked along the outer walls {{with a simple}} lime mortar for structural support and often serves as an exterior facing wall and foundation. There is a greater use of stone work in earth shelter structures in areas where timber is scarce. These are the most sustainable of the earth shelters as far as materials go because {{they are able to}} decompose and return to earth. This is why there are few remaining example like Hvalsey Church in Greenland where only the stacked stones remain. One of the oldest examples of <b>berming,</b> dating back some 5,000 years, can be found at Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands off northern Scotland.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{security}} systems employ <b>berms</b> to exclude hostile vehicles and slow attackers on foot (similar {{to the military}} application without the trench). Security <b>berms</b> are common around military and nuclear facilities. An example is the <b>berm</b> proposed for Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vermont. At Baylor Ballpark, a baseball stadium {{on the campus of}} Baylor University, a <b>berm</b> is constructed down the right field line. The <b>berm</b> replaces bleachers, and general admission tickets are sold for fans who wish to sit on the grass or watch the game {{from the top of the}} hill.|$|R

40|$|Safety <b>berms</b> or windrows for haul {{roads and}} dump faces are {{currently}} designed using rules of thumb, {{such as the}} <b>berm</b> height {{must be at least}} half the diameter of the tyre of the largest vehicle travelling on site. However, the energy absorption capacity of safety <b>berms</b> is currently not known. This paper presents the results of ACARP project C 21032 “Energy absorption capacity of muck piles and their status as engineered hard barriers”. The approach combines experimental testing with numerical modelling. Full-scale experiments were conducted at two different mine sites where trucks reversed into various <b>berms.</b> The experiments allowed investigating the interaction between truck and <b>berm</b> at low reversing velocities. More extensive testing was carried out in the laboratory at a 1 : 50 scale. The latter allowed increasing the approach velocity until failure of the <b>berm</b> was observed for various approach conditions. A numerical model calibrated by using the data from the full-scale tests was finally used to corroborate the failure velocities. The results clearly highlighted the effect of the <b>berm</b> geometry and the impact conditions on the <b>berm</b> response after impact. Experimental tests and numerical investigations demonstrated that the energy absorption capacity of safety <b>berms</b> is currently overestimated. Whereas the current rule of thumb might still be applicable to dump sites where trucks travel at low velocities, it cannot be the case for haul roads, as the effectiveness of safety <b>berms</b> strongly depends on their geometry and the impact velocity of the truck...|$|R

40|$|<b>Berm</b> {{formation}} and morphological {{development of the}} beach face have been observed during a neap-neap tidal cycle on the gently sloping and accreting beach at Vejers, Denmark. During the field campaign, an intertidal bar migrated onshore and stabilized as a <b>berm</b> on the foreshore. A new intertidal bar occurred on the lower beach face, migrated onshore on the rising tide and finally merged with the pre-existing <b>berm.</b> As the tide continued to rise, the new <b>berm</b> translated further onshore as an intertidal bar to the uppermost part of the foreshore. The sediment transport during the <b>berm</b> transition was onshore directed in the upper swash and offshore directed in the lower swash. This <b>berm</b> development can be described through both the neap-berm, ridge-and-runnel and berm-ridge development concepts proposed by Hine (Sedimentology 1979; 26 : 333 - 351), and all three stages were observed during only three tidal cycles. The main factors controlling this fast transformation were the gentle slope of the cross-shore profile, rapid water level translation rates, substantial swash overtopping of the <b>berm,</b> and low infiltration rates. Despite the onshore migration of intertidal bars and <b>berm</b> formation, no net foreshore accretion {{took place during the}} field campaign.

40|$|The dogwood borer, Synanthedon scitula (Harris), is a {{relatively}} new pest problem on apples. Larvae feed principally in burr knots on the above-ground portion of clonal rootstocks. According to a survey of 33 orchards on dwarf or semidwarf apple root-stocks, about 70 % of the trees had burr knots. The tendency to develop burr knots was similar among the rootstocks examined in this survey. The proportion of trees infested with dogwood borer in an orchard ranged from 0 to 100 % and averaged 30 %. The dogwood borer overwinters in the larval stage (2 nd to 6 th instar) and pupates in the feeding tunnel. Emergence and pheromone-trap records indicate 1 generation a year. In western New York, adults begin to emerge in mid-June, peak in mid-July, and continue to emerge through September. In several tests conducted over a 3 -year period, chlorpyrifos at 180 g/ 100 L provided the most consistent control. At this rate a single spray timed to first or peak egg hatch was as effective as 2 sprays.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2017 Global {{climate change}} is largely caused by {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from anthropogenic sources. The building industry is responsible for over 40 % of global carbon emissions. Almost half of the energy consumption in buildings is from space heating and cooling. The incorporation of energy efficiency in homes has a large potential to mitigate future climate change impacts {{while at the same}} time aiding household members to adapt to the effects of global change. This dissertation explores this potential in Alaska, where in addition to climate change impacts, residents are vulnerable to high oil prices affecting not only their energy security, but also their health, food security, and sense of place. This interdisciplinary dissertation explores the viability of Alaskan energy-efficient homes from social, economic, and environmental perspectives. In the following chapters, I first use a conceptual model of energy security that is adopted from the food security literature to determine that a significant segment of Alaska is in an energy-insecure state. This is predominantly due to expensive fuel, overreliance on fuel imports, inefficient uses of heating fuel, and a legacy of inefficient homes. Next, I provide a historical survey of Alaskan homes from pre-contact dwellings to modern era homes. Some of the pre-contact homes' energy efficiency features have been reintroduced in some modern homes, such as a small square-foot-to-occupant ratio, passive solar design, arctic entrance, round or octagonal building layout, using earth <b>berming,</b> sand dunes, and snow banks as natural insulation, permafrost lined cellars, subterranean building style, thermal mass, and shared stone walls between rooms. Third, I discuss interviews conducted with homeowners of highly energy-efficient homes and other stakeholders in the building-, real estate- and financing industry, which reveal several barriers to the adoption of this building style innovation. The predominant barriers are lack of information and education on this building style by homeowners, designers, and builders; economic disincentive due to a low appraisal value; and a psychological mindset resisting change. Finally, I use a case study of a highly energy-efficient home in Dillingham, Alaska to exemplify the carbon payback point. Using a life cycle assessment approach, I calculated that within 3. 3 years the highly energy-efficient house has reached carbon parity when compared to a conventional counterpart house. Collectively, I build on these findings to recommend improvements in education about the benefits of energy efficiency, an overhaul of the appraisal system, and a careful consideration of the psychological aspects of embracing innovations in an effort to facilitate wider adoption of highly energy-efficient homes in Alaska...|$|E
