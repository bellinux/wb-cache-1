60|$|Poor Florence Burton {{was short}} of stature, was <b>brown,</b> <b>meagre,</b> and poor-looking. So said Harry Clavering to himself. Her small band, though soft, lacked that wondrous charm of touch which Julia's possessed. Her face was short, and her forehead, {{though it was}} broad and open, had none of that {{feminine}} command which Julia's look conveyed. That Florence's eyes were very bright--bright and soft as well, he allowed; and her dark brown hair was very glossy; but she was, on the whole, a mean-looking little thing. He could not, as {{he said to himself}} on his return home, avoid the comparison, as she was the first girl he had seen since he had parted from Julia Brabazon.|$|E

60|$|I don’t {{know how}} he meant it, but at that moment, slim and elegant, he seemed a mere bundle of nerves himself, with the flitting {{expressions}} on his thin, well-bred face, with the restlessness of his <b>meagre</b> <b>brown</b> hands amongst the objects on the table. With some pipe ash amongst a little spilt wine his forefinger traced a capital R. Then he looked into an empty glass profoundly. I have a notion that I sat there staring and listening like a yokel at a play. Mills’ pipe was lying quite a foot away in front of him, empty, cold. Perhaps he had no more tobacco. Mr. Blunt assumed his dandified air—nervously.|$|R
60|$|With {{his head}} uncovered, the silver top-knot of his brushed-up hair {{completed}} {{the character of}} his physiognomy, all bony ridges and sunken hollows, clothed in a perfect impassiveness of expression. His <b>meagre</b> <b>brown</b> hands emerging from large white cuffs came and went breaking bread, pouring wine, and so on, with quiet mechanical precision. His head and body above the tablecloth had a rigid immobility. This firebrand, this great agitator, exhibited the least possible amount of warmth and animation. His voice was rasping, cold, and monotonous in a low key. He could not be called a talkative personality; but with his detached calm manner he appeared as ready to keep the conversation going as to drop it at any moment.|$|R

50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> {{is between}} 30 to 40 cm in length but can grow to 60 cm. It has a flat belly and its {{strongly}} arched back which {{give it an}} easily recognisable shape, the body is laterally compressed and the large, horizontal mouth reaches {{the level of the}} eye and contains villiform teeth. The anal and pelvic fins are black with an anterior white border. Both dorsal fins and the truncate caudal fin, are yellow with a black border. The body is grey with flashes of gold and silver. The scales are cteniod on the nape and the body while the head scales are cycloid.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> {{is found}} at depths between 5m and 200m, mainly over rocky and sandy {{substrates}} {{and the young}} enter estuarine environments. It is a rather nocturnal fish but it can occasionally be found during the day among beds of sea grass and on rocky bottoms {{in the vicinity of}} caves or large crevices where it can shelter. This species is social and lives in small groups. It feeds off the small fishes and crustaceans. They are capable of creating sound using some muscles under their well developed swim bladder. This is their way of communication since they have a very good hearing ability. They can manage their buoyancy perfectly. The spawning period is from March to August in the Mediterranean.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> Sciaena umbra, {{an iconic}} {{demersal}} fish species in Mediterranean coastal habitats, is {{particularly vulnerable to}} fishing pressure and presents a worrying population decline. Fish numbers and sizes were surveyed by visual census at Scandola (Corsica) in and outside reserve zones subject to increasing levels of protection, including unprotected zones (UP) where all fishing activities are permitted, buffer zones (BZ) subject to partial protection and a totally protected no-take integral reserve zone (IR). The numerical abundance, individual size and biomass of the <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> were found to increase with levels of reserve protection. The abundance of the larger size classes and the numbers of fish per shoal were significantly lower in unprotected zones. A comparison with similar censuses performed in 1983 showed a significant increase of S. umbra abundance in IR, but no difference in UP. That increasing levels of protection resulted in increased abundance and biomass of the <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> suggested a prominent role of fishing, particularly spearfishing, activities in the persistence of its low abundance in the unprotected zones. As a consequence, protective action for the <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> (including a ban on both spearfishing and recreational hook-and-line fishing) has been introduced in France since January 2014...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{biology of}} the <b>brown</b> <b>meagre,</b> Sciaena umbra, is {{described}} based on 171 specimens caught by trammel nets and spear gun from April 1998 to October 2000. Histological examination and gonadosomatic index {{suggest that the}} spawning season of the <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> in Balearic waters is from May to August and peaks in May and June. Seven stages of gonadal development were identified: immature, early developing, late developing, running, spent, recovering and resting. The frequency distribution of oocyte diameter reveals that <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> is an iteroparous, gonochoristic, seasonal multiple-spawning fish with aynchronous oocyte development. Size at first maturity was 25. 4 cm of total length for males and 29. 9 cm for females. Sex ratio varied with fish size, with a tendency for greater numbers of females in higher size classes. Weight-length relationships for both sexes, {{as well as for}} the total population, were significantly allometric positive. An analysis of the monthly variations of hepatosomatic index (HSI), and Le Cren’s condition factor showed that HSI is not a good indicator of the lipid reserves of S. umbra. According to our results, current management measures for this species should be re-evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Cleaning {{interactions}} between the wrasse Symphodus melanocercus and <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> Sciaena umbra are documented from observations whilst free diving on a shallow rocky reef in the central Mediterranean Sea. Cleaning events occurred at cleaning stations mainly during the morning and gradually decreased in the evening. The body parts mostly cleaned were the opercular region and the fins, possibly as gnathiid isopods preferentially attach to these areas...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} patterns exhibited by wild <b>brown</b> <b>meagre,</b> Sciaena umbra, during the sexual resting period were determined using an array of omnidirectional acoustic receivers. In mid-October 2010, four individuals were tagged using internal acoustic tags and released into their natural habitat. Fish were monitored for up to 70 days within the array of the acoustic receivers. The results provided proof {{for a variety of}} aspects of the behavioural biology of this species, including strong site-fidelity and low levels of mobility. No temporal patterns related to the diel phase were observed, nor was there any significant difference between the means of detection during the day or night. The observations on the use of space also suggest that the <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> is a sedentary species with a very limited adult dispersal capacity, spending much of its time within a small home range area (< 1 km 2). However, a larger space was used during the night, suggesting an increase in fish activity. This study also provides recommendations for further research on {{spatial and temporal}} patterns over lengthy time periods and in different behavioural states such as during the spawning season. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.

40|$|Many studies {{stress the}} {{usefulness}} of fish calls as effective indicators of distinct species occurrence. However, most of these studies have been undertaken in a given area and during restricted periods of time. There {{is a need to}} show passive acoustic monitoring is a reliable method to study vocal species over space and time. This study aims to use passive acoustic methods to follow the <b>brown</b> <b>meagre</b> Sciaena umbra at relevant temporal and spatial scales. Specimens of S. umbra were recorded in both aquarium and in the field. In situ recordings were made at two regions (Corsica and Sardinia) during four summers (2008 – 2012 – 2013 – 2015). Temporal and frequency parameters of the fish calls were collected by different teams and compared to test the ability to unequivocally identify the fish sound. The comparison between our data and the bibliography highlights the capability to identify S. umbra during a period of 17 years in different Mediterranean regions, clearly supporting {{the usefulness of}} acoustic monitoring to discover and protect aggregation sites of this endangered species. The sound producing mechanism in S. umbra consists of high-speed sonic muscles surrounding dorsally the posterior end of the swim bladder, which can explain the low acoustic variability that helps in the species identification. Similar mechanisms are found in other Sciaenidae, suggesting that a similar conclusion can be drawn for many other adult sciaenids that could be used as sentinel species. This study should be of high interest to policymakers and scientists because it shows passive acoustic can be confidently used in resource management. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) -based assay to detect nervous necrosis virus (NNV) in fish was developed by using two sets of primers designed on a highly conserved region of the coat protein gene encoded by RNA 2 of NNV. The first pair of primers amplified a fragment of 605 bp by one-step reverse-transcription (RT) -PCR, while the second pair amplified an internal segment of 255 bp by nested PCR. Addition of nested PCR increased the assay sensitivity 100 -fold when carried out in a separate tube (two-step assay) and 10 -fold when performed in the same tube (one-step assay). The sensitivity of the two-step assay was 104 times {{higher than that of}} virus cultivation. Nested PCR served also to confirm the specificity of the first amplification, as verified also by Southern hybridization analysis and direct sequencing. In species known to be susceptible to infection, such as European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, and gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, NNV was often detectable in brain tissue by RT-PCR alone but only by the two-step assay in blood, sperm, ovarian tissue or larvae. The same was true for sperm and ovarian tissue of shi drum, Umbrina cirrosa. NNV was also detected in the brains of Japanese red seabream, Pagrus major and <b>brown</b> <b>meagre,</b> Sciaena umbra, suggesting that these species can also be infected. No NNV was detected in samples of Artemia salina nauplii and rotifers obtained from a fish farm with an NNV outbreak. The inclusion of nested PCR in the assay appears to be necessary to screen out NNV-positive broodfish by blood sampling and testing of their larval progeny...|$|E
