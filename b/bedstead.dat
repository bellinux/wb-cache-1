The mutilated remains of a woman were lying two-thirds over, towards the edge of the <b>bedstead,</b> nearest the door. Deceased had only an under-linen garment upon her, and by subsequent examination I am sure the body had been removed, after the injury which caused death, from that side of the <b>bedstead</b> which was nearest to the wooden partition previously mentioned. The large quantity of blood under the <b>bedstead,</b> the saturated condition of the palliasse, pillow, and sheet at the top corner of the <b>bedstead</b> nearest to the partition leads me {{to the conclusion that the}} severance of the right carotid artery, which was the immediate cause of death, was inflicted while the deceased was lying at the right side of the <b>bedstead</b> and her head and neck in the top right-hand corner".|$|E

Needy negro squatters, living around the forts, have built themselves shanties of the officers' quarters, pulled out the abatis for firewood, made cord wood or joists out of the log platforms for the guns, and sawed up the great flag-staffs into quilting poles or <b>bedstead</b> posts. ...

500|$|By March 1873, Ellen was {{believed}} to be suffering from starvation. At first, she had largely subsisted on port, tea and milk, given three times per day. After about 15months—while her mother was attempting to administer arrowroot—Ellen's jaw locked closed. Subsequently, according to Hayman, she was fed [...] "wine, gruel and other things" [...] using the [...] "spout of a toy teapot inserted between two broken teeth". The Daily Telegraph journalist expanded on Ellen's feeding: [...] "The feeding implements stand on a little table {{by the side of the}} stump <b>bedstead,</b> and, at first sight, give you the idea that they are toys placed there to attract her attention should she, by a merciful termination of her trance, presently awake to life. The toys in question are two tiny 'teapots', each not much larger than a full-sized walnut and holding four small teaspoonfuls. One of these is filled with port wine, and the other with milk... this quantity of liquid nourishment... cannot weigh more than half an ounce..." [...] At this time, it was considered [...] "manifestly out of the question to think of moving her". How the family dealt with Ellen's passing of urine and faeces is unclear, but in 1880, Hayman said that Ann Frewen told him that no bowel movements had occurred for five years, and that approximately every four days [...] "a somewhat large amount would pass from the bladder".|$|E

500|$|As {{she arrived}} at the court Canning was cheered by the large crowd {{gathered}} outside the building. [...] Inside, she testified that she was taken by two men [...] "to the prisoner Wells's house" [...] at about 4am on the morning of 2January. [...] In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her [...] "if I chose to go their way". [...] Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. [...] She told the court she [...] "saw nothing brought uphen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor <b>bedstead,</b> nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". [...] She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window {{at the north end of}} the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. [...] She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. [...] When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. [...] Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. [...] Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: [...] "Because I thought they might let me out; it never came into my head till that [...] morning." [...] Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted [...] "I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks".|$|E

50|$|In the 15th century beds {{became very}} large, {{reaching}} 7 to 8 ft by 6 to 7 ft. The mattresses were often filled with pea-shucks, straw, or feathers.

2500|$|Unlike {{other women}} of her time, Elisabeth used little {{cosmetics}} or perfume, as {{she wished to}} showcase her natural beauty, but she tested countless beauty products prepared in the court pharmacy, or prepared by a lady-in-waiting in her own apartments, to preserve it. Although one favorite, [...] "Crème Céleste", was compounded from white wax, spermaceti, sweet almond oil, and rosewater; she attached far less importance to creams and emollients, and experimented {{with a wide variety}} of facial tonics and waters, from which she apparently expected more results. Elisabeth slept without a pillow on a metal <b>bedstead,</b> all the better to retain her upright posture, with either raw veal or crushed strawberries lining her nightly leather facial mask. She was heavily massaged and often slept with cloths soaked in either violet- or cider-vinegar above her hips to preserve her slim waist, and her neck was wrapped with cloths soaked in Kummerfeld-toned washing water. To further preserve her skin tone, she took both a cold shower every morning (which in later years aggravated her arthritis) and an olive oil bath in the evening.|$|E
2500|$|Hatshepsut {{had begun}} {{construction}} of a tomb when she was the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, but the scale of this was not suitable for a pharaoh, so when she ascended the throne, preparation for another burial started. For this, KV20, originally quarried for her father, Thutmose I, and probably the first royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings, was extended with a new burial chamber. Hatshepsut also refurbished the burial of her father and prepared for a double interment of both Thutmose I and her within KV20. It is likely, therefore, that when she died (no later than the twenty-second year of her reign), she was interred in this tomb along with her father. During the reign of Thutmose III, however, a new tomb, (KV38), together with new burial equipment was provided for Thutmose I, who then was removed from his original tomb and re-interred elsewhere. At the same time Hatshepsut's mummy might have been moved into the tomb of her nurse, Sitre In, in KV60. It is possible that Amenhotep II, son to Thutmose III by a secondary wife, was the one motivating these actions {{in an attempt to}} assure his own uncertain right to succession. Besides what was recovered from KV20 during Howard Carter's clearance of the tomb in 1903, other funerary furniture belonging to Hatshepsut has been found elsewhere, including a lioness [...] "throne" [...] (<b>bedstead</b> is a better description), a senet game board with carved lioness-headed, red-jasper game pieces bearing her pharaonic title, a signet ring, and a partial shabti figurine bearing her name. In the Royal Mummy Cache at DB320, a wooden canopic box with an ivory knob was found that was inscribed with the name of Hatshepsut and contained a mummified liver or spleen as well as a molar tooth. There was a royal lady of the twenty-first dynasty of the same name, however, and for a while it was thought possible that it could have belonged to her instead.|$|E
