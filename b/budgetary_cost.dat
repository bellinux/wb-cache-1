A fiscally conservative approach was supported by Wall Street and local investors and most of the business community; mainstream academic economists believed in it, as apparently did the majority of the public. Conservative southern Democrats, who favored balanced budgets and opposed new taxes, controlled Congress and its major committees. Even liberal Democrats at the time regarded balanced budgets as essential to economic stability in the long run, although they were more willing to accept short-term deficits. As Zelizer notes, public opinion polls consistently showed public opposition to deficits and debt. Throughout his terms, Roosevelt recruited fiscal conservatives to serve in his Administration, most notably Lewis Douglas the Director of Budget in 1933–1934, and Henry Morgenthau Jr., Secretary of the Treasury from 1934 to 1945. They defined policy in terms of <b>budgetary</b> <b>cost</b> and tax burdens rather than needs, rights, obligations, or political benefits. Personally the President embraced their fiscal conservatism. Politically, he realized that fiscal conservatism enjoyed a strong wide base of support among voters, leading Democrats, and businessmen.

The use of nominal exchange rates introduces a bias for international price comparisons and in calculations based on them.

We show that calculations of agricultural price distortions, protection rates and <b>budgetary</b> <b>costs</b> of EU-CEEC accession {{are sensitive to the}} exchange rate assumptions. More specifically, our simulations of EU-CEEC integration effects show that net exports are substantially smaller and <b>budgetary</b> <b>costs</b> less under the assumption of continued real appreciation of the CEC- 4 currencies.

Generally, the car parking is free, with revenue for the scheme being achieved through fares or travel passes taken by the bus operator. Initially heavily lobbied for by the environmentalists, increasingly the net benefits of park and ride schemes to the environment have been questioned in studies examining the effect of schemes on overall vehicle mileages and passenger travelling behaviour.|$|E

Our results show that the buyback of groundwater pumping rights is the option with the greatest public <b>budgetary</b> <b>cost</b> and economic impact. On the contrary, the combination of an environmental tax on groundwater pumping and the substitution of groundwater by subsidised desalinised water allow eliminating aquifer overdraft in the area while minimising the public <b>budgetary</b> <b>cost</b> and {{the economic impact}} on the agricultural sector.

Conventional wisdom suggests that, {{by lowering}} the <b>budgetary</b> <b>cost</b> of the military, a draft reduces distortionary taxation, especially when military needs are large. We study conscription in a private-information economy with heterogeneous civilian and military productivities. We show that voluntary enlistments leave more high-income earners in the civilian sector, leading to a larger tax base. When income taxes are set optimally, voluntary enlistments lead to less distortionary taxation than a draft.

40|$|The low-income country {{debt crisis}} had {{its origins in}} weak {{macroeconomic}} policies, and official creditors’ willingness to take risks unacceptable to private lenders. Payments problems were initially addressed through nonconcessional reschedulings and new lending that maximized financing while containing the <b>budgetary</b> <b>costs</b> for creditors. This led to an unsustainable buildup in debt stocks. More recently, debt ratios have improved, reflecting both adjustment and substantial debt relief. The paper estimates debt relief initiatives since 1988 have cost creditors at least $ 30 billion, and possibly much more. This compares with the estimated costs of about $ 27 billion under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. ...|$|R

We endogenize the economic and <b>budgetary</b> <b>costs</b> of different government policies and show that, early in transition, governments ought to subsidize state firms. Provided that inter-temporal commitment is feasible, this policy limits the initial output fall, which relaxes capital accumulation constraints, accelerates transition, and increases welfare. Moreover, by resorting to indirect — instead of direct — taxes, governments can bring the path of transition closer to the first best. Yet, political pressures may induce a policy of excessive subsidization. subsidies; transition...|$|R
