2500|$|Meles Zenawi's {{administration}} {{was the first}} to introduce private press in Ethiopia. However, he has been under fire often for imprisonment of journalists and lately for some website censorship. The Meles government defends its action on the ground that the banned media outlets advocated [...] "a certain population should be quarantined" [...] and incited [...] "violence among different ethnic groups in the country," [...] including using hate-filled text messages on mobile phones asking people to attack ethnic groups. Some sources blame certain websites and papers who have been caught inciting violence and asking for bombings on companies. A couple of them have even been sued for provoking uprising. Others claim that the supporters of the previous dictatorship government are trying to use the new opportunity to freely express themselves by defaming the current government officials. But the government critics say that the ruling party is not willing to be criticised. Many reports of international organizations support their claim. Strong criticism came from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). In its 2007 press freedom summary it wrote, [...] "Ethiopia [...] the world's worst <b>backslider</b> on press freedom over the previous five years". At the start of 2010, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that an Ethiopian journalist has been jailed for a year for criticising Meles.|$|E

But the <b>backslider</b> is worse, he proclaims, in his downward course, the awful blasphemy that 'sin is better than Christ'; 'hell is preferable to heaven.'

For what you have urged as yet, from the New Testament, is nothing but consequences drawn from this text. Indeed it is a full text for carnal ignorant sinners that come, but to me, who am a <b>backslider,</b> it yieldeth but little relief.|$|E

A declaration of readiness to receive them that come, as here in the text, and in many other places, is plain. Therefore, [...] "Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps," [...] of the golden grace of the gospel, [...] "set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest."
