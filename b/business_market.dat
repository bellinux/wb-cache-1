5|$|By {{the end of}} 1998, {{it became}} clear that Braathens had {{increased}} capacity by 20%, but only achieved a 5.2% ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. The <b>business</b> <b>market,</b> in particular the large corporations with divisions in several large cities, were demanding high frequencies on the routes. Color Air could get by with fewer departures because they mainly targeted the leisure segment. In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million seats annually, but only 345,000 passengers, giving a 29% cabin load. Accumulated cabin load for Color Air was 32%, with 116,176 passengers. In {{the course of the last}} quarter of 1998, Color Air lost NOK91 million, or NOK1 million each day. For the whole year, Color Air had an average ticket price of NOK453, giving a revenue of NOK 57 million.

40|$|The core {{idea of this}} Master's Thesis {{was that}} five key {{characteristics}} – market heterogeneity, sociopolitical governance, chronic shortage of resources, unbranded competition, and inadequate infrastructure – of emerging markets are radically different from the traditional industrialized capitalist society and they will require us to rethink the core assumptions of business-to-business <b>marketing,</b> such as <b>business</b> relationships, <b>marketing</b> communication elements, and digitalization. In this research, Russia {{is considered to be}} an emerging market that reflects the aforementioned theoretical characteristics. The research was a qualitative case study and furthermore a collective case study. In the beginning three digital marketing professionals were interviewed to better understand digital B 2 B marketing. The actual research data was collected through seven structured theme interviews with representatives of the case companies operating in Russia. The selection of case companies included three business consulting companies and four industrial companies. The aim of this qualitative study was to understand and clarify how <b>business</b> <b>marketing</b> exploits digital marketing methods {{as a part of the}} chosen <b>business</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy under emerging markets’ special conditions. This objective was divided in three research questions: 1) How the chosen marketing strategy reflects in the <b>business</b> <b>marketing</b> process? 2) How digital marketing communication contributes to <b>business</b> <b>marketing?</b> 3) How are the emerging markets’ characteristics reflected in the <b>business</b> <b>marketing</b> process? The main research findings indicate that digital business-to-business marketing communications can be useful and effective. Moreover, business DMC can be defined and structured in a reasonable way. The company's prevalent marketing paradigm and the chosen marketing strategy reflect in the <b>business</b> <b>marketing</b> process, and in utilizing digital marketing communications. The assumption that emerging markets set an environment with special characteristics for <b>business</b> <b>marketing</b> was supported by the study. However, the business environmental aspects were not considerably disturbing digital B 2 B marketing, but making it even more reasonable to harness in Russia...|$|R
