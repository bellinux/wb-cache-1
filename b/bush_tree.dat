5|$|The female {{song thrush}} builds a neat {{cup-shaped}} nest lined with mud and dry grass in a <b>bush,</b> <b>tree</b> or creeper, or, {{in the case}} of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple; they are typically 2.7x2.0 centimetres (0.79x1.06in) in size and weigh 6.0grammes (0.21oz), of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs alone for 10–17days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge. Two or three broods in a year is normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range. On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10years 8months.|$|E

50|$|Its main call is {{described}} as a hue-tac-tac, the 'tac' softer and less grating than that of the European stonechat; the call is used both for contact between birds and predator alarms. The male has a whistling, crackly but soft song used during the breeding season, consisting of a mixture of soft whistles, tacs and more grating sounds; it is often mimetic, including phrases from the songs of at least 12 other assorted bird species. It sings from a fence, <b>bush,</b> <b>tree</b> or wire, or occasionally from the ground or in flight, between about April and July. On the wintering grounds, it often gives alarm calls but only occasionally sings, being most likely to do so at the end of winter, when starting spring migration.|$|E

50|$|The nest, {{built by}} the female in a <b>bush,</b> <b>tree</b> or on a building, is a large roofed {{structure}} of stems and straw, which for protection is often built near a wasp, bee or ant nest, or the nest of another tyrant flycatcher, such as the similar social flycatcher, Myiozetetes similis. The nest site is often near or over water. The typical clutch is two to four brown or lilac-blotched dull white eggs, laid between February and June.In appearance the grey-capped flycatcher resembles the social flycatcher, which shares much of its range. The adult grey-capped flycatcher is 16.5-18 cm long and weighs 26-30 g. The head is grey with a short weak eyestripe and, in the male, a concealed vermilion crown stripe. The upperparts are olive-brown, and the wings and tail are brown with only faint rufous fringes. The underparts are yellow and the throat is white. Young birds have no crown stripe, and have chestnut fringes to the wing and tail feathers. The best distinction from the social flycatcher is the latter’s strong black-and white head pattern.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve in}} the Andean has {{vegetation}} consisting of tropical alpine herbs with dwarf shrubs {{of the forests}} of Polylepis. Plant and tree species are reportedly about 190 species, in the harsh terrain, which have emerged given the conditions of salinity, lack of fresh water, low temperatures, and scarcity of nutrients. Flora restricted to this and other ecoregions include the genera Barneoudia, Hexaptera, Nototriche, Pycnophyllum and Werneria. The vegetation {{is characterized by the}} strong presence of pasture grass (straw) such as Peruvian feather grass (Stipa ichu) in some plains and hillsides. The important plant species on which people are dependent for fuel wood in the area is yareta, which grows in the forest of the reserve at 1 - 3 mm per year amidst rocky terrain. This hardwood tree, which looks like a foamy bubble bath but is as hard as stone, grows slowly, attaining a height of about 5 ft in height with girth of 10 ft and can be as old as 3000 years. In places with higher humidity, Tola or Thola (Parastrephia lepidophylla), Quinoa and Kenua <b>bush</b> <b>tree</b> are found. The villagers use vegetation as fuel for heating and cooking.|$|E

The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10 years 8 months.The song thrush is occasionally a host of parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo, but this is very rare because the thrush recognizes the cuckoo's non-mimetic eggs. However, the song thrush does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult cuckoo that is shown by the blackbird. The introduced birds in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, have, over the past 130 years, retained the ability to recognise and reject non-mimetic eggs.|$|E

A set of features is extracted from labeled images to train a number of stochastic classifiers. The outputs of the classifiers are then combined in a meta-classifier to produce the final result.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} our {{experiments and}} analysis of the electrical tree growing characteristics. The relationship between electrical tree propagation and the material morphology in XLPE cable insulation has been studied by researching the structure and growth characteristics of a double structure electrical tree. It has been found that, due to the influence of uneven congregating state, difference in crystalline structure, and the existence of residual stress in semi-crystalline polymer, five types of electrical tree structures (branch, bush, bine-branch, pine-branch, and mixed configurations) would propagate in XLPE cable insulation. Three basic treeing propagation phases (initiation, stagnation, and rapid propagating phases) are presented in electrical tree propagating process. If initiation phase is very active, the single branch tree will propagate while if this phase is weak then the <b>bush</b> <b>tree</b> will occur more easily. There would be a clear double structure of electrical tree when it grows at submicroscopic structure uneven region of the material. A new parameter, the expansion coefficient is introduced to describe the electrical tree propagation characteristics. In addition, two other coefficients being used to describe our experimental results are dynamic fractal dimension and growth rate of electrical tree...|$|E
