40|$|Chaperonin {{action is}} {{controlled}} by cycles of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Here, we {{examine the effects of}} nucleotide binding on an archaeal group 2  chaperonin. In contrast to the ordered apo state of the group 1 chaperonin GroEL, the unliganded form of the homo- 16 -mer Methanococcus maripaludis group 2 chaperonin is very open and flexible, with intersubunit contacts only in the central double <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> <b>equatorial</b> domains. The intermediate and apical domains are free of contacts and deviate significantly from the overall 8 -fold symmetry. Nucleotide binding results in three distinct, ordered 8 -fold symmetric conformations—open, partially closed, and fully closed. The partially closed ring encloses a 40 % larger volume than does the GroEL-GroES folding chamber, enabling it to encapsulate proteins up to 80 kDa, in contrast to the fully closed form, whose cavities are 20 % smaller than those of the GroEL-GroES chamber...|$|R
40|$|We have {{obtained}} high-resolution spectroscopy, optical interferometry, and long-term broad band photometry of the ellipsoidal primary of the RS CVn-type binary system zeta And. Based on the optical interferometry the apparent limb darkened diameter of zeta And is 2. 55 +/- 0. 09 mas using a uniform disk fit. The Hipparcos distance and the limb-darkened diameter obtained with a uniform disk fit give stellar radius of 15. 9 +/- 0. 8 Rsolar, and combined with bolometric luminosity, it implies an effective temperature of 4665 +/- 140 K. The temperature maps obtained from high resolution spectra using Doppler imaging show a strong <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> <b>equatorial</b> spots and hints of a cool polar cap. The equatorial spots show a concentration around the phase 0. 75. This spot configuration {{is reminiscent of}} the one seen in the earlier published temperature maps of zeta And. Investigation of the Halpha line reveals both prominences and cool clouds in the chromosphere. Long-term photometry spanning 12 years shows hints of a spot activity cycle, which is also implied by the Doppler images, but the cycle length cannot be reliably determined from the current data.

The great Demon of the sea had seized upon and held him with unwonted avidity and perseverance. It appeared to regard him as fair game--as one whose life had been largely devoted to ploughing up its peculiar domain--or rather, inducing others to plough there--and who was therefore worthy of special attention. At all events, the wealthy merchant did not appear above-board until the lapse of two weeks after leaving his native land. At {{the end of that}} period something like the ghost of him crawled on deck one rather fine day, but a demoniac squall rudely sent him below, where he remained until those charming regions <b>of</b> the <b>Equatorial</b> <b>calms</b> were entered. Here a bad likeness--a sort of spoiled photograph--of him again made its appearance, and lay down helplessly on a mattress, or smiled with pathetic sarcasm when food was offered. But soon the calm regions were passed; the Cape of Storms was doubled, and the fierce [...] "south-easters" [...] of the Indian seas were encountered, during which period Mr Hazlit passed away, as {{one of the things that}} had been, from the memory of all on board, with the exception of Aileen, the captain, the bed-room steward, and a Christian pastor, who, with his amiable wife, had done much during the voyage for their fellow-passengers.|$|R
30|$|The amplitudes of MI at HUA, ASC, AAE, TIR, and GUA are 50, 23, 40, 23, and 23 nT, respectively. It is {{interesting}} to note that the amplitude of the MI at ASC, which is near magnetic noon (at 11 : 00 MLT), has an amplitude of much less than that at 07 : 00 MLT and at 14 : 40 MLT. However, this can be justified through the dip latitude of ASC, which is quite high (approximately 25 ° S), and hence it is located quite far from the dip equator and experiences very small ionospheric conductivity compared to the equatorial Cowling conductivity. While comparing the observations in a narrow <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equatorial</b> zone, it is necessary to bear in mind that the Cowling conductivity gradients in the vicinity of the magnetic equator are very sharp, resulting in large amplitude differences within a few degrees of latitude. The geomagnetic latitude of HUA is 2.1 °N, which is closer to the geomagnetic equator than AAE (5.36 °N GMlat). Shinbori et al. (2009) found that the daytime enhancement of the normalized SI amplitude at 5 ° away from the magnetic equator (GAM) has a peak amplitude of less than half the value of that is found close to the magnetic equator (YAP). From their Figure one, at 07 : 00 MLT, YAP had a normalized amplitude of 1.5, which was comparable with that at near noon at GAM. It is therefore quite possible that the present observation of the larger MI amplitude at 07 : 00 MLT could be due to the fact that HUA is located closer to the geomagnetic equator than AAE. Thus, in view of the magnetic latitudes of the observatories, the differences in the MI amplitudes could be due to the sharp latitudinal gradients of Cowling conductivity in a narrow <b>belt</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equatorial</b> region. Further, the dip latitudes of HUA and TIR are almost same (both situated close to the dip equator) and are located near dawn and dusk respectively. A comparison of the MI amplitude at these two locations reveals larger MI amplitude at the near-dawn station, HUA, than that at the near-dusk station, TIR.|$|R
