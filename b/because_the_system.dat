5|$|In 1913, a huge {{general strike}} took place {{across the country}} at the {{instigation}} of the Belgian Workers' Party on the issue of voting rights. The system of plural voting, in force since 1893, was extremely unpopular because of its perceived unfairness, but also <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> tended to favor the Catholic Party. Although between 300,000 and 450,000 workers were involved, the strike was ultimately unsuccessful. The party voted in favor ending the strike and taking future action by parliamentary means, on 22 April 1913.|$|E
5|$|Any initial two {{disjoint}} given circles can {{be rendered}} concentric as follows. The radical {{axis of the}} two given circles is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, two circles can be constructed that are centered on P and Q and that intersect the two given circles orthogonally. These two constructed circles intersect each other in two points. Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the two given circles into concentric circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> of circles is equivalent {{to a set of}} Apollonian circles, forming a bipolar coordinate system.|$|E
5|$|Contracting out to {{independent}} studios, Philips subsequently used the characters to create three {{games for the}} CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on {{the look of the}} characters based on the artwork from Nintendo's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets. Philips insisted that the development studios utilize all aspects of the CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, and graphics.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Rafael {{produced}} {{minor damage}} in the northeastern Caribbean Sea in mid-October2012. The seventeenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Rafael originated from a tropical wave roughly 230mi (370km) south-southeast of Saint Croix on October12; <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> already contained tropical storm-force winds, it skipped tropical depression status. Though initially disorganized due to moderate wind shear, a subsequent decrease allowed for shower and thunderstorm activity to develop in earnest by October14. While moving north-northwestward the following morning, Rafael intensified into a Category1 hurricane. A cold front off the East Coast of the United States caused the system to turn northward and eventually northeastward by October16, at which time Rafael attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90mph (150km/h). As the cyclone entered a more stable atmosphere and tracked across increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures, it began extratropical transition, a process the system completed by the following afternoon.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|PC Magazine {{found that}} the {{firewall}} put all ports in stealth mode. The firewall blocked ten of 12 leak tests, used to see if malware can evade the firewall's control of network traffic. Previous versions did not identify the tests because none carried a malicious payload. Another test was conducted using Core Impact, which successfully exploited one vulnerability on the test computer. However, other components of Norton stopped the exploit from causing harm. The other attempts were unsuccessful either <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was invulnerable or Norton's Intrusion Prevention System stopped it. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful by PC Magazine. On the contrary, PC Pro identified 15 open ports on a computer with Norton installed.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} little focus on {{expansion}} of the system <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{was in a state}} of disrepair, and funds were allocated to rebuilding and repairing the existing system. However, in the 1990s, with the system in better shape, the construction of the Second Avenue Subway was looked into again. Construction of the Second Avenue Subway started in 2007, and the first phase was completed in 2017. Since the 1990s, public officials and organizations such as the Regional Plan Association have pushed for the further expansion of the system. Projects such as the TriboroRx, a circumferential line connecting the outer boroughs, the reuse of the Rockaway Beach Branch, and the further expansion of the Second Avenue Subway have all been proposed, albeit unfunded.|$|E
5|$|After moving ashore, Sandy {{continued}} {{moving to}} the west, weakening below hurricane force {{by the time it}} reached Pennsylvania. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was non-tropical, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) – known at the time as the Hydrometeorogical Prediction Center (HPC) – took over the responsibility of issuing advisories on the low. The remnants of Sandy brought heavy snow and high winds to the central Appalachian Mountains, resulting in blizzard warnings being issued. The system continued to weaken as it moved across western Pennsylvania, and by 0300UTC on October31, the storm's movement had shifted to the northwest. Blizzard conditions continued in the Appalachians, bringing more snow to the region that had already seen high amounts the day before. By 0900UTC on October31, the circulation degenerated into a trough of low pressure, with no discernible center of low pressure. Later that day, the remnants of Sandy spread into the Great Lakes, and the WPC issued its last advisory. By the time the system had moved out of the region, nearly three feet of snow had fallen in some areas of West Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, with lesser amounts elsewhere in the region. During the next two days, Sandy's remnants drifted northward and then northeastward over Ontario, before merging with another low pressure area over Eastern Canada, on November 2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> uses a {{mixed culture}} of microorganisms, besides not needing any enzyme addition, the {{fermentation}} requires no sterility or aseptic conditions, making this front {{step in the}} process more economical than in more popular methods for the production of cellulosic ethanol.

25|$|Rochester's {{expressway}} system, {{conceived in}} the 1950s, {{was designed as}} two concentric circles with feeder expressways from the west, south and east. The system allows for quick travel within the metropolitan area {{and a lack of}} the traffic gridlock typically found in cities of comparable size; in part this is <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was designed to accommodate an anticipated year-2000 metro population of 5 million, whereas the present-day population is just over one million.|$|E

Pre-university centres that are particularly associated with academic excellence, however, usually expect students to attain points in the single digits, to be admitted. This is <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> is merit-driven, with places given to those with lower scores first.|$|E

25|$|This {{implies that}} the number of {{singular}} points is finite as long as p(x,y) or P(x,y,z) is square free. Bézout's theorem implies thus {{that the number of}} singular points is at most (d−1)2, but this bound is not sharp <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> of equations is overdetermined. If reducible polynomials are allowed, the sharp bound is d(d−1)/2, this value being reached when the polynomial factors in linear factors, that is if the curve is the union of d lines. For irreducible curves and polynomials, the number of singular points is at most (d−1)(d−2)/2, because of the formula expressing the genus in term of the singularities (see below). The maximum is reached by the curves of genus zero whose all singularities have multiplicity two and distinct tangents (see below).|$|E
25|$|The flow of {{reactants}} {{into the}} reaction chamber and subsequent ejection {{occur in a}} series of about 70 pulses, {{at a rate of about}} 500 pulses per second. The whole sequence of events takes only a fraction of a second. These pulsations are caused by repeated microexplosions which are the results of the continuous pressure on the reservoir and the oscillatory opening and closing of the valve that controls access to the reaction chamber. This pulsed mechanism is beneficial for the beetles' survival <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> uses pressure instead of muscles to eject the spray at a constant velocity, saving the beetle energy. Also, the reintroduction of new reactants into the vestibule where enzymes are stored, reduces the temperature of the chamber, thereby protecting the peroxidases and catalases from thermal denaturation.|$|E
25|$|Aerotel's patent {{was found}} to relate to a {{patentable}} invention in principle <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{as a whole was}} new in itself, not merely because it is to be used for the business of selling phone calls. While this system could be implemented using conventional computers, the key to it was a new physical combination of hardware. The judge felt that this was clearly more than just a method of doing business as such. The method claims were construed as relating to a use of the new system and were also deemed to relate to a patentable invention in principle. The additional questions of whether the claimed invention was novel and involved an inventive step were not considered directly by the judge, although the implication is that the invention was at least novel.|$|E
30|$|Ren’s {{conclusions}} (Ren 1998) {{have suggested}} that the efficiency and functionality of a management system can be reflected using the management entropy.

25|$|Tropical Storm Bill was a {{tropical}} cyclone that produced widespread rainfall across East Texas, Oklahoma, the Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic. The second named storm of the season, Bill developed {{from a broad}} {{area of low pressure}} over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico on June16. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was already producing tropical storm force winds, it was immediately classified as Tropical Storm Bill. Initially continuing northwestward, Bill re-curved west-northwestward later on June16. Around 12:00UTC, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h). Just under five hours later, Bill made landfall near on Matagorda Island, Texas, at the same intensity. The cyclone weakened to {{a tropical}} depression and turned northward early on June17. However, possibly due to the rare brown ocean effect, Bill remained a tropical cyclone until late on June18, when it degenerated into a remnant low. The remnant low moved east-northeastward until dissipating over West Virginia on June21.|$|E
25|$|Card users {{sometimes}} {{forget to}} touch in or touch out, {{are unable to}} find the yellow readers {{or it may be}} too crowded to touch out. Such card users have either received penalty fares by revenue inspectors, been charged a maximum cash fare, or been prosecuted in courts which can issue high penalties. Card users are also penalised for touching {{in and out of the}} same station within a two-minute period. The system applies two penalty fares (one for touching in, and one for touching out) to passengers who touch in, wait more than twenty minutes for a train, but are unable to travel because there are no trains, baulk at the waiting, and touch out. This is <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> assumes that, after such a long delay, the passenger has traveled to another station where they have failed to touch out and failed to touch in, thus resulting in two penalty fares.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} two-field system, a three-field system allows for {{significantly}} more land to be put under cultivation. Even more important, the system allows for two harvests a year, reducing the risk that a single crop failure will lead to famine. Three-field agriculture creates a surplus of oats {{that can be used}} to feed horses. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> required a major rearrangement of real estate and of the social order, it took until the 11th century before it came into general use. The heavy wheeled plough was introduced in the late 10th century. It required greater animal power and promoted the use of teams of oxen. Illuminated manuscripts depict two-wheeled ploughs with both a mouldboard, or curved metal ploughshare, and a coulter, a vertical blade in front of the ploughshare. The Romans had used light, wheel-less ploughs with flat iron shares that often proved unequal to the heavy soils of northern Europe.|$|E
