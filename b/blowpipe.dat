5|$|Hydrogen was {{liquefied}} for {{the first}} time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas <b>blowpipe</b> in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.|$|E

25|$|Surviving {{physical}} evidence, such as <b>blowpipes</b> and molds {{which are}} indicative {{of the presence of}} blowing, is fragmentary and limited. Pieces of clay <b>blowpipes</b> were retrieved from the late 1st century AD glass workshop at Avenches in Switzerland. Clay <b>blowpipes,</b> also known as mouthblowers, were made by the ancient glassworkers due to the accessibility and availability of the resources before the introduction of the metal <b>blowpipes.</b> Hollow iron rods, together with blown vessel fragments and glass waste dating to approximately 4th century AD, were recovered from the glass workshop in Mérida of Spain, as well as in Salona in Croatia.|$|R

2500|$|Researchers at the Toledo Museum of Art {{attempted}} {{to reconstruct the}} ancient free-blowing technique by using clay <b>blowpipes.</b> The result proved that short clay <b>blowpipes</b> of about [...] facilitate free-blowing because they are simple to handle and to manipulate and can be re-used several times. Skilled workers are capable of shaping almost any vessel forms by rotating the pipe, swinging it and controlling {{the temperature of the}} piece while they blow. They can produce a great variety of glass objects, ranging from drinking cups to window glass.|$|R

25|$|The first {{crystalline}} artificial diamond simulants were synthetic white sapphire (Al2O3, pure corundum) and spinel (MgO·Al2O3, pure magnesium aluminium oxide). Both {{have been}} synthesized {{in large quantities}} since {{the first decade of}} the 20th century via the Verneuil or flame-fusion process, although spinel was not in wide use until the 1920s. The Verneuil process involves an inverted oxyhydrogen <b>blowpipe,</b> with purified feed powder mixed with oxygen that is carefully fed through the <b>blowpipe.</b> The feed powder falls through the oxy-hydrogen flame, melts, and lands on a rotating and slowly descending pedestal below. The height of the pedestal is constantly adjusted to keep its top at the optimal position below the flame, and over a number of hours the molten powder cools and crystallizes to form a single pedunculated pear or boule crystal. The process is an economical one, with crystals of up to 9 centimeters (3.5nbsp&inches) in diameter grown. Boules grown via the modern Czochralski process may weigh several kilograms.|$|E
25|$|Glassblowing is a glassforming {{technique}} that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble (or parison), {{with the aid}} of a <b>blowpipe</b> (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, glassmith, or gaffer. A lampworker (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of borosilicate glass.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} December, {{profiting}} from its internal lines of communications, the Ecuadorian Army had strengthened to a considerable degree its presence in the area, having deployed a number of units, foremost among them several Special Forces formations, as well as artillery and BM-21 multiple rocket launchers on the heights of the Cordillera del Cóndor. The entire Ecuadorian perimeter was covered by antiaircraft batteries and, most significantly, several teams carrying Soviet-made SA-16 Igla and British-made <b>Blowpipe</b> man-portable surface-to-air missiles.|$|E

25|$|Mold-blowing was an {{alternative}} glassblowing method that {{came after the}} invention of free-blowing, during {{the first part of}} the second quarter of the 1st century AD. A glob of molten glass is placed on the end of the <b>blowpipe,</b> and is then inflated into a wooden or metal carved mold. In that way, the shape and the texture of the bubble of glass is determined by the design on the interior of the mold rather than the skill of the glassworker.|$|E
25|$|Manser created {{notebooks}} {{that were}} richly illustrated with drawings, notes, and 10,000 photographs during his six-year stay from 1984 to 1990 with the Penan people. Some of his sketches include cicada wing patterns, how {{to carry a}} gibbon with a stick, and how drill holes on a <b>blowpipe.</b> These notebooks were later published by Christoph Merian Verlag press in Basel. Manser also created audio recordings of oral histories told by Penan elders and translated them. He claimed that the Penan people were never argumentative or violent during his time with the Penan tribe.|$|E
25|$|An {{outstanding}} {{example of}} the free-blowing technique is the Portland Vase, which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment {{was carried out by}} Gudenrath and Whitehouse with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered {{on the end of the}} <b>blowpipe</b> and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass. Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the molten glass into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of white glass overlying the blue body.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} glassblowing {{was found by}} Roman Ghirshman in Chogha Zanbil, where many glass bottles {{were found in the}} excavations of the 2nd millennium BC site. Later evidence comes from a collection of waste from a glass shop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a mikvah, a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, dated from 37 to 4 BC. Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of <b>blowpipe.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} floats, {{including most}} Japanese glass fishing floats, were handmade by a glassblower. Recycled glass, especially old sake bottles, was typically used and air bubbles {{in the glass}} {{are a result of}} the rapid recycling process. After being blown, floats were removed from the <b>blowpipe</b> and sealed with a 'button' of melted glass before being placed in a cooling oven. (This sealing button is sometimes mistakenly identified as a pontil mark. However, no pontil (or punty) was used in the process of blowing glass floats.) While floats were still hot and soft, marks were often embossed on or near the sealing button to identify the float for trademark. These marks sometimes included kanji symbols.|$|E
25|$|State of the {{opposing}} air forces at {{the outbreak of the}} crisis. The war of 1995 came at a bad moment for the Peruvian Air Force, as the economic crisis that had struck the nation in the 1980s had a negative impact on the readiness of the FAP. At the beginning of January 1995, with a crisis looming on the horizon, the FAP found itself in no shape for a major air war. Most of its fleet of modern Mirage 2000Ps interceptors, bought in the mid-1980s and the backbone of the FAP, was grounded for lack of spare parts and proper maintenance due to lack of funds. Only three Mirage 2000Ps were immediately available for active operations. Its fleet of Sukhoi Su-22 fighter-bombers was in the same situation, with some seven aircraft in flying condition; the lack of preparedness even affected the Cessna A-37B subsonic counterinsurgency and ground-attack aircraft. Although by the end of January the situation regarding operational aircraft had greatly improved, the crisis had probably left its impact on the FAP. Ecuador had also passed through a period of economic crisis of its own, but the FAE had kept in operational status a sizeable part of its fleet of Mirage F.1JAs, IAI Kfir C.2s, and SEPECAT Jaguars, with perhaps some ten Mirages, ten Kfirs, and four or six Jaguars in serviceable condition. Thus, while smaller in total number of planes, the FAE of January 1995 felt qualitatively capable of facing the FAP on equal terms - in striking contrast to the situation during the crisis of 1981, where except for a small number of missions, the FAE had been kept on the ground armed and ready for immediate action, to be committed only in case of a full-fledged war. In 1995 their positions in the Cordillera del Cóndor were well defended due to tactically placed SAMs, and units armed with British-made <b>Blowpipe</b> missiles and Russian-made SA-16 MANPADS. Nevertheless, such defences didn´t stop the continuous raids of the Peruvian Air Force, which lost several aircraft in the effort.|$|E
