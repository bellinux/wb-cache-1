25|$|The Victorias {{of the two}} {{operational}} squadrons {{also made}} a number of long range training flights, such as return trips from Cairo to Aden in 1931, and helped to pioneer air routes for Imperial Airways' Handley Page HP.42 airliners. One Victoria was used as a blind flying trainer by the Central Flying School, being fitted with two sets of controls and instruments in a <b>blanked</b> <b>off</b> cabin. The Victoria continued in service until 1935, although many were converted to Valentias, which remained in use until well into the Second World War.|$|E
500|$|To ease {{maintenance}} and lubrication, panels of air-smoothed casing {{ahead of the}} cylinders were removed from 1952, and the front sanders were <b>blanked</b> <b>off.</b> This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender [...] "raves" [...] on all but five locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing. The resultant [...] "cut-down" [...] tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E
500|$|A {{waveguide}} stub filter is made {{by placing}} one or more stubs {{along the length of}} a waveguide, usually λg/4 apart, as shown in figure 12. [...] The ends of the stubs are <b>blanked</b> <b>off</b> to short-circuit them. [...] When the short-circuited stubs are λg/4 long the filter will be a band-stop filter and the stubs will have a lumped-element approximate equivalent circuit of [...] parallel resonant circuits connected in series with the line. [...] When the stubs are λg/2 long, the filter will be a band-pass filter. [...] In this case the lumped-element equivalent is series LC resonant circuits in series with the line.|$|E

2500|$|Connector cars, {{numbered}} in the 62xx series, were marshalled {{with their}} cabs (which {{were converted to}} vestibules, the windscreens being <b>blanked</b> <b>off)</b> next to the locomotive, {{to which they were}} connected with special control couplings. The purpose of the connector cars was to [...] "convert the signals from the former railcar controls on the control car into a form which can be received and acted upon by the control equipment on the loco." [...] The cars also contained guard's compartments, which retained their heating boilers; however, as noted above, only the boiler in the driving trailer was normally used, whereas the location of the generator set in that car forced the guard to travel in the (normally unheated) compartment in the connector car.|$|E
50|$|Six of the Class E locomotives, CSAR numbers 222, 233-235, 245 and 252, were {{converted}} to 4-8-2T Mountain type locomotives c. 1903 by removing the fifth pair of coupled wheels and <b>blanking</b> <b>off</b> the resulting opening in the frame.

40|$|In this chapter, I coin {{the term}} 'casting off blanks' {{to refer to}} a {{procedure}} often used in manuscript construction in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: the practice of leaving several pages of a manuscript blank in order to create distinct sections into which to copy an as yet undecided number of texts. I describe the types of manuscript in which <b>blank</b> casting <b>off</b> tends to occur, the main forms it takes and methods for detecting it. In {{the second half of the}} article, I examine specific manuscripts in which <b>blank</b> casting <b>off</b> seems to have been used, often without the knowledge of modern editors and critics, focusing in particular detail on Anne Southwell's 'commonplace book' (Folger Shakespeare Library MS Vb. 198.

50|$|Soon {{after the}} first two {{examples}} were introduced into traffic the class {{was found to be}} unstable at high speed and prone to derailment, due to water surging in the large side tanks. As a result the two locomotives were soon rebuilt to provide a large well tank between the axles, and to <b>blank</b> <b>off</b> the upper portion of the side tanks. This had the effect of lowering the centre of gravity of the locomotive.Once modified the first two locomotives proved to be most successful, but further deliveries were delayed by the onset of the First World War. Five more examples were built between October 1921 and April 1922. No. 333 Remembrance was the last new locomotive built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, before it became a part of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923. It was named in honour {{of the members of the}} railway killed in the war.|$|R
5000|$|A protectoscope is {{a similar}} {{periscopic}} vision device {{designed to provide a}} window in armoured plate, similar to a direct vision slit.

50|$|Maximum {{range is}} {{achieved}} by using the slowest possible speed, but for grouped flashes, {{it is necessary to}} blank off lenses and rotate the mechanism faster. So, for example, for The Cuckolds Light, whose characteristic is group flashing two every six seconds, all but two of the six panels are <b>blanked</b> <b>off</b> and the mechanism rotates at ten RPM.|$|E

50|$|Shake blocks {{are split}} into 1 inch thick slats called blanks, using either a {{hydraulic}} press with a blade attached, called a cuber, or split by hand using a froe and mallet.

Alternatively, the splitter may flip the block after a <b>blank</b> is taken <b>off</b> each edge, which results in a tapered split from end to end, called tapers or hand-split. The blanks which are not tapered require further processing before application to create this taper, and are run through a large band saw, pushed by hand to cut them from corner to corner forming a tapered shake, sawn on one face.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are four}} main types of thread rolling, {{named after the}} {{configuration}} of the dies: flat dies, two-die cylindrical, three-die cylindrical, and planetary dies. The flat die system has two flat dies. The bottom one is held stationary and the other slides. The blank is placed {{on one end of the}} stationary die and then the moving die slides over the blank, which causes the blank to roll between the two dies forming the threads. Before the moving die reaches the end of its stroke the <b>blank</b> rolls <b>off</b> the stationary die in a finished form. The two-die cylindrical process is used to produce threads up to [...] in diameter and [...] in length. There are two types of three-die processes; the first has the three dies move radially out from the center to let the blank enter the dies and then closes and rotates to roll the threads. This type of process is commonly employed on turret lathes and screw machines. The second type takes the form of a self-opening die head. This type is more common than the former, but is limited by not being able form the last 1.5 to 2 threads against shoulders. Planetary dies are used to mass-produce threads up to [...] in diameter.|$|R
5000|$|IM (1943-1944): A {{mixture of}} Gasoline and an {{incendiary}} compound thickener. It was ignited with an M3 fuze {{attached to the}} bottle with a Timmerman strap safety.

The Timmerman Strap was a metal band under tension around {{the surface of the}} grenade that was hooked up to a striker safety in the fuse body. (If the bottle broke prematurely, the Timmerman strap safety would prevent the striker from going off on impact.) The user pulled the safety pin from the fuse assembly and threw the bottle against the target. When the bottle broke, the Timmerman strap fell off, deactivating the strap safety and allowing the striker to engage. The fuze spring in the fuze body activated the striker, which struck the cartridge. The <b>blank</b> cartridge set <b>off</b> a flash, which ignited the liquid filler.|$|R
