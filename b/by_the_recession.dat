5|$|Planning for {{the large}} Finzels Reach {{development}} across the Floating Harbour from Castle Park, including the old Georges Brewery buildings, was first granted in 2006 but progress was hampered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> and the developers went into receivership.

5|$|The {{market for}} supercars was growing when the {{production}} XJ220 was announced, with comparable cars immediately reselling after delivery {{for three and}} four times the list price. The Ferrari F40 had been selling for more than £800,000 in 1990, but like the XJ220 it was adversely affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession,</b> and by 1992 prices had dropped to between £100,000 to £150,000.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) {{announced}} {{a campaign to}} redesign the buildings on the island, and six designs were submitted. One of the designs removed the existing buildings and piers to replace them with walking paths, and added a large curvilinear concrete building to the island. The design called for many windows in the building to create a large panorama of the surrounding seascape. In September 2010 Urban Splash placed the pier up for sale, citing a downfall in business caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> as their reason.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other parts of the Midlands, West Bromwich was hit badly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> of <b>the</b> mid-1970s and early 1980s, {{resulting}} in mass unemployment across the town, exceeding 20% in some districts.|$|R

5|$|Logging {{remained}} {{a mainstay of}} industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the wood and paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E
25|$|Maison de Chanel {{increased}} the Wertheimer family fortune to $5billion USD. Sales were hurt <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> {{of the early}} 1990s, but Chanel recovered by the mid-1990s with further boutique expansion.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{it had to}} be {{considered}} that a sudden halting or stunting of the movement of merchandise, as would occur with a large and sudden vacating of the cargo-transportation workforce, would have similar consequences.

30|$|Two {{additional}} tests are performed {{to study the}} change in the magnitude of parameters of interest. To test the structural change brought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession,</b> a dummy variable <b>Recession</b> (1 for <b>the</b> sample period of 1996 – 2007, 0 for the sample period of 2008 – 2013) is constructed and interacted with the other regressors from the transition model.

25|$|During {{the mid-1990s}} the scheme {{worked well for}} UAL.

30|$|As can be seen, the {{characteristics}} of users of the Law seem to change considerably in <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> period.

25|$|The bank {{weathered}} {{the economic downturn}} of the early 1980s, showing consistent revenue increases from 1980 to 1984. By the late 1980s, however, the bank {{was caught up in}} the debt crisis in the developing world caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> and the dramatic rise in interest rates. Significant loan losses were reported in 1987 and, while the bank participated actively in debt restructuring initiatives, it also committed itself to more conservative lending practices.|$|E
25|$|The Roosevelt 9:6 {{site was}} a Colonial Period Hohokam site near the Salt River north of Globe, Arizona.

Working for Gila Pueblo alongside the Gladwins, Haury published an extensive and detailed report of the findings. This report along with those published by the Gladwins, were important in the establishment of ceramic typologies, burial techniques, and lifeways of the Hohokam.|$|E
25|$|Reutemann's {{second term}} {{was marked by}} the {{nationwide}} economic problems brought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> that had started in 1999 and ultimately led to the socioeconomic crash of 2001. Under Reutemann, Santa Fe kept a conservative fiscal policy, whereby it applied discounts and froze public workers' salaries and pensions through an Economic Emergency Law. The province was among the few not to resort {{to the issue of}} government bonds as a form of quasi-currency, and thus did not become highly indebted.|$|E

50|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, {{the poor}} {{quality of the}} housing, {{together}} with numerous forms of crime including anti-social behaviour, burglary and joyriding, helped to push the area into a seemingly irreversible decline. Unemployment was well above the national average, further intensified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> of <b>the</b> early 1980s and early 1990s. Some families on the estate had even abandoned the decaying upstairs bedrooms and were sleeping in downstairs rooms, few of which were {{in a much better}} condition. The plight of people living in squalor on the Wren's Nest was highlighted in February 1985, in the second edition of the Dudley News.|$|R
25|$|Despite growth {{into new}} markets outside the brand's {{traditional}} footprint, {{the company was}} hit hard <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> of 2008–2009. In 2009, the brand had multiple quarters of declines in same-store sales {{for the first time}} in recent memory. Plans to bring Sonic to Alaska have not come to fruition. On October 26, 2015, Sonic opened its first Rhode Island location in Smithfield, reporting to have received 500 orders on its opening day. In the mid-2010s, the company began a refranchising effort and began to add to its numbers of stores again.|$|E
25|$|In May 1992, {{entertainment}} magazine The Hollywood Reporter {{reported that}} about 25% of Euro Disney's workforce – approximately 3,000 people – had resigned {{from their jobs}} because of unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. The disappointing attendance can be at least partly explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> and increased unemployment, which was affecting France {{and most of the}} rest of the developed world at this time; when construction of the resort began, the economy was still on an upswing.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1990s {{the brand}} had an annual {{turnover}} of around £1 million. This had grown to £4.86 million by 2006/7.

For the financial year 2008/9, the company failed to make any profits and turnover dropped to £2.2 million, with an operating loss of £3.3 million, compared to the previous year's operating profit of £57,000. Fortunes improved after the 2009 Waitrose arrangement, and by 2013 annual profits were £2.8 million.|$|E

25|$|The Great Recession {{had caused}} federal {{government}} revenues {{to fall to}} their lowest level relative {{to the size of}} the economy for 50 years, with tax revenues falling nearly $400 billion (20%) between 2008 and 2009. At the same time, safety net expenditures caused expenditures to rise considerably. For example, automatic stabilizer spending (such as unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments, which increased without legislative action) ranged between $350–420 billion annually from 2009 to 2012, roughly 10% of the expenditures. This drove the budget deficit up even without any policy steps by President Obama, creating significant debt concerns. This resulted in a series of bruising debates with the Republican Congress, which attempted (with much success) to blame the President for the deficits caused primarily <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> that began during the Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the graph}} to the right, the {{retailer}} has seen rapid growth since the end of 2008, doubling the number of their stores from 61 in November 2008 to 123 in December 2009. Company owner Lalani said that finding sites was getting easier because of the new empty rate tax on commercial property. Whereas, previously, landlords would decline to have a discount shop filling their empty stores, they are now less reluctant to fill them with discount stores, as they are now being charged for stores which lie empty. Stuart Donnelly, head of property at 99p Stores, notes that landlords are now being much more proactive, inviting potential retailers to come and have a look at their locations with the hope of them taking up a lease, as the property market has been badly affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession,</b> allowing the company to drive competitive deals to further expand their portfolio of stores with less expenditure, something that wouldn't have been possible just a few years ago. Landlords are now regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores can bring to a location.|$|E
25|$|Hughes {{remained}} with Embassy Racing for the 2008 Le Mans Series season, {{with the team}} now campaigning their new Embassy WF01-Zytek. The new car had an unsuccessful debut, with Hughes and Haberfield withdrawal from the 1000km of Catalunya, following the sister car's steering failure. Race two {{would prove to be}} more successful, with Hughes and Haberfield bringing home their WF01 in eighth position at the 1000km of Monza, although they were 41 laps behind the sister WF01. Kane partnered Hughes for the 1000km of Spa, which once more ended in retirement. Following the Spa event, Embassy Racing entered their first 24 Hours of Le Mans event, with Hughes being partnered with Kane and Joey Foster. Once more, however, luck evaded the Embassy Racing team: various mechanical and electrical maladies blighted the race, before the team were finally forced to retire after Foster was involved in an accident. Hughes and Kane closed the season out with a seventh-place finish at the 1000km of Nürburgring, and a sixth-place finish at the 1000km of Silverstone. The year, however, would end with Embassy Racing closing their doors, due to the economic recession, the first team in the series to be heavily affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession.</b>|$|E
