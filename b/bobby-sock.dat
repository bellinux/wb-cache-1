5000|$|Music critic JT Griffith {{wrote in}} his Allmusic review [...] "This Is Darin showcases his {{confident}} phrasing with some moments of humor and a few trademark [...] "hut hut"s (six in the first song!)... Gone is the <b>bobby-sock</b> rock of [...] "Splish Splash" [...] and even the crossover appeal of [...] "Mack the Knife." [...] In its place is a more mature Bobby Darin aiming for adult—not pop—credibility... This Is Darin is highly recommended if you have long since tired of the Swingers soundtrack and want to discover Darin's more traditional fare." ...|$|E
