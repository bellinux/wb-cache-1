The foreground elements conceal the parts of the background image behind them. Sometimes, the background is projected from the front, reflecting off the screen but not the foreground subjects because the screen is made of highly directional, exceptionally reflective material. (The prehistoric opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey uses front projection.) However, rear projection has been a far more common technique.|$|E

5000|$|Virtual {{sets are}} also used in motion picture filmmaking, {{some of which are}} photographed entirely in blue or green screen environments, as for example in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. More commonly, composited {{backgrounds}} are combined with sets - both full-size and models - and vehicles, furniture, and other physical objects that enhance the [...] "reality" [...] of the composited visuals. [...] "Sets" [...] of almost unlimited size can be created digitally because compositing software can take the blue or green color at the edges of a backing screen and extend it to fill the rest of the frame outside it. That way, subjects recorded in modest areas can be placed in large virtual vistas. Most common of all, perhaps, are set extensions: digital additions to actual performing environments. In the film Gladiator, for example, the arena and first tier seats of the Roman Colosseum were actually built, while the upper galleries (complete with moving spectators) were computer graphics, composited onto the image above the physical set. For motion pictures originally recorded on film, high-quality video conversions called [...] "digital intermediates" [...] are created to enable compositing and the other operations of computerized post production. Digital compositing is a form of matting, one of four basic compositing methods. The others are physical compositing, multiple exposure, and <b>background</b> <b>projection.</b>|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{demand in the}} field of dental and medical radiography for effective metal artifact reduction (MAR) in computed tomography (CT) because artifact caused by metallic objects causes serious image degradation that obscures information regarding the teeth and/or other biological structures. This paper presents a new MAR method that uses the Laplacian operator to reveal <b>background</b> <b>projection</b> data hidden in regions containing data from metal. In the proposed method, we attempted to decompose the projection data into two parts: data from metal only (metal data), and background data in the absence of metal. Removing metal data from the projections enables us to perform sparsity-driven reconstruction of the metal component and subsequent removal of the metal artifact. The results of clinical experiments demonstrated that the proposed MAR algorithm improves image quality and increases the standard of 3 D reconstruction images of the teeth and mandible...|$|E
40|$|Understanding what {{cannot be}} seen is difficult. Physical {{behavior}} can be explained {{on the basis of}} physical theories even if the behavior cannot be observed. Explanation of what is physically happening in the real world would become easy, however, if annotations were superimposed on the real objects. Herein, the authors demonstrate how an understanding of a physical event can be facilitated by overlapping a real-world situation with a simulation that predicts a future state. This idea is demonstrated in a game application in which a player stacks blocks into a pile until it collapses. In general, it is easy to estimate whether a block {{on the edge of a}} table will fall or not. However, it is more difficult to predict whether a stack of many blocks will collapse, and in what manner the stack will collapse. Even though previous research has demonstrated that the problem of how two-dimensionally stacked blocks collapse can be reduced to solving a sequence of convex quadratic programs, algorithms for convex quadratic programs require massive computational resources. Hence, the authors developed a fast and new algorithm based on a linear program. The proposed algorithm realizes real-time simulation based on physics that superimposes predicted collapse. The block that is predicted to fall is superimposed on the real block with a lit <b>background</b> <b>projection.</b> The system was evaluated in an experiment, and superimposed augmented reality annotation was observed to be efficient. The system was also demonstrated in game contests and received positive feedback and comments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{paradox of}} {{apparent}} optical associations of galaxies {{with very different}} redshifts, the so-called anomalous redshift problem, is around 35 years old, but is still without a clear solution and is surprisingly ignored {{by most of the}} astronomical community. Statistical correlations among the positions of these galaxies have been pointed out by several authors. Gravitational lensing by dark matter has been proposed as the cause of these correlations, although this seems to be insufcient to explain them and does not work at all for correlations with the brightest and nearest galaxies. Some of these cases may be just fortuitous associations in which background objects are close in the sky to a foreground galaxy, although the statistical mean correlations remain to be explained and some lone objects have very small probabilities of being a projection of background objects. The sample of discordant redshift associations given in Arp's atlas is indeed quite large, and most of the objects remain to be analysed thoroughly. For about 5 years, we have been running a project to observe some of these cases in detail, and some new anomalies have been added to those already known; For instance, in some exotic congurations such as NGC 7603 or NEQ 3, which can even show bridges connecting four object with very different redshifts, and the probability for this to be a projection of background sources is very low. Not only QSOs but also emission-line galaxies in general are found to take part in this kind of event. Other cases are analyzed: MCG 7 - 25 - 46, GC 0248 + 430, B 2 1637 + 29, VV 172 and Stephan's Quintet and, in some of them, it is probable that the associations stem from a <b>background</b> <b>projection,</b> although some other low probability features are present in some of these systems which remain to be understood...|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Background</b> <b>Projection</b> pursuit regression, {{multilayer}} feed-forward networks, multivariate adaptive regression splines {{and trees}} (including survival trees) have challenged classic multivariable models {{such as the}} multiple logistic function, the proportional hazards life table Cox model (Cox), the Poisson’s model, and the Weibull’s life table model to perform multivariable predictions. However, only artificial neural networks (NN) have become popular in medical applications. Results We compared several Cox versus NN models in predicting 45 -year all-cause mortality (45 -ACM) by 18 risk factors selected a priori: age; father life status; mother life status; family history of cardiovascular diseases; job-related physical activity; cigarette smoking; body mass index (linear and quadratic terms); arm circumference; mean blood pressure; heart rate; forced expiratory volume; serum cholesterol; corneal arcus; diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes; minor ECG abnormalities at rest. Two Italian rural cohorts of the Seven Countries Study, made up of men aged 40 to 59 years, enrolled and first examined in 1960 in Italy. Cox models were estimated by: a) forcing all factors; b) a forward-; and c) a backward-stepwise procedure. Observed cases of deaths and of survivors were computed in decile classes of estimated risk. Forced and stepwise NN were run and compared by C-statistics (ROC analysis) with the Cox models. Out of 1591 men, 1447 died. Model global accuracies were extremely high by all methods (ROCs > 0. 810) {{but there was no}} clear-cut superiority of any model to predict 45 -ACM. The highest ROCs (> 0. 838) were observed by NN. There were inter-model variations to select predictive covariates: whereas all models concurred to define the role of 10 covariates (mainly cardiovascular risk factors), family history, heart rate and minor ECG abnormalities were not contributors by Cox models but were so by forced NN. Forced expiratory volume and arm circumference (two protectors), were not selected by stepwise NN but were so by the Cox models. Conclusions There were similar global accuracies of NN versus Cox models to predict 45 -ACM. NN detected specific predictive covariates having a common thread with physical fitness as related to job physical activity such as arm circumference and forced expiratory volume. Future attention should be concentrated on why NN versus Cox models detect different predictors. </p...|$|E
