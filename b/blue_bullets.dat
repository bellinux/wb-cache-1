50|$|Space Marauder is a {{scrolling}} shooter, and {{has been}} compared to NES and SNES era shooter games such as Space Megaforce. The game puts the player in the role an infantryman dropped into an alien base that is determined to enslave humanity. There are three different power-ups, and the game allows you to shoot in eight different directions. However, due to the difficulty of switching the direction of fire during the midst of battle, it is regarded to be easier to just shoot in one direction. The three power-ups are considered standard for the genre: a <b>blue</b> <b>bullet,</b> a lighter <b>blue</b> laser, and a pink laser. The game uses a password system to continue progress.|$|R

50|$|Before 1984 Mount Buller was {{serviced}} by two lift companies {{that involved the}} skier needing to purchase two lift tickets to ski the whole mountain. In 1985, the two lift companies merged, allowing skiers to ski the whole mountain with one ticket. Today, Mount Buller is {{serviced by}} 22 lifts covering {{a wide range of}} terrain. In 1993, with an increasing number of visitors, the ski resort built a new quad chairlift called Wombat Lift on the skiers right of Little Buller spur to relieve the traffic on Federation triple chairlift. 2005 saw the addition of the Emirates quad chairlift to the lift network. A new six-seater chairlift was installed over the 2007/08 summer and is operational for 2008. This addition saw the decommissioning of one of the oldest chairs of the mountain â€” the Abom (previously known as Helicopter), along with <b>Blue</b> <b>Bullet</b> 2. In 2012 a new quad chairlift was built {{in the area of the}} old Burnt Hut T-Bar. A new carpet was also built. A list of every ski tow to ever operate at Mount Buller can be found at wikiski.|$|R

Money earned from gambling and performance is used to buy cars, upgrade them, and maintain them. There are 4 classes in the game.Each class had 4 people. Starting in Class D, they are Jack, Ms. Penny Parker, Alfanso, and Luigi. Class C has Vanessa, <b>Blue</b> <b>Bullet,</b> James, and Tex.

500|$|The script posed several {{technical}} {{challenges to}} both the puppet and special effects departments of Century 21 Productions. The [...] "blurring" [...] of the structures making up the Mysteron city was accomplished by mounting a sheet of glass between the camera and the effects set, with Vaseline placed on the glass at the necessary points to create lens flare. Complex scale model shots of Captain Blue's SPV navigating the spiral structure of the Car-Vu were simplified by turning the road surface instead of the vehicle, thus eliminating the requirement to manipulate the wires (or move the camera). Since the spinning blades reduced the practicality of overhead wire control, the scenes of Spectrum Helicopter A42's dogfight with the jetpack-wearing Blue were filmed upside-down (with wires supporting {{the base of the}} helicopter model) and flipped during post-production. A sequence of the World President and Captain Brown standing on a moving walkway while undergoing security checks at the Maximum Security Building was particularly difficult to film, since it was essential that the puppet operators, working from a gantry overhead, keep pace with the speed of the conveyor belt powering the set below. The Captain Scarlet [...] "grimacing" [...] head, used for the reaction shot immediately after the reconstruction is hit by <b>Blue's</b> <b>bullet,</b> was sculpted especially by the puppet workshop for its one-off appearance in this episode. In his DVD audio commentary for the episode, Gerry Anderson remembered how, on a technical level, [...] "everything had to be perfect" [...] for the filming of the first episode of the new series.|$|R
50|$|Australia has {{maintained}} distinctly different trends pertaining to Highway shields {{in the past}} and will continue in this vein somewhat, despite the conversion to alpha-numeric routes and shields.Alpha-numeric route numbering has been in use in Tasmania since the 1970s. However, from 1996 states on the mainland began conversion to the alpha-numeric system. The state of Victoria was the first to implement the policy.Prior to this conversion and concurrently, Federal Highway (gold-on-green squared-off bullet), National Highway (black-on-white squared-off <b>bullet),</b> State Highway (<b>blue</b> <b>bullet)</b> and Tourist Route (white-on-brown rounded pentagon) shields existed. In Victoria Freeway shields were used (white-on-green with 'F' prefix) until the late 1980s, while during the 1990s Queensland and New South Wales implemented a hexagonal blue-on-white Metroad system of urban arterial routes. With the opening of the Western Ring Road (now M80); that road used a shield quite similar to the U.S. Interstate shield, albeit with 'Ring Road' written instead of 'Interstate' and with 2 peaks, rather than 3.To further complicate matters, with the introduction of the alpha-numeric system, roads that are federally funded (or Federal Highways) have a squared-off bullet encompassing the alpha-numeric designation. Freeways and dual-carriageway roads often use an 'M' prefix, particularly in Victoria. In addition, trapezoidal signs are placed every 5 km on major regional highways and freeways indicating the distance to the post office of the next city or major town on the route. These signs usually only have the first letter of the destination; two or three letters are used if there is ambiguity between nearby towns or when the place name consists of two words.|$|R

A total of seven girls were used by Lord for the experiment, the rest presumably discarded as failures.|$|R

50|$|All of the {{characters}} in Dimahoo have a machine gun style shot, their own special bomb attack which ultimately makes them invisible for a second, and an individual personal attack. The personalized charge attack can be used once the magic book icon is collected. This then adds two satellites to the players ship. The satellites are what carry out the charge attack. After holding down the charge button, the charge burst becomes armed and then the character turns from red to blue. If the player releases the button while the character is red, then the attack will be more effective towards blue enemies. Likewise, when the character is blue it will be particularly damaging to the red enemies. When enemies are destroyed by the charge attack, they drop their armor, sword, shield, food, boots, helmets, jewelry or special items. These items each have point values and can be collected for points. The weapons that are fired from the satellites also change from red to <b>blue.</b> When the <b>bullets</b> hit enemies with the same color, it will neutralize them. The player can also collect yellow diamonds in order to fill up the point meter. Once the meter fills up completely, the sound of a chime will go off. A treasure chest with an extra bomb will appear for the player to collect. Once the point meter is filled up, it will reset to zero.|$|R
