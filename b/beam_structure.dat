40|$|Abstract: Obtaining {{mode shape}} values at {{rotational}} {{degrees of freedom}} (dofs) is a challenge from dynamic test of <b>beam</b> <b>structures,</b> {{for the reason that}} rotational dofs are usually difficult to be measured. This article proposes an expansion method to deal with spatial incompleteness of measured mode shapes of <b>beam</b> <b>structures.</b> One improvement is that the constrained linear least squares is combined into traditional expansion procedure proposed by Liu (2011), to estimate modeling errors in a physical meaning interval; and the initial guesses on mode-correction coefficients could be obtained using a non-iterative technique for improving the convergence of the approach. A cantilever beam is used to investigate the proposed method by establishing two numerical models: one is a beam finite element model as a baseline; the other is the model to represent real structure with different stiffness distribution compared with the baseline. One can conclude from numerical results that the approach has a better convergence performance than traditional expansion method, and spatially incomplete measured modes for <b>beam</b> <b>structures,</b> including higher order modes, can be expand properly and to be fundamental modal data for model updating or damage detection of <b>beam</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

The calculated results for straight beams and shallow arches using the FEM were consistent with the theoretical results carried by authors previously.

2500|$|Just after 1 p.m on February 17, 2014, {{one week}} after {{demolition}} of the stadium bowl had begun, demolition crews were working on taking down the concrete ring beam that encircled to top of the Metrodome, when {{a portion of the}} ring beam collapsed out of sequence, bringing an immediate halt to the work. No one was hurt and no equipment was damaged by the collapse. After five days of investigation from structural and demolition experts, it was decided that the remaining portion of the concrete ring beam would be destroyed using controlled explosive charges—virtually the same method that was used to bring down the Metrodome's steel support cables for the roof. This second controlled explosion was a continued deviation from the original plan to not use explosives to destroy the stadium. However, it was determined that this was the safest way to bring down the remaining ring <b>beam</b> <b>structure.</b> On February 23, 2014, just after 7:30a.m., with 84 explosive charges of dynamite, set in 24 columns of the upper concourse of the stadium, the remaining ring beam and corners of the Metrodome were brought down in 11 seconds. Once the concrete ring beam was brought down successfully, this enabled demolition crews to continue with the original wrecking ball demolition method that was originally chosen (though the order in which the sections would be brought down were changed {{as a result of the}} ring beam implosion), to bring down what was left of the Metrodome. Despite this unexpected setback, Mortenson Construction said that the demolition of the Metrodome and construction of U.S. Bank Stadium were both still on schedule.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{discusses}} a {{new method}} for damage detection {{based on the}} most fundamental concept in continuum mechanics: strain compatibility.

Therefore the principle of strain compatibility, {{in its ability to}} identify discontinuities, is very promising as a new foundation for future research into non-destructive evaluation and structural health monitoring technologies. The proposed method has many advantages compared to existing damage detection techniques, such as its invariance to material properties and the geometry of the structure. To illustrate the application of this technique, the detection of damage in <b>beam</b> <b>structures</b> is investigated. The formulation of the strain compatibility equation for <b>beam</b> <b>structures</b> is introduced and numerical simulations carried out to detect crack and delamination damage in a cantilever beam.
