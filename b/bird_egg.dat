500|$|Gobioolithus is an oogenus {{of fossil}} <b>bird</b> <b>egg</b> native to Mongolia. They are small, smooth-shelled, and {{elongated}} eggs that were first {{discovered in the}} 1960s and early 70s during a series of fossil-hunting expeditions in the Gobi desert. Two oospecies have been described: Gobioolithus minor and G. major. The eggs were probably laid in colonial nesting sites {{on the banks of}} rivers and lakes.|$|E
500|$|Also defined herewith: eggshell, yolk, albumen; chalaza. The organic vessel {{containing}} the zygote, in which birds develop until hatching. Eggs are usually oval in shape, {{and have a}} base white colour from the predominant calcium carbonate makeup of the outer shell, called the eggshell, though [...] birds especially may have eggs of other colours, such as through deposition of biliverdin and its zinc chelate, which give a green or blue ground colour, and protoporphyrin which produces reds and browns. A viable <b>bird</b> <b>egg</b> (as opposed to a non-viable egg: see [...] ) consists {{of a number of}} structures. The eggshell is 95–97% calcium carbonate crystals, at least in chickens, stabilized by a protein matrix, without which the crystalline structure would be too brittle to keep its form; the organic matrix is thought to have a role in deposition of calcium during the mineralization process. The structure and composition of the avian eggshell serves to protect the egg against damage and microbial contamination, prevention of desiccation, regulation of gas and water exchange for the growing embryo, and provides calcium for embryogenesis. Inside the eggshell are two shell membranes (inner and outer), and at the center is a yolk—a spherical structure, usually some shade of yellow, to which the fertilized gamete attaches and which the embryonic bird uses as sustenance as it grows. The yolk is suspended in the albumen (also called egg white or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. The albumen protects the yolk and provides additional nutrition for the embryo's growth, though it is made up of approximately 90% water in most birds. Prior to fertilization, the yolk is a single cell ovum or egg cell; one of the few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{having a}} bird-like shape and size, the P. jinguoensis {{has a very}} {{different}} microstructure, which bears a closer resemblance to non-avian dinosaur <b>eggs</b> than <b>bird</b> <b>eggs.</b> Most significantly, all known Cretaceous <b>bird</b> <b>eggs</b> have a three-layered eggshell, whereas the eggshell of Parvoblongoolithus is two-layered. Additionally, its pore system is prolatocanaliculate, unlike the angusticanaliculate pores of <b>bird</b> <b>eggs</b> (such as Laevisoolithidae or Gobioolithidae) and its microstructures are much more {{similar to those of}} stalicoolithids, Mosaicoolithus, and Paraspheroolithus.|$|R

2500|$|The {{elephant}} birds, {{which were}} giant ratites native to Madagascar, have been extinct {{since at least}} the 17th century. Étienne de Flacourt, a French governor of Madagascar in the 1640s and 1650s, mentions an ostrich-like bird said to inhabit unpopulated regions. In 1659, Flacourt wrote: [...] "vouropatra– a large bird which haunts the Ampatres and lays eggs like the ostriches; so that the people of these places may not take it, it seeks the most lonely places." [...] Marco Polo also mentioned hearing stories of very large birds during his journey to the East during the late 13th century. These accounts are today believed to describe elephant birds. Aepyornis, believed to have been more than [...] tall and weighing perhaps in the range of , was at the time the world's largest bird. Only the much older species Dromornis stirtoni from Australia is known to rival it in size among the fossil record and is reported to have shared the same estimated upper weight, [...] Remains of Aepyornis adults and eggs have been found; in some cases the eggs have a length up to , the largest type of <b>bird</b> <b>egg</b> ever found.
