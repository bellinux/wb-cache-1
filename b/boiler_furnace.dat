Home or other building heating may include <b>boilers,</b> <b>furnaces,</b> and water heaters. Compressed natural gas is used in rural homes without connections to piped-in public utility services, or with portable grills.

40|$|The overall {{frame and}} {{principal}} steps of complex numerical modelling of thermal processes in power <b>boiler</b> <b>furnaces</b> on pulverised coal with tangential {{disposition of the}} burners are presented in the paper. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique {{is used as a}} tool to perform comprehensive thermal analysis in two test cases. The methodology for creation of three-dimensional models of <b>boiler</b> <b>furnaces</b> is briefly described. Standard steady k- model is employed for description of the turbulent flow. The coupling of continuity and momentum is achieved by the SIMPLEC method. Coal combustion is modelled by the mixture fraction/probability density function approach for the reaction chemistry, with equilibrium assumption applied for description of the system chemistry. Thermal radiation is computed by means of the simplified P-N model, based on expansion of the radiation intensity into an orthogonal series of spherical harmonics. Comparison between the simulation predictions and available site measurements leads to a conclusion that the model produces realistic insight into the furnace processes. Qualitative agreement of the results indicates reasonability of the calculations and validates the employed sub-models. The described test cases and other experiences with CFD modelling stress the advantages over a purely field data study, such as the ability to quickly and cheaply analyse a variety of design options without actually modifying the object and the availability of significantly more data to interpret the results...|$|R
50|$|Tubular preheaters {{consist of}} {{straight}} tube bundles which {{pass through the}} outlet ducting of the boiler and open at each end outside of the ducting. Inside the ducting, the hot furnace gases pass around the preheater tubes, transferring heat from the exhaust gas to the air inside the preheater. Ambient air is forced by a fan through ducting {{at one end of}} the preheater tubes and at other end the heated air from inside of the tubes emerges into another set of ducting, which carries it to the <b>boiler</b> <b>furnace</b> for combustion.|$|E
5000|$|Oil waxing {{occurs when}} heating oil begin to gel, and before {{it has become}} {{actually}} too viscous to flow {{at all in the}} heating system oil piping, wax particles (wax platelets or little spheres of wax or in some articles, alkane [...] "wax crystals") have already begun to form in the fuel. The wax platelets form first from the long hydrocarbon chains which are a component in the heating oil (or diesel fuel). It is these waxy particles that can clog an oil line or even an oil-fired heating <b>boiler,</b> <b>furnace,</b> or water heater.|$|E
50|$|Superheater {{operation}} {{is similar to}} that of the coils on an air conditioning unit, although for a different purpose. The steam piping is directed through the flue gas path in the <b>boiler</b> <b>furnace.</b> The temperature in this area is typically between 1300 and 1600 C. Some superheaters are radiant type; that is, they absorb heat by radiation. Others are convection type, absorbing heat from a fluid. Some are a combination of the two types. Through either method, the extreme heat in the flue gas path will also heat the superheater steam piping and the steam within. While the temperature of the steam in the superheater rises, the pressure of the steam does not and the pressure remains the same as that of the boiler. Almost all steam superheater system designs remove droplets entrained in the steam to prevent damage to the turbine blading and associated piping.|$|E

30|$|From {{the above}} results and {{discussion}} {{it has been shown}} that there is an optimum sweep flow rate beyond which there is no significant effect on the oxygen permeation and devolatilization characteristics. Therefore, it is concluded that for the present oxygen transport reactor, sweep flow rate in the range of 7 e− 5 to 1 e− 4  kg/s gives adequate oxygen permeation along with satisfactory reaction rates. The results also indicate the feasibility of the liquid fuel combustion in oxygen transport reactors (OTRs). These OTRs can be utilized in combustors of gas turbines and <b>boiler</b> <b>furnaces.</b>|$|R
