The best balancing configuration is searched for two discrete parameters: allowed standard masses and predefined angular positions on the balancing planes. The objective is to minimize the residual unbalancing effects (such as reactions in supports) thanks to an optimal location of several accurately selected masses on each <b>balancing</b> <b>plane.</b> The corresponding optimization problem is solved using genetic algorithm. A simple model of a rigid rotor mounted on rigid supports is investigated in numerical examples. The optimization efficiency {{and the influence of}} the number of applied balancing masses are discussed. The experimental tests have validated the developed balancing approach...|$|E

The veracity of calculation result is verified by an academic rotor model. The latter study in this paper is subsequently put forward through a power turbine rotor modeled by finite element method. Simulation results show that proper equilibrium plane performs commendably in recognizing residual unbalance and reducing the vibration effect through the critical region. Moreover, the inherent unbalance recognized by experimental data from a turbine rotor with slender shaft is found to be in certain difference under different counterweight combination. Choosing suitable balancing planes will improve the accuracy of unbalance identification...|$|E
40|$|Several {{researchers}} have proposed many methods for balancing the rotor {{to reduce the}} machine vibration. Broadly these methods can be categorized into two classes â€“ balancing using measured responses only (known as Influence Coefficient Method) Approach), and balancing using both measured responses and a mathematical (often finite element (FE)) model of rotating machine (Modal Balancing Method). Both of these methods require several trial run-down runs of machine to estimate the unbalance masses and phases at multi <b>balancing</b> <b>plane</b> and usually a substantial experience in field balancing is also required. In addition to this for Modal Balancing a reliable model of the machine is also important which {{is often difficult to}} construct. Considering these practical difficulties a method has been developed recently which found to have the potential for fast and reliable rotor unbalance estimation. The method just uses measured pedestal vibration from a single run-down of a machine along with a priori models of the rotor and fluid bearings but the method accounts for the dynamics of the foundation. The method has been qualified on an experimental rotating rig and now the sensitivity analysis has been carried out and presented here for the proposed method with the perturbation errors in the rotor and fluid bearing models to confirm the robustness of the method. 1...|$|E

40|$|Balancing of {{flexible}} rotor with bow using {{transfer matrix method}} MB Deepthikumar 1, AS Sekhar 2 and MR Srikanthan 1 Synchronous lateral vibration is a frequent cause of machine failure and {{is probably the most}} common source of machine noise and vibration. Among the broad ranges of faults that cause synchronous vibration, mass unbalance and bow are the most common faults present in the rotor and hence their detailed understanding is required. In the present study, a rotor model having both mass unbalance and bow is analyzed to find the influence of these faults on the synchronous response. The synchronous response of a rotor is a function of influence coefficients due to mass unbalance and bow. The influence coefficients are analytically derived using transfer matrix method for rotor bearing system having both mass unbalance and bow. The correction unbalance vector required to balance the rotor at its first bending critical speed is computed using these analytically derived influence coefficients and the rotor responses measured at a speed much lower than the first bending critical speed. The balancing method needs a good mathematical model for the rotor system in finding the influence coefficients for mass unbalance and bow. This procedure helps in estimating the correction mass in a single trial run and using a single <b>balancing</b> <b>plane,</b> thus reducing the cycle time for balancing flexible rotors. Experiments are carried out on a test rig to verify the procedure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{balancing}} of rotors divides broadly {{into two}} categories: balancing in situ and balancing in a balancing machine. In the latter case, {{the most common}} practice is to arrange balance corrections on the rotor such that the net excitations {{of each of the}} four in-plane rigid-body modes of the free rotor is zero by deploying balance corrections on two independent planes. In a small proportion of cases, the net excitations of the rst pair of exural modes are also zeroed using a third correction plane. This paper proposes that, when rotors are balanced in a balancing machine (not similar to the machine stator), substantially more utility can be gained from the balancing operation by combining a suitably weighted account of the speci c balancing requirements of the machine with knowledge of the expected machine characteristics than can be achieved by ignoring this knowledge. A single cost function is established based on a numerical model of the machine. Then, depending on circumstances, either the expected value of this cost function or its worst possible value can be minimized. The methods proposed require that relatively detailed knowledge of the distribution of residual unbalance be obtained experimentally. The paper brie y discusses some practical methods for how such information might be extracted. The de nition of the cost function as a matrix quadratic form provides potentially valuable information about the necessary number and the optimal location of <b>balance</b> <b>planes</b> on a given rotor, and methods for determining an optimal set of <b>balance</b> <b>planes</b> are outlined...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of a}} multi-rotor bearing system, that includes realistic end support conditions. It provides a design engineer with the present day technology available in carrying out a balancing analysis. The design is based on minimizing the flexural response, due to mass unbalance. [...] The model is developed based on the finite element approach which provides a convenient and accurate means of balancing a rotor-bearing system. The model incorporates the effects of translational, and rotational inertia, and gyroscopic moments, using the consistent matrix approach in conjunction with dynamic matrix reduction technique, modal analysis, and least-square balancing technique. The use of matrix reduction technique for determining a equivalent reduced system, provides subsequent saving of both computational time and space on the digital computer. This allows modelling of complex rotor system conveniently, while retaining only those degree of freedom essential to {{the solution of the}} problem. The modal analysis used is an effective means of determining the unbalance force response, for systems with unsymmetric stiffness and damping matrices. The least-square method for balancing, is used to include balancing cases where the number of measuring lanes exceeds the number of <b>balancing</b> <b>planes.</b> This represents most actual balancing situations, and allows an increase in the input data, whereby the consequence of a single error in data tends to decrease. The balancing at one speed is usually sufficient to bring the rotor amplitude down over its entire speed range. Further, flexibility in rotor balancing is provided by including the effect of varying the location, and number of <b>balancing</b> <b>planes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a general analytic approach to constrained balancing {{that is consistent with}} past influence coefficient methods is described. The approach uses Lagrange multipliers to impose orbit and/or weight constraints; these constraints are combined with the least squares minimization process to provide a set of coupled equations that result in a single solution form for determining correction weights. Proper selection of constraints results in the capability to: (1) balance higher speeds without disturbing previously balanced modes, thru the use of modal trial weight sets; (2) balance off-critical speeds; and (3) balance decoupled modes by use of a single <b>balance</b> <b>plane.</b> If no constraints are imposed, this solution form reduces to the general weighted least squares influence coefficient method.

40|$|Harmonic {{vibrations}} {{of high-speed}} rotors in momentum exchange devices are primary disturbances for attitude control of spacecraft. Active magnetic bearings (AMBs), offering {{the ability to}} control the AMB-rotor dynamic behaviors, are preferred in high-precision and micro-vibration applications, such as high-solution Earth observation satellites. However, undesirable harmonic displacements, currents, and vibrations also occur in the AMB-rotor system owing to the mixed rotor imbalances and sensor runout. To compensate the rotor imbalances and to suppress the harmonic vibrations, two control methods are presented. Firstly, a four degrees-of-freedom AMB-rotor model with the static imbalance, dynamic imbalance, and the sensor runout are described. Next, a synchronous current reduction approach with a variable-phase notch feedback is proposed, so that the rotor imbalances can be identified on-line through the analysis of the synchronous displacement relationships of the geometric, inertial, and rotational axes of the rotor. Then, the identified rotor imbalances, which can be represented at two prescribed <b>balancing</b> <b>planes</b> of the rotor, are compensated by discrete add-on weights whose masses are calculated in the vector form. Finally, a repetitive control algorithm is utilized to suppress the residual harmonic vibrations. The proposed field balancing and harmonic vibration suppression strategies are verified by simulations and experiments performed on a control moment gyro test rig with a rigid AMB-rotor system. Compared with existing methods, the proposed strategies do not require trial weights or an accurate model of the AMB-rotor system. Moreover, the harmonic displacements, currents, and vibrations can be well-attenuated simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of the {{excessive}} vibration in rotating machines is the rotor mass unbalance. If a machine vibration due to mass unbalance exceeds the alarm limits, then it may lead to machine failure. Therefore, rotating machines should be regularly checked to ensure that they are properly balanced. Currently, industries use the influence coefficient (IC) balancing technique for in situ machine balancing. The accepted practice is to use the vibration measurements in both vertical and horizontal directions at the machine-bearing pedestals together with the tachometer signal to estimate the machine rotor unbalance (both mass and phase angle). It is generally believed that the use of the machine vibration measurements in the vertical and horizontal directions represents better machine dynamics, and hence the estimated unbalance is likely to be more accurate. However, this paper applies the same concept of the IC method but with a reduced number of vibration sensors (one sensor per bearing pedestal at 45 Â° instead of two sensors at the vertical and horizontal directions). The use of one sensor per bearing pedestal at 45 Â° from both vertical and horizontal directions is likely to have responses from both directions. The {{reduction in the number of}} sensors by half will definitely save the instruments and their maintenance cost and reduce the computational effort in the signal processing significantly. The proposed concept is applied on a small-size laboratory rig with two <b>balancing</b> <b>planes.</b> The paper presents the unbalance estimations by using the measured vibration responses in both the vertical and horizontal directions simultaneously and using vibration responses measured at 45 Â°...|$|R
