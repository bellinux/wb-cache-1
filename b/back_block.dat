50|$|On {{both the}} Sniper and Autococker, a pump rod {{runs from the}} front of the marker to the <b>back</b> <b>block</b> and serves as the means by which the <b>back</b> <b>block</b> moves forward and back. On the Sniper (and {{converted}} Autocockers), a pump handle is located on the front of the marker and attaches to the pump rod. After the player has pulled the trigger to fire a paintball, he/she then pulls back on the pump arm, pushing the <b>back</b> <b>block</b> rearward. This opens the bolt, allowing the next ball to be fed into the breech, and simultaneously pulls the hammer back until it is caught by the sear.|$|E

40|$|Materials {{processing}} {{field has}} been witnessing tremendous growth {{during the past}} few decades. Welding is an important metal fabrication process that has high potential for industrial applications. Friction welding is a vital solid state joining process that has gained popularity in welding non-weldable alloys. Friction welding of tube to tube plate using an external tool (FWTPET) is an innovative friction welding process and was invented in the year 2006. FWTPET is capable of welding tube to tube plate of similar or dissimilar metals and is capable of producing good quality leak proof weld joints. In this work, experimental investigation of FWTPET has been carried out with and without <b>backing</b> <b>block</b> arrangement. The results of the experimental investigation revealed that by employing <b>backing</b> <b>block,</b> FWTPET is capable of producing defect free welds. This aspect has been ensured by the conduct of macro structural observation as well as tensile test. Besides experimental investigation, numerical investigation has been conducted using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Von-Misses stress pertaining to configuration with and without <b>backing</b> <b>block</b> is 1. 093 x 103 and 2. 811 x 103 N/mm 2 respectively. Strain rate observed in the configuration with and without <b>backing</b> <b>block</b> is 2. 441 x 10 - 3 and 1. 348 x 10 - 2 respectively. The results of FEA indicate that joints produced by FWTPET process supported with <b>backing</b> <b>block</b> have less stress, minimum deformation and lesser strain. The experimental and numerical investigation of FWTPET process revealed that the employment of <b>backing</b> <b>block</b> greatly enhances the quality of the joints produced...|$|R

5000|$|Short-Stroking: On {{mechanical}} Autocockers, {{the trigger}} both fires the marker (by releasing the sear) and re-cocks it (by pulling the timing rod and activating the 3-way). The {{pull of the}} trigger accomplishes first one, then the other, in a precisely timed operation, making it necessary for the player to fully pull and release the trigger each time. Only partially pulling the trigger, known colloquially as [...] "short-stroking", will alter the duration of time the pneumatics are actively operating the recocking mechanism, or may eliminate the re-cocking cycle altogether. Short-stroking can thus cause many malfunctions related {{to one or more}} steps of the recocking process not being performed. For instance, if the <b>back</b> <b>block</b> does not move fully rearward, the hammer may not be caught by the sear, and will be released into the pin valve immediately upon the <b>back</b> <b>block</b> moving forward again. If the <b>back</b> <b>block</b> is not kept rearward long enough for a paintball to drop fully into the chamber, a [...] "dry fire" [...] or a [...] "ball chop" [...] may occur, the latter being extremely frustrating as it drastically affects accuracy of future shots until the barrel, breech and bolt are cleaned. The need for a full trigger pull on mechanical Autocockers also results in a slower rate of fire.|$|E

The finite element model is also utilised to interpret various resonances present in the matched or damped piezocomposite and to determine their influence on the overall transducer performance.

50|$|On {{both the}} Sniper and the Autococker, a <b>back</b> <b>block</b> {{performs}} {{all three of}} these functions. The bolt is attached to the block, while a cocking rod (which is attached to the hammer and designed to catch on the block) passes through it. When the block moves backward, it pulls the bolt back, allowing a paintball to drop into the breech. The backward movement simultaneously pulls the cocking rod back, causing the hammer to also be pulled back until it re-engages the sear. When the block moves forward, it pushes the bolt (and the paintball) forward, closing the breech. The cocking rod stays pulled back, with the hammer ready to fire.|$|E

5000|$|Reliability: Due {{to their}} {{large number of}} moving parts, Autocockers are popular with tinkerers. Since even {{seemingly}} unimportant aspects of the marker, such as how far the <b>back</b> <b>block</b> is screwed onto the pushrod, can affect Autococker performance, minor tinkering with the marker can compound over time and lead to failure. It {{is not uncommon for}} an inexperienced owner to try to fix an Autococker that is not broken, frequently with disastrous results. As a result, rumors of Autocockers being unreliable have circulated the internet for years. If an owner doesn't know how to tune an Autococker, then it is not [...] "Time to un-pimp ze Autococker". The reality however, is that Autocockers are extremely reliable once set up properly. Experienced owners that understand how each of the parts in the marker interact are consistently able to modify and upgrade the marker without causing problems. Since new Autocockers are designed to work [...] "out of the box," [...] new owners are usually advised to not tinker with anything until they fully understand how the marker works.|$|E
5000|$|Gas Efficiency: Although the Autococker {{operates}} at lower pressures {{than many of}} its contemporaries, such as the Kingman Spyder and Automag, the forces and pressures at play in the firing and recocking mechanisms must be balanced for the greatest effectiveness at the desired shot velocity, something {{that does not have}} to be done (at least to this degree) in any other marker. This is generally known as [...] "sweet-spotting" [...] the marker, or more specifically the marker's high-pressure regulator or HPR. If the HPR is set at too low a pressure, the marker will get insufficient pressure to fire the ball at the desired velocity or even to operate. If set too high, the pressure against the back of the valve will work against the hammer opening the valve to fire the paintball and again reduce velocity. Either way, the consistency of shots and the gas efficiency of the marker are reduced, and a common complaint among inexperienced Autococker users is that they do not get many shots from a full tank of air or CO2. Balancing the marker requires firing several shots over a chronograph to find the [...] "sweet spot" [...] of the HPR (the point at which the velocity is highest, then adjusting the hammer spring tension to increase or decrease velocity, and re-adjusting the HPR to find the new sweet spot, until the marker is firing at field limits with the HPR at or near its sweet spot. The LPR controlling the pneumatics must then be adjusted to use the least amount of pressure necessary to move the <b>back</b> <b>block</b> fully rearward. This process requires access to a shooting range with a chronograph, and significant time, air, paint and patience, which many casual players do not possess.|$|E
