But it is useful to know the box concept because it enhances our understanding of TEX, helps us to avoid and solve problems and can even propose solutions for unusual circumstances.

40|$|Abstract The book Digital Typography Using LATEX was {{published}} by Springer–Verlag in 2002, but has been mostly ignored by the LATEX community. However, Syropoulos and his co-authors have put lots of effort in creating a very good guide for the novice and the aspiring TEXnician. Despite some objections on how the book is structured, {{it can be said}} that Digital Typography Using LATEX is a very good, if not excellent, everyday guide for producing <b>beautiful</b> <b>documents.</b> In 2002, Apostolos Syropoulos, the founder and president of the Greek TEX LUG (∗eφτ∗), together with Antonis Tsolomitis and Nick Sofroniou, two other Greek TEX gurus, published an extensive guide of LATEX and other related typesetting systems and gismos [1]. The book passed almost unnoticed by the TEX commu-nity, with the exception of a few citations in TUGboat [2, 3] and elsewhere [4, 5]. Considering that this book merits some more attention, it is worth presenting it in the pages of The PracTEX Journal. The two first questions that come to mind when you face yet-another-LATEX...|$|R

40|$|A questão das relações entre igreja e Estado provocou debates prolongados e acesos, principalmente durante a idade média, no momento em que a Igreja, dotada de um domínio próprio temporal, encontrava-se em convívio com o Sacro Império Romano que abraçava os mesmos súditos e apoiava-se sobre bases jurídicas derivadas do cristianismo. Sob tal situação ainda era possível manter uma diferenciação entre Estado e Igreja? No presente estudo, apresentaremos a polêmica causada pela teoria do Papa Bonifácio VIII, no conflito com o Rei Filipe, o Belo. Daí surgem três documentos importantes, entre eles, a Bula Unam Sanctam.

5000|$|Transitioning from {{hobbyist}} to horticulturist, Powell {{needed a}} way to forward his finds to researchers and preserve them for future reference. He studied the standardized method for specimen preservation and storage. Specimens were dried by extracting moisture in a device called a plant press; however in one instance he noted: [...] "Live flower mashed flat with finger." [...] Although he was initially cautioned against it, he added artificial heat (an electric light bulb or electric iron) which aided {{in the quality of}} the results in the tropics. In a letter to Rolfe, Powell asks: [...] "It drying was done over an Electric Light Bulb while lighted up. I {{have done a lot of}} experimenting in the drying of flowers, both with stove and sun heat, but this seems to have been the most successful. How is it for a Specimen?" [...] The pressed plant could then be affixed to a mounting sheet (11 X 17 inch paper). Label data (essential documentary information) was added. Once label data was added to the mounting sheet, it was ready for shipping. The mounting sheet (specimen) became a candidate for long-term storage in a repository (like the Harvard University Herbaria). Once accepted, the mounting sheet would then be known as a herbarium specimen. At first he sent just the preserved flowers, but soon he was asked to send preserved plants that included the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds. Powell painstakingly crafted his mounting sheets; he enhanced them with fieldnotes, illustrations, flower cutouts, and photographs. His original sheets would stand on their own as works of art; over time they have evolved into <b>beautiful,</b> remarkably detailed <b>documents.</b>|$|R
