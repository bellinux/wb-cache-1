5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. <b>Bathymetry</b> and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|For a given {{topography}} and <b>bathymetry</b> {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the surge force (for the same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E

40|$|New {{theories}} {{to explain how}} tides and river flow determine estuarine <b>bathymetries</b> have been developed. The range of validity of these theories has been subsequently assessed against a recently available observational data set. Success in reproducing the evolution of estuarine <b>bathymetries</b> that has occurred over the last 10 000 years provides {{the basis for the}} translation, here, of these theories into new typologies. These then provide reference frameworks to enhance our perspective on existing morphologies and identify ‘anomalous’ estuaries. Further refinement of these new theories requires analyses of causal factors responsible for such anomalies drawing on classical morphological experience. These frameworks can also be used for calculating likely future bathymetric adjustments for prescribed changes in mean sea level, tidal amplitudes, river flow and sediment supply...|$|R

5|$|<b>Bathymetry</b> is {{the mapping}} and {{study of the}} {{topography}} of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring {{the depth of the}} sea include single or multibeam echosounders, laser airborne depth sounders and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries. The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle, and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper and mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. The crust below land is known as continental while that under the abyssal sea is called oceanic. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometers (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates. In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes. Heat is also produced and magma is forced up, creating underwater mountains, some of which grow into volcanic islands. Near some boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.|$|E

In this article, a linear stability analysis (LSA) model is used to characterize the morphological behaviour of the double bar system of Truc Vert beach.

First, the flat-bottom case is considered, then the effect of idealized <b>bathymetries</b> is analyzed. In the flat-bottom case an analytical equilibrium solution of the divergent quasigeostrophic equation forced by a periodic wind stress curl in a circular domain is recovered numerically {{in the framework of}} a primitive equation model. The initial spinup phase leading to the establishment of the lowest normal mode, the mode in equilibrium with the wind, and the free mode are then considered in a square domain. The equilibrium response to fluctuating winds reveals a westward intensification (absent in the inviscid theory as well as for free oscillations) that, unlike for steady western boundary currents, increases with increasing lateral friction. A dynamical explanation of this anomalous behavior in terms of vorticity balance is proposed. These westward intensified equilibrium solutions {{can be seen as the}} oscillating counterpart of the steady western boundary currents. The effect of idealized <b>bathymetries</b> is then analyzed.
