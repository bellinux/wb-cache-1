Another effect of fatty acids is to favour the inactivation of the glycerophosphate acyltransferase in extracts of adipocytes kept at 0 degree C. This inactivation is time-dependent and cannot be reversed by the addition of albumin to the assay mixture. Treatment of adipocytes with noradrenaline had no effect on the activity of the enzyme as long as the cells had been separated from fatty acids and albumin.

40|$|Plasma lipids and acyltransferase {{activities}} in experimental nephrotic syndrome. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and lysolecithin acyltransferase (LAT) are two activities {{carried out by}} the same plasma enzyme, but require different apoprotein activators. The LCAT reaction takes place primarily on high density lipoproteins (HDL) and is activated <b>by</b> <b>serum</b> <b>albumin,</b> whereas LAT takes place on low density lipoproteins (LDL) and is inhibited by albumin. In nephrotic syndrome (NS), the levels of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> are reduced, whereas the LDL levels are increased, and therefore, the ratio of LAT/LCAT activities should be increased. To test this hypothesis, we estimated the lipid levels and the two enzyme {{activities in}} experimental NS induced in rats by the injection of anti-FxlA antibody (passive Heymann nephritis). As found in other nephrotic conditions, the plasma lipid levels rose progressively as the proteinuria increased and the <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> concentration declined.

After adjustment for age, sex, and height, handgrip strength was most strongly correlated with lean body mass on the basis of creatinine kinetics (r = 0. 334, P < 0. 001), followed <b>by</b> <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> and subjective global assessment. Both men and women who died had lower handgrip strengths than did those who remained alive (P < 0. 001). After control for age, sex, diabetes, atherosclerotic vascular disease, GFR, hemoglobin, CRP, and <b>serum</b> <b>albumin,</b> greater handgrip strength was predictive of lower all-cause [hazards ratio (HR) : 0. 95 (95 % CI: 0. 92, 0. 99); P = 0. 005] and cardiovascular [HR: 0. 94 (0. 90, 0. 98); P = 0. 004] mortality. Conclusions: Handgrip strength not only is a marker of body lean muscle mass but also provides important prognostic information independent of other covariates, including CRP and <b>serum</b> <b>albumin.</b> Our data suggest that handgrip strength may be used in conjunction with <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> as a nutrition-monitoring tool in patients undergoing PD. © 2005 American Society for Clinical Nutrition.

40|$|Clearing of turbid amyloid A fibril {{containing}} agarose gels <b>by</b> human <b>serum</b> {{has been}} ascribed to 'amyloid degrading activity'. We report here that this optical phenomenon {{is not due}} to an enzymatic reaction, does not involve proteolysis of the fibril subunits and is not inhibited by sera of patients with AA amyloidosis. The extent of clearing correlates closely with the <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> concentration and, as previously reported <b>by</b> others, <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> itself causes clearing {{comparable to that of}} whole serum. Furthermore addition of albumin solutions to turbid aqueous suspensions of AA amyloid fibrils causes immediate clearing. <b>Serum</b> <b>albumin</b> is known to clarify turbid non-amyloid fibril containing gels and is used commercially to improve the optical properties of radial immunodiffusion plates. We therefore propose that this property of albumin, the mechanism of which is not yet understood, underlies the so called 'amyloid degrading activity' of human serum and the latter is not therefore likely to be of in vivo biological or clinical significance...|$|R
