500|$|As {{a direct}} result of the rescue operation, five {{aircraft}} were lost, 11 people were killed, and two were captured. Additional aircraft were seriously damaged. Hambleton wrote from an Air Force hospital after he was rescued. [...] "I had to stand <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> six young men die trying to save my life. It was a hell of a price to pay for one life. I'm very sorry." [...] His rescue was, according to Stars and Stripes, [...] "the biggest U.S. air rescue effort of the war." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonard Boyarsky, art {{director}} of the original Fallout, when asked about Interplay Entertainment's sale of the rights to Bethesda Softworks, said [...] "To be perfectly honest, I was extremely disappointed {{that we did not}} get the chance to make the next Fallout game. This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch.</b> Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E
500|$|Liptak said it portrays {{people as}} victims of technology, while Joyner commented it denotes that [...] "the {{way in which we}} are spoon-fed an almost {{constant}} stream of information through technology has turned us into passive consumers". Joyner believes that Brooker implicates the viewer with the story's credits scene, noting [...] "we're the ones with the smartphones, passively absorbing abuses to human rights and decency, and yet revelling in the image from the safety of the screen". Jeffery and Parker affirmed it contains the idea that people are preferring to document life rather than living it, as exemplified by [...] "people who see violence break out ... and decide to film it rather than intervene." [...] Leigh Alexander of Boing Boing said the episode reflects how violence is easily accessed on the Internet and quickly arouses people's attention. She noted, [...] "you can view the episode as a critique of all kinds of themes: Mob mentality, reality television, even the complicated treatment of women in the justice system ... Primarily, though, this episode is a critique of our deep, often-unexamined mass desensitization, or at least a dread portent of its potential to grow. It aims to ask: To what extent can you stand <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> horror before you are complicit, punishable?" ...|$|E

500|$|Apple filed {{a patent}} {{infringement}} suit against High Tech Computer Corp. (HTC) in March 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware {{in the two}} companies' ongoing battle with each other, and a complaint against HTC under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington, D.C. Apple's suit alleged 20 separate patent infringements relating to the iPhone's user interface, underlying architecture and hardware. Steve Jobs exclaimed [...] "We can sit <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> competitors steal our patented inventions, or {{we can do something}} about it. We've decided {{to do something about it}} ... think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours". The ITC rejected all but one of Apple's claims, however, ruling for Apple on a single claim relating to data tapping. HTC motioned the Delaware court for a change of venue to the Northern District of California, arguing against Apple's desire to consolidate the case with the similar cases brought by Nokia against Apple, alleging insubstantial overlap between those cases and Apple's complaint, but Judge Gregory M. Sleet denied HTC's motion for a venue change, ruling that Apple's choice of forum would prevail. HTC countersued Apple in September 2011 in the same court claiming infringement of four patents HTC obtained from Google, also filing a counter-complaint with the ITC, with HTC's general counsel saying [...] "HTC will continue to protect its patented inventions against infringement from Apple until such infringement stops." [...] In May 2012 the Delaware court ordered mediation between the companies. In November 2012, HTC and Apple ended the patent dispute by settling the case, but did not disclose the terms of the settlement. The companies reported the settlement included a 10-year agreement for licensing both companies' current and future patents to each other." ...|$|E

This was not done, but Irish Army field hospitals were set up and some money and arms were covertly supplied to nationalist groups for self-defence. Government ministers, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney, were later put on trial for allegedly supplying arms to republican paramilitaries.|$|E
2500|$|Don Zeno {{was being}} harassed by {{officials}} who {{felt he was}} a Communist, and even the Vatican turned against Don Zeno, calling him the [...] "mad priest." [...] The authorities decided to put the orphans into asylums and close down both Nomadelphia and Ceffarello. Dolci had to sit <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> as government forces took off {{with many of the}} commune's children, and had to gather up all his energy in the building of a new Nomadelphia. By 1952, he was ready to move on and work elsewhere.|$|E

2500|$|The Roman Catholic Church, led by its Los Angeles Archdiocese, also {{condemned}} {{the show and}} asked all American families to boycott it saying [...] "ABC should be told that American Catholics and all Americans {{are not going to}} sit <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> the networks have open season on Catholicism and morality. [...] {{is probably one of the}} most effective arguments for government censorship of TV that has yet come along." [...] In August, the Board of Rabbis of Southern California representing three branches of Judaism, joined the Catholic protest saying that the as-yet unaired show [...] "reached a new low".|$|E
2500|$|One {{response}} to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says: [...] "No doubt we do instinctively prefer {{to help those who}} are close to us. Few could stand <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but what we ought to do, {{and it is difficult to}} see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Corwin {{has said}} she entered {{politics}} in 2008 because she [...] "could not stand idly <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> state government spend away our children's future." [...] During her first campaign for the Assembly, she said the State needed to adopt a business-like approach, cut spending, cut taxes, end [...] "unfunded mandates" [...] and improve the business environment. She won the primary for the 142nd Assembly District seat against three other Republican candidates including incumbent Assemblyman Mike Cole, who had the Republican party endorsement, but who had been censured for fraternizing with an intern one year earlier. Corwin went on to defeat Working Families Party candidate Jeffrey Bono in the November 2008 general election, receiving 89 percent of the vote. She ran uncontested in the November 2010 general election, receiving endorsements from the Conservative and Independence parties of New York State.|$|E

25|$|It is {{even more}} tragic that other world leaders who witness {{repression}} pretend it is not happening, or is exaggerated.
