5|$|Lexus has {{not sold}} {{as well in}} Europe, where it suffers from smaller <b>brand</b> <b>recognition,</b> image, and a less-developed {{dealership}} network. In European markets, the Lexus LS has ranked behind Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW in flagship luxury car sales. Automotive analysts have suggested a possible rationale for the sales disparity, in that European buyers place less emphasis on vehicle reliability and have more brand loyalty to established domestic marques. In contrast, the Lexus LS has ranked second in sales to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (and ahead of rivals from BMW, Audi, and Jaguar) in markets outside Europe, such as South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{alcohol on}} {{television}} and in the press was outlawed under president Marc Ravalomanana. In order to maximize <b>brand</b> <b>recognition</b> of THB, the company altered the label for its Fresh shandy, which was exempt from this ban due to its low alcohol content, to match the THB Pilsener design but using a green background instead of the pilsener's red. The pilsener is advertised in a variety of non-traditional ways, such as through celebrity promotion in music videos and music and sporting event sponsorship. THB is considered by the public as a promoter of Malagasy culture and identity, particularly through its sponsorship of its annual THB Tour traveling music festival and the THB fête de la bière (beer festival). Three Horses Beer sponsors the THB Champions League, the national football championship. Many popular musical artists have advertised THB, including superstars Jerry Marcoss, AmbondronA, Samoëla, Tsiliva, Tence Mena and Jaojoby.|$|E

25|$|This {{is common}} with {{companies}} {{that want to}} retain <b>brand</b> <b>recognition</b> while moving away from an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became AT, Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC to de-emphasize the role of frying {{in the preparation of}} its signature dishes, and British Petroleum became BP. Russia Today has rebranded itself as RT. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.|$|E

Small businesses can benefit from social media marketing, due to its little to no start up costs which can decrease marketing costs, giving a personality to their brand, increased <b>brand</b> <b>recognition,</b> and higher conversion rates.

25|$|When Fortis faced near bankruptcy, {{its assets}} were divided among several companies. The same {{insurance}} branch which previously sponsored Feyenoord became ASR. To help with their <b>brand</b> <b>recognition,</b> {{it decided to}} continue Fortis' sponsor obligations, but in 2011, it announced it would stop its sponsorship deal in the 2012–13 season. However, due to an economic recession, Feyenoord had trouble finding a new shirt sponsor. Feyenoord and ASR therefore reached a compromise: ASR would remain sponsor for one more season, giving Feyenoord the time it needed to find another sponsor. After negotiations with several corporations, Opel became the club's new sponsor, signing a contract until 2018.|$|E

In late July 2003, the club went {{on a tour of}} the Far East as part of the pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's <b>brand</b> <b>recognition</b> in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons; however, the presence of global marketing icon such as Beckham made this particular tour a financial smash for los Merengues.|$|E
25|$|Part of the Commodore 64's {{success was}} its sale in regular retail stores instead of only {{electronics}} or computer hobbyist specialty stores. Commodore produced {{many of its}} parts in-house to control costs, including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology. It {{has been compared to}} the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production. Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles have been made for the Commodore64 including development tools, office productivity applications, and video games. C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, or a compatible video game console, to run these programs today. The C64 is also credited with popularizing the computer demoscene and is still used today by some computer hobbyists. In 2011, 17 years after it was taken off the market, research showed that <b>brand</b> <b>recognition</b> for the model was still at 87%.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} of social media is another channel or site that business' and brands must seek {{to influence the}} content of. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled {{all aspects of the}} ad, with social media, users are free to post comments right below an online ad or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social media strategy as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is about finding a balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There is a lot more attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain <b>brand</b> <b>recognition.</b> Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content.|$|E

40|$|The pink dollar {{market is}} a highly lucrative {{strategic}} target audience that commercial organisations seek, given its growing population and disposable income. However traditional marketing segmentation variables {{are unlikely to be}} effective as the key differential lies in that of the lifestyle and perceived values held by the market. This may include a <b>brand’s</b> <b>recognition</b> of gay culture or support of gay rights issues. In addition some organisations may be concerned that appealing to the gay market may alienate the heterosexual market. This paper aims to discuss the use of cryptic marketing as a strategic approach to target the pink dollar market and possible abandonment by non-gay consumers who {{do not want to be}} associated with a ‘gay brand’...|$|R

500|$|Many {{people have}} accused Steorn of {{engaging}} in a publicity stunt although Steorn denied such accusations.
