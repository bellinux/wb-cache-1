Although the <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitor</b> allows the user to take action based on the results, measurements such as the pulse rate, EKG signals, and calories do not necessarily serve to actively guide an individual's personal healthcare management.

50|$|The normal {{blood glucose}} level (tested while fasting) for non-diabetics, should be between 3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L (70 to 100 mg/dL).

Blood sugar levels for those without diabetes and who are not fasting should be below 6.9 mmol/L (125 mg/dL). The blood glucose target range for diabetics, according to the American Diabetes Association, should be 5.0-7.2 mmol/l (90-130 mg/dL) before meals, and less than 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) after meals (as measured by a <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitor).</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To re-examine the {{relation}} of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> to glycemic control among adolescents with type 1 diabetes and to evaluate {{the relation}} of demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial characteristics of adolescents who monitor more and less frequently. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 132 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (average age = 12 yr) and their parents, recruited from Children 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital of Pittsburgh. Adolescents were interviewed annually for five consecutive years after routine clinic appointments. At each assessment, data from <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> meters were downloaded and glycosylated hemoglobin A 1 c was recorded from medical records. RESULTS: More frequent <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> was related to better glycemic control. Adolescents who monitored more frequently were younger, from higher social status families, on insulin pumps, and had higher self-efficacy. Age-related declines in <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> occurred among adolescents with low self-esteem, high stressful life events, and lower parental support.

40|$|Background: Adherence to {{treatment}} {{has been defined}} as {{the degree to which a}} patient’s behavior corresponds to medical or health advice; however, the most appropriate method to evaluate adherence to diabetes care has yet to be identified. We conducted analyses to compare adherence assessments and <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> measures with regard to their ability to predict glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We analyzed four instruments to evaluate adherence: Self-Care Inventory-Revised, a self-administered survey; Diabetes Self-Monitoring Profile (DSMP), administered by trained researchers; a categorical (yes/no/sometimes) adherence self-evaluation; and a continuous (0 – 100) adherence self-evaluation. <b>Blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> frequency was evaluated by self-report, diary, and meter download. Results: Participants (n = 82) were aged 39. 0 ± 13. 1 years with a mean diabetes duration of 21. 2 ± 11. 1 years; 27 % <b>monitored</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> > 4 times/day. The DSMP score was the strongest predictor of glycemic control (r = − 0. 32, P = 0. 004) among adherence assessments, while <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> frequency assessed by meter download was the strongest predictor among <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> measures (r = − 40, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Clinical SciencesThomas SchermerhornThe use of {{continuous}} blood glucose monitors (CBGMs) has recently come into favor in human medicine {{for the control}} and monitoring of the diabetic patient.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control and <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> in {{intensive}} care unit (ICU) patients: two important aspects of care for and monitoring of critically ill patients. While the precise targets of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control in ICU patients remain a matter of debate, currently many, if not all, critically ill patients are treated with insulin at some point during their stay in the ICU. Although many patients are currently treated with insulin, it could be that certain patient groups benefit more from <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control than other patient groups. Several quality and safety metrics for <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control are proposed to be used, among others the mean <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level, the proportion of patients developing or samples showing dysglycemia, and glycemic variability. However, these metrics of quality and safety for <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control are only partly, and frequently inconsistently used. <b>Blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels are still monitored manually using point-of-care devices with significant inaccuracies. Manual <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> is not only time-and blood-consuming, but also bears the risk of incorrect adjustments of the insulin infusion rate.

Accuracy was assessed by comparing finger stick blood glucose values to venipuncture. Precision was assessed by comparing consecutive finger stick blood glucose values from 2 Prodigy AutoCode monitors. Data were analyzed using paired t tests, signed rank tests, regres-sion, and mixed effect models. Results: Fifty-three subjects completed the study. Meter 1 produced 14 (26 %) and meter 2 pro-duced 13 (25 %) blood glucose readings outside the acceptable error margin of+ 20 % set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Neither meter was accurate compared to venipuncture (P <. 001 for both). Consecutive blood glucose results obtained from meters 1 and 2 were precise (meter 1 vs 2, P. 533).

40|$|Insulin {{therapy has}} enabled {{diabetic}} patients to maintain blood glucose control to lead healthier lives. Today, rather than manually injecting insulin using syringes, a patient {{can use a}} device, such as an insulin pump, to programmatically deliver insulin.

40|$|Aim. This paper {{reports a}} study to {{investigate}} whether diabetes-specific, demographic and psychosocial variables predict adherence in young children with type 1 diabetes. Background. Paediatric diabetes rates are increasing worldwide; however, young children are neglected in treatment adherence research, despite the importance of adherence for health. Greater understanding of adherence in this group could enhance nurses' ability to provide care tailored to families' needs. Method. A cross-sectional study was carried out between 2001 and 2003 with 65 children aged 2 – 8 years and their mothers in Britain. Mothers were interviewed about children's diabetes care, nutritional analyses were conducted and mothers completed assessments of diabetes knowledge, parenting stress, family functioning and child psychological adjustment. Demographic and medical information was collected from patient records. Findings. Consistent with older populations, <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> and dietary regimens showed greater adherence variability than injection frequency and injection time consistency. Better maternal diabetes knowledge correlated with less injection time variability, more frequent <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring,</b> lower percentage energy intake from extrinsic sugars, lower glycosylated haemoglobin levels and fewer relationship difficulties. Longer diabetes duration, greater injection time variability and higher percentage energy intake from extrinsic sugars predicted less frequent <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring.</b> More relationship difficulties and less frequent <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monitoring</b> predicted higher percentage energy intake from extrinsic sugars. Conclusions. Nurses can facilitate treatment adherence through provision of educational, practical and socio-emotional support.
