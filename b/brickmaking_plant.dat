50|$|The Bucklands {{also had}} a <b>brickmaking</b> <b>plant</b> {{at the north end}} of Little Bucklands Beach near the old Bucklands Beach Yacht Club house in 1869. The brick works was owned by a Mr Spencer and managed by John Granger, who had arrived in New Zealand in 1865 to try his luck at the Thames goldfields (LaRoche 1991). He was a brickmaker by trade. Part bricks and field tiles can still be found at the {{northern}} end of Little Bucklands Beach, although many were buried by the dumping of material between the rock retaining wall and the roadside grass strip. It is possible that both bricks and field tiles were being made. The bricks were possibly used to line wells in the area. Various old wells can be found around Bucklands Beach such as at 31 and 42 The Parade, 23 Hattaway Ave next to the R.O.W., 15 Sunderlands Road, the site of an old farmstead, and by the supermarket at Highlands Park. The brickworks closed in 1878, when Granger bought the equipment and moved to Whitford Creek. The area was sometimes referred to as Grangers Point.One of the first (possibly the first) buildings on Bucklands Beach was a large boathouse built on the land at 44 The Parade by Mrs Biss. The building is evident in a 1910 photo.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 58 - 59. This {{thesis is}} a case study about a brickinaking plant in Türkiye. The principles of a process costing system are applied to a specific firm in this sector. This study {{will be used for}} understanding the cost structure and cost factors of a <b>brickmaking</b> <b>plant</b> and it is a source for making pricing decisions in a competitive market. In the thesis, the typical production technologies and departmentalization of the plant are explained and the cost factors are analyzed. A spreadsheet program calculates the cost for a brick. This study also covers some of the previous studies undertaken in other countries about the same subject. Özsümer, Eyüp HasanM. S...|$|E

[...] The {{entrepreneurs}} in Thessaloniki were mostly Jewish, unlike in other major Ottoman cities, where industrialization {{was led by}} other ethno-religious groups. The Italian Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing milling and other food industries, <b>brickmaking,</b> and processing <b>plants</b> for tobacco. Several traders supported {{the introduction of a}} large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production.|$|R
25|$|From {{the second}} half of the 19th century with the Ottoman reforms, the Jewish {{community}} had a new revival. Many French and especially Italian Jews (from Livorno and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environment for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialized Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian Jews Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing milling and other food industries, <b>brickmaking</b> and processing <b>plants</b> for tobacco. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Other notable names of the era include the Italian Jewish Modiano family and the Italians Poselli. With industrialization, many people of all faiths became factory workers, part of a new proletariat, which later led to the establishment of the Socialist Workers' Federation.|$|R
