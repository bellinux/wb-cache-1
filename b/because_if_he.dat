5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E

Later returning to his building, Scully finds his water being contaminated. As Mulder is entering in his building, he spots Krycek, whom he disarms and prepares to kill. However, Scully shoots him {{to prevent him from}} doing so, allowing Krycek to escape. Scully brings an unconscious Mulder to New Mexico and, when he awakens, reveals that his behavior was caused by a drug placed into his water supply and that she shot him <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had killed Krycek, it then would have been harder to prove his innocence in his father's death. She then introduces him to Hosteen, who has been translating the files on the digital tape.|$|E

Captain Delhemme believes that one passenger said that he refused to leave, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did the crew would be killed.

Lý Chiêu Hoàng thus became the only empress regnant in history of Vietnam. This decision of Lý Huệ Tông was considered by the historian Ngô Sĩ Liên as the crucial factor leading {{to the collapse of}} the Lý Dynasty, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had chosen a capable member of the royal family instead of his young princess, the situation for the Dynasty could have been different.|$|E
500|$|Since he {{was working}} with a largely non-professional cast, Forman's {{operating}} procedure was never to share the script with any of the performers, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had given them the screenplay, [...] "they’ll take it home to read, and their wives will end up directing your movie". [...] Instead, he chose to explain each scene in great detail just before starting to shoot takes, reciting the dialog from memory only one time, so that when the camera was rolling the actors had to try to remember {{as much as they could}} of what he had told them and then improvise to the best of their ability what they had forgotten or only half-understood. His cameraman was later to say that, as a result, all the performers were playing Miloš Forman playing their roles.|$|E

The Cleveland mayor was the insurgents' candidate for both the short and long Senate term, and had been elected in 1895 to his municipal position despite the opposition of Hanna and the Cleveland business community. [...] Rumors flew in Columbus that legislators had been kidnapped by either or both sides, and allegations of bribery were made. [...] James Rudolph Garfield, the late president's son, stated {{that he had been}} told by one Republican from Cleveland that he had to vote for McKisson <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did not, his contracts to sell the city brick pavers would be cut off.

I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution.

At the town's edge, he swerves his car to avoid hitting {{a girl in the}} road; as a result, he crashes the vehicle and loses consciousness. Waking up in town, he realizes that his daughter is missing, so he sets out to look for her. He meets police officer Cybil Bennett, who works in the nearby town of Brahms. Finding that the town is deserted and foggy, with snow falling out of season, Harry meets several other people in the monster-filled town: Dahlia Gillespie, who gives him a charm, the [...] "Flauros"; Doctor Michael Kaufmann, director of Silent Hill's Alchemilla Hospital; and nurse Lisa Garland, who worked at Alchemilla. He also encounters a symbol throughout the town, which Dahlia claims will allow darkness to take over the town if it continues to multiply. Eventually, this darkness begins taking over the town. According to Dahlia, the girl from the road is a demon responsible for the symbol's duplication. She urges him to stop the demon, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> does not, Cheryl will die. Harry soon finds himself attacked by Cybil, who is parasitized by a creature; the player must choose whether to save her or not.|$|E

He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was the next thing I did... everything was such a blur to me after this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days."

500|$|Duncan and his Spurs {{looked to}} re-assert {{themselves}} in the next 2004–05 season. Despite their new captain's slight statistical slump (20.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 2.6 blocks per game), the Spurs won the second seed for the 2005 NBA Playoffs by winning 59 games. In the first round, the Spurs eliminated the Denver Nuggets four games to one, and met the Seattle SuperSonics in the semi-finals. After splitting the first four games, Duncan led his team to two decisive victories, setting up {{a meeting with the}} Phoenix Suns, known for their up-tempo basketball. The Spurs managed to beat the Suns at their own game, defeating them 4–1 and earning a spot in the 2005 NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons. In the Finals, Duncan was pitted against Detroit's defensively strong frontcourt anchored by multiple NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace. After two convincing Game 1 and 2 wins for the Spurs, the Pistons double teamed Duncan and forced him to play further from the basket. Detroit won the next two games and the series was eventually tied at 3–3, but Duncan was instrumental in Game 7, recording 25 points and 11 rebounds as the Spurs defeated the Pistons. NBA.com reported that [...] "with his unique multidimensional talent, Duncan depleted and dissected the Pistons... He was the fulcrum of virtually every key play down the stretch", and coach Popovich added: [...] " [...] complete game is so sound, so fundamental, so unnoticed at times, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't score, people think, 'Well, he didn't do anything'. But he was incredible and he was the force that got it done for us." [...] Pistons center Ben Wallace remarked: [...] "He put his team on his shoulders and carried them to a championship hat's what the great players do." [...] Duncan won his third NBA Finals MVP Award, joining Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to win it three times.|$|E

J. P. Taylor, and, more recently, the German psychiatrist Manfred Lütz. Ian Kershaw has concluded that Hitler had no major psychotic disorders and was not clinically insane. The American psychologist Glenn D. Walters wrote in 2000: [...] "Much of the debate about Hitler's long-term mental health is probably questionable, <b>because</b> even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had suffered from significant psychiatric problems, he attained the supreme power in Germany rather {{in spite of these}} difficulties than through them." ...|$|R
2500|$|Mutombo also {{achieved}} {{a certain level}} of on-court notoriety. After a successful block, he was known for taunting his opponents by waving his index finger, like a parent reproaching a disobedient child. Later in his career NBA officials would respond to the gesture with a technical foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. To avoid the technical foul, Mutombo took to waving his finger at the crowd after a block, which is not considered taunting by rules. In addition, his flailing elbows were known for injuring several NBA players, including Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Patrick Ewing, Chauncey Billups, Ray Allen, Yao Ming, LeBron James and Tracy McGrady. His former teammate Yao Ming made a joke about it: [...] "I need to talk to Coach to have Dikembe held out of practice, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> hits somebody in practice, it's our teammate. At least in the games, it's 50/50." ...|$|E
2500|$|Organizational {{rewards and}} job {{conditions}} play {{a large role}} in perceived organizational support as well. [...] Sometimes, extrinsic motivation can mean more to an employee than intrinsic motivation because perceived appreciation has the power to turn a bitter employee into a content employee. [...] Eisenberger and Rhoades discuss the many ways that employers can show appreciation and reward their employees. [...] A few examples are paying their employees fairly; recognizing their employees for new ideas, exceptional work, etc.; promoting their employees when they deserve it; providing job security as incentive to remain with the organization; encouraging autonomy to correspondingly increase production and morale; reduce stress when made aware of it; and to provide proper training, to ensure employees' confidence in their jobs. [...] Some of these factors carry less weight than others do. [...] Being autonomous increases an employee's desire to continue to remain loyal to his or her organization <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> feels competent and confident in his ability to do well, he will be less likely to give up or lose faith.|$|E
2500|$|Yzerman's first {{off-season}} with Tampa Bay {{began with}} a splash. With the sixth pick of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, the Lightning selected forward Brett Connolly despite a history of injuries while playing for the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Prince George Cougars. When asked about Connolly's injuries being {{a factor in the}} decision to draft him, Yzerman boldly declared, [...] "I think it was a factor that he was available with the 6th pick. <b>Because</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been healthy all year, based on everything I know, he would not have been available with the 6th pick." [...] On July 1, 2010, veteran blueliner Andrej Meszaros was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for their second round pick in 2011. Later that day, the Lightning signed their star winger Martin St. Louis to a four-year, $22.5million contract extension to come into effect on July 1, 2011. On July 19, in another move with the Flyers organization, the Lightning traded defenseman Matt Walker and Tampa Bay's fourth round pick in 2011 for high-scoring winger Simon Gagne. Other off-season acquisitions included the signing of forwards Sean Bergenheim, Dominic Moore and Marc-Antoine Pouliot, along with defensemen Brett Clark, Randy Jones and Pavel Kubina and goaltender Dan Ellis, as well as the re-signing of restricted free agent forward Steve Downie to a two-year, $3.7million deal.|$|E
