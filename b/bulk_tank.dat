5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria in {{milk can}} come from sources other than the animal. Over time the milking {{pipeline}} and equipment can become coated with residues such as milkstone which are not removed by standard detergents and require periodic flushing of equipment with high strength corrosives. Automatic washing equipment for the <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> may not effectively clean all interior surfaces, and does not clean {{the exterior of the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> at all.|$|E

25|$|As established, these {{measurements}} are taken daily from the milk <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> {{and not from}} individual cows. This is because testing of individual animals at each milking would be expensive, {{but it also means}} that milk from a sick cow is diluted and averaged down by the healthy animals. Greater bulk tanks at very great commercial farms are accommodating of more sick animals in the herd, without the sick animals affecting the overall milk quality rating.|$|E
25|$|This {{cooling method}} {{worked well for}} smaller dairies, however was fairly inefficient {{and was unable to}} meet the {{increasingly}} higher cooling demand of larger milking parlors. In the mid-1950s direct expansion refrigeration was first applied directly to the bulk milk cooler. This type of cooling utilizes an evaporator built directly into the inner wall of the storage tank to remove heat from the milk. Direct expansion is able to cool milk at a much faster rate than early ice bank type coolers and is still the primary method for <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> cooling today on small to medium-sized operations.|$|E
25|$|Somatic cells {{originate}} {{only from}} inside the animal's udder, while bacteria are usually from external contamination, such as insufficient cleaning of the milk transport equipment or insufficient external cleansing of the cowâ€™s udder and teats prior to milking. Milking equipment can also be accidentally knocked or kicked off an animal onto the floor, and contaminants on the barn floor can be sucked into the milk line by the system vacuum. A filter sock or filter disk in the pipeline prevents large particulate contaminants from entering the milk <b>bulk</b> <b>tank,</b> but cannot remove bacterial contamination once it has occurred.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of refrigeration and better road transport, {{in the late}} 1950s, has meant that most farmers milk their cows and only temporarily store the milk in large refrigerated <b>bulk</b> <b>tanks,</b> from where it is later transported by truck to central processing facilities.|$|R
25|$|A pillow plate {{exchanger}} {{is commonly}} used in the dairy industry for cooling milk in large direct-expansion stainless steel <b>bulk</b> <b>tanks.</b> The pillow plate allows for cooling across nearly the entire surface area of the tank, without gaps that would occur between pipes welded to {{the exterior of the}} tank.|$|R

2500|$|Milking {{machines}} {{are held in}} place automatically by a vacuum system that draws the ambient air pressure down from [...] of vacuum. The vacuum {{is also used to}} lift milk vertically through small diameter hoses, into the receiving can. A milk lift pump draws the milk from the receiving can through large diameter stainless steel piping, through the plate cooler, then into a refrigerated <b>bulk</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some milk {{handling}} systems eliminate the receiver bowl and transfer pump by having rubber seals on the <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> covers, {{to permit the}} entire tank to be under vacuum until milking is finished. Milk can then just flow directly by gravity from the pipeline into the <b>bulk</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E

50|$|On May 26, 2009, at 11:07 am, about 14 tons {{of ammonia}} leaked from a <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> {{carrying}} about 15 tons. The ammonia was being {{transferred from the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> to a smaller tank on a truck; however, a hose from the truck caught a valve from the tank and pulled several hoses off it, resulting in the spill. Ammonia, which is used as fertilizer, is poisonous and flammable.|$|E
50|$|There {{is usually}} a {{transition}} point to move the milk from the pipeline under vacuum to the <b>bulk</b> <b>tank,</b> which is at normal atmospheric pressure. This is done by having the milk flow into a receiver bowl or globe, which is a large hollow glass container with electronic liquid-detecting probes in the center. As the milk rises to a certain height in the bowl, a transfer pump is used to push it through a one-way check valve and into a pipe that transfers it to the <b>bulk</b> <b>tank.</b> When the level has dropped far enough in the bowl, the transfer pump turns off. Without the check valve, the milk in the <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> could be sucked back into the receiver bowl when the pump is not running.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, the LNG {{supply chain}} {{is the main}} thing that has held back this fuel source from growing rapidly. The LNG supply chain is very {{analogous}} to that of diesel or gasoline. First, pipeline natural gas is liquefied in large quantities, which is analogous to refining gasoline or diesel. Then, the LNG is transported via semi trailer to fuel stations where it is stored in <b>bulk</b> <b>tanks</b> until it is dispensed into a vehicle. CNG, on the other hand, requires expensive compression at each station to fill the high-pressure cylinder cascades.|$|R
50|$|Amish {{dairy farms}} have {{discarded}} the metal milk bucket and three-legged stool {{in favor of}} an automated milking system. The Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture demand that certain guidelines be followed before milk can be marketed. Thus, power equipment and refrigerated <b>bulk</b> <b>tanks</b> are a necessity and permitted. However, the electricity needed to run a modern dairy must be produced, typically using gas or diesel generators. This may be more expensive than grid electricity, but lacks the degree of intrusion on Amish values and households that would result if fixed-line external power were used.|$|R

2500|$|In {{order to}} prevent spoilage, milk can be kept {{refrigerated}} and stored between [...] in <b>bulk</b> <b>tanks.</b> Most milk is pasteurized by heating briefly and then refrigerated to allow transport from factory farms to local markets. The spoilage of milk can be forestalled by using ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment. Milk so treated can be stored unrefrigerated for several months until opened but has a characteristic [...] "cooked" [...] taste. Condensed milk, made by removing most of the water, {{can be stored in}} cans for many years, unrefrigerated, as can evaporated milk. The most durable form of milk is powdered milk, which is produced from milk by removing almost all water. The moisture content is usually less than 5% in both drum- and spray-dried powdered milk.|$|R
40|$|Observations {{were made}} {{on the value of}} certain {{selective}} media for isolation and identification of staphylococci from milk obtained from individual quarters and farm <b>bulk</b> <b>tanks</b> Aerobic fermentation of mannitol salt was unreliable for identification of coagulase positive strains. Coagulase positive strains tended to clump when grown in tryptose serum broth. Tellurite glycine agar plates were not entirely reliable for the selection of coagulase positive strains. Fibrinogen-tellurite-glycine plates were very useful for the isolation of staphylococci from milk in the presence of other microorganisms and for the simultaneous identification of coagulase positive strains. Plate coagulase tests utilizing fibrinogen tellurite glycine agar corresponded almost perfectly with conventional tube tests. Fibrinolytic strains were not uncommon and were found also among beta hemolysin producing coagulase positive strains...|$|R
