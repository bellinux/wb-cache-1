The foreland basin typically shows a thermal and rheological structure similar to a rifted continental margin with three brittle layers above three ductile layers.

This composed of two ductile layers of higher moduli providing in both tension and compression zones to maintain the equilibrium conditions during flexure. The formulation shows that the flexural modulus of the entire section of laminated composites obtained by this method is equal to the modulus of ductile layers plus a factor of the difference of modulus of ductile and <b>brittle</b> <b>layers.</b> It is concluded that this factor is different from the usual one which is obtained under uniaxial loadings.

40|$|Existing {{conceptual}} growth {{models for}} faults in layered sequences suggest that faults first localise in strong, and <b>brittle,</b> <b>layers</b> and are later linked in weak, and ductile, layers.

The initially vertically segmented fault arrays are later linked via shallow dipping faults in the weak layers. Faults localise, therefore, as geometrically and kinematically coherent arrays of fault segments in which abandoned fault tips or splays are a product of the strain localisation process and do not necessarily indicate linkage of initially isolated faults. The modelling suggests that fault tip lines in layered sequences are more advanced in the strong layers compared to weak layers, where the difference in propagation distance is most likely related to strength and/or ductility contrast.

Integration of current and previous experiments shows that the evolution of deformation, in particular the amount of extension needed for the abandonment of boundary faults and migration of deformation to in-rift faults, is dependent on at least five boundary conditions: (i) thickness of <b>brittle</b> <b>layers</b> (including syn-rift sediments); (ii) thickness of ductile layers; (iii) extension rate; (iv) width of the weak zone localizing extension; and (v) rift obliquity {{with respect to the}} extension direction. An increase in the amount of extension corresponding to the inward migration of faulting (i. e., a longer phase of slip on boundary faults) is observed for (a) an increase in the thickness of both brittle and ductile crustal layers and syn-rift sediment accumulation, (b) a decrease in extension rate and width of the weak zone, and (c) a decrease in rift obliquity. A unified account of these correlations is presented, based on the hypothesis that fault migration occurs when boundary faults can no longer accommodate the imposed bulk extension, leading to time-space variations of internal strain and strain rate (and consequently stress) in the ductile layers which overcome the total resistance of <b>brittle</b> <b>layers</b> to thoroughgoing faulting...|$|R

The pendulum beam rotates in the horizontal plane around a virtual near-to-vertical axis that passes through the upper and lower mounting points. The Earth crust (the outer <b>brittle</b> <b>layer</b> of our planet, on average 35 km thick in continental areas) moves up and down by ten centimeters during the time of 12 and 24 hours due to the attraction of Moon and Sun, and is accompanied by a local tilting of some parts in a billion of radians.The movements of the pendulums has contributed to identify the free oscillations of the Earth, and to show that the secular term tilting of the cave is towards North-West.

40|$|The {{geometry}} and orientation of faults are examined using several field examples of small-scale (< lm displacement) fault systems. For isotropic rocks under triaxial compression, faults normally develop in conjugate sets about the maximum compressive stress (1), with dihedral angles usually of about 50 °, as {{predicted by the}} Coulomb theory of failure. In layered rocks, the geometry of faults varies with the orientation of layering {{with respect to the}} stress field. Where 1, is approximately normal to layering or anisotropy, conjugate faults also develop symmetrically about 1. Where rocks have interbedded layers with different mechanical behaviours, however, faults tend to initiate orthogonal to the more <b>brittle</b> <b>layers</b> (i. e. originate as extension fractures sub-parallel to 1), but oblique to the less <b>brittle</b> <b>layers.</b> As the fault steps through the layering, pull-aparts are developed which may reduce the dihedral angle. Where 1 is oblique (c. 25 – 75 °) to anisotropy, one set of faults is developed at a high angle to layering, with another at a low angle, usually showing a ramp-flat geometry. Large dihedral angles (up to 90 °) may result and 1, does not bisect this angle. Where 1 is approximately parallel to layering, two cases can be recognized. Where 3 is approximately normal to layering, faults with layer-parallel flats and contractional ramps develop. Where 2 is approximately normal to layering, conjugate faults develop which are symmetrical about 1, the geometry resembling that in isotropic rocks. These observations are in agreement with rock deformation experiments which show the strong effect of anisotropy on fault orientation, but the observations incorporate the effects of layering of materials with different deformation characteristics. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The central Iberian Peninsula (Spain) {{is made up}} {{of three}} main tectonic units: a {{mountain}} range, the Spanish Central System and two Tertiary basins (those of the rivers Duero and Tajo). These units are the result of widespread foreland deformation of the Iberian plate interior in response to Alpine convergence of European and African plates. The present study was designed to investigate thermal structure and rheological stratification in this region of central Spain. Surface heat flow has been described to range from f 80 to f 60 mW m 2. Highest surface heat flow values correspond to the Central System and northern part of the Tajo Basin. The relationship between elevation and thermal state was used to construct a one-dimensional thermal model. Mantle heat flow drops from 34 mW m 2 (Duero Basin) to 27 mW m 2 (Tajo Basin), and increases with diminishing surface heat flow. Strength predictions made by extrapolating experimental data indicate varying rheological stratification throughout the area. In general, in compression, ductile fields predominate in the middle and lower crusts and lithospheric mantle. Brittle behaviour is restricted to the first f 8 km of the upper crust and to a thin layer {{at the top of the}} middle crust. In tension, <b>brittle</b> <b>layers</b> are slightly more extended, while the lower crust and lithospheric mantle remain ductile in the case of a wet peridotite composition. Discontinuities in <b>brittle</b> and ductile <b>layer</b> thickness determine lateral rheological anisotropy. Tectonic units roughly correspond to rheological domains. <b>Brittle</b> <b>layers</b> reach their maximum thickness beneath the Duero Basin and are of least thickness under the Tajo Basin, especially its northern area.

Depth versus frequency of earthquakes correlates well with strength predictions. Earthquake foci concentrate mainly in the upper crust, showing a peak close to maximum strength depth. Most earthquakes occur in the southern margin of the Central System and southeast Tajo Basin. Seismicity is related to major faults, some bounding rheological domains.

40|$|Abstract. Large-scale tectonic {{structures}} such as orogens and rifts commonly display regularly– spaced faults and/or localized shear zones. Numerical models reproduce this phenomenon. To {{understand how}} fault sets organize with a characteristic spacing, we present a semi–analytical instability analysis of an idealized lithosphere composed of a <b>brittle</b> <b>layer</b> over a ductile half– space undergoing horizontal shortening or extension. The rheology of the layer is character-ized by an effective stress exponent, ne. The layer is pseudo–plastic if 1 /ne = 0 and forms localized structures if 1 /ne < 0. The tendency for localization is stronger for more negative 1 /ne. Two instabilities grow simultaneously in this model: the buckling/necking instability that produces broad undulations of the <b>brittle</b> <b>layer</b> as a whole, and the localization instability that produces a spatially periodic pattern of faulting. The latter appears only if the material in the <b>brittle</b> <b>layer</b> weakens {{in response to a}} local perturbation of strain rate, as indicated by 1 /ne < 0. Fault spacing scales with the thickness of the <b>brittle</b> <b>layer</b> and depends on the efficiency of localization. The more efficient localization is, the more widely spaced are the faults. The fault spacing is related to the wavelength at which different deformation modes within the layer enter a resonance that exists only if 1 /ne < 0. Depth–dependent viscosity and the model den-sity offset the instability wavelengths by an amount that we determine empirically. The wavenum-ber of the localization instability, is kLj = pi (j + aL) (− 1 /ne) − 1 / 2 /H, with H the thick-ness of the <b>brittle</b> <b>layer,</b> j an integer, and 1 / 4 < aL < 1 / 2 if the strength of the layer in-creases with depth and the strength of the substrate decreases with depth. 1...|$|E

"Thermal" lithosphere is about 90 km in thickness in shelf area, and thins toward the slope, lowers to 60 - 65 km in the lower slope, ocean crust and Xisha Trough. In the mid-west of the studied area, the lithospheric rheological structure in shelf area and Xisha Islands is of four layers: brittle, ductile, brittle and ductile. Because of uprising of heat mantle and thinning of crust and lithosphere in Xisha Trough, {{the bottom of the}} upper <b>brittle</b> <b>layer</b> is only buried at 16 km. In the eastern area, the bottom of the upper <b>brittle</b> <b>layer</b> in the north is buried at 20 km or so, while in lower slope and ocean crust, the rheological structure is of two layers of brittle and ductile, and crust and uppermost mantle form one whole <b>brittle</b> <b>layer</b> whose bottom is buried at 30 - 32 km. Analyses show that the characteristics of rheological structure accord with the seismic result observed. The character of rheological stratification implies that before the extension of the continent margin, there likely was a ductile layer in mid-lower crust. The influence of the existence of ductile layer to the evolution of the continent margin and the different extensions of ductile layer and <b>brittle</b> <b>layer</b> should not be overlooked.

Cracking in the Fe layers directly lead to the failure of the multilayer micropillars, although the Cu layers have very good ductility. The results imply that suppressing the cracking of <b>brittle</b> <b>layers</b> is more important than simply adding ductile layers for improving the overall ductility of metallic multilayers...|$|R
