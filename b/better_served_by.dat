5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters was not significantly large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too hard and fast or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of the German people would be <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} {{justifications}} for the exemption of the insane from criminal responsibility. When mental incapacity is successfully raised as a defence {{in a criminal}} trial it absolves a defendant from liability: it applies public policies in relation to criminal responsibility by applying a rationale of compassion, accepting that it is morally wrong to punish a person if that person is deprived permanently or temporarily of the capacity to form a necessary mental intent that {{the definition of a}} crime requires. Punishment of the obviously mentally ill by the state may undermine public confidence in the penal system. A utilitarian and humanitarian approach suggests that the interests of society are <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> treatment of the illness rather than punishment of the individual.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, {{the members}} of the county council decided by 45 votes to 27 to build a new county hall in Devizes, which is near the {{geographical}} centre of Wiltshire, and not at Trowbridge, very near its western edge. However, construction was delayed, and in 1933 the decision was reversed in favour of Trowbridge, {{on the grounds that it}} was <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> rail services. A site of several acres was bought in Bythesea Road, Trowbridge, not far from the railway station, for £1,650, and a new building designed by Philip Dalton Hepworth, perhaps inspired by a building in Amsterdam, was begun in 1938 and finished in 1940 at a cost of £150,000. Between 1940 and 1943, the new county hall, built in a pale stone, was seen as a potential landmark for German aircraft, so was disguised by covering it with camouflage nets.|$|E
25|$|Langston {{was twice}} {{threatened}} with destruction in the 1960s. In 1964, Washington, D.C., officials proposed closing {{the first nine}} holes of Langston Golf Course and building the Barney Circle Freeway on the land, but the National Park Service (which owned and managed the island at the time) refused {{to turn over the}} land to the city. In 1969, the city of Washington proposed closing all of Langston Golf Course and building extensive low-income public housing on the golf course and the rest of Kingman Island. The National Park Service rejected that plan as well. Perhaps the biggest threat to the course was a study by the Park Service in the mid-1960s which called for a new federally owned golf course to be built at Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm (just over the District line in Maryland). This study showed that D.C. golfers would be <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> the new course, and that Langston should be closed. But by 1977, the Oxon Cove course had yet to be built, and the plan died.|$|E

500|$|Ross rebuked Nogueira for {{allowing}} the broadcast, saying its content was insidious and goading. Nogueira agreed that Reedman's words were provocative, but said Portugal {{could not be}} blamed as it did not censor public broadcasts. Britain considered withdrawing Ross in protest, but its Foreign Office ruled this out, saying Britain {{could not afford to}} be without an ambassador in Lisbon to influence Portugal's actions in the event of UDI. British Cabinet Secretary Burke Trend rejected this view, pointing to Lisbon's conduct regarding Reedman, which he said showed the Portuguese [...] "ha very clearly made up their minds" [...] to support a Rhodesian UDI. The British ambassador {{would not be able to}} affect matters, he surmised, and British interests would be <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> immediately taking a firm hand against Portugal, in the hope that this would send a strong message to Rhodesia.

Hip hop writer Andrew Nosnitsky remarked in The Wire that Lil B was likely the only rapper who could pull off both an ambient release on Weird Forest and a collaboration with Soulja Boy in the same year. The San Francisco Bay Guardian said the album demonstrated Lil B's unpredictability; similarly, SF Weekly called it [...] "a different beast entirely" [...] {{from the rest of}} his work.

500|$|At the time, the Dutch {{naval force}} in the NEI, the Dutch Squadron in the East Indies, was widely seen as inadequate.

In response to the perceived threat of Japanese attack, the Dutch laid down a coastal defense ship, , and eight destroyers of the , while beginning plans for other ships. In addition, a submarine for the colony was approved in 1911. Four coast defense ships were projected in one of the two major bills to come before the House of Representatives in 1912. Specifications for these ships included an armament of four 280-mm (11-inch) and ten 102-mm (4-inch) guns and three torpedo tubes and they would have been armored with a belt of 152-mm (6-inch) and turret armor of 203mm (8inches).

500|$|The geopolitical {{situation}} tilted further against Smith in December 1974 when the South African Prime Minister BJ Vorster pressured him into accepting a détente initiative involving the Frontline States of Zambia, Tanzania and Botswana (Mozambique and Angola {{would join the}} following year). Vorster had concluded that Rhodesia's position was untenable and that South African interests would be <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> collaborating with black African governments over a Rhodesian settlement; he hoped that success in this might win South Africa some international legitimacy {{and allow it to}} retain apartheid. Détente forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup, and required the Rhodesians to release the ZANU and ZAPU leaders so they could attend a conference in Rhodesia, united under the UANC banner and led by Muzorewa. When Rhodesia stopped releasing black nationalist prisoners on the grounds that ZANLA and ZIPRA were not observing the ceasefire, Vorster harried Smith further by withdrawing the South African Police, which had been helping the Rhodesians patrol the countryside. Smith remained stubborn, saying {{in the run-up to the}} conference that [...] "We have no policy in Rhodesia to hand over to a black majority government" [...] and that his government instead favoured [...] "a qualified franchise for all Rhodesians... ensure that government will be retained in responsible hands for all times".|$|E
