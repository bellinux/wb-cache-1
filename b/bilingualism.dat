5|$|The Constitution Act of 1867 was {{designed}} to meet the growing calls of Canadians for autonomy from British rule, while avoiding the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the Civil War in the United States. The compromises made by the Fathers of Confederation set Canadians on a path to <b>bilingualism,</b> and this in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity.|$|E
5|$|Canada's post-war {{economic}} growth, {{combined with}} the policies of successive Liberal governments, {{led to the emergence}} of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, the implementation of official <b>bilingualism</b> (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971. Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans, though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Millhouse, now the State Parliamentary Leader of the LM, {{announced}} the LM's {{policy for the}} 1975 state election at the Adelaide Town Hall on 2 July. He outlined the LM's plans for economic rejuvenation: an end to compulsory unionism, budget and tax cuts, and measures to curb rising inflation and cost of living. Social policy included proposals for an early form of multiculturalism and promotion of 'cultural diversity' and <b>bilingualism.</b> Energy policy appealed {{to a new generation}} of environmentalists, and promoted conservation and promotion of solar power. He slammed the proposed City of Monarto as a 'monument to socialist folly'.|$|E
5|$|Of the 317 Finnish {{municipalities}}, 16 are monolingually Swedish. 33 municipalities are bilingually Finnish and Swedish; of these, 15 have a Swedish-speaking {{majority and}} 18 a Finnish-speaking one. Four municipalities, all located in Lapland, have a Finnish-speaking majority and a Sami-speaking minority: Enontekiö, Inari, Sodankylä and Utsjoki. Initially, only Swedish was accorded official <b>bilingualism,</b> through a language act of 1922; similar provisions were extended to Sami through a 1991 law. The 1922 law {{was replaced by}} new but largely similar legislation in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of the Byzantine Empire, at least in its early stages, had a variety of mother tongues including Greek. These included Latin, Aramaic, Coptic, and Caucasian languages, while Cyril Mango also cites evidence for <b>bilingualism</b> {{in the south and}} southeast. These influences, as well as an influx of people of Arabic, Celtic, Germanic, Turkic, and Slavic backgrounds, supplied medieval Greek with many loanwords that have survived in the modern Greek language. From the 11th century onward, there was also a steady rise in the literary use of the vernacular.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg {{developed}} rapidly {{after the}} coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative <b>bilingualism</b> and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.|$|E
5|$|A {{multitude}} of languages {{are used by}} Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians, respectively. Nearly 6.8million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some {{of the most common}} non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi (430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490). Canada's federal government practices official <b>bilingualism,</b> which is applied by the Commissioner of Official Languages in consonance with Section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Federal Official Languages Act English and French have equal status in federal courts, parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.|$|E
5|$|Erromintxela {{is a mixed}} {{language}} (referred to as Para-Romani in Romani linguistics), deriving most of its vocabulary from Kalderash Romani {{but using}} Basque grammar, {{similar to the way}} the Angloromani language of the Roma in England mixes Romani vocabulary and English grammar. The development of the mixed language was facilitated by the unusually-deep integration of the Erromintxela people into Basque society and the resultant <b>bilingualism</b> in Basque. The language is in decline; most of the perhaps 1000 remaining speakers live on the coast of Labourd and in the mountainous regions of Soule, Navarre, Gipuzkoa and Biscay. The Erromintxela are the descendants of a 15th-century wave of Kalderash Roma, who entered the Basque Country via France. Both ethnically and linguistically, they are distinct from the Caló-speaking Romani people in Spain and the Cascarot Romani people of the Northern Basque Country.|$|E
5|$|First, the {{assigned}} herald develops a written description based on {{consultation with the}} petitioner. The petitioner then signs a contract with an artist at the authority to create the design. The Fraser Herald, serving as the CHA's principal artist, must review the design. At all stages the documents {{must be approved by}} both the petitioner and the Chief Herald. The final step is to prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes a drawing of the armorial bearings and the accompanying legal text and explanation of the symbolism of the bearings. Under Canadian <b>bilingualism</b> laws, letters patent are written in both English and French, though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document.|$|E
5|$|Multilingualism {{had been}} {{characteristic}} of Sicily for centuries, resulting from occupations by the Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans. While {{the slave trade}} during the Republican period brought speakers of Greek and other languages from the East to the island, Greek was the language of higher-status persons such as government officials and businessmen during the Imperial era. Immigration to Sicily in the early Empire originated more often in places where Latin was spoken than in Greek-speaking areas. African speakers of Latin were a significant presence in Sicily. Christian inscriptions {{are far more likely}} to be in Greek. In late antiquity, Greek-Latin <b>bilingualism</b> was common enough that it would have been acquired through everyday personal interaction. The Jewish communities of Syracuse seem to have been bilingual in Greek and Hebrew. There is some Sicilian evidence of Syriac.|$|E
5|$|As a part {{of their}} missionary efforts, members of various {{religious}} orders (principally Franciscan and Dominican friars and Jesuits) introduced the Latin alphabet to the Nahuas. Within the first twenty years after the Spanish arrival, texts were being prepared in the Nahuatl language written in Latin characters. Simultaneously, schools were founded, such as the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco in 1536, which taught both indigenous and classical European languages to both Native Americans and priests. Missionary grammarians undertook the writing of grammars, also called artes, of indigenous languages for use by priests. The first Nahuatl grammar, written by Andrés de Olmos, was published in 1547—three years before the first French grammar. By 1645 four more had been published, authored respectively by Alonso de Molina (1571), Antonio del Rincón (1595), Diego de Galdo Guzmán (1642), and Horacio Carochi (1645). Carochi's is today considered the most important of the colonial era grammars of Nahuatl. Carochi has been particularly important for scholars working in the New Philology, such that there is a 2001 English translation of Carochi's 1645 grammar by James Lockhart. Through contact with Spanish the Nahuatl language adopted many loan words, and as <b>bilingualism</b> intensified, even began changing the grammatical structure under influence by Spanish.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} consensus has, at times, broken down when {{other aspects of}} official <b>bilingualism</b> are examined. However, a significant shift in anglophone opinion has occurred since the mid-2000s, in favour of <b>bilingualism.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1974, a {{new policy}} {{mandated}} by the Government of Ontario strengthened institutional <b>bilingualism</b> at the university, with specific instructions to further <b>bilingualism</b> and biculturalism and preserve and develop French culture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bilingualism</b> {{involves}} the use of two languages by an individual or community. Neuroimaging studies of <b>bilingualism</b> generally focus on a comparison of activated areas when using the first language (L1) and second language (L2).|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{operates the}} Official Languages and <b>Bilingualism</b> Institute (OLBI). The OLBI was officially opened on 1 July 2007, replacing its predecessor, the Second Language Institute. Both institutes promoted English-French <b>bilingualism,</b> although the OLBI holds an expanded mandate, to strengthen research, innovation and outreach efforts in official languages and <b>bilingualism.</b> The university {{is a member}} of the Association of Universities of the Canadian Francophonie, an association which promotes post-secondary education and research in French.|$|E

25|$|The Acadian {{population}} {{began to}} become more prosperous and influential during the 1980s as linguistic tensions began to relax (although not disappearing entirely). The anglophone population of the city generally began to accept the principle of <b>bilingualism</b> and enrollment in French Immersion classes in public schools became popular. <b>Bilingualism</b> would ultimately {{become one of the}} strengths of the community.|$|E
25|$|Austronesian {{content in}} Kalaw Lagaw Ya (and the {{neighbouring}} Papuan languages) {{appears to be}} mainly lexicon (including verbs), particularly in the spheres of sea, farming, canoe and sky/weather/astrological terminology, with some possible syntactic words. This presents {{a picture of a}} typically extensive borrowing situation with much lexical borrowing and some structural borrowing with a large amount of passive <b>bilingualism</b> and little active <b>bilingualism.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{institutional}} <b>bilingualism</b> {{and strong}} Francophone identities are {{arguably the most}} enduring legacy of New France.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the study of}} <b>bilingualism</b> in children, similar research is being conducted in adults. Research findings show that although bilingual benefits are muted in middle adulthood, they are more profound in older age when those who develop dementia experience onset about 4.5 years later in bilingual subjects. The increased attentional control, inhibition, and conflict resolution developed from <b>bilingualism</b> may be accountable for the later onset of dementia.|$|E
25|$|The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for <b>Bilingualism</b> {{was set up}} on 28 November 2011. The Fund aims {{to promote}} <b>bilingualism</b> amongst young {{children}} in Singapore, is set up to supplement existing English and Mother Tongue language programmes in teaching and language learning. It is managed by a Board chaired by the Singapore's Minister of Education, Mr Heng Swee Keat and advised by an International Advisory Panel of Experts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bilingualism</b> {{is one of}} Trudeau's most lasting accomplishments, {{having been}} fully {{integrated}} into the Federal government's services, documents, and broadcasting (not, however, in provincial governments, except for Ontario, New Brunswick, and Manitoba). While official <b>bilingualism</b> has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians {{would be able to}} function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were.|$|E

25|$|Despite these findings, many {{therapists}} {{and other professionals}} maintain that simultaneous <b>bilingualism</b> can be harmful for a child's cognitive development. One side argues that only one language should be spoken until fluently spoken and then incorporate the second language. The other side argues that the child, whether simultaneously bilingual or not, would still have speech issues. Some bilingual families have chosen to stop speaking a language after hearing about the supposed negative developmental effects of child <b>bilingualism</b> from people in authority.|$|E
25|$|In {{reaction}} to events in Quebec and formal {{demands of the}} Lesage government, Lester Pearson's ruling Liberal government in Ottawa sought to address the new political assertiveness of Quebec. He commissioned the Royal Commission on <b>Bilingualism</b> and Biculturalism in 1963. Pearson also recruited Pierre Trudeau, who campaigned against the violation of civil liberties under Duplessis and {{the economic and political}} marginalization of French Quebecers in the 1950s. Trudeau saw official <b>bilingualism</b> in Canada as the best way of remedying this.|$|E
25|$|Language policy {{remains a}} {{perennial}} issue in New Brunswick society and politics. Recurring debates have arisen {{in regards to}} interpretation of the provincial <b>bilingualism</b> policy, duality (the system of parallel French and English speaking public services), and specifics of implementation. The extent of the provincial policy on <b>bilingualism</b> means that a new row is never far off in the New Brunswick news cycle. The French-speaking community continues to advocate for full funding of French-language public services and fair representation in public sector employment, while some Anglophones (and Francophones) fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile, or that the provincial governments targets for <b>bilingualism</b> in public employment are hurting their chances {{to work for the}} government, as Anglophones are less likely than Francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment.|$|E
25|$|Military {{education}} for Canadian officers {{is focused on}} the four components unique to the military colleges: military training, physical fitness, <b>bilingualism</b> and academic excellence.|$|E
25|$|With {{regards to}} issues of {{diversity}} (<b>bilingualism</b> and multiculturalism), the Conservatives {{tend to be more}} majoritarian, favouring a reduced scope for official <b>bilingualism</b> and a more assimilationist approach to immigrants and Native peoples. The Liberals and NDP are more pluralistic including generous government support for minority cultures, while the BQ favour viewing Canada as two separate societies (English Canada and Quebec), and advocate strong protections for French language and culture in Quebec while remaining unconcerned about issues with other minorities or {{in other parts of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|Canada’s {{thirteen}} provincial {{and territorial}} education systems place {{a high priority}} on boosting the number of bilingual high school graduates. For example, in 2008 New Brunswick's provincial government reconfirmed its goal of boosting the percentage of <b>bilingualism</b> among graduates from its current rate of 34% to 70% rate by 2012. In 2003, the federal government announced a ten-year plan of subsidies to provincial education ministries {{with the goal of}} boosting <b>bilingualism</b> among all Canadian graduates from its then-current level of 24% to 50% by 2013.|$|E
25|$|However, bilingual {{acquisition}} {{can also}} {{be affected by the}} amount of input, the separation of input, and the stability of input, as well as attitudes about <b>bilingualism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Stroop {{test has}} {{additionally}} been modified to include other sensory modalities and variables, {{to study the}} effect of <b>bilingualism,</b> or to investigate the effect of emotions on interference.|$|E
25|$|Formed in April 1978 {{and led by}} Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, the Goh Report {{assessed}} the bilingual education programme in Singapore.The Ministry of Education saw its <b>Bilingualism</b> policy as not being universally effective. The Goh Report critiqued the Bilingual policy as ineffective <b>bilingualism</b> leading to {{the main cause of}} language education problems in Singapore. Although the Bilingual policy resulted in a rise in overall literacy rate, statistics reveal that less than 40% of the School-going Students had the minimum competency level in two languages at a time.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneous trilingualism is also possible. There is {{significantly}} less {{research in this}} area than in simultaneous <b>bilingualism.</b> However, trilingual language acquisition in young children has been shown to generally mirror bilingual acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Pearson {{also started}} {{a number of}} Royal Commissions, {{including}} the Royal Commission on the Status of Women and the Royal Commission on <b>Bilingualism</b> and Biculturalism. These suggested changes that helped create legal equality for women, and brought official <b>bilingualism</b> into being. After Pearson's term in office, French was made an official language, and the Canadian government provided services in both English and French. Pearson himself had hoped {{that he would be}} the last unilingual Prime Minister of Canada and fluency in both English and French became an unofficial requirement for candidates for Prime Minister after Pearson left office.|$|E
