The proposed <b>action</b> <b>level</b> for n-propylbenzene {{was derived}} by analogy based on structural similarities to another alkyl aromatic hydrocarbon, ethylbenzene, {{and is based}} on non-carcinogenic effects (hepatotoxicity) observed in experimental animal studies. However, recent data which was not accounted for in the development of OEHHA's public health goal (PHG) for ethylbenzene (on which the n-propylbenzene <b>Action</b> <b>Level</b> is based), show ethylbenzene to be an animal carcinogen (IARC, 2000). It is not clear at this time whether n-propylbenzene could be expected to have carcinogenic effects (neoplasms in kidneys and testes of Fischer rats, and in lungs of male and liver of female B 6 C 3 F 1 mice) similar to those found with ethylbenzene. Based on this uncertainty, we do not agree with the Department of Health Services (DHS) proposal to base the <b>Action</b> <b>Level</b> for n-propylbenzene on toxic effects of ethylbenzene, either from the earlier OEHHA evaluation, or including the ethylbenzene carcinogenicity study of Chan et al. (1998). As the n-propylbenzene toxicological data is insufficient to derive an <b>action</b> <b>level,</b> it is OEHHA's recommendation that the <b>Action</b> <b>Level</b> for n-propylbenzene be based on another structural analog, cumene, for which there is appropriate subchronic oral toxicity data.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Symptoms and {{secondary}} disorders associated with excess central fat distribution are being increasingly recognised. We aimed {{to define the}} symptoms and assess risks of chronic disorders in people with large waist circumferences. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study of 5887 men and 7018 women aged 20 - 59 years {{from the general population}} of Maastricht, Amsterdam, and Doetinchem, Netherlands. We assessed in health centres respiratory insufficiency, low back pain, degree of physical function, presence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors. We measured bodyweight, body-mass index, and waist circumference by <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> (men: less than <b>action</b> <b>level</b> 1 or = 102. 0 cm; women: less than <b>action</b> <b>level</b> 1 or = 88. 0 cm). The reference group were people with waist circumferences lower than <b>action</b> <b>level</b> 1. FINDINGS: All symptoms and risks increased among participants higher than <b>action</b> <b>level</b> 2, after adjustment for age and lifestyle, by 3. 1 (95 % CI 2. 5 - 3. 7) in men and 2. 7 (2. 3 - 3. 1) in women for shortness of breath when walking upstairs; 4. 5 (2. 5 - 7. 8) and 3. 8 (1. 9 - 7. 3) for non-insulin-dependent diabetes; and 4. 2 (3. 6 - 5. 0) and 2. 8 (2. 4 - 3. 2) for at least one major cardiovascular risk factor. Above <b>action</b> <b>level</b> 2, compared with the reference group, men and women were at twice the risk of difficulties in everyday activities, women were 1. 5 {{times more likely to have}} low back pain or symptoms of intervertebral disc herniation, with secondary problems including hindrance to daily activities.

50|$|The {{first step}} in {{mitigation}} is testing {{to see if the}} indoor-air and/or domestic water radon concentrations should be reduced.

The World Health Organization's International Radon Project has recommended an <b>action</b> <b>level</b> of 2.7 pCi/l for radon in the air.

40|$|Purpose: This {{document}} is intended solely {{as a quick}} reference guide for use by public health and environmental officials in evaluating data collected from structures in which mercury pressure regulating devices for natural gas meters were moved from inside to outside the structures {{as part of a}} modernization process. It does not provide detailed justifications for environmental sampling requirements, as health consultations or environmental sampling plans may do. In the past, ATSDR has been reluctant to provide a list of suggested <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> such as this because of the site specific nature of exposures. ATSDR has recognized that <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> can differ according to differing populations, exposure durations, concentrations, and specific hazards. However, the immediacy and extent of the potential health risk associated with mercury contamination in the present situation require publication of this guide. Many parts of the country may be affected by the possible exposure to mercury resulting from re-positioning of mercury-containing gas pressure regulators and the subsequent response efforts of gas utilities, public health and environmental officials. Moreover, the involvement of multiple health and environmental jurisdictions creates a need for consistency in presenting health risk information. Therefore, ATSDR, at the request of a state health department and an U. S. EPA regional office, is attempting to provide suggested <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> for various response activities under different exposure scenarios. Background: In this context, an <b>action</b> <b>level</b> is an indoor air concentration of mercury vapor, which should prompt consideration of the need to implement a recommended response by public health and environmental officials. The various suggested <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> provided in this document are intended as recommendations, not as regulatory values or cleanup values, although some may correspond to present or future values adopted by regulatory authorities. The suggested <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> presented in this document recognize that an individual must be exposed to a sufficient concentration over some specific period of time in order for mercury vapor to cause adverse health effects. The suggested <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> also recognize that while individual susceptibility may vary, developing fetuse...|$|R

40|$|In the {{previous}} chapter, various testing methods for assessing health risks were evaluated for their usefulness in regulating environmental contaminants— i. e., setting an <b>action</b> <b>level</b> or tolerance.

30|$|Comparisons {{between the}} Types I and II {{indicate}} some key features {{that contribute to}} STR. On one hand, one can relate STR {{to the fact that}} the system contains some kind of a threshold. A fluctuating stimulus that is frozen across trials yields threshold crossings that are more robust with occasional large amplitude fluctuations, thus making the spike timing more reliable. This is particularly true when the intrinsic noise is relatively small. This observation is consistent both with the monotonic increase in reliability as a function of noise intensity (Fig.  3) and, with the typically increased reliability of SEEs related to higher <b>action</b> <b>levels.</b> In both types, we observe this increase in <b>action</b> <b>level</b> as the voltage approaches the spiking threshold in a reliably reproducible spike. On the other hand, dynamic properties of a neuron sometimes make it respond in an amplified way to certain stimulus profiles. In a recent study, Paydafar [22] showed that a specific wave form of noise facilitates the switch between a stable fixed point and a stable periodic solution. This helps explain why SEEs with certain time profiles are more favorable for inducing reliably timed spikes. Results in Fig.  8, obtained by subdividing the individual “reliable” SEEs into subgroups with different temporal profiles, suggest that, among all the reliable SEEs, the one-third that has lower <b>action</b> <b>level,</b> but with a more favorable time profile actually triggers spikes with higher precision (Fig.  8). While this relationship between <b>action</b> <b>level</b> and precision is observed for both types, the two types differ in the magnitude of the increased <b>action</b> <b>level</b> before the spike, the distribution of observed <b>action</b> <b>levels,</b> the distribution of the values of the gating variable w when the voltage reaches its threshold, and shifts in the precision distributions for the reliable SEEs.|$|R

A radon remediation programme based on an <b>Action</b> <b>Level</b> above 200 Bq m− 3 will cost less and will target those most at risk, but will be less cost-effective and will lead to higher residual dose and greater risk of cancer in the remaining population.

These cutoff points {{have been based on}} analysis in mainly middle-aged and younger adults. In this article, we examine the applicability of the suggested waist <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> in an older population. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6, 423 men and women aged 55 or over participating in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study. MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivities and specificities of the proposed waist <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> in relation to the cutoff points for BMI and WHR were calculated. Also, cardiovascular risk factor levels at baseline examination in the different categories defined by high/low waist circumference, BMI and WHR were investigated. RESULTS: At waist <b>action</b> <b>level</b> 1 (waist circumference > or = 94 cm in men, > or = 80 cm in women), sensitivity was 71 % in men and 86 % in women for detecting those with high BMI (> or = 25 kg/m 2) and/or WHR (> or = 0. 95 in men, > or = 0. 80 in women). At waist <b>action</b> <b>level</b> 2 (waist circumference > or = 102 cm in men, > or = 88 cm in women in comparison with BMI > or = 30 kg/m 2 and/or WHR > or = 0. 95 in men, > or = 0. 80 in women), sensitivity was considerably lower: 35 % in men and 59 % in women. This was mainly due to a large proportion of subjects with low waist and BMI but high WHR. Specificity was high (> 90 %) at both <b>action</b> <b>levels.</b> Cardiovascular disease risk factors, except smoking, tended to increase with increasing waist circumference, WHR, and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: The suggested cutoff points for waist circumference are only to a limited degree useful in identifying subjects with overweight and obesity and/or central fat distribution in an older population. This concerns especially the upper cutoff point (waist <b>action</b> <b>level</b> 2) and is mainly due to the increased central distribution of fat with advancing age...|$|R
