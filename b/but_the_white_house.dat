In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> remained closed to the public.

2500|$|On August 6, 2015, Schumer {{announced}} {{his opposition to}} the nuclear deal with Iran. Schumer planned to tell the White House, then his Senate colleagues, and then the public, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> leaked the news during the Republican debate in what CBS News described as an [...] "apparent attempt to limit coverage". Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis derided Schumer's decision, noting that Schumer was making factually incorrect claims about the amount of time in which the treaty would allow inspection of Iranian nuclear facilities.

2500|$|High ran for {{governor}} again in 1966 under the slogan, [...] "Integrity is the issue". Governor Burns charged that Robert F. Kennedy was behind High's campaign, pointing to three High campaign aides who had previously worked for Sargent Shriver, a Kennedy ally. Kennedy denied taking sides. High had been close to the late President John F. Kennedy; {{he was the first}} elected official in Florida to support Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign. Burns claimed to have the support of President Lyndon B. Johnson and Vice President Hubert Humphrey, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> denied taking sides. Many conservative Democrats in Florida were alienated by High's racial views and ties to the Kennedys. High was from Miami, and people in the rest of Florida believed that urban Miami and Dade County represented high taxes and liberalism; the region was considered suspect.|$|E
50|$|In August of 1964, Representative William S. Moorhead of Pennsylvania {{proposed}} legislation {{to implement the}} commission's recommendations. Support from <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> followed in September, when Johnson lent his endorsement during a speech at Brown University. In March of 1965, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> proposed <b>the</b> establishment of a National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities and requested $20 million in start-up funds. The commission's report had generated other proposals, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House's</b> approach eclipsed them. The administration's plan, which called {{for the creation of}} two separate agencies each advised by a governing body, was the version that the Congress approved.

2500|$|In a major {{speech on}} January 21, 2010, Clinton, {{speaking}} {{on behalf of}} the U.S., declared that [...] "We stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas", while highlighting how [...] "even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable." [...] She also drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet. Her speech, which followed a controversy surrounding Google's changed policy toward China and censorship, appears to mark a split between authoritarian capitalism and the Western model of free capitalism and Internet access. Chinese officials responded strongly, saying Clinton's remarks were [...] "harmful to Sino-American relations" [...] and demanded that U.S. officials [...] "respect the truth", and some foreign policy observers thought that Clinton had been too provocative. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> stood behind Clinton, and demanded that China provide better answers regarding the recent Chinese cyberattack against Google. Clinton's speech garnered marked attention among diplomats, as {{it was the first time}} a senior American official had clearly put forth a vision in which the Internet was a key element of American foreign policy.|$|E

Bush, responded similarly, and {{declined to give}} Rather an interview during his presidency. After the Hussein interview, the White House was interested in a rebuttal interview. CBS News would accept President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney or Secretary of State Colin Powell for the interview, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> only offered other officials for the interview, such as Ari Fleischer and Dan Bartlett. The CBS network deemed these individuals inappropriate for the broadcast, and an American interview was never done.|$|E

At first, she turned it down, because, she explained, [...] "they wanted me there on my day off," [...] <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> amended its schedule to suit the veteran artist. During that time, there was also a visit from former First Lady turned book editor Jackie Onassis, who wanted to sign her for an autobiography but was unhappy with the co-author assigned to the project. The book was eventually done for another publisher, with the help of writer Frank Taylor.|$|E
2500|$|Greenleaf Point in Washington, D.C., {{is named}} for James Greenleaf. Little of Greenleaf Point was {{developed}} by the time Greenleaf was forced into bankruptcy. The city grew not on Greenleaf Point, as he anticipated, <b>but</b> around <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> around <b>the</b> United States Capitol, and between <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and Georgetown. By 1800, Greenleaf Point was still almost completely undeveloped. The only finished road through the area was New Jersey Avenue, on which two large buildings were constructed. Twenty half-finished structures, begun by Greenleaf, clustered around high land on South Capitol Street. The city's first Methodist church meeting was held in one of the [...] "20 Buildings" [...] in 1802. By 1824, however, the 20 Buildings were in ruins.|$|R
25|$|In late 2007, Turkey {{recalled}} its {{ambassador to}} the United States after the House Committee on Foreign Affairs passed a United States resolution on the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire.

An article by journalist Murray Waas has described a specific controversy over the PDB for September 21, 2001, which allegedly said that the US intelligence community had [...] "no evidence" [...] linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks, and [...] "scant credible evidence" [...] that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with al Qaeda.|$|E

With Charlie Rose, he proposed a bill that would limit tobacco price supports, <b>but</b> would allow <b>the</b> transfer of subsidy credits from non-farmers to farmers. He co-sponsored the bi-partisan move in 1982 to extend drug patent duration. Helms continued to pose obstacles to Reagan's budget plans. At the end of the 97th Congress, Helms led a filibuster against Reagan's increase of federal gasoline tax by 5-cents per gallon: mirroring his opposition to Governor Jim Hunt's 3-cent increase in the North Carolina gasoline tax, <b>but</b> alienating <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> from Helms.|$|R
50|$|Oscar Stanton De Priest was {{the first}} black elected to Congress in the 20th century and the first ever from outside the South. The Chicago {{district}} represented by Oscar De Priest had a reputation among some whites for political corruption, at a time when Chicago and other big cities were thought by whites to be dominated generally by machine politics built on ethnic immigrants and their descendants. Washington’s high white society had also shunned the De Priest couple, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> had established a tradition for the First Lady to entertain congressional wives at tea, and Lou Hoover and the president never considered snubbing Jessie De Priest.

50|$|Not {{long after}} this Wiedemann {{fell out of}} favour with Hitler as his rival Julius Schaub became the more {{important}} adjutant. Seeking a way out in January 1939 Wiedemann was appointed Consul General to the United States in San Francisco. In public, Wiedemann continued to support Nazism and apparently led a playboy lifestyle which included attendance at society parties, membership of the exclusive Olympic Club and regular appearances in the columns of Herb Caen. Allegations levelled in a case filed at the city's Federal District Court in 1941 also suggested that he worked on pro-Nazi initiatives with Henry Ford. In private, however, Wiedemann broke entirely with Nazism. He met with the British agent Sir William Wiseman, warning him of Hitler's unstable personality and urging Britain to attack Germany. He also offered to publicly denounce the German regime, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> at that time {{had no interest in}} such an offer.|$|E

On March 16, 2017, White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeated the claim. When Trump was questioned about the claim at a news conference, he said [...] "All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television.

5000|$|A study coauthored by the Center for Public Integrity {{found that}} {{in the two years}} after September 11, 2001 the {{president}} and top administration officials had made 935 false statements, in an orchestrated public relations campaign to galvanize public opinion for the war, and that the press was largely complicit in its uncritical coverage of the reasons adduced for going to war. PBS commentator Bill Moyers had made similar points throughout the run up to the Iraq War, and prior to a national press conference on the Iraq War Moyers correctly predicted [...] "at least a dozen times during this press conference he President will invoke 9/11 and Al-Qaeda to justify a preemptive attack on a country that has not attacked America. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> press corps will ask no hard questions tonight about those claims." [...] Moyers later also denounced the complicity of the press in the administration's campaign for the war, saying that the media [...] "surrendered its independence and skepticism to join with U.S. government in marching to war," [...] and that the administration [...] "needed a compliant press, to pass on their propaganda as news and cheer them on." ...|$|E

Ford narrowly won renomination <b>but</b> lost <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> Following major gains by Democratic liberals in the 1974 midterm election, Jimmy Carter was elected as President. Carter proved too liberal for his fellow Southern Baptists, (as they voted for him in 1976 but not 1980), too conservative for the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and many considered his foreign policy a failure. Carter realized {{there was a strong}} national sense of malaise, as inflation skyrocketed, interest rates soared, the economy stagnated, and prolonged humiliation resulted when Islamic militants in Tehran kept American diplomats hostage for 444 days in 1979–81.|$|R
