5|$|Robert Zemeckis, the director, {{originally}} wanted Fox to play Marty, but Gary David Goldberg {{the creator}} of Family Ties, which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future,</b> but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved. Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open {{with the return of}} Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in Once Bitten, but it eventually went to Jim Carrey. During filming, Fox would rehearse for Family Ties from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million. Variety applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> Part II (1989) and <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> Part III (1990).|$|E
