A {{place by the}} fire, dear boy, a crust for my friend, Bertrand. (A dead pause.) Ah, well, {{this is a different}} home-coming from that I fancied when I left the letter: I dreamed to grow rich. Charles, you remind me of your sainted mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} I am a terrible <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> hands, monsieur," [...] she said quietly, at last; [...] "but I will do {{anything}} that you think best. If you set us down, we will try and find refuge in some peasant's hut; or we can dress ourselves as countrywomen, {{and try to make}} our way westward to La Rochelle." ...|$|R

6000|$|On the door-step of Miss Blake's Furnished Apartments for Families and Gentlemen, the {{stranger}} stopped again.

50|$|There {{are so many}} {{benefits}} of eating fermented food. First of all, eating fermented food and drinking fermented drinks such as Shindari will improve your immune system.
