5|$|Flying <b>Blind,</b> <b>Flying</b> Safe reached number 10 on the New York Times Best Seller list on April 6, 1997, and {{remained}} on the list through June 1997. On April 13, 1997 the book was ranked 9th on the Chicago Tribune list of bestsellers for hardback non-fiction.|$|E
5|$|Co-writer Sabra Chartrand {{graduated}} from the University of Washington, and reported for Reuters and Israel Radio in Tel Aviv, Israel. She later joined The New York Times as a journalist with their Jerusalem bureau. After Flying <b>Blind,</b> <b>Flying</b> Safe, she co-wrote Black And White on Wall Street, The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody with former Kidder, Peabody & Co. bond trader Joseph Jett.|$|E
5|$|The Z-4 was {{designed}} as trainer. Although nearly identical to the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> training. The four-seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right. Rudder pedals were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight.|$|E

50|$|A terrible storm hits Llanview {{on the day}} of Marcie Walsh and Michael McBain's wedding day. St. James' rectory collapses, {{resulting}} in life-threatening injuries to Kelly Cramer and the death of Duke Buchanan. The adoptive parents of Tommy McBain are also killed, and Evangeline Williamson is temporarily rendered <b>blind</b> from <b>flying</b> broken glass.|$|R
5|$|Schnaufer then {{attended}} the advanced Flugzeugführerschule C 3 (FFS C 3—advanced flight school) at Alt Lönnewitz near Torgau and the <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> school Blindflugschule 2 (BFS 2—2nd <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> school) at Neuburg an der Donau from August 1940 to May 1941. This qualified him to fly multi-engine aircraft. During this assignment {{he was promoted}} to Fähnrich (cadet sergeant) on 1 September 1940, to Oberfähnrich (rank equivalent to Company Sergeant Major) on 1 February 1941 and to the officer rank of Leutnant (second lieutenant) on 1 April 1941. He was then posted for ten weeks to the Zerstörerschule (destroyer school) at Wunstorf near Hanover. At Wunstorf, Schnaufer and the radio operator (Bordfunker) Friedrich Rumpelhardt were assigned as an aircrew team on 3 July 1941. Schnaufer's previous radio operator had proved unable to cope with aerobatics, and Schnaufer thoroughly tested Rumpelhardt's ability to cope with aerobatics before they teamed up. Here the two decided to volunteer to fly night fighters to defend against the increasing Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command offensive against Germany. Following their training at Wunstorf, the two were sent to the Nachtjagdschule 1 (1st night fighter school) at Schleißheim near Munich, formerly the Zerstörerschule 1 (ZS 1—1st destroyer school), to learn the rudiments of night-fighting. The night fighter training was carried out on the Ar 96, the Fw 58 and the Messerschmitt Bf 110. Training at night focused on night takeoffs and landings, cooperation with searchlights, radio-beacon direction finding and cross country flights.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression {{prevented}} Bär from {{gaining a}} civil pilot license. In 1934, {{he joined the}} Reichswehr and {{was assigned to the}} 3. Kompanie of Kraftfahrabteilung 4 (3rd Company of the 4th Motor Vehicle Battalion) as a mechanic. He served in this position until the following year, when he was transferred to a combat wing of the Luftwaffe. A few months later, he was accepted for pilot training, receiving his transport aircraft pilot's training. From 1 November 1937 to 31 March 1938, Bär attended the flight school at Oldenburg and was then transferred to the flight school at Hildesheim. He was transferred again, attending the flight school at Ludwigslust where he attained his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate (Erweiterter Luftwaffen-Flugzeugführerschein), also known as 'C'-Certificate, confirming proficiency on multi-engine aircraft, on 16 May 1938. Bär then attended the <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> school Blindflugschule 2 (BFS 2—2nd <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> school) at Neuburg an der Donau from 7 July to 14 August 1938. He was transferred to I./Jagdgeschwader 135, the core of the future Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG51), on 1 September 1938, usually flying the Junkers Ju 86. The Squadron Leader (Staffelkapitän) Douglas Pitcairn noticed Bär's flying talents and tried to convince Bär to become a fighter pilot. Initially Bär refused, but after he illegally conducted some aerobatics in the Ju 86 leading to an engine failure, he reluctantly accepted and became a fighter pilot.|$|E
5|$|Flying <b>Blind,</b> <b>Flying</b> Safe is a non-fiction {{book about}} the American airline {{industry}} and Federal Aviation Administration, written by Mary Schiavo with Sabra Chartrand. The book {{was first published in}} March 1997 in hardcover format by Avon Books. An updated paperback edition was published on April 1, 1998. Schiavo is a former Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation, and Chartrand a journalist for The New York Times. Schiavo was Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation for six years, and resigned in 1996 shortly after the ValuJet Flight 592 airline crash in the Florida Everglades. She became a whistleblower and was highly critical of the airline industry and its relationship with aviation safety agencies in the United States federal government.|$|E

5|$|The P variant {{had similar}} {{features}} to the Do 17M-1, with added <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> and camera equipment for reconnaissance work. The Do 17P-1 was powered by two BMW 132N radial engines {{with a maximum}} performance of 865PS (853hp, 636kW) each. The machine was fitted with several radio variations. The FuG IIIaU radio (Funkgerät), the PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuBI 1 radio blind-landing device (FuBI - Funkblindlandegerät). The crew of three communicated with each other via the EiV intercom (EiV -Eigenverständigungsanlage). The P-1 was equipped with either Rb 20/30 and Rb 50/30 or Rb 20/18 and Rb 50/18 cameras. The P-1/trop was fitted with filters and protection for the cameras. The cameras were controlled remotely by the crew from the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} {{one year}} of studies at the teacher's college, Puusepp transferred to a pilot's school, first in Volsk and later in Orenburg. He stayed at the latter as a flight instructor, having graduated. He was later transferred to a newly formed squadron specializing in <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> (using only the airplane's instruments due to limited visibility).|$|E
25|$|The ATA trained its pilots only {{to ferry}} planes, {{rather than to}} achieve {{perfection}} on every type. For example, aerobatics and <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> were not taught, and pilots were explicitly forbidden to do either, {{even if they were}} capable of doing so. The objective of the ATA was to deliver aircraft safely and that meant taking no unnecessary risks.|$|E
50|$|Halifax, Nova Scotia, was {{the main}} staging point for convoys making trans-Atlantic crossings. On December 6, 1917, a Belgian relief ship {{collided}} with the , a French munitions ship in Halifax harbour. The crash set the Mont-Blanc on fire; its holds were full of benzol, picric acid, and TNT. Twenty minutes later it exploded with a force stronger than any man-made explosion before it, destroying most of Halifax and the surrounding towns. Out of a population of 50,000, 1600 {{people were killed and}} over 9,000 injured; hundreds were <b>blinded</b> by <b>flying</b> glass. The city was evacuated and dropped out of the war effort, focusing primarily on economic survival.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{the work}} roused and warmed him, and he toiled on, {{battered}} and almost <b>blinded</b> by <b>flying</b> brine, while {{he wondered how}} long the boat would stand the pressure of her largely reduced sail. He did not think they could tie another reef in, because it seemed certain that something must burst or break the moment a rope was started. Besides, even had it been possible, reefing {{was out of the}} question. Their harbor lay to weather, and a boat will not sail to windward in a vicious breeze unless she is driven at a speed which is greater than the resistance of the opposing seas.|$|R
25|$|Determined to {{make the}} night flight program work, Riviére has sent pilot Jules Fabian (Clark Gable) and his {{wireless}} operator on another dangerous flight. The pair are caught in a torrential rain storm and when Madame Fabian (Helen Hayes) comes to the headquarters, she realizes that her husband is overdue. The two airmen, <b>flying</b> <b>blind</b> over the ocean, run out of fuel and choose to jump, but are drowned.|$|R
25|$|From 4–30 June 1940 Zorner {{was based}} at the Fluglehrerschule (flight {{instructor}} school) in Brandenburg and from the 1 July 1940 – 15 January 1941 he attended the Flugzeugführerschule C 11 to complete his advanced training. Zorner attended the Blindflugschule (<b>Blind</b> <b>Flying</b> School) at Neuburg an der Donau from 23 August–16 September 1940 to qualify for night flying.|$|E
25|$|Maitland was {{eventually}} promoted to colonel during World War II, commanded a B-26 Marauder bomb group in combat in 1943, then {{retired from the}} Air Corps. In the 1950s he became an Episcopal minister. Hegenberger returned to his work with the Materiel Division and won the 1934 Collier Trophy for developing the first <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> landing system. He rose through the ranks to major general and command of the Tenth Air Force in China during World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Victorias {{of the two}} {{operational}} squadrons {{also made}} a number of long range training flights, such as return trips from Cairo to Aden in 1931, and helped to pioneer air routes for Imperial Airways' Handley Page HP.42 airliners. One Victoria was used as a <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> trainer by the Central Flying School, being fitted with two sets of controls and instruments in a blanked off cabin. The Victoria continued in service until 1935, although many were converted to Valentias, which remained in use until well into the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|Paul Morrow voices {{the danger}} of the pilots' {{potential}} exposure to radiation. Koenig disagrees, feeling the Eagles' radiation screens are sufficient. Bergman stresses there is an unknown class of radiation present in the cloud against which they may have no defence. The Commander disregards his advice and lifts-off in Rescue Eagle Four, with Morrow volunteering to serve as co-pilot. They are literally <b>flying</b> <b>blind</b> through the plasma cloud, sending out hails and receiving no answer.|$|R
50|$|Still {{able to see}} {{the death}} silhouettes, Sydney begins to get {{everyone}} off the highway, starting with a bus filled with people. She and Paul convince everyone to leave the bus and the cars by telling them that there is a bomb inside the bus. However, a driver leading the police chase rushes through the border barriers and collides into a tank truck, igniting leaking gasoline in the process. Sydney sees the little girl trapped in the car, her mother laying on {{the ground in front of}} it, already being hit by a passenger and losing consciousness. Paul breaks open the window and gets the girl out. Paul and Sydney carry the girl and her mother to safety just before the tank truck causes a chain explosion. Sydney is <b>blinded</b> by <b>flying</b> glass fragments in the process.|$|R
2500|$|Moore, {{who was a}} mountaineer {{and pilot}} as well as {{president}} of the University of Alaska, told journalists the C-124 [...] "obviously was flying at full speed" [...] and appeared to have slid down the cliffs of Mount Gannett and exploded. Wreckage was spread across several acres of the glacier. Moore surmised that the pilot had narrowly missed other Chugach Range peaks during his approach. [...] "From this I conclude he was on instrument, <b>flying</b> <b>blind,</b> and probably crashed without any warning whatsoever to him directly into the southerly face of Mt. Gannett." ...|$|R
25|$|By 1938, Puusepp was an {{established}} pilot, proficient in <b>blind</b> <b>flying.</b> Even earlier, {{he participated in}} the operation to locate the plane of Sigizmund Levanevsky, which disappeared in the Arctic. The North captivated Puusepp {{so much that he}} decided to stay and work there. He flew to the ice station North Pole-1 on several occasions and visited other Soviet Arctic stations. He was also involved in creating optimal routes for ships and in observing the movements of ice. While on one of these missions over the Kara Sea, Puusepp learned about the onset of the Operation Barbarossa. Having landed, Puusepp requested a transfer to the front line.|$|E
500|$|I./JG234 was {{equipped}} with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E-3 in December 1938 and re-designated as I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 26 [...] "Schlageter" [...] (JG26—26th Fighter Wing), named after Albert Leo Schlageter, on 1 May 1939. Müncheberg was transferred to 11. Staffel of Lehrgeschwader 2 (11./LG2—11th squadron of the 2nd Demonstration Wing) in mid-1939. 11.(Nacht)/LG2 was formed on 1 August 1939 and experimented with night fighting techniques. Only pilots with excellent flying abilities, especially <b>blind</b> <b>flying,</b> were chosen.|$|E
500|$|Christina Del Valle {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} BusinessWeek, and wrote: [...] "Flying <b>Blind,</b> <b>Flying</b> Safe is an incisive primer on what ails the aviation industry and the feds' regulation of it". A subsequent article in BusinessWeek highlighted the book among [...] "The Best Business Books of 1997". In a review in The Washington Post, Judy Mann called the book [...] "a scathing -- and frightening -- indictment of the FAA, the multibillion-dollar airline industry and its lapdogs in Congress". James T. Yenckel of The Washington Post called the book [...] "frightening" [...] and [...] "informative", and wrote that [...] "passengers should {{have this kind of}} safety information when choosing a flight." [...] In a review for The Virginian-Pilot, Michael Anft wrote: [...] "She may be to the airplane what Ralph Nader was to the automobile." [...] Bill Wallace gave the book a favorable review in the San Francisco Chronicle, and wrote: [...] "Part memoir, part expose, her book gives an inside view of how the FAA does its job of regulating air travel -- and how it frequently fails." [...] R.J. Ignelzi gave the book a positive recommendation in a review for The San Diego Union-Tribune, and commented: [...] "Mary Schiavo's candid evaluation of the Federal Aviation Administration, airport security and air traffic controllers will give even the occasional flier some apprehension. Still, it should be read." ...|$|E

60|$|It was, however, not {{particularly}} easy. The breeze freshened steadily, until {{she put her}} forecastle under and hove her stern out at every plunge, while her propeller shook her in every plate as it whirred in empty air. A man could scarcely venture forward along her brine-swept deck, and at times when Jimmy had to cling to the bridge-rails for his life she rolled until all her rail was in the sea. He was battered and <b>blinded</b> by <b>flying</b> spray, and when the black night came {{he could not see}} an arm's-length in front of him; but the telegraph still stood at full-speed, and the Shasta resolutely butted the big foaming seas. At last she ran in among the islands, where there was smoother water, and Jimmy was rowed ashore, red-eyed, half-asleep, and aching in every limb, when he had brought her up off a certain icy, green-stained river. As it happened, {{the man in charge of}} the cannery on its bank was unusually pleased to see him, though he did not say so. He gave Jimmy a cigar in his office, and when they sat down looked at him thoughtfully.|$|R
2500|$|Over {{the next}} [...] hours, {{he and the}} Spirit faced many challenges, {{including}} skimming over both storm clouds at [...] and wave tops at as low as , fighting icing, <b>flying</b> <b>blind</b> through fog for several hours, and navigating only by the stars (whenever visible), and dead reckoning before landing at Le Bourget Airport at 10:22 pm on Saturday, [...] The airfield was not marked on his map and Lindbergh knew only that it was some seven miles northeast of the city; he initially mistook it for some large industrial complex because of the bright lights spreading out in all directionsin fact the headlights {{of tens of thousands}} of spectators' cars caught in [...] "the largest traffic jam in Paris history" [...] in their attempt to be present for Lindbergh's landing.|$|R
50|$|Problems {{with this}} method include {{complete}} surveillance information assurance, communication with different equipment, smaller aircraft incapable of carrying the equipment, {{and the possibility}} of a system malfunctioning. It is extremely difficult to have total assurance of all air traffic. If two aircraft flying with different equipment encounter each other, the equipment’s data will have to be sent to the receiving equipment as well as the normal information such as speed. Larger planes will have no problems with the equipment, but smaller aircraft will have problems communicating to each other if it lacks an essential component. Surely, if this was a one-on-one scenario, {{it would be easy to}} solve, but if multiple aircraft were involved, the difficulty of finding a solution compounds. Lastly, if a system fails or the software has a computer programming error, the aircraft and other aircraft will be <b>flying</b> <b>blind.</b>|$|R
