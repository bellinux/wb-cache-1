40|$|Abstract. An {{increasing}} number of bridges have been built in earthquake zones, alonged with rapid development of high-speed railway. Their seismic behaviors attract researchers ’ attention now. The steel shear keys as falling-off prevention measures have been used widely in 32 m simply-supported box girder bridges on high-speed railways in China. To allow for transverse temperature movement, the shear keys are placed with a slight gap from the girders. However, out-of-phase vibrations between superstructures and substructures result in nonlinear eccentric pounding between <b>bearing</b> <b>base</b> and steel shear keys if the relative displacements exceed their initial gaps. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze the effect of eccentric pounding on elasto-plastic behavior of a simply-supported concrete box girder bridge under transverse earthquake, and evaluate the seismic performance of falling-off prevention measures. The effect of cushion block on seismic response has been studied. The results of the study indicate that a bridge column occur plastic deformation and suffer residual displacements due to eccentric pounding, and simple analysis in elastic range may result in nonconservative results. The lateral shear keys play a key role in limiting girder displacements. By setting hardwood blocks between steel shear keys and <b>bearing</b> <b>base,</b> the pounding forces can be appropriately reduced, and the lateral seismic performance of bridge can be effectively improved...|$|E

40|$|Use of base {{isolators}} in {{the seismic}} design of structures has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The major {{concern in the}} design of these structures is to have enough lateral stability to resist wind and seismic forces. There are different systems providing such isolation, among them there are friction- pendulum base isolation systems (FPS) which are rather widely applied nowadays involving to both affordable cost and high fundamental periods. These devices are characterised by a stiff resistance against wind loads and to be flexible to the seismic tremors, which make them suitable for different situations. In this paper, a 3 D numerical investigation is done considering the seismic response of a twelve-storey steel building retrofitted with a FPS. Fast nonlinear time history analysis (FNA) of Boumerdes earthquake (Algeria, May 2003) is considered for analysis and carried out using SAP 2000 software.

40|$|The ~ 30 ka, basaltic Tower Hill Volcanic Complex, of {{the late}} Cainozoic Newer Volcanics Province, southeastern Australia, was {{produced}} by early phreatomagmatic maar forming activity followed by magmatic cone forming activity. Phreatomagmatic activity was caused by subsurface Tertiary sedimentary aquifers. However, fluctuating phreatomagmatic and magmatic explosive activity occurred during the early maar forming phase, represented in the maar rim succession by interbedded fine, accretionary lapilli <b>bearing,</b> <b>base</b> surge ash beds, poorly sorted base surge and fallout lapilli-ash beds with abundant sedimentary and basalt rock debris, and well-vesiculated, magmatic scoria fallout deposits. The interbedding could indicate simultaneously active “dry”magmatic and “wet” phreatomagmatic vents, or regular variation between “dry” and “wet”explosive activity from one vent system. The latter could be caused by variations in magma discharge rate, slow aquifer recharge rates, or episodic sealing of the conduit walls by impermeable linings of chilled magma. The maar rim succession contains repeated cycles beginning with ash facies, gradationally changing to coarsening up lapilli-ash, overlain by a scoria bed. Short-circuited cycles also occur. Each cycle represents short-term “drying” of the vent, suggesting aquifer recharge rate relative to magma discharge rate was not consistently high enough to sustain maximum efficiency phreatomagmatic explosive activity. Simple mass balance calculations {{will be used to}} estimate magma and aquifer flow rates. However, finally the aquifer must have become sealed by magma to explain late magmatic cone formation, including increased magma discharge rates leading to formation of spatter cones and agglutinates...|$|E

40|$|Hepadnaviruses {{replicate}} their circular DNA genomes via {{reverse transcription}} of an RNA intermediate. The initial product of reverse transcription, minus-strand DNA, contains {{two copies of}} a short direct repeat (DR) sequence, termed DR 1 and DR 2. Plus-strand DNA synthesis initiates at DR 2 on minus-strand DNA, using as a primer a short, DR 1 -containing oligoribonucleotide derived by cleavage and translocation from the 5 ' end of pregenomic RNA. To clarify the sequence requirements for plus-strand primer cleavage and translocation, we have constructed mutants of the duck hepatitis B virus <b>bearing</b> <b>base</b> changes in or around the DR 1 sequence in the primer. A point mutation at the terminal nucleotide of DR 1 has a striking phenotype: normal levels of duplex viral DNA are produced, but {{nearly all of the}} DNA is linear rather than circular. Mapping of the 5 ' end of plus-strand DNA reveals that primer cleavage occurs with normal efficiency and accuracy, but the primer is not translocated to DR 2; rather, it is extended in situ to generate duplex linear DNA. Other mutations just 3 ' to DR 1 similarly affect primer translocation, although with differing efficiencies. Linear DNA found in wild-type virus preparations has the same fine structure as the mutant linears described above. These results indicate that (i) plus-strand primer cleavage and translocation are distinct steps that can be dissociated by mutation, (ii) lesions in sequences not included in the primer can severely inhibit primer translocation, and (iii) elongation of such untranslocated primers is responsible for the variable quantities of linear DNA that are found in all hepadnaviral stocks...|$|E
40|$|The minimum volume {{design of}} plane frames {{constituted}} by elastic perfectly plastic material {{and subjected to}} appropriate combinations of fixed, cyclic and dynamic loads is studied. The influence on the design, in terms of cost (volume) and behavioural features, of seismic protecting devices is particularly focused. The considered protecting device is a lead rubber <b>bearing</b> <b>base</b> isolation system. Two optimal design problem formulations are proposed for the structure {{with or without the}} protecting device, both based on the so-called statical approach. The minimum volume frame is reached accounting for three different resistance limits: the purely elastic limit, the (elastic) shakedown limit and the instantaneous collapse limit. The adopted load combinations are alternatively characterized by the presence of only fixed loads, of amplified fixed loads and quasi-static perfect cyclic loads due to the wind action, of suitably reduced fixed loads and dynamic actions due to the earthquake. The linear elastic effects of the dynamic actions are studied by utilizing a modal technique. Reference is made to the most recent Italian code related to the structural analysis and design. The solution of the optimization problem is reached by using a suitable subroutine available into the optimization toolbox of MATLAB® appropriate to the proposed formulations. A flexural frame is studied with and without the relevant seismic protecting device in order to study the influence on the design of such a base isolation system. The related minimum volume structures are obtained assuming the stiffness and the damping feature of the base isolation system as variables within assigned suitable ranges. The Bree diagrams of the obtained optimal designs are also determined in order to characterize and compare their structural and safety behaviou...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results of}} flow around a {{circular}} cylinder with moving surface boundary-layer control (MSBC) are presented. Two small rotating cylinders strategically located inject {{momentum in the}} boundary layer of the cylinder, which delays {{the separation of the}} boundary layer. As a consequence, the wake becomes narrower and the fluctuating transverse velocity is reduced, resulting in a recirculation free region that prevents the vortex formation. The control parameter is the ratio between the tangential velocity of the moving surface and the flow velocity (U-c/U). The main advantage of the MSBC is the possibility of combining the suppression of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and drag reduction. The experimental tests are preformed at a circulating water channel facility and the circular cylinders are mounted on a low-damping air <b>bearing</b> <b>base</b> with one degree-of-freedom in the transverse direction of the channel flow. The mass ratio is 1. 8. The Reynolds number ranges from 1600 to 7500, the reduced velocity varies up to 17, and the control parameter interval is U-c/U = 5 - 10. A significant decreasing in the maximum amplitude of oscillation for the cylinder with MSBC is observed. Drag measurements are obtained for statically mounted cylinders with and without MSBC. The use of the flow control results in a mean drag reduction at U-c/U = 5 of almost 60 % compared to the plain cylinder. PIV velocity fields of the wake of static cylinders are measured at Re = 3000. The results show that the wake is highly organized and narrower compared to the one observed in cylinders without control. The calculation of the total variance of the fluctuating transverse velocity in the wake region allows the introduction of an active closed-loop control. The experimental results are in good agreement with the numerical simulation studies conducted by other researchers for cylinders with MSBC. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{antitumor}} drugs including naphthalimides, {{a new class}} of intercalating agents, interfere with the DNA breakage-reunion activity of mammalian DNA topoisomerase II resulting in DNA cleavage stimulation. In this work, the sequence specificity of a lead compound of this series, amonafide, in stimulating DNA cleavage by murine topoisomerase II has been studied. Amonafide-stimulated cleavage intensity patterns were markedly different from those of other antitumor drugs by using pBR 322 and SV 40 DNAs. This drug had an unusually high site selectivity since about 60 % of DNA cleavage was observed at only one site in pBR 322 DNA, and at two sites in SV 40 DNA. A total of ninety-four drug-stimulated sites were collected, and a statistical analysis of their sequences showed that amonafide highly prefers a cytosine, and excludes guanines and thymines instead, at position - 1. A lower preference for an adenine at position + 1 was also noted. In agreement with the statistical analysis, the DNA sequences of the three sites stimulated by amonafide at exceptionally high levels showed that the drug requirements of a cytosine (- 1) and adenine (+ 1) were present in both the two strands. In addition, a particular feature of these prominent cleavage sites was the presence of an inverted repeat from position - 3 to + 7. Comparison of amonafide stimulation of DNA cleavage in oligonucleotides <b>bearing</b> <b>base</b> mutations at positions - 2, - 3 and/or + 6, + 7 suggested that DNA sequence, and not a putative cruciform structure, was critical for drug action. Moreover, the results showed that, for strong cleavage stimulation, the primary drug requirements at - 1 and + 1 positions were not sufficient and that the sequence 5 '-WRC decreases A- 3 ' (W, A or T; R, A or G) is required from - 3 to + 1 positions at both strands. The results suggest that the exceptionally high sequence specificity of amonafide is the result of optimal drug interactions with both the two enzyme subunits...|$|E
