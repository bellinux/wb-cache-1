30|$|In {{addition}} to source kitchen conditions, reservoir and sealing conditions {{are two other}} essential factors. With respect to reservoirs, not only widespread distribution and certain heterogeneities are indispensable for quasi-continuous accumulations, but the development of sweet spots is also significant to hydrocarbon enrichment and production. As far as the controlling effects of sealing conditions (including top and <b>bottom</b> <b>seals)</b> are concerned, it can be observed that vertical distribution of high-quality sealing beds usually determines the uppermost intervals of the accumulations above the source rocks or lowest intervals below the source rocks. Moreover, sealing conditions are of great significance to the richness of tight oil and gas accumulations, whereby high-quality seals favor the enrichment of oil/gas in tight reservoirs.|$|R
30|$|Heating {{microscope}} can {{be shown}} to be an excellent experimental technique for performing studies of sintering kinetics, because the shrinkage process can be monitored continuously. The height of the peak is proportional to the intensity of sintering. The sintering profiles with narrow peaks with comparatively higher intensity indicate that the fuel ash is very much temperature sensitive for sintering. If the ash particle reaches the critical temperature range corresponding to peak, then it sinters fast. And if it {{happened to be in the}} dense region of the fuel/ash path of CFBC-like cyclone <b>bottom,</b> <b>seal</b> pot, then heavy sintering leading to shrinkage is a distinct possibility.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} were {{to examine the}} site-specific physical, chemical, and biological factors that impact construction, durability and performance of the proposed 5 -MW (sub e) solar pond system at the Salton Sea. The interactions of the water, salt, and soil of the site and on material compatibility were examined. Potential interactions of the water/brine and soil are particularly important because the pond will utilize the naturally occurring clays as a <b>bottom</b> <b>seal.</b> Although there is a considerable and growing solar pond literature, little written information deals with the important site-specific investigations of water, salt, and soil. Therefore, technical effort was directed toward identifying the factors that should be investigated and determining methods of investigation. As a result, a by-product was {{the development of an}} approach for site-specific investigations and some specific methodologies.

30|$|Similarly, the Fuling Shale Gas Field in the Sichuan Basin {{also has}} {{excellent}} {{top and bottom}} sealing conditions, which {{play a crucial role}} in the shale gas enrichment and preservation (Zhao et al. 2016 a). The top seal of this Silurian Longmaxi Formation Shale Gas Field is a thick mudstone sequence with lower organic matter abundance and low porosity and permeability, while the <b>bottom</b> <b>seal</b> is the widely distributed tight limestones of the Ordovician Jiancaogou Formation (O 3 j), which is 45 – 50  m in thickness and has a porosity of 0.61 %– 1.66 % (averaging 1.01 %) and a permeability of 0.0058 – 0.1092 md (averaging 0.0201 md) in well DS 1 (Guo 2013). In spite of this, diffusion of natural gas in the Fuling Shale Gas Field might be noticeable. According to Dai et al. (2016, 2017), shale gas from this field displays a complete carbon and hydrogen isotopic reversal (i.e., δ 13 C 1 [*]>[*]δ 13 C 2 [*]>[*]δ 13 C 3; δ 2 H 1 [*]>[*]δ 2 H 2 [*]>[*]δ 2 H 3), which they interpreted as the result of secondary alteration like, among others, oil or gas cracking and diffusion at high temperatures.|$|E
30|$|For the SPS, TPS, and CPS {{derived from}} a common {{hydrocarbon}} source kitchen, the resulting accumulations in source-rock, tight, and conventional reservoirs must be inversely related to each other. Clearly, the proportion of continuous accumulations in the SPS of {{the total amount of}} hydrocarbons generated from the source rocks (namely, the retention ratio) is crucial. The higher the retention ratio of hydrocarbons within the source rocks or the lower the hydrocarbon expulsion efficiency, the higher the proportion of hydrocarbon resources in the SPS and the lower the proportion of resources in the TPS and CPS would be. The major factors influencing the retention ratio of hydrocarbons in source rocks include the thickness of effective source rocks, abundance of organic matter, source rock type, and the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>sealing</b> conditions, etc. The thicker the effective source rocks, the higher the organic matter content, and especially, the better the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>sealing</b> conditions, the more abundant the hydrocarbons to be retained in the source rocks. In contrast, if a source rock is too thin and its top and <b>bottom</b> <b>sealing</b> conditions are not good enough, the hydrocarbon expulsion efficiency (reciprocal of the retention ratio) is generally higher and more hydrocarbons generated in the source rock would be expelled and accumulate in non-source rock-reservoir intervals or be lost elsewhere. As far as the resource potentials of the TPS and CPS are concerned, they are highly affected by the distribution and quality of tight reservoirs, quality of sealing rocks, and the amount of hydrocarbons expelled from source rocks. It has been found that the better the conditions of tight reservoirs and sealing rocks, the more favorable it is for hydrocarbons to accumulate in tight reservoirs. The hydrocarbon resource potential of the TPS is likely to be greater than that of the CPS; otherwise, the CPS would be of greater potential for hydrocarbon resources. This phenomenon can be demonstrated from the distribution of hydrocarbon resource potentials of various accumulations in the Ordos Basin. Because both Mesozoic and Upper Paleozoic source rocks are widely distributed in the basin, but their thicknesses are relatively small, the resources retained in the corresponding source rocks, including shale oil/gas and CBM, appear to be less than expected. Nevertheless, tight oil and gas are more plentiful, which is also {{due to the fact that}} both tight reservoirs and their cap rocks are well developed in the basin. The hydrocarbon resources of conventional accumulations are, therefore, somewhat limited. By corollary, in those basins or regions that are rich in petroleum resources, the potential of unconventional resources would be relatively smaller if their conventional resources are preponderant.|$|R

30|$|Favorable top {{and bottom}} sealing {{conditions}} are also critical for the enrichment of continuous hydrocarbon accumulation. As far as the accumulations of shale oil/gas or CBM are concerned, the premise of their enrichment is that the hydrocarbons generated in organic-rich shales or coals were not completely expelled. The less hydrocarbons that are expelled, the more hydrocarbons are retained in the source rocks, and the more abundant the accumulated shale oil/gas and CBM. The quantity of hydrocarbons trapped within source rocks is not simply affected {{by the quality of}} source rocks per se, but also by the sealing conditions or the conditions of hydrocarbon expulsion. The conditions of sealing and expulsion of source rocks depend on the following three major factors. The first is the thickness of source rocks; the greater the thickness, the more difficult it is for the hydrocarbon to be expelled and the more hydrocarbons that are retained. The second is the {{top and bottom}} sealing conditions, as more hydrocarbons would be held in source rocks with effective top and bottom seals. The third is the intensity of tectonic activities, as strong tectonic activities can lead to the development of more fractures, and thus conditions would become more favorable for hydrocarbon expulsion from source rocks and less favorable for hydrocarbon accumulation within them. As a consequence, source rocks with sufficiently great thickness and good quality, and propitious top and bottom sealing conditions, but moderately developed fractures, are advantageous for shale oil/gas and CBM enrichment. The major gas-rich shales in North America are exactly those possessing good to excellent top and bottom sealing conditions. For instance, the Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin and the Devonian–Carboniferous New Albany Shale in the Illinois Basin have tight limestones acting as both top and bottom seals; for the Devonian Marcellus Shale in the Appalachia Basin and the Devonian Antrim Shale in the Michigan Basin, the top seals are shales, while the bottom seals are limestones; the top seal of the Devonian Woodford Shale in the Acoma Basin is comprised of limestones, while the <b>bottom</b> <b>seal</b> consists of sandstones/limestones; the Upper Jurassic Haynesville Shale in the East Texas–North Louisiana Basin is overlain by sandstones and underlain by limestones, whereas the Carboniferous Fayetteville Shale in the Acoma Basin is overlain by a limestone interval and underlain by a sandstone formation (Ground Water Protection Council 2009).|$|E

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} design {{procedure for}} jet grouted <b>bottom</b> <b>sealing</b> barriers of open excavations under ground water level is {{shown on the}} basis of geometrical considerations on the true shape of the columns, which are far from being vertical perfect cylinders. By considering a square grid disposition of the columns axes, and taking into account the possible defects of the columns (verticality and diameter) assuming typical statistical parameters of their distributions taken from field trial measurements carried out by the authors, a Monte Carlo procedure is used to get some simple design charts for a given risk level. The analyses have been carried out for different values of column mean diameters Dm and length, as well as for different spacing between columns s. It is shown that columns overlapping decreases with depth because of defects, the deviation form verticality being the most critical one. The true minimum thickness of the barrier is smaller than the ideal one, resulting into lower uplift safety factors. For a given value of the ratio s/Dm, larger columns are more effective. In the paper, it is argued that a cost effective design may be obtained by associating safety and economical considerations via the proposed probabilistic charts...|$|R
