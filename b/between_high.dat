5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of {{the expansion of the}} universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split <b>between</b> <b>high</b> redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} the link <b>between</b> <b>higher</b> {{education and social}} mobility in Indonesia. There are several theoretical frameworks talking about the link <b>between</b> <b>higher</b> education and social mobility and the relevant theory of them is Raymond Boudon’s Inequality of Educational Opportunity (IEO) danInequality of Social Opportunity (ISO). The results reveal that the link <b>between</b> <b>higher</b> education and social mobility in Indonesia is influenced by other factors: inequality of social-economy and geograpfy and cultural disparities. Furthermore, the more decreasing inequality in the society, the more people can go to higher education and in turn will promote upward social mobility...|$|R

5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1st century, ancient tracks across the hills were {{superseded}} by the Roman Fosse Way, from Bath to Ilchester, a branch of which served the Charterhouse lead mines. Stratton-on-the-Fosse and Lydford-on-Fosse, two villages of the Mendips, reflect the arrival of this new road. Much of the high plateau, however, remained uncultivated and unenclosed until the 18th century, resulting in many roads remaining as narrow winding lanes <b>between</b> <b>high</b> banks and hedges or stone walls. Where the tracks had their origins as drovers roads, they typically become open roads with wide verges. The roads tend to follow the line of gorges and valleys, as at Cheddar Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Many CAS family {{proteins}} {{have altered}} activity and functional roles in cancer progression and metastasis, with functional roles in influencing cellular adhesion, migration and drug resistance. Changes in CASS4 {{may also be}} associated with human malignancies. CASS4 function was linked to {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) in a study by Miao et al. that correlated elevated CASS4 expression with lymph node metastasis and high TNM stage. In addition, this study detected a significant difference in cytoplasmic accumulation of CASS4 protein <b>between</b> <b>high</b> (H1299 and BE1) and low (LTE and A549) metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines. These may suggest CASS4 as a possible prognostic marker in clinical management of NSCLC.|$|E
5|$|Sedimentological {{data from}} the Mussentuchit Member {{indicates}} that Eolambia lived on a poorly-drained floodplain, around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated <b>between</b> <b>high</b> and low water levels in Milankovitch cycles of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits. During dry periods, the exposed lakebed formed a broad beach devoid of plants. The cracked mud of the lakebed produced mud clasts, while organic debris and scavenged carcasses were scattered around the water's edge as the lake progressively retreated. Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded the floodplain, which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season.|$|E

Shortly before the storm made landfall, the warning was discontinued <b>between</b> <b>High</b> Island and Cameron, Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center briefly issued a hurricane watch from Intracoastal City to Morgan City, but it was discontinued when Tropical Storm Bill failed to strengthen.

5|$|The Ministry of National Education is {{responsible}} for pre-tertiary education. This is compulsory and lasts twelve years: four years each of primary school, {{middle school and high}} school. Less than half of 25- to 34-year-old Turks have completed at least high school, compared with an OECD average of over 80 percent. Basic education in Turkey is considered to lag behind other OECD countries, with significant differences <b>between</b> <b>high</b> and low performers. Turkey is ranked 32nd out of 34 in the OECD's PISA study. Access to high-quality school heavily depends on the performance in the secondary school entrance exams, to the point that some students begin taking private tutoring classes when they are 10 years old. The overall adult literacy rate in 2011 was 94.1 percent; 97.9 percent for males and 90.3 percent for females.|$|E

Piccadilly line trains operate every 26 minutes from approximately 05:41 to 00:25 eastbound and 05:56 to 00:43 westbound.

As Allen approached its final landfall, the northeast Mexican coast and Texas coast were placed under a hurricane watch from the morning of August 8 until the morning of August 9 for Mexico and the afternoon of August 9 for Texas. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Texas coast during the afternoon of August 8, and were lowered north of Freeport, Texas during the afternoon of August 9 and south of Freeport during the afternoon of August 10. Gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued for the Louisiana coast from Vermilion Bay westward from the afternoon of August 8 into the afternoon of August 9. Hurricane warnings were in effect for northeast Mexico from the early afternoon of August 9 into the late afternoon of August 10. Hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings <b>between</b> <b>High</b> Island, Texas and Freeport, Texas between the late afternoon of August 9 and the late afternoon of August 10.

5|$|To ensure {{constant}} air support, Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wings) and Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) in {{the shape}} of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1, were ordered to achieve a frantic pace in servicing and preparing aircraft for their next mission. To keep a constant aerial vigil over the task force, the 'black men' (mechanics) had to complete rearming and refuelling in 30 minutes or less. Galland insisted that the air units aircraft should be split <b>between</b> <b>high</b> and low altitude to provide sound cover. The low altitude groups would be able to evade detection by British coastal radar. Galland demanded an umbrella of at least 16 fighters over the ships at any one time along the whole length of the channel. The fighter group would be split into two groups of eight aircraft for their respective patrol altitudes. Each formation was split into two Schwärme of four aircraft. The Schwärme tactics involved one formation flying to sea and one to land in a zigzag pattern. All Schwärme were ordered to fly back and forth along the line of ships in wide figures of eight while maintaining radio silence. Every sortie was meticulously timed to allow the fighters exactly 30 minutes over the ships, enough to maintain cover and allow the relieved units to refuel and rearm and return to start the cycle again. However, during Donnerkeil, the relieving sortie would arrive after only 20 minutes which meant the actual fighter cover for half the dash would be 32 fighters.|$|E

40|$|We {{provide a}} brief but {{comprehensive}} overview of linkages <b>between</b> <b>higher</b> education and the high tech sector and study the major linkages in India. We find that the links outside {{of the labor market}} are weak.

In the labor market, we find a robust link <b>between</b> <b>higher</b> education and high-tech industry, but despite a strong private sector supply response to the growth of the high-tech industry, the quality leaves much to be desired.
