5|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin, {{has been}} shown to improve the {{ventilatory}} response, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been poorly studied and is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Similarly, the drug acetazolamide can reduce bicarbonate levels, and thereby augment to normal ventilatory response, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been researched insufficiently to recommend wide application.|$|E
5|$|Crucifix Bastion – a large {{asymmetrical}} bastion {{containing a}} 19th-century gunpowder magazine. It {{also had a}} concrete emplacement for a 9-inch BL gun, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been removed.|$|E
5|$|David Norman has {{suggested}} that I. bernissartensis includes the dubious Mongolian I. orientalis (see also below), <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> not been followed by other researchers.|$|E
50|$|A map of 1828 shows a {{significant}} mansion there <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been demolished some twenty years later.|$|R
50|$|By the 14th {{century the}} village had a water mill, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> {{disappeared}} by the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|The commune {{formerly}} included Taiţa village, mainly Russian-inhabited {{prior to}} 1877, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been depopulated by 1930.|$|R
5|$|In November 2004, all 45 {{episodes of}} the Playhouse, plus six episodes {{that had never}} before been {{released}} on home video, were released on DVD split between two box set collections. Reubens planned to re-release the DVDs with audio commentaries by the following year, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> yet to materialize.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} {{announced that a}} Blu-ray edition would be released of Season 1, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> yet to occur.|$|E
5|$|Massospondylus {{had also}} been {{reported}} from Argentina, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been reassessed as a closely related but distinct genus. The fossils included several partial skeletons {{and at least one}} skull, found in the Lower Jurassic Canon del Colorado Formation of San Juan, Argentina. This material was named Adeopapposaurus in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Badgerline was {{operating}} 342 buses on 1 January 1986 <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> increased to 441 by 30 November 1989.|$|R

50|$|He {{admitted}} {{that there had}} been difficulty in rolling the section <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been overcome by the manufacturers at Middlesbrough.|$|R
5|$|Moravian {{palaeontologist}} Ferdinand Stoliczka {{separated the}} Himalayan {{population as a}} third subspecies, P.g.forsythi, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> not been widely accepted and is usually treated as synonymous with digitatus. A Pleistocene form from Europe {{was similar to the}} extant subspecies, and is sometimes categorised as P.g.vetus.|$|E
5|$|The Mendips were mined for lead, silver, coal, ochre, fuller's {{earth and}} zinc <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> finished. They were also quarried for stone, notably at Bath and Doulting. Today the Mendips {{are a major}} source of aggregates.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} {{walls are}} of rough-hewn stone, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been hidden under modern layers of cement. The church is approached {{from the east}} through a lychgate {{at the end of}} Ifield Street, the ancient village street.|$|E
50|$|The {{magazine}} had a peak {{circulation of}} around 30,000 in the 1970s, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> fallen to around 10,000 by 2014.|$|R
5000|$|<b>But</b> <b>this...</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to}} do with {{historical}} reality. There were virulent nationalists, imperialists, anti-Semites and Jew-haters. Without them, Hitler was unthinkable ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} design specified ten stories, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> to be scaled back to seven due to budget concerns following the Panic of 1907.|$|R
5|$|The {{green turtle}} (Chelonia mydas) has been {{observed}} in large numbers near the shore, {{and it has been}} claimed that they breed on the island, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> never been verified. If it is true, then North Island would be the species' most southerly breeding site in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Somerset {{has continued to}} grow since 1800, when it was 274,000, particularly in the seaside towns such as Weston-super-Mare. Some population decline occurred earlier in the period in the villages, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> now been reversed, and by 1951 the {{population of}} Somerset was 551,000.|$|E
5|$|The written test {{as well as}} the {{practical}} exam has to be taken in the Czech language. Until 31 December 2011, test-takers were allowed to use a sworn interpreter/translator, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> since been forbidden.|$|E
50|$|Sveriges Radio later {{introduced}} processed {{sound to}} increase sound quality, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> {{the effect of}} the modulation transformer almost reaching its alarm limit.|$|R
60|$|Slowly {{the night}} wore away, {{until it was}} {{three o'clock in the}} morning. Only one alarm <b>had</b> come, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> {{amounted}} to nothing.|$|R
50|$|Alterations {{were made}} in 1843 and 1869. The church once possessed a spire, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> to be taken down in 1980 for safety reasons.|$|R
5|$|A Mk. IV tank {{built in}} Lincoln {{and used in}} World War I was {{presented}} to the town on 1 August 1919 to thank the townsfolk for their war efforts. It is situated in St Georges Square near the town centre. For some years, electricity provider Seeboard fitted an electricity substation inside the tank, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> now been removed. A protective cover was built over the tank in 1988.|$|E
5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> not always been the case. For {{hundreds}} of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.|$|E
5|$|B. Lance Armstrong was {{declared}} winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005. However, in October 2012 he {{was stripped of}} all titles by the UCI due {{to the use of}} performance-enhancing drugs. The Tour director Christian Prudhomme had previously declared that if this happened, there would be no alternate winners for those years, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> not yet been made official.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{important}} leftist {{party was}} the Ceylon Labour Party, founded in 1931 by A.E. Goonesinha, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> drifted into communalist strike-breaking action by 1937.|$|R
50|$|Incidentally running powers {{had been}} south to Tondu in the authorising Act <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been refused, obliging {{the company to}} {{exchange}} mineral traffic at Coity Junction.|$|R
5|$|Bethune's episcopal acta, or his {{decisions}} {{and other documents}} relating to his episcopal career, {{have been published in}} the English Episcopal Acta series, in the volume relating to the diocese of Hereford. A medieval catalogue of works at Llanthony Priory also recorded that they owned a collection of letters by Bethune, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> not survived.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females have short, {{straight}} fur that is relatively dense and without spots or patterns. Both sexes are generally a reddish-brown dorsally and colored a dirty cream ventrally. When in rut, they may have an orange coloration to their abdomen from a reddish substance secreted by a chest gland secretions, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> not been consistently observed by all researchers. The tail tends to be lighter in coloration than the sides. Juveniles are either gray or nearly white.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> not been well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, {{although it is not}} clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E
50|$|The NIW {{has some}} 6,000 subscribers. To enlarge the readership, the NIW started a {{modernization}} campaign in 2001, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> minimal {{effect on the}} number of subscribers.|$|R
