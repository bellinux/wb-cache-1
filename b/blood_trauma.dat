50|$|The {{oxygenator}} {{was first}} conceptualized in the 17th century by Robert Hooke and developed into practical extracorporeal oxygenators by French and German experimental physiologists in the 19th century. Bubble oxygenators have no intervening barrier between blood and oxygen, these are called 'direct contact' oxygenators. Membrane oxygenators introduce a gas-permeable membrane between blood and oxygen that decreases the <b>blood</b> <b>trauma</b> of direct-contact oxygenators.

40|$|Heart {{transplant}} {{is often}} {{considered the best}} treatment for prolonged left ventricular failure. However due to limited donor hearts and ineligibility of some patients to get a transplant, heart assist devices are considered a short/long term option to assist the failing ventricle. Numerous in vitro and animal trials are conducted to study the flow fields in artificial ventricles to avoid hemolysis and thrombosis but the effects of flow fields corresponding to the angle of LVAD insertion into the aorta are often neglected. This experiment uses 30, 60 and 90 degree glass models to signify different angles of the surgical end to side anastomosis. Particle Image Velocimetry is used to study the flow fields at the interface and determine optimum angle amongst the three to avoid <b>blood</b> <b>trauma.</b> Use of a 30 degree glass interface minimizes stagnation zone, recirculation patterns, flow reversal, high shear region and other flow irregularities which may lead to reduced hemolysis, thrombosis and <b>blood</b> <b>trauma</b> in a clinical setting...|$|E
40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>trauma</b> {{caused by}} medical devices {{is a major}} concern. Complications {{following}} the implantation/application of devices such as prosthetic heart valves, cannulae, blood pumps, tubing, and throttles lead to sublethal and lethal damage to platelets and erythrocytes. This damage {{is provided by the}} alterations in fluid dynamics, providing a mechanical load on the blood corpuscle's membrane by means of the shear stress. An appropriate quantification of the shear-induced hemolysis of artificial organs is thought to be useful in the design and development of such devices in order to minimize device-induced <b>blood</b> <b>trauma.</b> To date, a power-law mathematical relationship using the time of exposure of a blood corpuscle to a certain mechanical load and the shear stress itself (derived under the peculiar condition of uniform shear stress) has served as a basic model for the estimation of the damage to blood, investigated by means of numerical and/or experimental fluid dynamical techniques. The aim of the present article is to highlight the effect of a time-varying mechanical loading acting on blood cells based on the usual power-law model; furthermore, the effect of the loading history of a blood particle is discussed, showing how the past history of the shear acting on a blood corpuscle is not taken into account, as researchers have done until now. The need for a reassessment of the power-law model for potential <b>blood</b> <b>trauma</b> assessment is discussed by using a mathematical formulation based on the hypotheses of the existence of damage accumulation for blood with respect to time and with respect to shear stress, to be applied in complex flow fields such as the ones established in the presence of artificial organs...|$|E

40|$|A new {{hollow fiber}} {{membrane}} oxygenator, the Medtronic Maxima Forte, was tested for gas transfer, blood path resistance and blood handling characteristics in a standardized setting with surviving animals.

The animals were weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and then from the ventilator. After seven days, the animals were sacrificed electively.

Maximum flow in vitro was 4. 3 l/min {{with the original}} drive console versus 9. 2 l/min for activation with the intra-aortic balloon pump console. Performance characteristics of the VAD were evaluated in 11 bovine experiments. In vivo left ventricular assist for up to 24 hours with VAD and either original drive console or standard intra-aortic balloon pump console showed superior flow on activation with the intra-aortic balloon pump console (5. 3 +/- 1. 7 l/min) versus original drive console (3. 5 +/- 0. 5 l/min).

Patients were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 had valve surgery without separation of suction, Group 2 had coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with direct blood aspiration and Group 3 had coronary artery bypass grafting with shed blood separation.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the numerical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) validation of a new pumping concept and the possibility for application of a further developed type, as an implantable ventricular assist device (VAD). The novel principle of the so-called progressive wave pump {{is based on the}} interaction of an elastic membrane actuated by forced excitation with a surrounding fluid and the pump housing. By applying forced vibrations to one end of the membrane, a transversal wave builds up and progresses to the far end generating both a positive pressure gradient and flow rate. Among others, two axisymmetric geometrical configurations are possible, namely the discoidal and the tubular design. The first one has been built as a physical prototype and is experimentally investigated. In addition, a corresponding numerical FSI model is set up and validated against the experimental findings. Based on this validated numerical method, further numerical investigations are conducted focusing on the development of a tubular progressive wave pump concept with regard to its potential for application as a VAD in the future. To address VAD-relevant issues such as size, hydraulic performance, and <b>blood</b> <b>trauma,</b> corresponding numerical simulations involving macroscopic <b>blood</b> <b>trauma</b> models have been performed. Although being still in an early phase of development, the results are promising and indicate that the wave pump concept in its present state is feasible and can be further developed and investigated as a new type of blood pump. © 2012, Copyright the Authors.

Experimental procedures followed the guidelines of Fort Valley State University's Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee. Pigs were traumatized by splenectomy followed by pancreatectomy. Blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies were taken before and after trauma. Adult-derived BLSCs were isolated from skeletal muscle and blood samples following established procedures.

After full systemic heparinization, five calves (weight, 62. 5 +/- 4. 4 kg) for the automatic suction system group, and four (weight, 62. 8 +/- 5. 1 kg) for the control group, were equipped with a jugular cannula connected via a roller pump to the cardiotomy reservoir. Through a small thoracotomy, a standardized hole was created in the right atrium, allowing for a blood loss of approximately 400 ml/min.

Despite decades of research, mechanical blood damage remains {{a problem in the}} clinical utilization of CAD, which results in a myriad of patient complications including device-induced erythrocyte lysis (hemolysis), bleeding and thrombosis. There is a clinical need to better understand the mechanisms of flow-induced blood damage to aid in the design and clinical utilization of CAD with enhanced biocompatibility as well as to determine specific factors responsible for blood damage and methods of their assessment. 	The objectives were to study in vitro the mechanisms of flow-induced <b>blood</b> <b>trauma</b> and the parameters that affect in vitro hemolysis testing of CAD. The tested hypotheses were: 1) Mechanically induced polymer degradation in a high molecular weight polyethylene oxide (PEO) solution could predict the degree of shear-induced hemolysis within a CAD candidate without the use of animal or human blood; 2) Blood bank storage of packed red blood cells (RBC) could adversely affect RBC mechanical properties which may reduce the efficiency of RBC transfusion in CAD patients; 3) Cell-cell interactions and suspension viscosity are potential mechanisms of flow-induced hemolysis; and 4) The geometry of micro-gaps and crevices in CAD blood flow paths could affect cell trafficking at supra-physiological shear stresses relevant to operating CAD. 	We demonstrated that polymer mechanical degradation was highly correlated with hemolysis obtained due to circulation in the same CAD circuit as blood and ascertained valuable information on CAD performance predicting <b>blood</b> <b>trauma</b> without the need to use blood. We found that RBC deformability significantly decreased during blood bank storage which contributes to blood damage produced by CAD.
