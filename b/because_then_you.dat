5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
60|$|You will be miserable {{if you do}} {{not learn}} to {{understand}} little things: <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> {{will not be able to}} understand great things when you meet them. Children who are not trained to use their eyes and their common sense grow up the more miserable the cleverer they are.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} speak aloud that way," [...] said the ghost, [...] "or {{you may get}} {{yourself}} into trouble. I want to see everything go well with you, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> may be disposed to help me, especially if I should chance to be of any assistance to you, which I hope I shall be." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bob in Stephen Chbosky's novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower {{says that}} you can't have three on a match <b>because</b> <b>then</b> they'd find <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly it is. You can {{abuse the}} {{government}} {{as much as you}} like, say that the ministers are a parcel of incompetent fools, and so on; but, of course, you cannot attack them as to their private life and character any more than you can anyone else, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> would render yourself liable to an action for libel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because I was a beast, Hypatia; and {{had all but}} {{forgotten}} what this righteousness was like; and was afraid to find out lest it should condemn me. Because I was a devil, Hypatia; and hated righteousness, and neither wished to see you righteous, nor God righteous either, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> would both have been unlike myself. God be merciful to me a sinner!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know it is}} {{not only}} that," [...] said Babie; [...] "Allen is bound in honour to marry Elvira, to repair the great injustice. It is a great pity she will not marry him now at once, but I think she is afraid, <b>because</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> know, she would get to have a soul, like Undine, and she doesn't want one yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is this <b>then</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> want {{to throw}} dust {{in the eyes of}} the Black Diamond chaps?' (with an admiring glance at Bob's costume).|$|R
60|$|Flo. Well, <b>then,</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> {{are but a}} beginner, and I {{would not}} {{discourage}} you, any of these shall serve your turn, in a fair way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{what is the}} use of your talking that way, <b>then?</b> <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> {{never saw}} a thing done, is that any reason why it can't be done?" ...|$|R
60|$|I wish I could {{remember}} {{some of the}} beautiful things in that essay, and here set them down; <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> {{would be able to}} see what they were like for yourselves, and that would be so much more simpler than my explaining to you how beautiful they were. Unfortunately, however, I cannot now call to mind any of them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You know,' he said, 'it {{is simply}} {{because there are}} so many other things to be learnt in this wide world that I didn't trouble about that {{particular}} bit of knowledge. I thought it would be useless to me; but I don't think so now. I will learn riding, and all connected with it, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> would like me better. Do you like me much less for this?' ...|$|E
60|$|After breakfast {{the host}} takes {{the young man}} into a corner, and {{explains}} to him that what he saw was {{the ghost of a}} lady who had been murdered in that very bed, or who had murdered somebody else there--it does not really matter which: you can be a ghost by murdering somebody else or by being murdered yourself, whichever you prefer. The murdered ghost is, perhaps, the more popular; but, on the other hand, you can frighten people better if you are the murdered one, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> can show your wounds and do groans.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is why, <b>then.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> hadn't {{cleared his}} father to him, and {{you ought to have}} done it. Because, before you went into any tantrum about yourself, who are--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] said Dorcas. [...] "If our {{daughter}} dies <b>because</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>then</b> I {{have done with}} you. We part for ever. Do you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those {{days were}} very different," [...] Mr. Bows answered; [...] "and Mr. Arthur Pendennis was an honest, impetuous young fellow then; rather selfish and conceited, perhaps, but honest. He liked <b>you</b> <b>then,</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> {{were ready to}} ruin {{yourself}} for a woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And we took {{advantage}} of your absence," [...] said Lady Maud {{in a tone of}} amiable artlessness, [...] "to find out all about you. And what a pity we did not know you when you were at the convent, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> might have been constantly at the castle; indeed I should have insisted on it. But still I hear we are neighbours; you must promise to pay me a visit, you must indeed. Is not she beautiful?" [...] she added in a lower but still distinct voice to her friend. [...] "Do you know I think there is so much beauty among the lower order." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it would}} make a difference," [...] Malchus said, [...] "if no more gold and silver came from Spain, <b>because</b> <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> know, people wouldn't be able to pay a good price for fish, and there would be bad times for you fishermen. But that is not the worst of it. The Romans are so alarmed by our {{progress}} in Spain that they are glad to keep friends with us, but if we were driven out from there they would soon be at war again. You and your sons would be pressed for the ships of war, and like enough you might see the Roman fleets hovering on our coasts and picking up our fishing boats." ...|$|E
60|$|Next {{we come to}} the Hump, {{which is}} the part of the Broad Walk where all the big races are run, and even though you had no {{intention}} of running you do run when you come to the Hump, it is such a fascinating, slide-down kind of place. Often you stop when you have run about half-way down it, and then you are lost, but there is another little wooden house near here, called the Lost House, and so you tell the man that you are lost and then he finds you. It is glorious fun racing down the Hump, but you can't do it on windy days <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> are not there, but the fallen leaves do it instead of you. There is almost nothing that has such a keen sense of fun as a fallen leaf.|$|E
60|$|Mel. Why did I not {{in prison}} die, before My fatal freedom made me suffer more? I had been pleased to think I died for you, And doubly pleased, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>then</b> were true: Then I had hope; but now, alas! have none.|$|R
5000|$|Merritt {{was also}} a film critic for CBC Radio's morning program, Information Morning. At times he roused strong {{listener}} reaction with his attacks on mainstream movies and his promotion of independent film. Describing Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman's Ishtar, Merritt {{said that it was}} a pity that the film was not named [...] "Tishtar." [...] <b>because</b> <b>then</b> [...] "if <b>you</b> spelled it backwards, it would almost write its own review." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--I {{will be in}} earnest. I shall {{take the}} first that comes after I have quite made up my mind. You'll think it very horrible, but that is really what I shall do. After all, a husband {{is very much like}} a house or a horse. You don't take your house because it's the best house in the world, but <b>because</b> just <b>then</b> <b>you</b> want a house. You go and see a house, and if it's very nasty you don't take it. But if you think it will suit pretty well, and if you are tired of looking about for houses, you do take it. That's the way one buys one's horses,--and one's husbands." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{fact is that}} {{researchers}} cannot build anything on Said's thoughts-dead-end. ... He has {{made it difficult for}} Westerners to say anything critical about Islam and the Muslim world. You cannot do that <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> run the risk of getting denounced as an orientalist, i.e. a racist, an imperialist and other terrible things." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “A beautifully shot film. [...] "Irish Vampire" [...] {{brought back}} my evenings in the {{underground}} cinema of the 60s. Too bad its not still with us, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> have a camp cult classic on your hands. - Wanda Coleman, Award-Winning Poet, Writer [...] "Mad Dog Black Lady, [...] "A War of Eyes and Other Stories".|$|E
5000|$|I'm an {{explorer}} if I might use that expression. I'm {{looking for something}} all the time. And oft-times I get lost. And people that are around me a lot know that when they see me smiling, they know I'm lost and I'm trying to get back. But it makes it much more interesting <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> do things that surprise yourself. And after you hear the recording, it makes {{you a little bit}} happy too because you say, [...] "Oh, I didn't know I could do THAT! ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, if shooting, Hugh Kelsey {{recommends}} [...] a pass with [...] over RHO's opening bid of 1. Kelsey notes {{that everyone else}} will double, because {{in the long run}} it's the best call. But if LHO has a good redouble, or if the takeout double leads to an unmakeable game, or if declarer misguesses <b>because</b> <b>you</b> pass, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> might get a very good result (more often, you'll get a bottom). Notice that Kelsey's suggestion conforms to the basic notion of taking an action that is slightly against the odds. To pass with a much stronger hand would be far too extreme an action.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] {{said the}} senator, his black necktie {{working out of}} place as his anger {{got the better of}} him, [...] "I am to believe, <b>then,</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> claim to be the author of a few society novels, that you are infallible? Let me tell you that the President of the United States himself is liable to impeachment, and bound to {{disprove}} any charge he may be accused of. What in Halifax do I care for your divine-right-of-authors theory? I'll continue to think you guilty until you are shown to be innocent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, I {{could not}} write before because I have no room at home now where I {{can write a}} letter, and Mrs. Frobisher told my mother falsehoods about you. My mother has {{surprised}} me dreadfully--I {{did not think it}} of her. She told me nothing. But of that I must tell you in another letter. I am too angry to write about it now. Even now you cannot write back, for you must not send letters here. It would never do. But I think of you, dear,"--the [...] "dear" [...] had been erased and rewritten--"and I must write and tell you so, and of that nice walk we had, if I never write again. I am very busy now. My work is rather difficult and I am afraid I am a little stupid. It is hard to be interested in anything just because that is how you have to live, is it not? I daresay you sometimes feel the same of school. But I suppose everybody is doing things they don't like. I don't know when I shall come to Whortley again, if ever, but very likely you will be coming to London. Mrs. Frobisher said the most horrid things. It would be nice If you could come to London, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> perhaps <b>you</b> might see me. There is a big boys' school at Chelsea, and when I go by it every morning I wish <b>you</b> were there. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> would come out in your cap and gown as I went by. Suppose some day I was to see you there suddenly!!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Once a year, Northrup and {{his father}} would make a seven-hour drive (before the expressways) to Detroit when the Boston Red Sox came to town. Ted Williams was Northrup's idol, the [...] "only idol I've ever had." [...] Northrup, however, never saw a {{complete}} game as a boy. Rather than pay full price, his father would [...] "wait until the sixth or seventh inning, <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> could give the guy outside a buck or two and you could {{go out there and}} watch Ted play." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked whether}} he {{believed}} [...] "there {{was some kind of}} destiny involved" [...] in humanity's transition to a multi-planetary species, rather than [...] "just physics", Musk responded:Well, I do. Do I think that there's some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff? I think probably not <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> have to say: [...] "Where does the master intelligence come from?" [...] So it sort of begs the question. So I think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics. You know its complex phenomenon from simple elements.|$|E
50|$|Throughout his career, Soler has {{accumulated}} a second {{place at the}} European Championships, 9 Spanish championships and 5 Paralympic Games appearances. He has been a Plan ADOP scholarship holder. Because {{of the amount of}} luggage he has to take in order to compete that needs to be checked, including a wheelchair and a bag with his fencing foils, not all of it arrives on the same plane. As a result, he has had to borrow equipment from his teammates to compete. Because of his personality, he has tried to avoid team events and only compete in individual events <b>because</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> are only responsible for yourself and not others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it. They {{are very}} amusing, these boys, Jim. I was really quite sorry for Richards, but I {{told him he would}} get over it in time, for as far as I could learn you had been just as bad thirty-three times before I finally took pity on you, and that I only did it <b>then</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> were wearing away with your troubles. I advised him to put the best face he could on it, for that Miss Hannay would be the last person to be pleased, if he were to be going about with a face as long {{as if he had just}} come from his aunt's funeral." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 255. As I {{have been}} writing these paragraphs, I have been {{checking}} myself almost at every word,--wondering, Will they be restless on their seats at this, and thinking all the while {{that they did not}} come here to be lectured on Divinity? You may have been a little impatient,--how could it well be otherwise? Had I been explaining points of anatomy, and showing you how you bent your necks and straightened your legs, you would have thought me quite in my proper function; <b>because</b> <b>then,</b> when <b>you</b> went with a party of connoisseurs through the Vatican, you could point out to them the insertion of the clavicle in the Apollo Belvidere; and in the Sistine Chapel the perfectly accurate delineation of the tibia in the legs of Christ. Doubtless; but you know I am lecturing at present on the goffi, and not on Michael Angelo; and the goffi are very careless about clavicles and shin-bones; so that if, after being lectured on anatomy, you went into the Campo Santo of Pisa, you would simply find nothing to look at, except three tolerably well- drawn skeletons. But if after being lectured on theology, you go into the Campo Santo of Pisa, you will find not a little to look at, and to remember.|$|R
500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd <b>because</b> <b>then</b> why did <b>you</b> want to do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|R
