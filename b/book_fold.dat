Book music is made from thick cardboard, containing perforated holes specifying the musical notes to be played, with the <b>book</b> <b>folded</b> zig-zag style.

The length of each tune was no longer determined by the physical dimensions of the instrument.|$|R

Publication was {{intended}} for 1907 as a companion piece to the panorama books, The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit and The Story of Miss Moppet, but booksellers objected to the panorama format which {{was nothing more than}} a long paper strip of illustrations and text that folded accordion-fashion into a wallet and was tied with a ribbon. It was difficult to keep such a <b>book</b> <b>folded</b> and enclosed in its wallet after curious customers opened it for examination. The story was set aside.|$|R

50|$|The Posts {{frequent}} {{reports of}} collusion would at times decimate advertising revenue. However, the paper always turned a profit because the exposés were immensely popular with readers. The Posts {{role in a}} 1905 Democratic mayoral victory led some advertisers to boycott the paper {{for up to a}} decade, and its valuation fell by half. The paper habitually refused advertisements attacking labor unions, such as those by Postum Cereals in 1905. In 1914, the Post weathered a severe drop in advertising after it exposed a scheme to extend the franchises of the local utilities and sided with striking streetcar workers. Still, disappointed that the Posts advertising business always pressured the paper to moderate its investigative reporting, E. W. Scripps founded the Chicago Day Book in 1911 as an experimental daily paper entirely devoid of advertising. The Day <b>Book</b> <b>folded</b> in 1917.|$|R

The book is usually bound by stacking the pages and fixing one edge, and using a cover thicker than the sheets. Some codices are continuously folded like a concertina. The alternative to paged codex format for a long document is the continuous scroll. Examples of folded codices include the Maya codices.

The series totals of thirteen drawings, all made on note cards. The second <b>book,</b> <b>Folds</b> (1991), {{is a collection of}} photographs documenting extent sheepfolds; a unique indigenous structure found throughout the island. To Place: Verne’s Journey (1995), the fifth in the series, refers to the North Atlantic island where the book Journey to Center of The Earth (1864), by Jules Verne, began. Horn’s volume opens with a series of aerial geographic views of Iceland, continues with multiple images of the island’s geological formations, and concludes with images of crashing waves. A photographic essay, the seventh volume Arctic Circles (1998) records the endless horizon of the North Sea, the feathers of an eider nest, and the rotating beacon of a lighthouse, invoking in form the very circumference of Iceland. Doubt Box (Book IX) (2006) is a collection of cards rather than a bound volume. Printed on both sides, the cards show pictures of glacial water, taxidermied birds, and of the same face, a little older.|$|R

25|$|Sewing {{through the}} fold (also called Smyth Sewing), where the {{signatures}} of the <b>book</b> are <b>folded</b> and stitched through the fold.

Many varieties of sewing stitches exist, from basic links to the often used Kettle Stitch. While Western books are generally sewn through punched holes or sawed notches along the fold, some Asian bindings, such as the Retchoso or Butterfly Stitch of Japan, use small slits instead of punched holes.|$|R
