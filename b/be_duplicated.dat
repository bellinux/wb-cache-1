5|$|Cervical {{agenesis}} {{is a rare}} congenital {{condition in}} which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the vagina to develop. Other congenital cervical abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of the vagina and uterus. The cervix may <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> in situations such as bicornuate uterus and uterine didelphys.|$|E
5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} varies {{in size and}} location. The foramen is rarely absent, usually unilaterally, {{in which case the}} middle meningeal artery enters the cranial cavity through the foramen ovale. It may be incomplete, which may occur in almost half of the population. Conversely, in a {{minority}} of cases (less than 1%), it may also <b>be</b> <b>duplicated,</b> particularly when the middle meningeal artery is also duplicated.|$|E
5|$|Tessellation or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E
50|$|The Nishi-Suzurandai - Aina section <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> in 1982, and the Kizu - Oshibedani section <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> between 1979 and 1989.|$|R
25|$|Tunnels are {{confined}} {{spaces and}} <b>are</b> difficult to <b>duplicate</b> while trains keep on running. Generally they <b>are</b> <b>duplicated</b> {{by building a}} second tunnel. An exception is the Hoosac Tunnel, which <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> by enlarging the bore.|$|R
50|$|In 1911 {{the line}} was {{extended}} to Horikawa (since closed), and the Horikawa - Ozone section <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> in 1914. The Ozone - Owari Seto section <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> between 1921 and 1929.|$|R
5|$|Many {{circumstances}} surrounding the film—including its unusual budget, length, and production time, {{as well as its}} similarities to the 1901 New York attraction—indicate that Méliès was especially keen to release the film in the United States. Because of rampant film piracy, Méliès never received most of the profits of the popular film. One account reports that Méliès sold a print of the film to the Paris photographer Charles Gerschel for use in an Algiers theatre, under strict stipulation that the print only be shown in Algeria. Gerschel sold the print, and various other Méliès films, to the Edison Manufacturing Company employee Alfred C. Abadie, who sent them directly to Edison's laboratories to <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> and sold by Vitagraph. Copies of the print spread to other firms, and by 1904 Siegmund Lubin, the Selig Polyscope Company, and Edison were all redistributing it. Edison's print of the film was even offered in a hand-colored version available at a higher price, just as Méliès had done. Méliès was often uncredited altogether; {{for the first six months}} of the film's distribution, the only American exhibitor to credit Méliès in advertisements for the film was Thomas Lincoln Tally, who chose the film as the inaugural presentation of his Electric Theater.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to <b>be</b> <b>duplicated.</b> Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E
50|$|On 15 July 1985, {{the line}} from Gymea to Caringbah <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> with a new track laid north of the {{existing}} single line. In April 2010, {{the rest of the}} line <b>was</b> <b>duplicated.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 5 May 1986, {{the line}} <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> from Riverwood {{with a new}} track laid {{to the north of}} the {{existing}} one. The line from Padstow to Revesby <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> around the same time.|$|R
50|$|The Tomita - Kuwana section (except for {{the bridge}} over the Inabegawa) <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> in 1973, and the Kuwana - Yatomi section between 1977 and 1980. The Yokkaichi - Tomidahama section <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> in 1993.|$|R
25|$|As {{part of this}} proposal, {{the current}} 12.8km section of single track between Hizen Yamaguchi and Takeo Onsen is to <b>be</b> <b>duplicated,</b> with work on that {{component}} scheduled to commence in April 2016.|$|E
25|$|The base to each {{sculpture}} holds {{a bronze}} tablet bearing {{the name of}} the person commemorated, significant dates, achievements and quotations. Each bronze bust must have been made specifically for The Hall of Fame and must not <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> within 50 years of its execution.|$|E
25|$|Gardner {{believes}} that careers that suit {{those with high}} bodily-kinesthetic intelligence include: athletes, dancers, musicians, actors, builders, police officers, and soldiers. Although these careers can <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> through virtual simulation, they will not produce the actual physical learning that is needed in this intelligence.|$|E
50|$|On 25 October 1970 {{the line}} from Werribee to Little River <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> and the goods siding closed. On 4 June 1981 the line to Lara <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> and a second {{platform}} (Platform 1) provided.|$|R
50|$|On 9 December 1985, {{the line}} from Revesby to East Hills <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> with a new track laid {{to the north of}} the {{existing}} one. The line from Kingsgrove to Revesby <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> around the same time.|$|R
50|$|The {{result of}} the change from loose sheets to albums is that the {{regional}} pages <b>are</b> <b>duplicated,</b> as <b>are</b> {{the arms of the}} principal cities in the two provinces of the Alsace Region (Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin). Of the 1363 images, 62 <b>are</b> <b>duplicated.</b>|$|R
25|$|Every local {{authority}} has been allocated a unique prefix for their stop numbering, this ensures that stop numbers cannot <b>be</b> <b>duplicated,</b> in addition there are national number prefixes - 900 for coach stops, 910 for railway stations, 920 for airports, 930 for ferry terminals and 940 for metro and tram stops, the national stop numbers are created centrally {{and not by}} local authorities.|$|E
25|$|The same (asymmetric) design may <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> on both sides. Such flags can be {{manufactured}} by creating two identical {{through and through}} flags and then sewing them back to back, though this can affect the resulting combination's responsiveness to the wind. Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol , indicating the reverse is congruent to (rather than a mirror image of) the obverse.|$|E
25|$|Inspection of the {{propeller}} from Garros' machine prompted Idflieg {{to attempt to}} copy it. Initial trials indicated that the deflector wedges would not be sufficiently strong {{to cope with the}} standard steel-jacketed German ammunition, and representatives from Fokker and Pfalz, two companies already building Morane copies (although, strangely, not Schneider's LVG concern) were invited to Döberitz to inspect the mechanism and suggest ways that its action might <b>be</b> <b>duplicated.</b>|$|E
50|$|The section from Bowen Hills to Eagle Junction <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> in 1886, {{extended}} to Northgate in 1890 and Caboolture in 1917. The section from Roma Street to Bowen Hills was opened as double track, {{one of the}} few lines in Queensland so built, in 1890. The line from Caboolture to Beerburrum <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> when realigned in 2009, meaning the first 65 km of the NCL <b>is</b> <b>duplicated.</b> Plans have <b>been</b> announced to realign and duplicate to Nambour (a further 40 km), but the completion date is 2031.|$|R
50|$|Each VHS tape had {{two pairs}} of episodes. The first three VHS tapes with {{two pairs of}} episodes each were {{released}} on March 23, 1999. The first three <b>were</b> <b>duplicated</b> in either EP/SLP, LP, or SP while the last three <b>were</b> <b>duplicated</b> in the SP mode.|$|R
50|$|The line <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> between 1908 and 1912.|$|R
25|$|Each router has an {{identifier}}, customarily {{written in}} the dotted decimal format (e.g., 1.2.3.4) of an IP address. This identifier must be established in every OSPF instance. If not explicitly configured, the highest logical IP address will <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> as the router identifier. However, since the router identifier is not an IP address, {{it does not have}} to be a part of any routable subnet in the network, and often isn't to avoid confusion.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Age {{also saw}} {{developers}} experimenting with vector displays, which produced crisp lines that couldn't <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> by raster displays. A {{few of these}} vector games became great hits, such as 1979's Asteroids, 1980's Battlezone and Tempest and 1983's Star Wars from Atari, as well as 1982's Star Trek from Sega. However, vector technology fell out of favor with arcade game companies due to {{the high cost of}} repairing vector displays.|$|E
25|$|Byte {{encodings}} and UTF-8 {{are represented}} by byte arrays in programs, and often nothing {{needs to be done}} to a function when converting from a byte encoding to UTF-8. UTF-16 is represented by 16-bit word arrays, and converting to UTF-16 while maintaining compatibility with existing ASCII-based programs (such as was done with Windows) requires every API and data structure that takes a string to <b>be</b> <b>duplicated,</b> one version accepting byte strings and another version accepting UTF-16.|$|E

50|$|The same program content <b>is</b> <b>duplicated</b> on both subchannels.|$|R
50|$|CTC {{signalling}} {{was commissioned}} in 1958, and the Atami to Kinomiya section <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> in 1968. The entire line was {{originally designed to}} be built as double track, and earthworks were undertaken on this basis, including tunneling, but to date only the first 1.2 km of the line has <b>been</b> <b>duplicated.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bakelite's {{molding process}} {{had a number}} of advantages. Bakelite resin could be {{provided}} either as powder, or as preformed partially cured slugs, increasing the speed of the casting. Thermosetting resins such as Bakelite required heat and pressure during the molding cycle, but could be removed from the molding process without being cooled, again making the molding process faster. Also, because of the smooth polished surface that resulted, Bakelite objects required less finishing. Millions of parts could <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> quickly and relatively cheaply.|$|E
25|$|However, in the {{sporadic}} form, both alleles {{would need}} to sustain a mutation before the cell can become cancerous. This explains why sufferers of sporadic retinoblastoma are not at increased risk of cancers later in life, as both alleles are functional in all their other cells. Future cancer incidence in sporadic Rb cases is observed with polynomial kinetics, not exactly quadratic as expected because the first mutation must arise through normal mechanisms, and then can <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> by LOH {{to result in a}} tumour progenitor.|$|E
25|$|Library {{expansion}} – {{was calculated}} in 1945 by Fremont Rider to double in capacity every 16 years, if sufficient space were made available. He advocated replacing bulky, decaying printed works with miniaturized microform analog photographs, which could <b>be</b> <b>duplicated</b> on-demand for library patrons or other institutions. He did not foresee the digital technology {{that would follow}} decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging, storage, and transmission media. Automated, potentially lossless digital technologies allowed vast increases in the rapidity of information growth in an era that now sometimes is called the Information Age.|$|E
50|$|The Amagasaki - Tsukaguchi section <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> in 1934, and {{extended}} to Takarazuka in 1979/80. The Takarazuka - Shin-Sanda section <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> in 1986 {{in conjunction with}} the opening of the 2970m Najio tunnel and associated deviation, which shortened the route by 1.8 km. Duplication to Sasayamaguchi was completed in 1996.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{completion}} of the Neu-Ulm 21 project in 2009, the Neu-Ulm-Kempten line has <b>been</b> <b>duplicated</b> from Neu-Ulm Finningerstraße station to Neu-Ulm station. The continuation of the line over the Danube has also <b>been</b> <b>duplicated</b> so that the line runs to Ulm Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) independently of the Augsburg-Ulm railway.|$|R
5|$|The Bendigo and Geelong–Ballarat mainlines {{were both}} built as double {{track in the}} 1860s, but were singled in the 1930s and {{first decade of the}} 21st century respectively. The {{north-east}} line to Seymour <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> in the mid-1880s and remains so today, the Gippsland line to Moe <b>was</b> <b>duplicated</b> in the 1950s in conjunction with increased briquette traffic, and the busiest country line in the state to Geelong <b>was</b> progressively <b>duplicated</b> from 1959 to 1981.|$|R
