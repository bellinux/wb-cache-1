5|$|After SpongeBob and Patrick leave, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty {{formula and}} {{uses it to}} produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the Chum <b>Bucket,</b> {{claiming}} that Krabs bequeathed him the recipe. As a contingency, he hires a hitman named Dennis to eliminate SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward discovers the truth about Plankton stealing Neptune's crown and tries to alert Neptune. However, Plankton uses mind-controlling <b>bucket</b> helmets, disguised as souvenirs, to control Bikini Bottom's residents, including Squidward, and renames the city Planktopolis and exiles Mindy.|$|E

5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American <b>bucket</b> orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The <b>bucket</b> orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we show {{detailed}} analysis and performance {{evaluation of the}} Dynamic Hybrid GRACE Hash Join Method (DHGH Method) when the tuple distribution in <b>buckets</b> is unbalanced. The conventional Hash Join Methods specify the tuple distribution in <b>buckets</b> statically. However it may differ from estimation since join operations are applied with selection operations. When the tuple distribution in <b>buckets</b> is unbalanced, the processing cost of join operation becomes more costly than the ideal case when you use Hybrid Hash Join Method (HH Method). On the other hand, when you use the DHGH Method, the destaging <b>buckets</b> are selected dynamically, gives the same performance as the ideal case even if the tuple distribution in <b>buckets</b> is unbalanced such as Zipf-like distributions. We analyze the total I/O cost of a join operation at various number of <b>buckets.</b> The result shows {{that we have to}} determine the number of <b>buckets</b> baaed on the tuple distribution in <b>buckets</b> rather than the size of the source relation. It is shown that we had better partition the source relation using a large number of small <b>buckets</b> instead of the smaller number of <b>buckets</b> almost filling the whole main memory adopted in the HH Method. ...|$|R
50|$|The insert {{operation}} is extended to increment {{the value of}} the <b>buckets,</b> and the lookup operation checks that each of the required <b>buckets</b> is non-zero. The delete operation then consists of decrementing the value of each of the respective <b>buckets.</b>|$|R
5|$|Charlie <b>Bucket</b> (Freddie Highmore) is a {{kind and}} loving boy living in poverty with his parents (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) and four {{bedridden}} grandparents. They all rely on his father for income, employed at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting the caps on the tubes. However, Mr. <b>Bucket</b> eventually loses his job because the factory replaced him with a machine that puts the caps on the tubes. Down the street is Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory, which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) worked for Wonka before the termination.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the <b>bucket,</b> or the <b>bucket</b> or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E

5|$|Krabs' rival {{and former}} best friend Plankton {{operates}} the Chum <b>Bucket,</b> a failing restaurant {{across the street}} from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the series is Plankton's futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer sidekick Karen, under the assumption that they would be able to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent Plankton from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty legitimately out of fear that Plankton might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula. Krabs also makes it his duty to ensure that the Chum <b>Bucket</b> never has any business whatsoever.|$|E

5|$|SpongeBob asks Mr. Krabs for assistance, but he {{supports}} the highway, believing that it can bring more customers to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob then shows Mr. Krabs the highway's blueprint, which shows that the highway with concrete columns will run over the Krusty Krab and end directly at the Chum <b>Bucket,</b> revealing that Plankton {{is responsible for the}} highway's development. Mr. Krabs is outraged at this revelation and decides to support SpongeBob. They both go to the Chum <b>Bucket</b> and ask Plankton to not develop the highway, but he states {{that the rest of the}} town has already unanimously voted to build the highway.|$|E
50|$|Referred to as Sitapur {{in ancient}} times, Pyangaun is a centuries-old {{crafting}} village. The settlement's {{name comes from}} its unique production of bamboo <b>buckets,</b> known as pyang in Nepali.

40|$|Abstract. In {{data storage}} applications, a large {{collection}} of consecutively numbered data “buckets ” are often mapped {{to a relatively}} small collection of consecutively numbered storage “bins. ” For example, in parallel database applications, <b>buckets</b> Correspond to hash <b>buckets</b> of data and bins correspond to database nodes. In disk array applications, <b>buckets</b> correspond to logical tracks and bins correspond to physical disks in an array. Measures of the “goodness ” of a mapping method include: (1) The rime (number of operations) needed to compute the mapping. (2) The storage needed to store {{a representation of the}} mapping. (3) The balance of the mapping, i. e., the extent to which all bins receive the same number of <b>buckets.</b> (4) The cost of relocation, that is, the number of <b>buckets</b> that must be relocated to a new bin if a new mapping is needed due to an expansion of the number of bins or the number of <b>buckets.</b> One contribution {{of this paper is to}} give a new mapping method, the Interval-Round-Robin (IRR) method. The IRR method has optimal balance and relocation cost, and its time complexity and storage requirements compare favorably with known methods. Specifically, if m is the number of times that the number of bins and/or <b>buckets</b> has increased, then the time complexity is O(1 ogm) and the storage is O(rn 2). Another contribution of the paper is to identify the concept of a history-independent mapping, meaning informally that the mapping does not “remember ” the past history of expansions to the number of <b>buckets</b> and bins, but only the current number of <b>buckets</b> and bins. Thus, such mappings require very little information to be stored. Assuming that balance and relocation are optimal, we prove that history-independent mappings are possible if the number of <b>buckets</b> is fixed (so only the number of bins can increase), but not possible if the number of bins and <b>buckets</b> can both increase...|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} {{partially}} cast with stock actors that Corman had used in previous films. Writer Charles B. Griffith portrays several small roles. Griffith's father {{appears as a}} dental patient, and his grandmother, Myrtle Vail, appears as Seymour's hypochondriac mother. Dick Miller, who had starred as the protagonist of A <b>Bucket</b> of Blood was offered the role of Seymour, but turned it down, instead taking the smaller role of Burson Fouch. Production at the <b>Bucket</b> of Blood sets was compressed into three days of cast rehearsals, immediately followed by two days and one night of principal photography.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} {{inclined}} planes was an innovation that Green had pioneered elsewhere. He had been the engineer for the Bude Canal, which included six planes, five powered by water wheels and one by a descending <b>bucket</b> mechanism.

40|$|Abstract. In data {{warehousing}} applications, numerous OLAP queries involve {{the processing of}} holistic aggregators such as computing the “top n, ” median, quantiles, etc. In this paper, we present a novel approach called dynamic <b>bucketing</b> to efficiently evaluate these aggregators. We partition data into equiwidth <b>buckets</b> and further partition dense <b>buckets</b> into subbuckets as needed by allocating and reclaiming memory space. The <b>bucketing</b> process dynamically adapts to the input order and distribution of input datasets. The histograms of the <b>buckets</b> and subbuckets are stored in our new data structure called structure trees. A recent selection algorithm based on regular sampling is generalized and its analysis extended. We have also compared our new algorithms with this generalized algorithm and several other recent algorithms. Experimental results show that our new algorithms significantly outperform prior ones {{not only in the}} runtime but also in accuracy...|$|R
