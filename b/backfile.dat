25|$|Wiley's scientific, technical, {{and medical}} {{business}} was significantly expanded by {{the acquisition of}} Blackwell Publishing in February 2007. The combined business, named Scientific, Technical, Medical, and Scholarly (also known as Wiley-Blackwell), publishes, in print and online, 1,400 scholarly peer-reviewed journals and an extensive collection of books, major reference works, databases, and laboratory manuals in the life and physical sciences, medicine and allied health, engineering, the humanities, and the social sciences. Through a <b>backfile</b> initiative completed in 2007, 8.2 million pages of journal content have been made available online, a collection dating back to 1799. Wiley-Blackwell also publishes on behalf of about 700 professional and scholarly societies; among them are the American Cancer Society (ACS), for which it publishes Cancer, the flagship ACS journal; the Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing; and the American Anthropological Association. Other major journals published include Angewandte Chemie, Advanced Materials, Hepatology, International Finance and Liver Transplantation.|$|E
500|$|The early 1950s saw {{dramatic}} changes in the world of U.S. science fiction publishing. At the start of 1949, {{all but one of the}} major magazines in the field were in pulp format; by the end of 1955, almost all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format. [...] Despite the rapid decline of the pulp market, several new science fiction magazines were launched in pulp format during these years; Tops in Science Fiction was one of the last of these. [...] The publisher, Love Romances Inc., also published Planet Stories, and Malcolm Reiss, Planets editorial director, decided to try to take advantage of the <b>backfile</b> of stories and artwork from Planets 14 years of publication. [...] He may have been inspired by the example of Fantastic Story Magazine, which was published by Standard Magazines as a vehicle to reprint their extensive <b>backfile</b> of science fiction. [...] If so, he was evidently not aware that by 1953 Fantastic Story was not doing well financially.|$|E

40|$|I {{am happy}} to report that the Library’s budget will be {{increased}} $ 150, 000 for 2005 - 2006 to cover the annual cost increase for the current journal and database subscriptions, and to add a few new subscriptions for journals which have been heavily requested on interlibrary loan. The Library also recently received $ 26, 000 from the Arkansas Biosciences Institute, which was {{used to pay for}} improved online access to the New England Journal of Medicine for all UA campuses, a portion of the Cell Press online journals, and the online <b>backfiles</b> of the Wiley neurosciences journals. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is currently involved in a massive project to digitize major journal <b>backfiles</b> not yet available electronically. The articles will be made available through PubMed Central, which is NLM’s free online repository of journal articles. Libraries throughout the country have been asked to provide needed print <b>backfiles,</b> and the UAMS Library has provided printed <b>backfiles</b> for two journal titles totaling about 75 volumes.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1950 Fiction House {{launched}} a companion magazine to Planet. [...] It was titled Two Complete Science-Adventure Books; the policy was to print two novels in a single magazine. [...] It appeared {{three times a year}} and lasted until the spring of 1954. [...] In 1953 Fiction House launched a reprint magazine, Tops in Science Fiction, selecting the contents from the <b>backfile</b> of stories that had appeared in Planet. [...] It only lasted for two issues, the second of which received almost no distribution.|$|E
500|$|Cohen also {{launched}} {{a series of}} reprint magazines, drawing from the <b>backfile</b> of both Amazing and Fantastic, again using the second serial rights he had acquired from Ziff-Davis. [...] The first reprint magazine was Great Science Fiction; the first issue, titled Great Science Fiction from Amazing, appeared in August 1965. [...] By early 1967 this had been joined by The Most Thrilling Science Fiction Ever Told and Science Fiction Classics. [...] These increased the workload on Wrzos, though Cohen made the selection of stories, and Wrzos found himself able to work on Fantastic and Amazing only part-time. Cohen hired Herb Lehrman {{to help with the}} other magazines.|$|E
500|$|Circulation dropped {{for both}} Amazing and Fantastic; in 1964 Fantastic had a paid {{circulation}} of only 27,000. [...] In 1965 Sol Cohen, who {{at that time}} was Galaxys publisher, set up his own publishing company, Ultimate Publishing, and bought both Amazing and Fantastic from Ziff-Davis. [...] Cohen had decided to make the magazines as profitable as possible by filling them only with reprints. This was possible because Ziff-Davis had acquired second serial rights for all stories they had published, and since Cohen had bought the <b>backfile</b> of stories he was able to reprint them using these rights. [...] Using reprints in this way saved Cohen about $8,000 a year between the two magazines. [...] Lalli decided that {{she did not want to}} work for Cohen, and stayed with Ziff-Davis. [...] Her last issue was June 1965. [...] Cohen replaced Lalli with Joseph Wrzos, who used the name [...] "Joseph Ross" [...] on the magazines. [...] Cohen had met Wrzos at the Galaxy offices not long before; Wrzos was teaching English full-time, but had worked for Gnome Press as an assistant editor in 1953–1954.|$|E

500|$|In the mid-1950s, Leo Margulies, a {{well-known}} {{figure in the}} magazine publishing world, launched a new company, Renown Publications, with plans to publish several titles. [...] He acquired the rights to both Weird Tales and Short Stories, and hoped to bring both magazines back. [...] He abandoned a plan to restart Weird Tales in 1962, using reprints from the original magazine, after being advised by Sam Moskowitz {{that there was little}} market for weird and horror fiction at the time. [...] Instead Margulies mined the Weird Tales <b>backfile</b> for four anthologies which appeared in the early 1960s: The Unexpected, The Ghoul-Keepers, Weird Tales, and Worlds of Weird. [...] The latter two were ghost-edited by Moskowitz, who proposed to Margulies that when the time was right to start the magazine up again, it should include reprints from obscure sources that Moskowitz had found, rather than just stories reprinted from the first incarnation of Weird Tales. [...] These stories would be as good as new for most readers, and the money saved could be used for an occasional new story.|$|E
500|$|The first {{science fiction}} (sf) magazine, Amazing Stories, was {{launched}} in 1926 by Hugo Gernsback {{at the height of}} the pulp magazine era. [...] It helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre, and by the mid-1930s several more sf magazines had appeared, including Wonder Stories, also published by Gernsback. [...] In 1936, Ned Pines of Beacon Publications bought Wonder Stories from Gernsback. [...] Pines changed the title to Thrilling Wonder Stories, and in 1939 and 1940 added two more sf titles: Startling Stories and Captain Future. [...] Pines had acquired reprint rights to the fiction published in Wonder Stories as part of the transaction, and he instituted a [...] "Hall of Fame" [...] department in Startling Stories to carry some of this material. [...] Captain Future also carried [...] reprint material, but neither Startling nor Captain Future had room for some of the longer stories in the <b>backfile.</b> [...] At the end of the 1940s a boom in science fiction magazines encouraged Pines to issue a new magazine, titled Fantastic Story Quarterly, as a vehicle for reprinting this older material. [...] The original plan was for the magazine to carry no new fiction, but this policy was changed shortly before publication, and at least one new story was included in every issue.|$|E

500|$|In July 1966 Roberts & Vinter's distributor, Thorpe & Porter, went bankrupt, owing Roberts & Vinter a {{substantial}} sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts & Vinter {{to focus on}} their more profitable magazines, and they made plans to close down both Science Fantasy and New Worlds. [...] After hearing of these plans, Moorcock and Warburton began to consider forming a separate company to continue publishing New Worlds, and Brian Aldiss contacted well-known literary figures such as J.B. Priestley, Kingsley Amis, Marghanita Laski, and Angus Wilson to gain support for an application for {{a grant from the}} British Arts Council in late 1966. [...] In early January 1967 Aldiss discovered that the grant application would be successful, and that New Worlds would be awarded £150 per issue, though in the event the formal grant certification was delayed until at least May. [...] The grant was enough to enable the magazine to continue, though it would not cover all costs. [...] A publisher still needed to be found, and both Fontana and Panther Books expressed an interest, but the promise of the money and the prestige of an Arts Council grant convinced Warburton to stay involved personally. [...] While these negotiations were going on, two more issues were assembled from <b>backfile</b> material and donated stories. [...] Roberts & Vinter had ceased to exist by this time, so a sister company, Gold Star Publications, became the publisher for both these issues, with Warburton and Aldiss providing Gold Star with personal financial guarantees. [...] These two issues appeared in March and April 1967, but the latter was mistakenly also dated March in the indicia. [...] Science Fantasy, which by this time had been retitled SF Impulse, was not continued but was merged with New Worlds as of the first Gold Star issue, though nothing of SF Impulses design or content was visible in New Worlds.|$|E
