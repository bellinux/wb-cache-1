In response to this, a great deal of ergonomics research effort has been directed towards the analysis of <b>brake</b> <b>reaction</b> times. However, the engineering solution has been to develop advanced systems for longitudinal control, which it is argued will mitigate the problem of rear-end collisions. So far, though, there have been few empirical studies to determine how <b>brake</b> <b>reaction</b> times will be affected by such vehicle automation. This paper presents a literature review summarizing the current state of knowledge about driver responses in non-automated vehicles. The review covers driver factors, vehicle factors and situational factors. Following the review, some empirical data are presented from a driving simulator experiment assessing <b>brake</b> <b>reaction</b> times of skilled and unskilled drivers under two different levels of automation.

The {{aim of this study}} was to better determine the link between increasing cognitive workload and corresponding reaction times that are relevant to the driving task, for example <b>brake</b> <b>reactions</b> to sudden events. In a driving simulator study with 35 middle-aged participants, subjects had to remember a series of digits ranging from 2 to 5 numbers, recall them in the reverse order and additionally react to suddenly appearing pedestrians. Cognitive workload was assessed by a head-mounted detection response task (DRT). It was hypothesized that with increasing difficulty of the cognitive task, hence increasing cognitive workload, reaction times to the DRT as well as <b>brake</b> <b>reaction</b> times to the pedestrian increase. DRT reaction time increased significantly with ascending number of digits. However, increasing cognitive workload did not affect <b>brake</b> <b>reaction</b> times in this setting. One reason might be the strong salience of pedestrians as a stimulus, leading to no increase in reaction time...|$|R

This paper describes the impact of an auditory secondary task on drivers' mental states during a primary driving task. N = 20 participants performed the test procedure in a car following task with repeated forced braking on a non-public test track. Performance measures (provoked <b>reaction</b> time to <b>brake</b> lights) and brain activity (EEG alpha spindles) were analyzed to describe distracted drivers. Further, a classification approach was used to investigate whether alpha spindles can predict drivers' mental states. Results show that reaction times and alpha spindle rate increased with time-on-task. Moreover, <b>brake</b> <b>reaction</b> times and alpha spindle rate were significantly higher while driving with auditory secondary task opposed to driving only. In single-trial classification, a combination of spindle parameters yielded a median classification error of about 8 % in discriminating the distracted from the alert driving.

Driver’s reaction time deeply impacts on the safety of driver’s manoeuvres. Psychological sciences approach is not properly consistent to objectives of road engineering.

It is a method to assess the time taken from the perception of a stimulus followed by mental processing for a motor response. Reaction time in various day to day activities as in driving a car is very important. <b>Brake</b> <b>reaction</b> time (BRT) is the time taken for the driver to respond to visualize an object and to press the brake pedal. It is affected by many features like age, gender, neuromuscular disorders. OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY Study has been undertaken to compare the BRT in male and female drivers and to analyze the effect of sex difference on <b>Brake</b> <b>reaction</b> time. MATERIALS & METHODS Male and female subjects between the age group of 25 – 35 years with driving license were included. Study is conducted in a stationary car. An in-house built; braking timer is fixed to the electric circuit of the braking system in the car. This device is wirelessly connected to the reaction time software installed in the laptop. The subject is instructed to press the brake pedal when the light changed from red to green in the laptop screen. 5 readings are taken and the mean BRT is recorded. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS & RESULTS Statistical analysis done with unpaired student t test indicates that the BRT was more in the females than the males and was statistically significant (p value - 0007).

This study examined the ability of 2 MWT trials to predict driving-simulator performance in healthy individuals. Patients or Participants: Twenty healthy volunteers (mean age 22. 8 years; 9 men). Interventions: NA. Measurements and Results: The MWT and driving-simulator performance were examined under 2 conditions—partial sleep deprivation and a combination of partial sleep deprivation and alcohol consumption. Each subject was studied a week apart, with the order randomly assigned. Subjects completed a nighttime 70 -minute AusEd driving simulation task and two 40 -minute MWT trials, 1 before (MWT 1) and 1 after (MWT 2) the driving task. In the sleep-deprived condition, the MWT 1 sleep latency was inversely correlated with <b>braking</b> <b>reaction</b> time. During the partial sleep deprivation and alcohol condition, the number of microsleeps during the driving task, steering deviation, <b>braking</b> <b>reaction</b> time, and crashes all negatively correlated with the MWT 1 sleep latency. Additionally, construction of a receiver-operator characteristic curve revealed that MWT 1 sleep latency in the partial sleep deprivation plus alcohol condition significantly discriminated subjects who had a crash from those who did not. Conclusions: These results indicate that sleep latency on the MWT is a reasonable predictor of driving simulator performance in sleepy, alcohol- impaired, normal subjects. Further research is needed to examine the relationship between daytime MWT results and driving simulator performance in sleepy patients (eg, those with obstructive sleep apnea) and in experimentally sleep-deprived normal subjects.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to refine a {{commercial}} car driving simulation for occupational research. As the effects of ethanol on driving behavior are well established, we choose alcohol as a test compound to investigate the performance of subjects during simulation. Materials and Methods: We programmed a night driving scenario consisting of monotonous highway and a rural road on a Foerst F 10 -P driving simulator. Twenty healthy men, 19 - 30 years, participated in a pilot study. Subjects were screened for simulator sickness, followed by training on the simulator one hour in total. Experiments were performed in the morning on a separate day. Participants were randomized into either an alcoholized or a control group. All subjects drove two courses consisting of highway and rural road and were sober for the first course. During a 1 h break the ethanol group drank an alcoholic beverage to yield 0. 06 % blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze the influence of alcohol on driving performance. Among others, independent variables were Simulator Sickness Questionnaire scores and subjective sleepiness. Results: Subjects did not experience simulator sickness during the experiments. Mean BAC before the second test drive was 0. 065 % in the mildly intoxicated group. There was no clear-cut difference in the number of crashes between 2 groups. BAC of 0. 1 % would deteriorate mean <b>braking</b> <b>reaction</b> time by 237 ms (SE = 112, p < 0. 05). Ethanol slightly impaired the tracking in the righthand curves (p = 0. 058). <b>Braking</b> <b>reaction</b> time improved by 86 ms (SE = 36, p < 0. 05) for the second test drive, indicating a learning effect.

The major goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the dynamic switchover between preattentive and attentive processing taking place during a simulated driving task. A PC-based driving simulator was used to create the dynamic environment in conjunction with the Eye-Link ™ head-mounted system, which recorded eye movements. Two types of hazards were presented to the subjects: traffic lights and a pedestrian facing the street. The analysis was focused mainly on the situations containing immediate hazards, i. e. a red traffic light and a pedestrian crossing the street. There was a marked increase in fixation duration around the time of emergence of an immediate hazard. This phasic increase was time-invariant. It is therefore possible to track the switching from one level of processing to another with reference to analysis of driver’s visual fixations. The study is concluded by a discussion of attentional conditions where overlooked or not sufficiently processed hazards do not lead to the appropriate <b>braking</b> <b>reaction</b> on the part of the driver...|$|R

In the experiment, the CWS warnings significantly reduced <b>brake</b> <b>reaction</b> time and prompted drivers to press the brake pedal more heavily, demonstrating the effectiveness of CWS warnings in alerting drivers to avoid red-light running (RLR) vehicles when approaching a signalized intersection. Providing a clear warning with directional information about an urgent hazard event could give drivers adequate time to prepare for the potential collision.

Phone tasks were chosen that vary across two factors: interaction medium (text vs image) and task pacing (self-paced vs experimenter-paced) and were as follows: Text messaging with the experimenter (text/other-paced), reading Facebook posts (text/self-paced), exchanging photos with the experimenter via Snapchat (image, experimenter-paced), and viewing updates on Instagram (image, experimenter-paced). Drivers also performed a driving only baseline. <b>Brake</b> <b>reaction</b> times (BRTs) were significantly greater in the text-based conditions (Mean = 1. 16 s) as compared to both the image-based conditions (Mean = 0. 92 s) and the baseline (0. 88 s).
