In 2009, {{responding}} to claims by both his literary agent and his biographer that his writing career was over, he told Colombian newspaper El Tiempo: [...] "Not {{only is it}} not true, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> I do is write".|$|E
500|$|Smith had {{attempted}} to go to rehab several times, but {{found that he was}} unable to relate to the popular treatments for addicts that used a twelve-step program basis for treatment. [...] "I couldn't do the first step [...] I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it." [...] In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, [...] "What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic." ...|$|E

50|$|In 2010, an UK based {{developer}} {{created an}} emulator {{image of the}} Android Operating System ported to the HTC Blue Angel, it lacked features {{and there was no}} integration with the user. It was an image of Android 1.6 Doughnut <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> which were usable were the volume control buttons. This development sparked interest on xda-developers where many users were willing to help port a usable Android version to the Blue Angel.|$|R

2500|$|In April 1989, Fleischmann and Pons {{published}} a [...] "preliminary note" [...] in the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry. This paper notably showed a gamma peak without its corresponding Compton edge, which indicated {{they had made}} a mistake in claiming evidence of fusion byproducts. Fleischmann and Pons replied to this critique, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> left clear was that no gamma ray had been registered and that Fleischmann refused to recognize any mistakes in the data. A much longer paper {{published a}} year later went into details of calorimetry but did not include any nuclear measurements.|$|E
2500|$|On February 28, 1914, Jack Pferdner, {{captain of}} the steamer Agnes, was serving on Nestor while Agnes was {{temporarily}} out of service. [...] Nestor was towing logs. [...] Near Prescott about 3 miles upriver from Rainier, some logs broke loose. [...] Pferdner walked out on the log tow to secure the loose logs. [...] This was called “dogging”. [...] The log Pferdner was walking on rolled, and he was thrown head-first into the river. [...] Pferdner came up and tried to grab on to the log, but it kept rolling, {{and he could not}} get a grip. [...] Capt James Peck, in charge of Nestor, yelled at Pferdner to {{get to the end of}} the log, but by this time, Pferdner was too exhausted to comply. [...] He let go of the log and sank under the water, and was not seen again. [...] Grappling hooks were used to search, all afternoon, for Pferdner’s body, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that was found was the hatchet that Pferdner had been holding when he was thrown into the water.|$|E
2500|$|Many US anti-war protesters {{claimed to}} view Binh as a martyr for their cause, {{and shortly after}} the {{incident}} a break-in occurred at Vaughn's home in Scottsdale, Arizona, with [...] "animal intestines, paint and broken bottles" [...] thrown into his swimming pool. The vandal or vandals also left a note, apparently written in animal blood: [...] "Pig Eugene Vaughn guilty of murder. To be punished later. Long live Nguyen Thai Binh. Victory to the Vietnamese. Death to the American aggressor." [...] However, Vaughn was also lauded as a hero who acted to save his passengers, craft and crew, and his actions were described {{as an expression of}} frustration with the many hijackings that occurred during the period. [...] Vaughn was quoted as saying, at an event to honor him at the Phoenix airport on his return to the United States, [...] "A lot of time and effort has been spent on trying to prevent hijackings, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that will be effective is a mandatory death penalty, without any loopholes." [...] Vaughn retired from Pan Am in 1979 after 38 years with the airline, and died of cancer in 1984; both of his sons became airline pilots.|$|E
50|$|The {{expedition}} {{returned to}} St Petersburg on 10 March 1794. Sauer {{was at that}} time in a very critical state of health, suffering from rheumatism. In his apartment he had hidden a diary, some notes and also possibly other secret materials from the expedition. Billings cautioned members of the Admiralty that Sauer might publish them to the world before the Empress Catherine the Great would like. As a result Billings received permission to search Sauer's room, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> he found were a few draft notes. Sauer claimed he had burned the material.|$|R

2500|$|Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon is aged {{for about}} 25 months {{exclusively}} in American oak barrels. Silver Oak’s Alexander Valley wines are aged in both new and once-used American oak barrels and spend an additional 14 months in bottle before release. Silver Oak’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon spends about 20 months in bottle after barrel. In {{answer to the}} question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak. I like tannic wine about as much as I like tough steak." [...] The company formed a partnership with Missouri-based barrel producer A Cooperage in 2000 to have a steady supply of American oak barrels made to Silver Oak’s specifications. Silver Oak’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, produced at the Oakville Winery, is considered to be a wine of deep garnet color with a [...] "complex nose of black cherry, boysenberry, cassis, licorice, coffee and spice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The pair bottled {{their first}} vintage Cabernet Sauvignon in 1972, aging the {{wine in the}} old Keig Dairy barn on the {{original}} plot of land Duncan purchased. They {{made the decision to}} produce only Cabernet Sauvignon and to attempt to produce the finest in the world, to age the wine exclusively in American oak barrels. Meyer said of the reason for deciding to concentrate on one wine, [...] "it was kind of a reaction to my days at Christian Brothers, where we made so many wines it was hard to do them all right, {{and it was kind of}} in keeping with what I thought — that Cabernets were what Napa and Sonoma did best, so why not devote our attention to that. This is a pretty common concept in France." [...] According to noted wine critic Robert Parker, Meyer always believed in harvesting ripe, physiologically mature fruit. In answer to the question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster...

2500|$|Recording artist Prince {{played the}} guitar on three {{songs from the}} album, [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Keep It Together", and [...] "Act of Contrition", though he {{remained}} uncredited. [...] Prince and Madonna also worked together on the track [...] "Love Song". The song was recorded at Prince's Studio on Paisley Park; [...] "We were friends and talked about working together, so I went to Minneapolis to write some stuff with him, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> I really dug was 'Love Song' [...] We ended up writing it long-distance, because I {{had to be in}} L.A. and he couldn't leave Minneapolis, and quite frankly I couldn't stand Minneapolis. When I went there, it was like 20 degrees below zero, and it was really desolate. I was miserable and I couldn't write or work under those circumstances", Madonna recalled. [...] For the artwork, the singer chose to work with photographer Herb Ritts. Initially, photos from the session with Ritts were also to be used for the lead single's packaging. For the photoshoot, she decided to dye her blonde hair brown; she commented [...] "I love blonde hair, but it really does something different to you. I feel more grounded when I have dark hair. It's unexplainable. I also feel more Italian when my hair is dark". The cover art features a close-up of the singer's jean-clad midsection and bare midriff. The cover has been seen as a reference to Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones. The packaging on the first pressings of the CD, cassette, and LP were scented with patchouli oils to simulate church incense. [...] A publicist for Warner Bros. Records revealed this had been the singer's idea; [...] "She wanted to create a flavor of the 60's and the church. She wanted to create a sensual feeling you could hear and smell". Initial pressings also included an insert with safe sex guidelines and a warning about the dangers of AIDS, to which Madonna had lost friends. Its inclusion was decided after Warner Bros. had agreed to release an album by stand-up comedian Sam Kinison the year before, although he had stated that AIDS came from gay men involved in bestiality. Madonna dedicated the album to [...] "My mother, who taught me how to pray".|$|E
