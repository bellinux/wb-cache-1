5|$|It was {{initially}} used for daylight ground attack missions during the Battle of Moscow, but this proved to <b>be</b> <b>costly</b> since the aircraft was unarmored. Armor and additional guns were retrofitted {{to the existing}} aircraft {{to make it more}} effective, but the evacuation of the sole factory building the Pe-3 in October 1941 limited the number of aircraft available and many units of the Soviet Air Forces flying the Pe-3 were either disbanded or converted to other aircraft. Although production was stopped and restarted several times, the aircraft remained in service throughout World War II. Most of the later production runs were given to reconnaissance units.|$|E
5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can <b>be</b> <b>costly</b> to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a Gullfisk {{lost control}} {{on the line and}} derailed near Sjømansskolen, causing the tram to be scrapped. From 1977, Oslo Sporveier also put SM53 trams into service. This was not sufficient, and Oslo Sporveier {{considered}} introducing the old Ekeberg Line trams. But this would <b>be</b> <b>costly,</b> as the vehicles would have to be upgraded. Instead, used MBG trams from the Gothenburg Tramway were put into service. The section from Sæter to Ljabru had since the opening had a signaling system that had worked fine with 15- and 20-minute headways, but did not work properly with 10-minute routes. A new system was installed, and proved to work just as poorly as the old system. During 1979, the section was rebuilt to double track, although the short bridge over Nordstrandsveien was kept single tracked.|$|E

5|$|The scenes set in Cyprus were filmed on {{location}} in Deià, a coastal village in the island of Majorca. Previously working on a film using the same location, producer Chris Fry chose the village because {{he felt it was}} the closest to the UK the crew can get to mimic the hot, Mediterranean feel of Cyprus. Because filming abroad tend to <b>be</b> <b>costly</b> for a BBC budget, the producers kept costs down as much as possible by using a limited crew with some local help. Much of the original script was to take place inside a house, but because there were no gaffers responsible for lighting, and that the weather was decent, filming took place primarily outside because of the natural sunlight. The filming crew spent four days at the end of April shooting in Majorca.|$|E
25|$|To {{compensate}} for this, specially constructed storage containers are required, which can <b>be</b> <b>costly.</b> Strong metal-ligand bonds, {{such as in}} metal-imidazolate, -triazolate, and -pyrazolate frameworks, are known to decrease a MOF's sensitivity to air, reducing the expense of storage.|$|E
25|$|The upside is {{security}} of supply (such as food security), the downside huge stockpiles or, in other cases, destruction of commodities. The scheme also makes domestic food more expensive for other countries to purchase and operation of such a scheme can <b>be</b> <b>costly</b> to the operator.|$|E
40|$|Regulations impose {{idiosyncratic}} {{capital and}} funding costs for hold-ing derivatives. Capital requirements <b>are</b> <b>costly</b> because derivatives desks are risky businesses; funding <b>is</b> <b>costly</b> {{in part because}} regulations increase the minimum funding tenor. Idiosyncratic costs mean no single mea-sure makes derivatives martingales for all market participants. Hence Regulatory-compliant pricing is not risk-neutral. This has implications for exit prices and mark-to-market. ...|$|R

25|$|Shooting {{is often}} used for large animals to control them. This method has {{meanings}} of gaining food supply and recreation. It requires accessibility {{in the field and}} experience for the hunters. Also, to maintain the effect, it requires good amount of manpower for long time, so it can <b>be</b> <b>costly.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Kings' {{victory over}} Red Bull in the 2004 Fiesta Conference broke the {{flawless}} finals {{record of the}} Barakos.

25|$|Poisoning is very {{effective}} for small species. However, {{there are some}} disadvantages of this method. It is possible that untargeted animals take the poison. It is also necessary to consider the secondary poisoning that other animals are affected by poisoned species. This method can <b>be</b> <b>costly</b> if the area to cover is large.|$|E

50|$|War's {{inefficiency}} puzzle {{explains why}} states {{go to war}} even though war <b>is</b> <b>costly.</b> In James Fearon’s Rationalist Explanations for War, he asserts war <b>is</b> <b>costly</b> and that creates an incentive to bargain with the other side. However, states do not bargain and instead go to war because of private information on the capability to fight and the incentives to misrepresent this information.|$|R

25|$|The local {{authorities}} are endeavouring {{to prevent the}} effects of erosion. Hard defences {{in the form of}} a concrete seawall and timber groynes have given some protection. It has been suggested that a large underwater reef made of tyres could be built off the Holderness coast to mitigate this erosion but it would <b>be</b> <b>costly</b> to build.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining UV {{ornamentation}} {{and size}} dimorphism of some jumping spiders may seem strictly beneficial to sexual selection, {{yet there are}} costs to maintain such distinguishing characteristics. While UV reflecting individuals may attract more female spiders, it can also {{increase the risk of}} predation. Similarly, larger body size can <b>be</b> <b>costly,</b> as it may also increase the risk of predation.|$|E
25|$|A {{suggestion}} {{was made by}} the Public Parks Committee that the success of the proposed recreation ground and golf, course at Bulwell Hall Estate would depend on the extension of the Bulwell tramway service to the entrance to the Estate. This proposal was found to <b>be</b> <b>costly,</b> as increased generating equipment would be required, and the idea was not proceeded with.|$|E

50|$|Fear is {{least in}} bipolarity {{where there is}} usually a rough {{balance of power between}} the two major states. However the {{bargaining}} model of war refuted this claim with the fact that war <b>is</b> <b>costly.</b> Given that war <b>is</b> <b>costly</b> and states <b>are</b> rational actors, there has to have something more than the polarity that would instigate nations to incur the cost of war that is non-negative.|$|R
50|$|One {{issue is}} {{infrequent}} large orders vs. frequent small orders. Large orders {{will increase the}} amount of inventory on hand, which <b>is</b> <b>costly,</b> but may benefit from volume discounts. Frequent orders <b>are</b> <b>costly</b> to process, and the resulting small inventory levels may increase the probability of stockouts, leading to loss of customers. In principle all these factors can be calculated mathematically and the optimum found.|$|R
25|$|Early covered {{resonators}} {{with glass}} frit seals were unstable because contaminants outgassed from the sealing material. To overcome this, getters were {{built into the}} cavities. Getters are materials that can absorb gas and contaminants after cavities are sealed. However, getters can also release contaminants and can <b>be</b> <b>costly,</b> so their use in this application is being discontinued in favor of cleaner cover bonding processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} in Havana was not pleased. He ordered that Father Mónaco {{and the soldiers}} be withdrawn, and the stockade burned to deny it to the Uchizas. He also forwarded the missionaries' plan to Spain, where the Council of the Indies decided that the proposed mission on Biscayne Bay would <b>be</b> <b>costly</b> and impractical. The second attempt to establish a mission on Biscayne Bay had lasted less than three months.|$|E
25|$|The Falcons {{won their}} first playoff game in team history after they overcame a 13–0 deficit by scoring 2 {{touchdowns in the}} final 5 minutes of the game. In the first quarter, Philadelphia's Cleveland Franklin {{recovered}} a fumble from Billy Ryckman on a punt return at the Falcons 13-yard line, setting up wide receiver Harold Carmichael's 13-yard touchdown reception from Ron Jaworski. However, Michel missed the ensuing extra point, which would later prove to <b>be</b> <b>costly.</b>|$|E

25|$|Route: From PSU to Tualatin via Tigard along {{dedicated}} lanes on Barbur Boulevard. In May 2016, {{light rail}} {{was chosen as}} the mode over bus rapid transit, with the project expected to cost $2.5 billion. Proposals to serve Marquam Hill/OHSU, Hillsdale, and PCC Sylvania with tunnels were dropped from the plan because they would <b>be</b> <b>costly,</b> have severe construction impacts, and attract few new transit riders. Connecting OHSU to a surface transit line though elevators or escalators is being studied.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, the House of Representatives Committee on Suffrage and Electoral Reforms {{agreed to}} {{consolidate}} bills {{that seek to}} postpone the barangay elections, with Commission on Elections chairman Jose Melo preferring a 2011 date since synchronizing it with the 2013 general election would <b>be</b> <b>costly</b> as it {{will be included in}} the automation project. The City Mayors League preferred postponement up to 2011, the Liga ng mga Barangay wants a 2012 election while the SK prefers any year {{as long as it is}} held in October.|$|E
25|$|Putting {{on a show}} at the Fringe {{with the}} big venues can <b>be</b> <b>costly</b> to performers, due to {{registration}} fees, venue hire, cost of accommodation, and travel to Edinburgh. In recent years venue costs {{and the need for}} expensive marketing have been increasingly challenged by Free and other Independent venues. There is a change happening at the Fringe and performers can increasingly negotiate with the big venues. The festival is also a networking opportunity, training ground or springboard for future career advancement, and exciting and fun for performers as well as spectators.|$|E
