40|$|<b>Batch</b> soil <b>washing</b> {{experiments}} {{were used to}} evaluate the feasibility of using biosurfactants for the removal of heavy metals from a contaminated soil and sediments. Surfactin from Bacillus subtilis, rhamnolipids from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and sophorolipid from Torulopsis bombicola were evaluated using a soil contaminated with hydrocarbon and metals (890 mg/kg zinc, 420 mg/kg copper, 12. 6 % oil and grease) and metal contaminated sediments (110 mg/kg copper, 3300 mg/kg zinc). Although water alone removed insignificant levels of metals, results showed that the biosurfactants could remove 5 % of the zinc (with 12 % rhamnolipid) and 19. 5 % of the zinc (with 4 % sophorolipid with 0. 7 % HCl). Copper could also be removed and was most efficiently extracted (greater than 25 %) with 12 % rhamnolipid or with 2 % rhamnolipid with 1 % NaOH. 1 % NaOH alone removed only 5 % of the copper and 2 % zinc. After a series of five <b>batch</b> <b>washes,</b> 90 % of the copper could be removed by 0. 1 % surfactin with 1 % NaOH while 4 % sophorolipid with 0. 7 % HCl was able to remove 100 % of the zinc. From the sediment, a single washing with 0. 5 % rhamnolipid removed 65 % of the copper and 18 % of the zinc whereas 4 % sophorolipid removed 25 % of the copper and 60 % of the zinc. Sequential extraction procedures were used on the soil and sediments. For both matrices, the carbonate and the oxide fractions accounted for over 90 % of the zinc present in the soil. The organic fraction constituted over 70 % of the copper in the soil and sediments. Sequential extraction of the soil and sediments after washing with the various surfactants indicated that the biosurfactants, rhamnolipid or surfactin with NaOH, could remove the organically-bound copper and that the sophorolipid with acid could remove the carbonate and oxide bound zinc and cadmium. Concerning the mechanism for metal removal by the surfactants, the techniques of octanol-water partitioning, ultrafiltration and zeta potential measurements indicated that the surfactants removed the metals first by sorption at the soil interphase, followed by desorption of the metal through interfacial tension lowering and fluid forces and then solubilization of the metal within the micelle...|$|R

40|$|Previous Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) melt rate {{tests in}} support of the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) have {{indicated}} that improvements in melt rate can be achieved through an increase in the total alkali of the melter feed. Higher alkali can be attained by the use of an ''underwashed'' sludge, a high alkali frit, or a combination of the two. Although the general trend between melt rate and total alkali (in particular Na{sub 2 }O content) has been demonstrated, the question of ''does the source of alkali (SOA) matter?'' still exists. Therefore the purpose of this set of tests was to determine if the source of alkali (frit versus sludge) can impact melt rate. The general test concept was to transition from a Na{sub 2 }O-rich frit to a Na{sub 2 }O-deficient frit while compensating the Na{sub 2 }O content in the sludge to maintain the same overall Na{sub 2 }O content in the melter feed. Specifically, the strategy was to vary the amount of alkali in frits and in the sludge batch 3 (SB 3) sludge simulant (midpoint or baseline feed was SB 3 /Frit 418 at 35 % waste loading) so that the resultant feeds had the same final glass composition when vitrified. A set of SOA feeds using frits ranging from 0 to 16 weight % Na{sub 2 }O (in 4 % increments) was first tested in the Melt Rate Furnace (MRF) to determine if indeed there was an impact. The dry-fed MRF tests indicated that if the alkali is too depleted from either the sludge (16 % Na{sub 2 }O feed) or the frit (the 0 % Na{sub 2 }O feed), then melt rate was negatively impacted when compared to the baseline SB 3 /Frit 418 feed currently being processed at DWPF. The MRF melt rates for the 4 and 12 % SOA feeds were similar to the baseline SB 3 /Frit 418 (8 % SOA) feed. Due to this finding, a smaller subset of SOA feeds that could be processed in the DWPF (4 and 12 % SOA feeds) was then tested in the Slurry-fed Melt Rate Furnace (SMRF). The results from a previous SMRF test with SB 3 /Frit 418 (Smith et al. 2004) were used as the SMRF melt rate of the baseline feed. The SOA SMRF test results agreed with those of the MRF tests for these two feeds as the melt rates were similar to the baseline SB 3 /Frit 418 feed. In other words, the source of alkali was close enough to the baseline feed as to not negatively impact melt rate. Based on these results, there appears to be an acceptable range of the source of alkali that results in the highest melt rate for a particular sludge batch. If, however, the alkali is too depleted from either the sludge or the frit, then melt rate will be lower. Although SB 3 simulant sludge and Frit 418 were used for these tests, it was not the intent of these tests to determine an optimum source of alkali range for SB 3. Rather, the findings of these tests should be used to help in the decision process for future sludge <b>batch</b> <b>washing</b> and/or blending strategies. The results, however, do confirm that the current processing of SB 3 is being performed in the proper source of alkali range. Because all of this testing was performed on small-scale equipment with slurried, non-radioactive simulant, the exact impact of the source of alkali with SB 3 in the DWPF melter could not be fully evaluated...|$|E

The removal of Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn from the sediment was evaluated, and the corresponding changes of metal fraction distribution were examined by using a sequential extraction procedure. The mobility of the remaining metals in the washed sediment was assessed by leaching extractability and compared to those in the original sediment. The results showed that inorganic acid washing effectively removed the majority of heavy metals, but the transformation of Cr, Cu, and Pb from the reducible fraction to the acid-extractable fraction significantly enhanced the mobility of the remaining metals in the washed sediment. Chelating agents such as EDTA and EDDS could efficiently extract Pb and Zn from the sediment, but to a less extent with Cu and Cr. Chelating agents also reduced the relative portions of Cr, Cu, and Pb associated with reducible fraction. Cu and Cr extraction would require the use of oxidizing agents such as H 2 O 2 and Na 2 S 2 O 8 that reduced their relative portions associated with the oxidizable fraction. Citric acid was only effective for Cr removal through dissolution of Fe oxides/hydroxides into which Cr(III) incorporates. The feasibility of acid washing for sediment remediation should be reconsidered due to high mobility of residual metals, while H 2 O 2 could be a promising additive for sediment remediation.

Metals' leaching was performed by flushing (column tests) or <b>washing</b> (<b>batch</b> tests) the soil with an aqueous solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA. An excess of EDTA was used in flushing tests (up to a EDTA:Cu molar ratio of about 26. 2 : 1), while, in washing tests, the investigated EDTA vs. copper molar ratios were in the range between 1 (equimolar tests) and 8. Copper extraction yield in flushing tests (up to about 85 %) was found to depend upon contact time between the soil and the leaching solution and the characteristics of the conditioning solution. The saturation of the soil with a NaNO 3 solution before the treatment, favoured the flushing process reducing the time of percolation, but resulted in a lower metal extraction during the following percolation of EDTA. The indigenous iron was competitive with copper to form EDTA complexes only when it was present in the organic and oxides-hydroxides fractions. Artificial iron addition to the soil resulted in an increase of both the exchangeable iron and the iron bonded to the organic fraction of the soil, thus increasing the overall amount of iron available to extraction. In both batch and continuous tests, the mechanism of copper extraction was found to involve the former dissolution of metal salts, that lead to an initial high concentration of both copper and selected competitive cations (essentially Ca 2 +), and the following EDTA exchange reaction between calcium and copper complexes.

Batch and column adsorption experiments were performed to study the adsorbability of styrene onto soil. Soil type 1 (10. 2 % silt and clay, 5. 3 % organic matter content) presented the highest styrene adsorbability 1190 mg/kg and bentonite presented the lowest adsorbability 385 mg/kg in batch adsorption tests. The sorption capacity is found to be strongly dependent on the amount of organic matter and clay ratio present in the soil. Batch and continuous flow washing experiments were used to evaluate the feasibility of using surfactants for the removal of styrene from contaminated soil. Higher styrene removal was achieved from batch experiments compared to column experiments. The highest styrene removal (98. 4 %) was achieved at 1 % rhamnolipid in the batch test. Maximum styrene removal occurred at the highest rhamnolipid concentration in both <b>batch</b> and continuous <b>washing</b> tests. After rhamnolipid adsorption to soil, the two mechanisms of surfactant-aided soil washing are mobilization and solubilisation. The mobilization mechanism occurs at a rhamnolipid concentration below critical micelle concentration (CMC). In this situation, rhamnolipid reduce the surface and interfacial tension between air/water, oil/water, and oil/soil systems. When rhamnolipid concentration is above CMC, the solubility of styrene increased dramatically due to the aggregation of surfactant micelles. Leachate from soil washing experiments was biodegraded in an DASH reactor before release to the environment. The comparison between the results from batch and continuous experiments led to the conclusion that anaerobic biomass could biodegrade styrene and styrene in rhamnolipid under anaerobic conditions.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professor Steven Cramer; Pages: 168. Specifications which {{limit the amount of}} fine material that adheres to coarse aggregates tend to be vague. For example, the Wisconsin state specifications require coarse aggregates used in portland cement concrete to be free of deleterious substances and adherent coatings; however, neither the washing procedure nor the desired end result of aggregate washing is specified. The purpose of this research was to identify which aggregate coatings in Wisconsin are deleterious and to determine what degree they affect concrete durability and strength. To this end, coarse aggregates containing surface coatings were collected throughout the state and characterized with the California cleanness test, methylene blue adsorption test, and x-ray diffraction. Based on the results of these tests, a subset of the sampled aggregates was selected to further study the effects of the coatings on concrete performance. It was hypothesized that coatings containing clay material are more deleterious than coatings containing either dust or carbonate material. The 10 -batch mixing plan tested coarse aggregates fiom three different sources and in the following three conditions: (1) coated aggregates that were sampled in the field, (2) washed aggregates that were washed in the laboratory to remove the existing coating, and (3) coated aggregates that were manufactured with dust and clay fines to increase the extent of the coating. The effect of each aggregate coating on concrete performance was assessed by comparing the relative changes in compressive strength, tensile strength, drying shrinkage, freeze-thaw durability, and chloride ion penetrability between <b>batches</b> containing the <b>washed</b> and coated aggregates. The test results confirmed that coatings with high clay contents are more deleterious to concrete strength and durability than coatings that consist largely of dust or carbonate material. While the carbonate coatings appeared to slightly improve performance, the clay coatings appeared to significantly decrease strength and durability. Although current washing procedures {{do not need to be}} changed, it was recommended that the WisDOT require the California cleanness test whenever aggregate coatings are suspected of influencing strength or durability during concrete construction.

40|$|Although strict {{practices}} for controlling {{the safety of}} leafy green produce have been implemented in the produce industry, current commercial operations rely on a wash treatment with an antimicrobial agent as the only step for reducing microbial populations on fresh produce. However, washing with a sanitizer has been demonstrated to achieve no more than 1 - 2 log reduction in pathogen populations. In recent years, much research effort has been put into the development of multiple-hurdle techniques to enhance produce safety. Ultrasonic waves ranging from 20 to 100 kHz in frequency have been successfully used as a surface cleaning technique in the medical and precision processing industries {{for a number of}} years. The use of ultrasound in fresh produce sanitation as a hurdle technique is a relatively recent endeavor, however. The reported studies have been sporadic and inconsistent, and have only dealt with batch operations. There are few reports documenting the effects of ultrasound and washing tank operational parameters on the efficacy of combined treatments of ultrasound and sanitizer, or on the removal of bacteria from fresh or fresh-cut vegetable surfaces. In this study, a systematic approach, starting from understanding the interactions among acoustic energy, produce, sanitizers, and bacteria, as well as the distribution of the ultrasonic field in the treatment channel, was employed to find the answer to the important question: "Can an ultrasound-assisted treatment indeed enhance microbial reduction in a continuous-flow pilot-scale produce washing system?" The first question that has to be answered for any ultrasound-assisted produce wash is if ultrasound as a form of physical energy will cause produce quality degradation. To address this issue, a determination was made of the threshold of acoustic power density (APD) in an ultrasound treatment allowable without causing unacceptable produce damage immediately after sonication. All subsequent produce wash tests were performed with an APD below this threshold. Next, the effect of ultrasound on the reduction of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 inoculated on the surfaces of selected produce was measured. The interactions between ultrasound and sanitizers were examined by monitoring the concentration changes of the sanitizers in washing solutions used for fresh-cut lettuce washes. The effects of ultrasound parameters and operational conditions on the uniformity of the acoustic field in the ultrasonic channel, and on surface decontamination of leafy green produce, were also examined. A continuous-flow pilot scale ultrasonic washing system was designed, fabricated, and tested in this study. Further, produce surface characteristics and infiltration pathways were studied. Finally, the application of ultrasonication for surface decontamination of lettuce coring knives was also investigated. The overall quality scores of baby spinach, lollo rosso, loose leaf lettuce, iceberg lettuce, and romaine lettuce remained unchanged during a 2 -week storage period when sonicated at an APD of less than 100 W/L for less than 2 min., and were above the acceptable level as determined by a sensory panel. The electro-conductivity rate of all four of these salad leaves increased over the treatment time. The ultrasound treatment significantly enhanced the removal of E. coli O 157 :H 7 cells from the spinach surfaces in all of the sanitation treatments, and the enhancement of the ultrasound increased with the treatment time and APD. Ultrasonication accelerated the degradation of free chlorine and total chlorine during a 4 -min treatment, compared to a wash without ultrasound, while concentrations of acidified sodium chlorite and peroxyacetic acid remained unchanged. An ultrasound treatment at 75 kHz was significantly less effective in the removal of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from spinach leaves than treatments at 25 and 40 kHz (p < 0. 05). The removal of microbes from baby spinach leaves by ultrasonication decreased when the ultrasonic channel width increased from 304. 8 to 609. 6 mm. The blockage of ultrasound due to the overlapping of spinach leaves dramatically decreased the decontamination efficacy, and hence care should be taken to avoid the overlapping of produce leaves. A 20 -min degassing prior to ultrasonication only resulted in a marginal increase (0. 16 log cycle) in the E. coli count reduction. In the tests with the pilot-scale ultrasonic produce washer, ultrasound in combination with chlorine enhanced the reduction of E. coli inoculated on spinach by a 0. 53 log cycle for batch-leaf washes. Additionally, batch-leaf washes with chlorinated water enhanced the reduction of aerobic plate count by a 0. 50 log cycle over a chlorine-only wash. No significant effect of ultrasound was observed for yeast and mold reduction. Ultrasonication enhanced the removal of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from baby carrots by 1. 24 log cycles and 0. 65 log cycle when treated for 1 min and 3 min, respectively. A <b>batch</b> <b>wash</b> with ultrasound also significantly (p < 0. 05) increased the aerobic plate count reduction for roma tomato surfaces by a 0. 75 log cycle over a sanitizer-only wash, while there was only a marginal enhancement in yeast and mold reduction. A number of new techniques were developed or applied to elucidate the relationships between produce surface characteristics and microbial attachment and removal. In the inactivation tests, the underside of spinach leaves (rough side) was found to provide a better shelter for E. coli O 157 :H 7 than the upside. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical profiler mapping were used to provide some insight into this observation. The SEM images and surface profiles of a spinach leaf showed valleys, deeper in the underside than in the upside, harboring and even protecting the cells attached in them. In the effort to quantify the surface roughness of produce, a freeze-drying sample preparation method for confocal laser scanning microscopy was developed which worked well. There {{were no significant differences in}} surface roughness among selected vegetables. Moreover, the surface hydrophobicity of the inner surface of spinach leaves was not significantly different from that of the outer surface, and was not affected by ultrasonication. For the first time, the MicroXCT technique was employed in this study to examine the internal structure of a produce sample on the micrometer scale. The MicroXCT images provided a detailed view of the potential infiltration pathways inside a produce tissue that may be used by human pathogens to penetrate fresh and fresh-cut produce. In the test to examine the interactions of ultrasound with a hard metal surface, the ultrasound treatment reduced the E. coli O 157 :H 7 count to below the detection limit on coring knives on both the blade and welding joint when treated for 30 s in 1 mg/L chlorinated water. The two newly designed prototype knives harbored significantly fewer E. coli cells than the current commercially used ones, enabling high disinfection efficacy. In summary, prerequisites for the application of acoustic energy for produce surface decontamination are a good understanding of the underlying physics of acoustics, as well as of the interactions among ultrasound, sanitizers, produce, and bacteria. The operational parameters of both the ultrasound generator and produce washer are also critical in improving the washing efficacy. With a carefully designed ultrasound system and a uniform acoustic field distribution in the washer and on each side of a produce sample, a significantly enhanced reduction in microbial count over that of a sanitizer-only wash can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out aimed at {{identifying}} potential sources of transmission of Campylobacter jejuni to broiler chickens, determining whether boots can mechanically transmit C. jejuni to susceptible chickens, determining the transmission rate of C. jejuni in broiler chickens, and assessing the effect of washing slaughterhouse fomites with chlorinated water {{on the level of}} C. jejuni contamination during the day. Bacteriological culture of samples taken in the premises of a broiler slaughterhouse showed that after washing and just before departure for depopulation of broiler farms, 75 %, 58. 33 %, 47. 22 %, 50 %, 54. 29 %, 66. 67 %, 31. 25 %, and 0 % of pallets, crates, truck beds, truck wheels, drivers' boots, catchers' boots, forklift wheels, and tractor wheels respectively, were contaminated with C. jejuni. Therefore it was concluded that slaughterhouse personnel and fomites could potentially transmit C. jejuni during partial depopulation of broiler flocks. The level of C. jejuni in consecutive sample batches of fomites (n = 30) that were collected in six periods of one hour each day (hence six batches), between 0530 and 1230 hrs, over six days, was found to range from 44. 83 % in the lst batch and 66. 67 % in the 5 th <b>batch,</b> indicating that <b>washing</b> fomites with pressurized chlorinated water makes no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) in the contamination level. The fomites sampled were pallets, crates, truck bed, truck wheels, and drivers' boots. Susceptible broiler chickens became colonized with C. jejuni after exposure to boots that had been worn in a pen with infected chickens demonstrating that boots can mechanically cause horizontal transmission of the bacterium. A transmission study conducted by introducing a bird infected with C. jejuni to 99 susceptible chickens demonstrated a rapid spread of the infection to all the birds within 48 hours and a transmission rate best represented by a simple epidemic curve. A transmission parameter beta (β), with a value of 2. 1 x 10 - 3 ± 0. 013 x 10 - 3 (mean ± standard error), was calculated by fitting the data into a simple deterministic epidemic model. The transmission rate in a population of 100 birds, predicted by this model, was very similar to that obtained in the experiment. Therefore, it was concluded that the transmission rate of C. jejuni in broilers resembles a simple epidemic...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{experimental}} tests of heavy metals mobilization from sediments collected from an Italian harbour are presented and discussed. <b>Batch</b> tests of <b>washing</b> with an aqueous solution of chelating agent were performed at selected liquid/solid (L/S) ratios and chelant concentration (0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 M). Two chelating agents were chosen: EDTA and citric acid. The {{objective of the}} tests was to investigate metal mobilization and soil mineral dissolution promoted by the washing treatment. The study {{was focused on the}} mobilization of Pb, Zn, and Cu: their concentrations in the contact solution, together with Fe and Ca concentration, were monitored along time for 144 h. Results of experimental tests performed at different chelant concentration and US ratio show EDTA effectiveness in mobilizing metals bond to the sediment. The overall amount of the three selected metals (Cu, Ph and Zn) extracted in the tests with EDTA varied in a quite narrow range (from 2. 262 to 2. 724 mmol), while the higher was the EDTA concentration in the washing solution, the higher the dissolution of other competitive cations, such as Ca and Fe. In addition, a general difficulty in copper extraction from the organic fraction of the sediment was observed, due to the high stability of copper humate. The mechanism of metals extraction was found to involve the initial metals salts dissolution, that was pH-dependant, followed by the development of exchange reactions between the metal-EDTA complexes previously formed. Depending upon the pH of the washing solution an initial high Ca dissolution was observed, followed by dramatic reduction in Ca 2 +, content, mainly determined by calcium carbonate precipitation, {{as a result of the}} increase of pH during mixing. Metal mobilization was evaluated performing sequential extraction tests: the dissolution of Cu, Ph and Zn from the carbonate fraction of the sediment was almost total, as the mobilization of Ph and Zn from the Fe-Mn oxides and hydroxides fraction. On the contrary, as a consequence of the mobilization induced by washing treatment, about 17 % of the remaining Cu and 10 % of the remaining Zn resulted in the exchangeable fraction. At the investigated operating conditions, citric acid was unable to extract Ph and Cu from the sediment, while at the strong acidic conditions maintained during the extractions with citric acid, a Zn mobilization up to the 80 % of the initial amount was observed, depending upon the operating conditions in the extractions. In addition, because of the great affinity between citric acid and Fe, and the strong acidic conditions maintained during extraction, a high Fe dissolution was observed (up to about the 39 % of the total Fe content in the sediment).

40|$|The nutty and cereal {{aromas of}} new make malt whisky are {{important}} sensory characteristics of certain distillery malts of commercial value for blending; however {{there is a}} lack of understanding regarding the volatile congeners which contribute to these complex sensory characters. The work described in this thesis aimed to improve knowledge of the chemical origins of nutty and cereal aromas in immature spirit in order to aid process control of these characters during manufacturing. Two aroma extraction methods were compared; liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) using dichloromethane and solid-phase extraction (SPE) with LiChrolut EN sorbent. New make spirit samples from industry (n= 5) were evaluated by a trained whisky sensory panel using Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA). Four were noted for their nutty/cereal character, the other served as a non-nutty control. Gas Chromatography-Olfactometry/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-O/MS) was used to try and identify compounds in chromatogram regions coincident with nutty/cereal descriptors. Using LLE extracts, 14 such regions were identified. LiChrolut EN SPE proved to be more selective (19 nutty/cereal odour active regions). 2,s-dimethylpyrazine (known to impart a nutty/cereal character in other food systems) was one noted congener, which was only detected using the more selective SPE method. The gross volatile compositions of the 5 spirit samples were remarkably similar, suggesting that congeners present at low concentration but with low odour thresholds are likely responsible for nutty/cereal characters. One analytical difference of note was that the nuttier samples contained higher concentrations of long-chain esters. Thus, ethanolic Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometry {APCI-MS) was used to analyse the headspace concentrations of a test set of 14 whisky aroma volatiles above a series of aqueous ethanolic solutions differing in concentrations of alcohol (5 - 40 % ABV) and ethyl hexadecanoate (0 - 500 mg/L). Ethanol had a significant solubilising effect (p 2. 5). We propose that nutty and cereal characters are imparted by relatively polar aroma compounds, whose characters are emphasised by the selective incorporation of hydrophobic aroma compounds into the interior of micelle-like structures formed by long chain esters (typified here by ethyl hexadecanoate). Some distillers have reported that manipulation of the lipid concentrations in wash offers a method of controlling the nutty/oily character of new make spirit. A <b>batch</b> of fermented <b>wash</b> sourced from industry was spiked with varying concentrations of oleic (18 : 1) and linoleic (18 : 2) acids and (laboratory) distilled at two different temperatures, using a D-optimal experimental design to evaluate the impacts of each factor. Nutty (p = 0. 0203) and oily (p = 0. 0034) aroma characteristics were scored as significantly stronger in distillates of wash spiked with 100 ~g/mL each of oleic and linoleic acids, as compared to the control. GC-O/MS of distillate extracts once again determined several odour active regions relevant to the nutty/cereal characters and concentrations of some compounds could be correlated with nutty/cereal QDA scores. New make spirit samples from 35 individual malt whisky distilleries were extracted using the LiChrolut SPE method and analysed by GC-MS. Analytical concentrations of 'candidate' nutty-cereal compounds (n = 20) were used to model sensory QDA data for the 3 S spirit samples (nutty, oily, cereal and feinty characters) using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Significant positive correlations with nutty were seen for 7 compounds (using ANOVA). These included the Maillard products 2 -furanmethanol (p < 0. 0001), 2 -methylpyrazine (p < 0. 0013) and 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine (p < 0. 0004). The PCA overlay bi-plot showed clustering of certain higher alcohols near to the nutty aroma descriptor (methionol, pentan- 1 -ol, 2 -phenyethyl alcohol). Nutty and cereal characters of whisky are of complex origin and likely originate from multiple congeners in a synergistic mixture. This work has shown that processes of particular importance to the expression of this character in new make spirit are lipid oxidation and Maillard chemistry. The conditions for these reactions are to be found during malt kilning and distillation. Whilst these processes are where nutty/cereal compounds are likely to be formed, other distillery parameters such as the mashing protocol, length of fermentation (both determine the supply of key precursors such as fatty and amino acids) and the spirit cut of the distillation govern the chemical composition of the final spirit.

40|$|The noble metals Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag were {{produced}} in the Savannah River Site (SRS) reactors as products of the fission of U- 235. Consequently {{they are in the}} High Level Waste (HLW) sludges that are currently being immobilized into a borosilicate glass in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The noble metals are a concern in the DWPF because they catalyze the decomposition of formic acid used in the process to produce the flammable gas hydrogen. As the concentration of these noble metals in the sludge increases, more hydrogen will be produced when this sludge is processed. In the SRS Tank Farm it takes approximately two years to prepare a sludge batch for processing in the DWPF. This length of time is necessary to mix the appropriate sludges, blend them to form a sludge <b>batch</b> and then <b>wash</b> it to enable processing in the DWPF. This means that the exact composition of a sludge batch is not known for {approx}two years. During this time, studies with simulated nonradioactive sludges must be performed to determine the desired DWPF processing parameters for the new sludge batch. Consequently, prediction of the noble metal concentrations is desirable to prepare appropriate simulated sludges for studies of the DWPF process for that sludge batch. These studies give a measure of the amount of hydrogen that will be produced when that sludge batch is processed. This report describes in detail the measurement of these noble metal concentrations in sludges and a way to predict their concentrations from an estimate of the lanthanum concentration in the sludge. Results for two sludges are presented in this report. These are Sludge Batch 3 (SB 3) currently being processed by the DWPF and a sample of unwashed sludge from Tank 11 that will be part of Sludge Batch 4. The concentrations of the noble metals in HLW sludges are measured by using mass spectroscopy to determine concentrations of the isotopes that comprise each noble metal. For example, the noble metal Ru is comprised of isotopes with masses 101, 102, and 104. The element Rh has a single isotope with mass 103. The element Pd is comprised of five isotopes. These are at masses 105 - 108 and mass 110. As does Rh, Ag has only one isotope. This is at mass 109. However, results in this report show that the Ag concentration in the two samples was due to natural Ag being in the samples. Natural Ag has masses at 107 and 109. The Ag- 107 interferes with the measurement of Pd- 107. This Ag was used in one of the processes at SRS. The results also show that natural Cd is in the two samples. Cadmium has isotopes at masses 106, 108 and 110, thus it interferes with the analysis of the Pd isotopes at these masses. Cadmium was also used in one of the processes at SRS. However, the concentrations of the Pd isotopes at masses 106, 107, 108 and 110 could be calculated using the fission yields for the Pd isotopes, and the measured concentration of Pd at mass 105 where there is no Ag or Cd interference. Based on the measurements of the concentrations of the isotopes of each noble metal, the total concentration of that noble metal can be determined by summing the concentrations of the individual isotopes. The results in this report show that the relative concentrations of the isotopes of Ru and Rh are in proportion to their yields from the fission of U- 235 in the reactors. These results were expected since these elements are very insoluble in caustic and thus are primarily in the sludge tanks rather then the salt tanks of the SRS Tank Farm. The relative concentration of Pd is somewhat lower than that based on the relative fission yields of its five isotopes. This indicates that some of the Pd is in the salt tanks rather than the sludge tanks of the Tank Farm. The concentrations of the noble metals were predicted using the High Level Waste Characterization System (WCS) at SRS. This system keeps record of the inventory of the major compounds and select radionuclides that are in each of the SRS HLW tanks. Using this system, the Closure Business Unit (CBU) can predict the major composition of a sludge batch by knowing the tanks involved in that batch and the estimates of the volume of sludge from each tank that will be blended to make the final sludge batch. The system does not track the inventories of Rh, Pd, and Ag. It does track Ru, but Ru is not included in the projections by CBU. However, another U- 235 fission product is tracked by WCS. This fission product is La. The element La was not used in any of the chemical processes at SRS. Results in this study show that it is in the HLW primarily as a U- 235 fission product. This fission product is comprised solely of the isotope La- 139 which can be measured along with the isotopes of the noble metals that do not have interferences from Ag or Cd. The concentrations of La in SB 3 and in the Tank 11 sample have been estimated by the CBU using WCS projections...|$|R
