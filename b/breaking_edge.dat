50|$|The indices encode {{the actual}} index {{and type of}} the edge. The actual indices are not file offsets in bytes, but rather in int32 values, {{in the range of}} 1 to the number of points (# of points). If the value is {{negative}} (bit 31 is set) the edge is a <b>breaking</b> <b>edge.</b> Furthermore, bit 30 of the int32 values is used to determine if the edge is a hard or soft <b>breaking</b> <b>edge.</b> If the actual index would be 1234 (0x000004D2) then a hard <b>breaking</b> <b>edge</b> would be encoded as -1234 (0xFFFFFB2E) and a soft <b>breaking</b> <b>edge</b> as -1073743058 (0xBFFFB2E). The edge definition of the neighbouring triangle must mirror the edge type. ATTENTION: This behaviour has changed since ArcGIS 10.

40|$|One of the {{components}} of a turboprop gas turbine engine is the Front Bearing Structure (FBS) which leads air into the compressor. FBS directly encounters with ambient air, as a consequence ice accretion may occur on its static vanes. There are several aerodynamic parameters which should be considered in the design of anti-icing system of FBS, such as diameter, position, exit angle of discharge holes, etc. This research focuses on the effects of <b>break</b> <b>edge</b> configuration over anti-ice jet flow. <b>Break</b> <b>edge</b> operation is a process which is applied to the hole in order to avoid sharp edges which cause high stress concentration. Numerical analyses and flow visualization test have been conducted. Four different <b>break</b> <b>edge</b> configurations were used for this investigation; without <b>break</b> <b>edge,</b> 0. 35 xD, 74 xD, 0. 87 xD. Three mainstream flow conditions at the inlet of the channel are defined; 10 m/s, 20 m/s and 40 m/s. Shear stresses are extracted from numerical analyses near the trailing edge of pressure surface where ice may occur under icing conditions. A specific flow visualization method was used for the experimental study. Vane surface near the trailing edge was dyed and thinner was injected into anti-ice jet flow in order to remove dye from the vane surface. Hence, film effect on the surface could be computed for each testing condition. Thickness of the dye removal area of each case was examined. The results show noticeable effects of <b>break</b> <b>edge</b> operation on jet flow, and the air film effectiveness decreases when mainstream inlet velocity decreases...|$|R

We further propose a concrete system with a zigzag graphene nanoribbon grown on top of a hexagonal boron-nitride substrate to realize such edge modes.
