5|$|The {{developer}} and {{producer of the}} original Metroid for the Nintendo Entertainment System – Nintendo Research & Development 1 (Nintendo R) and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Metroid II. The developers of the game added round metal shoulders on Samus' Varia Suit to differentiate it from her Power Suit, since <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> similar on the Game Boy's limited greyscale display. The updated suit has since been {{a staple of the}} series, appearing in all subsequent games. A unique color palette for Metroid II was added to the Game Boy Color console, a successor to the original Game Boy with a color screen.|$|E
25|$|England {{opened the}} bowling with the {{relatively}} inexperienced pair of Devon Malcolm and Angus Fraser, and Australia's opening batsmen Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh tore them apart. The Nottingham crowd {{were treated to}} an exciting display of a mixture of stroke-play and powerful hitting. The pair batted throughout the morning and had soon passed 50. Botham and then Hemmings were brought in to bowl, but were equally ineffective. The Australians <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> set and determined, and rarely mis-timed or beaten.|$|E

25|$|In reply Australia started strongly, with Ponting {{having to}} wait until 123 runs were scored before walking out to bat on the third day. After {{surviving}} a spell reverse-swing bowling from Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan, Ponting was bowled through the gate from a sharp turning delivery from part-time off-spinner Virender Sehwag. Ponting and out-of-form opener Matthew Hayden partnered for a cautious 79-run compilation, as <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> to survive on a pitch that was becoming lower and slower. Ponting was more cautious against Sharma than usual, scoring only nine from 26 balls from the tall right-armer quick. Nevertheless, he was more aggressive and assured against spinners Amit Mishra and Sehwag, where he scored 35 from 60 and 17 from 32 deliveries respectively. During the early stage of his innings, a swarm of bees interrupted the match when they forced the players and officials to lie on the ground, before they moved on. After surviving four dropped catches, Michael Clarke scored his eight Test century in during Australia's highest Test score in India—577—as Sehwag took a career best five wickets {{in the absence of}} fellow spinners Harbhajan Singh and Kumble who left the field with a finger injury. India lost two late Indian wickets on the fourth evening and were reduced to 4/93 on the fifth morning; however the match ended in a tame draw, with the home side declaring on 5/208, setting Australia an unrealistic target of 245 in the final session. They finished on 31 without loss, before the match was declared a draw, resulting in Australia needing victory in the final Test to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 tournament {{was held}} in Bangladesh. More than 350,000 spectators saw the 54 matches played in the tournament. The finale ended with a close final between the two best teams - West Indies and Pakistan. It was won by Pakistan by 25 runs against West Indies and a 30,000 crowd {{acclaimed}} the victorious Pakistanis almost as their own. The players, from the ten Test countries and six other nations, were feted wherever they went, and the appetite for cricket was remarkable: even Zimbabwe v Canada sold out. The shock was the elimination from the main competition of holders Australia, bowled out for 73 and beaten by Zimbabwe in the group stage when Tinashe Panyangara took 6 for 31, the second-best figures in the competition's history. And Australia then lost to Bangladesh in the plate final amid thumping drums and gleeful celebrations. The downside was {{the quality of the}} cricket, which was often mediocre on some indifferent pitches, and the reporting of six unidentified bowlers for having suspect actions. Pakistan would have finished unbeaten but for a hiccup against England - when both teams had already qualified for the semis. England reached the last four, which was progress, and Alastair Cook looked a class apart. But they came unstuck against West Indies' spinners in the semi-final. India completed the semi-finalists. Dhawan and Suresh Raina were the backbone of a strong batting line-up, and Raina's 90 from just 38 balls against the hapless Scots was as brutal an innings as one will see at any level. <b>Both</b> <b>looked</b> international-class already, though faced with a tough task breaking into their senior side's formidable top order. The captain Ambati Rayudu had been hailed as the next great batting hope, having scored a century and a double in a first-class match at the age of 17. But he did not score the runs promised and was banned by the referee John Morrison from the semi-final after allowing a funereal over-rate during the Super League win against Sri Lanka: eight overs were bowled in the first 50 minutes. India's Shikhar Dhawan was named Man of the Tournament, and was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 505 runs at an average of 84.16. Bangladeshi Enamul Haque was the leading wicket-taker, with 22 wickets at 10.18.|$|E

500|$|In September 2010, it was {{announced}} Weinberg would {{not be part of}} the show, now named Conan; Jimmy Vivino took over leadership of that band, with Wormworth replacing Weinberg full-time on drums. The split was stated as being mutual, with O'Brien saying, [...] "Max has been a huge part of my life for the past 17 years and he is an incredible bandleader and musician," [...] and Weinberg thanking his band and saying, [...] "17 years – a lifetime on TV ... my association with Conan, his staff, and crew has been a deeply rewarding experience for me." [...] Weinberg subsequently acknowledged that [...] "we both wanted to go in different directions," [...] but <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> forward to Weinberg occasionally stopping by to sit in on the new show. Weinberg said his health was better than ever but that the [...] "life-changing experience emotionally and spiritually" [...] of the surgery, a desire to remain in New Jersey with his family, and an interest in exploring new musical directions had all played a role in his departure from O'Brien.|$|E
500|$|Abbot Bower also {{described}} the king {{as capable of}} stabbing a near relative through the hand for creating a disturbance at court. The abbot was generally supportive of James but he and others besides regretted {{the demise of the}} Albany Stewarts and that he was confounded by James's greed for territory and wealth. Although Bower didn't dwell at length on the negative aspects of James's character he alluded to the dismay of even those close to the king at his harsh regime. John Shirley's account of the events leading up to James's murder in the work The Dethe of the Kynge of Scotis provided an accurate narrative of politics in Scotland and which must have depended upon knowledgeable witnesses. The Dethe describes James as 'tyrannous' and whose actions were motivated by revenge and 'covetise [...] [...] [...] than for anny laweful cawse'. Shirley agrees with Bower as far as the Albany Stewarts were concerned when he wrote that the Albanys 'whos dethe the people of the land sore grutched and mowrned'. Writing nearly a century later both the chroniclers John Mair and Hector Boece relied extensively on Bower for their own narratives. They described James as the embodiment of good monarchy with Mair's eulogy that James '...indeed excelled by far in virtue his father, grandfather and his great-grandfather nor will I give precedence over the first James to any of the Stewarts' while Boece in similar vein calls James the 'maist vertuous Prince that evir was afoir his days'. Late in the 16th century the early historians George Buchanan and Bishop John Lesley from opposite ends of the religious spectrum <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> favourably on James's reign but were uneasily mindful of an enduring aggressive history regarding the king.|$|E

2500|$|The {{construction}} of the Rideau Canal {{was one of the}} first projects in Upper Canada to employ thousands of laborers. It was under the control of the [...] British military. The British officers and the contractors they hired <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> at the workers as [...] instruments of production required to facilitate the most economic completion of the project. Because of the shortage of jobs, labourers had little choice but to endure difficult and often dangerous working and living conditions. The response of workers to these harsh conditions was militant but sporadic. They tended to act against individual property owners and contractors in order to obtain the immediate necessities for survival. More concerted activity was discouraged in large part by the military which posted soldiers along the line of the canal to suppress dissent and ensure a cheap supply of labour.|$|E
2500|$|With several fresher {{riders in}} the breakaway, the move started to {{fracture}} in the terrain {{and by the}} time the move reached the Alto de Ibardin for the second and final time with [...] to go, only five riders remained in the move: Albasini, Clarke, Paterski, Petrov and Sørensen. Clarke and Paterski were dropped on the climb itself as [...] looked to establish themselves on the front of the pack along with , looking to position Tony Martin in a prime position to attack late on. Albasini was caught with [...] to go, and a lead group of some 25 riders was established for the closing stages. Maxime Monfort and Fränk Schleck looked to set the pace for their [...] team-mate Chris Horner, while Simon Špilak looked to do so for Rodríguez. 's Wout Poels and 's Sergio Henao <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> to go clear in the final kilometre, but Rodríguez prevailed comfortably in the closing stages – an 18% gradient in some places – to win by nine seconds, taking the overall lead from Sánchez, who was second ahead of Henao and 's Robert Kišerlovski.|$|E
2500|$|In reply, the Sixers {{had trouble}} {{of their own}} keeping wickets in hand. With regular opener Michael Lumb out for the game, Stephen O'Keefe partnered Nic Maddinson {{at the top of}} the order. <b>Both</b> <b>looked</b> to move the scores on but fell cheaply. Then when Moises Henriques and Marcus North both {{returned}} to the pavilion without troubling the scorers the Sixers were 4/20. Scorchers bowler Tim Behrendorff was the destroyer with 3/21 from his four overs. Steve Smith and Jordan Silk did some rebuilding of their own before Silk gifted Voges an easy return catch. Smith continued scoring runs and looked in fine form as he reached his half century. The Sixers seemed like they would now easily make the runs. However, the game turned on its head once more when Dan Smith attempted to play a reverse sweep only to scoop the ball to fine leg. With the Scorchers eyeing off the Sixers tail-enders, Steve Smith took it upon himself to finish the game. A mistimed shot of the bowling of Yasir Arafat saw him caught at short third man by Voges with the Sixers 7/131. Lyon quickly departed and the Scorchers looked destined to win. However, the nineteenth over by Thomas saw some big hitting by Lee and Chris Tremlett leaving the Sixers with just 7 runs of the final over by Arafat to win. Neither side could quite find the slice of luck to get the win in ordinary time. With Lee out bowled, Tremlett faced the final delivery needing two runs to win. He dug out the ball from Arafat who couldn't quite hold onto out bumping it out to cover. The Sixers scampered through for a single leaving the scores tied.|$|E
