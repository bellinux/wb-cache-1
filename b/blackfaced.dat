The gang scattered after the Red Rock robbery, but soon <b>Blackfaced</b> Charley was captured by Deputy US Marshal Ed Short.

5000|$|The Lonk is a {{domestic}} sheep {{of a specific}} breed, found {{in the hills of}} the central and south Pennines, in the north of England.

Their range extends into only three counties; Lancashire, Yorkshire and Derbyshire.

5000|$|The Scottish Blackface is {{the most}} common breed of {{domestic}} sheep in the United Kingdom. This tough and adaptable breed is often found in the more exposed locations, such as the Scottish Highlands or roaming on the moors of Dartmoor. It is also known as <b>Blackfaced</b> Highland, Kerry, Linton, Scottish Mountain, Scottish Highland, Scotch Blackface and Scotch Horn. Blackfaces are horned in both sexes, and as their name suggests, they usually have a black face (but sometimes with white markings), and black legs. [...] This breed is primarily raised for meat.|$|E
50|$|Polycerate sheep breeds {{include the}} Hebridean, Icelandic, Jacob, Manx Loaghtan, Boreray and the Navajo-Churro.

In the spring of 1808 this ram {{attacked}} several people who had taken shortcuts across the square, injuring some and actually killing a small boy. Because of selective breeding, polycerate sheep are increasingly rare in the British Isles and Spain, but some breeds can still be found in Asia.

50|$|Existing {{documents}} offer confused {{accounts of}} Juba's dancing style, but certain themes emerge: it was percussive, varied in tempo, lightning-fast at times, expressive, and unlike anything seen before. The dance likely incorporated both European folk steps, {{such as the}} Irish jig, and African-derived steps used by plantation slaves, such as the walkaround. Prior to Juba's career, the dance of blackface performance was more faithful to black culture than its other aspects, but as <b>blackfaced</b> clowns and minstrels adopted elements of his style, Juba further enhanced this authenticity. By having an effect upon blackface performance, Juba was highly influential {{on the development of}} such American dance styles as tap, jazz, and step dancing.|$|E

50|$|The most fertile tracts lie on {{the eastern}} coast, {{especially}} in Easter Ross and the Black Isle, where the soil varies from a light sandy gravel to a rich deep loam. As of 1911, among grain crops oats were most generally cultivated, but barley and wheat were also raised. Turnips and potatoes were the chief green crops. The higher land contains much good pasturage, with many sheep, <b>blackfaced</b> being the principal breed. Most of the horses, principally half-breds between the old garrons (hardy, serviceable, small animals) and Clydesdales, were maintained {{for the purposes of}} agriculture. The herds of cattle, mainly native Highland or crosses, were large, many of them supplying the London market.

Jerry jumps into a tea kettle to escape the cat's wrath, but Tom sees him and throws another firecracker into the kettle; Jerry panics, but the oxygen has run out and the mouse escapes through the spout with no explosion.

Einar and Gunnar exit the hospital and wander around feverishly. Einar observes Lord Dufferin giving a public speech. Einar hallucinates that Lord Dufferin is the mythical Fish Princess. The men end up in a field together along with a Shriners Highland Pipe Band and begin to Glima Wrestleâ€”a traditional competition where fighters graps each other's buttocks and take turns lifting one another up until one collapses. They tear each other's clothes and claw at each other's buttocks until they bleed, then both collapse.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story of}} the [...] "Old South" [...] is the {{story of the}} slave plantations, its origins, its expansion, its {{pervasive}} influence on the region we know as the American South. Pre-Civil War Americans regarded Southerners as a distinct people, who possessed their own values and ways of life. During the three decades before the Civil War, popular writers created a stereotype, now known as the plantation legend, that described the South as a land of aristocratic planters, beautiful southern belles, poor white trash, faithful household slaves, and superstitious fieldhands. This image of the South as [...] "a land of cotton where old times are not forgotten" [...] received its most popular expression in 1859 in a song called [...] "Dixie," [...] written by a Northerner named Dan D. Emmett to enliven shows given by a troupe of <b>blackfaced</b> minstrels on the New York stage.|$|E

The registered area amounts to 3,015 ãŽ¡. The area around the Maehwa Mareum Habitat has been utilized as farmland and was mainly introduced by eco-friendly farming communities. The Maehwa Mareum is home to various species, like the <b>Blackfaced</b> Spoonbill, Chinese Egret, Yellow-spotted Serpent, Seoul Pond Frog, Narrow-mouth Frog and many more. Especially important for the registration as an official Ramsar site, was the endangered plant maehwa mareum that grows in the rice paddies. The Maehwa Mareum nearly faced destruction because of land consolidation. Fortunately, the Korean National Trust, a civil environmental movement that is dedicated to preserve natural and cultural heritage, bought that land and after consultation with local residents, they decided to preserve the land as a rice paddy wetland.|$|E
5000|$|In 1881, {{the pair}} became {{familiar}} with Sam Hague's British Minstrels, then on a U.S. tour. Primrose and West adopted Hague's techniques of ultra-refinement: Ballet and high-class music {{played by a}} large orchestra replaced low comedy and African American-themed song and dance as the main focus, and sets and costumes came to mimic fancy European powdered wigs and eveningwear. Only the (sometimes) <b>blackfaced</b> endmen kept the new troupe from severing its ties to minstrelsy completely. George Thatcher, one of the troupe members who became a partner of Thatcher, Primrose & West (and later had his own troupe), explained later that [...] "We were looking for novelty, and for a change tried white minstrelsy." [...] When Milt Barlow left the troupe in 1882, Primrose and West did away with plantation and blackface material completely. In its place, audiences witnessed such upper-class pursuits as fox hunting, lawn tennis, and yacht racing. Primrose and West had a hit, and they {{came to be called}} [...] "The Millionaires of Minstrelsy".|$|E
