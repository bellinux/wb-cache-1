5|$|In {{contrast}} to the H-11 and H-16 the H-20, equipped with two Jumo 211F-2s, had more powerful armament and radio communications. The defensive armament consisted of one MG 131 in an A-Stand gun pod for the forward mounted machine gun position. One rotatable Drehlafette DL 131/1C (or E) gun mount in the B-stand was standard and later MG 131 machine guns were added. Navigational direction-finding gear was also installed. The Peil G6 was added to locate targets and the FuBI 2H <b>blind</b> <b>landing</b> equipment was built in to help with night operations. The radio was a standard FuG 10, TZG 10 and FuG 16Z for navigating to the target. The H-20 also was equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutters. The bomb load of the H-20 could be mounted on external ETC 1000 racks, or four ESAC 250 racks. The sub variant H-20/R4 could carry 20 50kg (110lb) bombs as external loads.|$|E

25|$|The UK had {{for some}} time used a <b>blind</b> <b>landing</b> system known as Standard Beam Approach, an {{adaptation}} of a pre-war German system known as a Lorenz beam. Lorenz, and Standard, used two radio transmissions that were picked up by conventional voice radio sets. The signals were sent from two directional antennas positioned {{at the end of}} the active runway, switching back and forth between the two, spending 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E

[...] The Ambrose Channel cable was removed from the Channel and used in testing an early system of autolanding. The cable found no more success in that role than it did in guiding ships. The <b>Blind</b> <b>Landing</b> Experimental Unit later tried a similar system briefly before also abandoning it in favor of wireless.|$|E
500|$|The Comet 3, which flew for {{the first}} time on 19 July 1954, was a Comet 2 {{lengthened}} by [...] and powered by Avon M502 engines developing [...] The variant added wing pinion tanks, and offered greater capacity and range. The Comet 3 was destined to remain a development series since it did not incorporate the fuselage-strengthening modifications of the later series aircraft, and was not able to be fully pressurised. Only two Comet 3s began construction with G-ANLO, the only airworthy Comet 3, demonstrated at the Farnborough SBAC Show in September 1954. The other Comet 3 airframe was not completed to production standard and was used primarily for ground-based structural and technology testing during development of the similarly sized Comet 4. Nine additional Comet 3 airframes were not completed and their construction was abandoned at Hatfield. In BOAC colours, G-ANLO was flown by John Cunningham in a marathon round-the-world promotional tour in December 1955. As a flying testbed, it was later modified with Avon RA29 engines fitted, as well as replacing the original long-span wings with reduced span wings as the Comet 3B and demonstrated in British European Airways (BEA) livery at the Farnborough Airshow in September 1958. Assigned in 1961 to the <b>Blind</b> <b>Landing</b> Experimental Unit (BLEU) at RAE Bedford, the final testbed role played by G–ANLO was in automatic landing system experiments. When retired in 1973, the airframe was used for foam arrester trials before the fuselage was salvaged at BAE Woodford, to serve as the mock-up for the Nimrod.|$|E

After some years of enrollment fluctuation, student numbers began a steady increase, new programs were added, curricula and faculty expanded, and a true state university emerged.|$|R

[...] Hastert's ownership interest in the tract was not a public record because the land was held by a <b>blind</b> <b>land</b> trust, Little Rock Trust No. 225. [...] There were three partners in the trust: Hastert, Thomas Klatt, and Dallas Ingemunson. However, public documents only named Ingemunson, who was the Kendall County Republican Party chairman and Hastert's personal attorney and longtime friend. Hastert denied any wrongdoing.

2500|$|The Trident had a complex, {{sophisticated}} and comprehensive avionics fit which {{was successful in}} service. This comprised a completely automatic <b>blind</b> <b>landing</b> system developed by Hawker Siddeley and Smiths Aircraft Instruments. It was capable of guiding the aircraft automatically during airfield approach, flare, touchdown and even roll-out from the landing runway. The system was intended to offer autoland by 1970. In the event, it enabled the Trident to perform the first automatic landing by a civil airliner in scheduled passenger service on 10 June 1965 and the first genuinely [...] "blind" [...] landing in scheduled passenger service on 4 November 1966.|$|E
2500|$|The last {{aircraft}} of {{the series}} {{was based on a}} partially completed third twin-engined Vellore airframe, fitted with a new, broader fuselage with a glazed pilots' compartment, a spatted tailwheel and powered by 600hp (450kW) Bristol Pegasus IM3 radials. [...] This variant was renamed the Vickers Vellox, flying {{for the first time on}} 23 January 1934 in the hands of Mutt Summers. [...] Vickers hoped to sell the Vellox as a ten-passenger airliner and the new fuselage had five windows per side in front of large starboard side freight doors at the wing trailing edge, but the sole example was used by Imperial Airways as a freighter, mailplane, and for testing Lorenz <b>blind</b> <b>landing</b> equipment. The Vellox crashed shortly after takeoff from Croydon Airport in August 1936 due to a loss of power possibly as a result of some fuel problem. The crew of two pilots and two wireless operators was killed.|$|E
