They are at a standstill, thus House seeks Lisa Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) resolution. However, she will only lay out the conditions if House does his team's performance reviews (knowing that he hates doing paperwork). House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E
5|$|Chris Columbus—who {{had written}} the Spielberg-produced Gremlins, The Goonies, and Young Sherlock Holmes—was hired to write the script. His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a Garden of Immortal Peaches. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to Mozambique to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a Katharine Hepburn type {{according}} to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old pygmy. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier—an old friend of Indiana—travel up the Zambezi river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the Monkey King. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a Toshiro Mifune type), who dies eating a peach <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> pure of heart.|$|E

5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E
5|$|On the July 7 {{episode of}} SmackDown, it was {{announced}} that Lesnar would be facing Randy Orton at SummerSlam, who himself had just returned to WWE from injury. Two days later on July 9, WWE allowed Lesnar to have a one-off fight for UFC 200. Lesnar failed two of his drug tests for this fight, but he was not suspended by WWE <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a full-time performer. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Lesnar was the #5 draft pick for the Raw brand. Reports claimed that he would have been #1 had he not failed his UFC drug tests. Orton was drafted to SmackDown, thus making their match an interbrand match, while WWE billed their face-off as a match fifteen years in the making. Along with Heyman, Lesnar made his return to Raw on August 1 (his first appearance on WWE programming since WrestleMania 32), but during his segment Orton appeared and attacked Lesnar with an RKO. Lesnar then attacked Orton during his match the following night on SmackDown Live, performing an F-5 on Orton. At SummerSlam on August 21, Lesnar defeated Orton by technical knockout, leaving Orton with a forehead wound which required ten staples. Much to Shane McMahon's dismay, Lesnar would later attack Shane with an F-5. The end made many people believe Lesnar had gone off script due to the severity of Orton's head wound. Lesnar was later storyline fined $500 for delivering an F-5 to SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon and his assault on Orton. On September 24 at a house show in Chicago, Illinois, Lesnar defeated Orton in a no-disqualification rematch, with the match being billed as a Suplex City death match.|$|E

He averaged 9.9 points on 45 percent shooting. His minutes dwindled down in the playoffs. The Nuggets' head coach George Karl, said Kleiza played fewer minutes <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a playmaker.|$|E

His distaste for industrial waste, cars and rubbish eventually turned into an art form. He creates tiny works of art by painting chewing gum stuck to the pavement. Initially, his work garnered him unwanted attention from the authorities, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> defacing private property but merely painting rubbish, he was found to be breaking no law. In addition to the chewing gum art, Wilson paints and sculpts. He has exhibited his paintings and sculptures in England, the United States, Germany, Ireland, Finland, France and Serbia.|$|E

This bought back memories for Regina as she reflected about how Cora killed Daniel, which gave Regina an idea to obtain the tear, which could come from her by using the dreamcatcher. When Emma tried using it, the potion didn’t work, as Regina has moved on to Robin. Meanwhile, Henry treats Violet to dinner and a movie at Granny's and she is impressed, but when the subject of dating or courting came up, Violet tells Henry {{that she wants to}} just be friends, but explains that it was not because of her father's disapproval of him. This devastated Henry <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a hero in this universe.

The Doctor tells them they have fallen out of the time vortex and that the TARDIS's power cell is dead. The Doctor fears they are trapped in the Void, but Mickey opens the TARDIS doors {{to see that they}} are in London. Heading outside to look, they quickly realise that they are in London on a {{parallel}} Earth. The Doctor finds a small power cell in the TARDIS that still works, and he energises it with some of his own lifeforce. The cell needs time to recharge, so they decide to explore the alternate world. Rose is shocked to see a billboard with her father's picture on it, and the Doctor warns her not to seek him out <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> her real father. Mickey decides to head off on his own and try to find his grandmother, who died in his universe. The Doctor and Rose discover that most of the population of London wear EarPod devices that feed information directly into the wearer's brain.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{interest}} in female characters, Kon stated that female characters were easier to write <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> able to know the character {{in the same way}} as a male character, and [...] "can project my obsession onto the characters and expand the aspects I want to describe." [...] With a frame of reference up to Tokyo Godfathers, Susan J. Napier notes that while the theme of performance is the one obvious commonality in his works, she finds that the concept of the male gaze is the more important topic for discussion. Napier shows the evolution of Kon's use of the gaze from its restrictive and negative aspects in Magnetic Rose and Perfect Blue, to a collaborative gaze in Millennium Actress before arriving at a new type of gaze in Tokyo Godfathers which revels in uncertainty and illusion.|$|E

Bower revealed Natasha has her father wrapped around her finger. Michael dotes upon Natasha and Bower opined Natasha causes havoc <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> strict with her. Winton said he thinks Michael is not handling things with Natasha [...] "too poorly", but she does make things difficult for him. During a 2011 interview with Channel 5, Winton said that Michael and Natasha's relationship had become tortured. Winton stated that Michael wishes Natasha would stop lying to him and hoped she would get her act together, so they could have some semblance of a father/daughter relationship. Winton wanted Michael to build a better relationship with Natasha in the future as he loves her, despite the things she has done.|$|E

Nevertheless, Amanda Tapping (Carter) felt that [...] "there is a hesitancy on 's part {{to be too}} familiar with Jonas [...] make this big emotional investment" [...] in him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> Daniel. Jonas hopes that Carter and the alien SG-1 member Teal'c can persuade Colonel O'Neill {{to give him a}} chance to prove himself worthy of a place on the SG-1 team, but according to Richard Dean Anderson (O'Neill), [...] "O'Neill feels that Jonas is directly responsible for the demise or at least the damaging of Daniel Jackson [...] harbors some resentment towards Jonas". Although O'Neill is suspicious of aliens in general (except of Teal'c), O'Neill begins to accept Jonas at the end of [...] "Redemption" [...] yet finds it hard to ever significantly warm up to Jonas, something which Nemec felt [...] "makes things much more interesting". Tapping added that Jonas inadvertently brings the three remaining SG-1 members closer together again. Jonas's [...] "easy-going nature" [...] later helps him to also establish relationships with the supporting characters Dr. Janet Fraiser and General George Hammond, whom Nemec regarded [...] "very much [...] a father figure in Jonas's eyes".|$|E
