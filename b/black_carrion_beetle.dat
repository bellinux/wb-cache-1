40|$|Urbanization is an {{increasingly}} pervasive form of land transformation that reduces biodiversity of many taxonomic groups. Beetles exhibit {{a broad range}} of responses to urbanization, likely due to the high functional diversity in this order. <b>Carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> (Order: Coleoptera, Family: Silphidae) provide an important ecosystem service by promoting decomposition of small-bodied carcasses, and have previously been found to decline due to forest fragmentation caused by urbanization. However, New York City (NYC) and many other cities have fairly large continuous forest patches that support dense populations of small mammals, and thus may harbor relatively robust <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> communities in city parks. In this study, we investigated <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> community composition, abundance and diversity in forest patches along an urban-to-rural gradient spanning the urban core (Central Park, NYC) to outlying rural areas. We conducted an additional study comparing the current <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> community at a single suburban site in Westchester County, NY that was intensively surveyed in the early 1970 ’s. We collected a total of 2, 170 <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> from eight species at 13 sites along this gradient. We report little to no effect of urbanization on <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> diversity, although two species were not detected in any urban parks. Nicrophorus tomentosus was the most abundant species at all sites and seemed to dominate the urban communities, potentially due to its generalist habits and shallower burying depth compared to the other beetles surveyed. Variation between species body size, habitat specialization, and % forest area surrounding the surveyed sites also did not influence <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> communities. Lastly, we found few significant differences in relative abundance of 10 different <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> species between 1974 and 2015 at a single site in Westchester County, NY, although two of the rare species in the early 1970 ’s were not detected in 2015. These results indicate that NYC’s forested parks have the potential to sustain <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> communities and the ecosystem services they provide...|$|R

50|$|Gold-necked <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle,</b> or Tomentose {{burying beetle}} (Nicrophorus tomentosus), is {{a species of}} burying beetle that was {{described}} by Friedrich Weber in 1801. The beetle belongs to the Silphidae family which are <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles.</b> The beetles have sensitive antennae that contain olfactory organs. Thus, the beetle can locate dead animals (carcass), and then as the name suggests, can bury them. However, unlike other burying beetles, N. tomentosus does not feed these brood carcasses. They instead eliminate the soil under the carcass, so the carcass will sink underneath. Recognition of these beetles can be distinguished by its black color with orange markings on the wing covers (elytra).|$|R

The vegetation of the survey sites consist of four types, deciduous forest, mixed forest of deciduous and sasa types, and bushes. A total of 1, 084 individuals in 6 species of <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> by using bait traps were investigated and among them, Nicrophorus quadripunctatus was the most dominant species with 947 (87. 36 %).

25|$|Oiceoptoma noveboracense is {{a member}} of the family Silphidae, or <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles,</b> which feed on {{decaying}} organic matter such as dead animals. Its common name is the margined <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle,</b> from the orange-red margins on the pronotum, which are helpful when identifying this species. The larva is typically light brown to red and also has vertical ridges on its thorax like the adult. This diurnal beetle can be found mainly in the spring into the fall, and it has a strong preference towards a deciduous forest habitat. The primary forensic importance of this beetle is its ability to use the succession of insect fauna to provide confirmation of postmortem intervals.|$|R
40|$|Necrophagous beetles (Coleoptera) {{are very}} {{interesting}} and diverse ecological group of species with an immense impact on a natural nutrient cycle. Their main food source and breeding ground are carrions of vertebrates, human remains included. This relationship is often used in various ways by forensic entomology, but its potential was not jet fully reached, because our knowledge of biology and ecology of these beetles is very much incomplete. In this thesis I would like to explore geographic distribution, ecological requirements and developmental biology of several Central European necrophagous beetles as an outcome of their ecological and evolution strategies. For that I raised three broad research questions. Which factors are determining the local abundance of <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Silphidae) ? How the current geographical distribution of open-landscape <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> looks like in the Czech Republic? How the temperature affects the development of Sciodrepoides watsoni (Spence, 1813) ? We found out that soil type can have significant effect on abundance of <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles.</b> They showed preference for chernozem [...] Nicrophorus antennatus (Reitter), N. germanicus (Linnaeus), N. interruptus (Stephens), N. sepultor (Charpentier), Silpha obscura obscura (Herbst), T. sinuatus (Fabricius) or for fluvisol as did N. humator (Gleditsch). These findings support our hypothesis that soil type could {{be an important factor}} determining the occurrence of necrophagous European <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles.</b> To collect novel data of the current geographical distribution of <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> we used 420 baited pitfall traps at 84 localities, and we collected 71 234 specimens of 15 silphid species. Among them, three endangered <b>carrion</b> <b>beetle</b> species listed on the Czech Red List of Invertebrates, were found. Two are vulnerable thermophilic species of open landscapes, Nicrophorus antennatus (Reitter, 1884) (collected around Louny and Židlochovice) and Nicrophorus germanicus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Louny, Zábřeh and Židlochovice). The third is the near threatened species, Nicrophorus sepultor Charpentier, 1825 (collected around Louny, Kutná Hora, Zábřeh and Židlochovice), which also prefers open landscapes. We studied development of common Holarctic beetle Sciodrepoides watsoni under five constant temperature regimes in laboratory (15, 18, 21, 25 and 28 °C). Parameters of thermal summation models and their standard errors were calculated for each developmental stage (egg, three larval instars and pupae). We also find a new character for larval instar determination (head width) and proposed novel approach for future studies of size-based characters in instar determination...|$|R

50|$|Silphidae is {{a family}} of beetles that are known {{commonly}} as large <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles,</b> <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> or burying beetles. There are two subfamilies: Silphinae and Nicrophorinae. Nicrophorines are sometimes known as sexton beetles. The number of species is relatively small and around two hundred. They are more diverse in the temperate region although a few tropical endemics are known. Both subfamilies feed on decaying organic matter such as dead animals. The subfamilies differ in which uses parental care and which types of carcasses they prefer.

40|$|<b>Carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> are {{important}} in terrestrial ecosystems, consuming dead mammals and promoting the recycling of organic matter into ecosystems. Most forensic studies are focused on succession of Diptera while neglecting Coleoptera. So far, little information is available on <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> postmortem colonization and decomposition process in temperate biogeoclimatic countries. These beetles are however part of the entomofaunal colonization of a dead body. Forensic entomologists need databases concerning the distribution, ecology and phenology of necrophagous insects, including silphids. Forensic entomology uses pig carcasses to surrogate human decomposition and to investigate entomofaunal succession. However, {{few studies have been}} conducted in Europe on large carcasses. The work reported here monitored the presence of the <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Silphidae) on decaying pig carcasses in three selected biotopes (forest, crop field, urban site) at the beginning of spring. Seven species of Silphidae were recorded: Nicrophorus humator (Gleditsch), Nicrophorus vespillo (L.), Nicrophorus vespilloides (Herbst), Necrodes littoralis L., Oiceoptoma thoracica L., Thanatophilus sinuatus (Fabricius), Thanatophilus rugosus (L.).

We collected beetles on Nakanoshima Island (experimental site) and lakeshore areas (control site) and compared the species richness, abundance, diversity index, and community composition of beetles between the sites. Results showed that although both species diversity and abundance of carabid beetles were significantly higher at the lakeshore site, those of dung and <b>carrion</b> <b>beetles</b> were higher at the island site.
