500|$|Mustaine {{elaborated}} {{on possible}} lyrical themes, revealing {{that he had}} <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> world history and [...] "crazy science stuff". Both Mustaine and Ellefson had indicated that the album would feature a different musical and stylistic approach from the previous album, including a move away from a radio-oriented sound, [...] which was subsequently characterized as a move back towards a thrash-oriented sound. Mustaine also stated his belief that the album sound and songwriting would be influenced by his 2014 guest performance alongside the San Diego Symphony.|$|E

The English word for gymnasium equipment is 'apparatus.' [...] And in her book Labour and Childhood (1907) you will find this sentence: 'Apparatus can be made by fools, but only God can make a tree.' ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Carter {{claimed to}} have been {{inspired}} to write the episode after his dog had worms, a situation he called [...] "very disgusting". He also had <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> Chernobyl and the extinction of species at the time and blended all three of these concepts when writing the episode. Carter described his mood while writing the episode, [...] "I was in a funk when I wrote that episode. We were coming back from hiatus and I was trying to find something more interesting than just the Flukeman. I was irritated at the time and I brought my irritation to Mulder's attitude. Basically, he had become fed up with the FBI. They had given him what he felt was a low assignment, which was sending him into the city after a dead body. But lo and behold, he finds that this is a case that {{for all intents and purposes}} is an X-File. It's been given to him by a man he's never looked at as an ally, Skinner. So it's an interesting establishing of a relationship between them." [...] Producer J.P. Finn described the episode as a departure from Carter's usual work as it did not deal with an alien subject matter.|$|E

500|$|Many Stanford alumni {{were upset}} with the {{decision}} to hire Shaughnessy. The most popular candidates for the vacant position were two Stanford alumni themselves: San Jose State coach Dudley DeGroot, and Santa Clara coach Buck Shaw. Some believed the Shaughnessy hiring was a ploy to eventually eliminate football at the school, as had happened at both Loyola and Chicago the year prior. The Bay Area media mocked the Shaughnessy hiring as comically inept. They believed that a prestigious academic school had foolishly hired an inveterate loser as its head coach. Prescott Sulivan of the San Francisco Examiner and Jack McDonald of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin coined the nickname [...] "Soup" [...] for Shaughnessy, which they sarcastically explained was a diminutive for the word [...] "super". Sullivan wrote, [...] "We have heard it said that Shaughnessy has developed the knack of losing to the point where, with him, it is an exact science. In light of his record, we aren't at all surprised at this." [...] The Stanford players were also skeptical of Shaughnessy's abilities. Center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among ourselves that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben-Hur {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews {{upon its}} release. Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, called Ben-Hur [...] "a remarkably intelligent and engrossing human drama". While praising the acting and William Wyler's [...] "close-to" [...] direction, {{he also had}} high praise for the chariot race: [...] "There has seldom been anything in movies to compare with this picture's chariot race. It is a stunning complex of mighty setting, thrilling action by horses and men, panoramic observation and overwhelming use of dramatic sound." [...] Jack Gaver, writing for United Press International, also had praise for the acting, calling it full of [...] "genuine warmth and fervor and finely acted intimate scenes". Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "magnificent, inspiring, awesome, enthralling, {{and all the other}} adjectives you have <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] He also called the editing [...] "generally expert" [...] although at times abrupt. Ronald Holloway, writing for Variety, called Ben-Hur [...] "a majestic achievement, representing a superb blending of the motion picture arts by master craftsmen," [...] and concluded that [...] "Gone With the Wind, Metro's own champion all-time top grosser, will eventually have to take a back seat." [...] The chariot race [...] "will probably be preserved in film archives as the finest example of the use of the motion picture camera to record an action sequence. The race, directed by Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt, represents some 40 minutes of the most hair-raising excitement that film audiences have ever witnessed." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band began touring {{in support}} of the album, christened the Vices & Virtues Tour, in earnest {{beginning}} in February 2011.

[...] In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, [...] "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [...] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football... Now, I have a formation for {{you that if you}} learn it well will take you to the Rose Bowl." [...] He asserted that one of his plays, a line plunge by a back without a blocker, would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical, and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner said before the season, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean." [...] Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing. As a contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "The [...] team looked great in some games and sour in others. The machinery was there but it wasn't running as smoothly as had been hoped for." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1935—the {{year that}} Beckett {{successfully}} {{published a book}} of his poetry, Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates—Beckett worked on his novel Murphy. In May, he wrote to MacGreevy that he had <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> film and wished to go to Moscow to study with Sergei Eisenstein at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow. In mid-1936 he wrote to Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin to offer himself as their apprentices. Nothing came of this, however, as Beckett's letter was lost owing to Eisenstein's quarantine during the smallpox outbreak, {{as well as his}} focus on a script re-write of his postponed film production. [...] In 1936, a friend had suggested him [...] to look up the works of Arnold Geulincx, which Beckett did and he took many notes. The philosopher's name is mentioned in Murphy and the reading apparently left a strong impression. Murphy was finished in 1936 and Beckett departed for extensive travel around Germany, during which time he filled several notebooks with lists of noteworthy artwork that he had seen and noted his distaste for the Nazi savagery that was overtaking the country. Returning to Ireland briefly in 1937, he oversaw the publication of Murphy (1938), which he translated into French the following year. He fell out with his mother, which contributed to his decision to settle permanently in Paris. Beckett remained in Paris following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, preferring, in his own words, [...] "France at war to Ireland at peace". His was soon a known face in and around Left Bank cafés, where he strengthened his allegiance with Joyce and forged new ones with artists Alberto Giacometti and Marcel Duchamp, with whom he regularly played chess. Sometime around December 1937, Beckett had a brief affair with Peggy Guggenheim, who nicknamed him [...] "Oblomov" [...] (after the character in Ivan Goncharov's novel).|$|E
