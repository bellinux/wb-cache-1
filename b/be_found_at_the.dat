5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it {{as a prelude to}} a search for the ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and {{came to the conclusion that}} the German accounts were true, and that the ship would <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E

Two busts of his likeness have also been commissioned. One was by Rayner Hoff, {{with whom he had}} collaborated on the design for the South Australian National War Memorial, and is kept in the offices of Woods Bagot.

5|$|Bajar Dengan Djiwa was {{screened}} {{as late as}} October 1943, but is now likely lost. Movies in the Indies {{were recorded}} on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and the film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that some Japanese propaganda films can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands Government Information Service.|$|E

5|$|Captive lemur {{populations are}} {{maintained}} locally {{and outside of}} Madagascar in many zoos, although the diversity of species is limited. Sikafas, for instance, do not survive well in captivity, so few facilities have them. The largest captive lemur population can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Duke Lemur Center (DLC), whose mission includes non-invasive research, conservation (e.g. captive breeding), and public education. Another large lemur colony the Myakka City Lemur Reserve run by the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), which also hosts lemur research. In Madagascar, Lemurs' Park is a free-range, private facility southwest of Antananarivo that exhibits lemurs for the public while also rehabilitating captive-born lemurs for reintroduction into the wild.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1925, a {{foundation}} pile and some tents could <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{site of the}} future bridge.

Similarly government debt was increasing, although it was still expected the railway line to Abbotsford Bridge would be completed. In November, construction started and it was expected that the bridge would be opened around 25 September the following year.|$|E
