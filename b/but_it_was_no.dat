5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Taft met Helen Herron (often called Nellie), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> later than 1880, when she {{mentioned}} in her diary receiving {{an invitation to a}} party from him. By 1884, they were meeting regularly, and in 1885, after an initial rejection, she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19, 1886. William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage. Nellie Taft pushed her husband much as his parents had, and she could be very frank with her criticisms. The couple had three children, of which the eldest, Robert, became a U.S. senator.|$|E
25|$|But {{just six}} months later, the UMWA called {{a halt to the}} strike. The union had disbursed more than $1 million in strike relief funds, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer financially able to keep the strike going. On July 1, 1911, the UMWA {{executive}} board voted to end to the strike. Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were blacklisted and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|In 1696, {{the legal}} {{dispute between the}} heirs of Isabel de Challant and the Challant family finally {{came to an end}} and the castle {{returned}} to the Challant family. The castle remained their property until the extinction of their house in the nineteenth century, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer inhabited and fell into ruin. The strong exterior walls held up well, but the wooden roof was removed as punishment for not paying taxes, leaving the top floor exposed to the elements.|$|E

Hikers {{continued}} to climb {{it for the}} views from the steps, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer maintained and subject to deterioration. In 1990 George Profous, a DEC forester, wrote in a draft planning document that the Red Hill tower, {{one of the five}} left in the Catskill Park along with Balsam Lake, should be dismantled as no longer in conformance with state management guidelines for Forest Preserve lands. He hoped that public opposition would emerge and save the remaining towers, which it did.|$|E
25|$|The Board of Punishments handled {{all legal}} matters, {{including}} {{the supervision of}} various law courts and prisons. The Qing legal framework was relatively weak compared to modern day legal systems, as there was no separation of executive and legislative branches of government. The legal system could be inconsistent, and, at times, arbitrary, because the emperor ruled by decree and had final say on all judicial outcomes. Emperors could (and did) overturn judgements of lower courts from time to time. Fairness of treatment was also an issue under the system of control practised by the Manchu government over the Han Chinese majority. To counter these inadequacies and keep the population in line, the Qing government maintained a very harsh penal code towards the Han populace, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> more severe than previous Chinese dynasties.|$|E
25|$|Nos. 1 and 2 Nelson Place {{were first}} leased c. 1817, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> easy task {{to raise funds}} for the other planned 21 houses in the terrace. As a result, it was decided that the terrace could be {{continued}} with smaller houses. The new design, probably the work of John Pinch the elder, had houses that were 2 windows wide, to attract middle class rather than upper class occupants. The ground floor window (which is larger than the others) and the door are offset from the upper windows. Pinch designed very similar terraces elsewhere in Bath, such as Raby Place (Bathwick Hill). Four houses (Nos. 3-6) were built in this style and completed c. 1827 and a further two houses (Nos. 7 and 8) were built slightly later and completed c. 1835. By this time the demand for town houses was dropping and no more houses were built in Nelson Place.|$|E

25|$|Because the Pill was so effective, {{and soon}} so widespread, it also {{heightened}} {{the debate about}} the moral and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E
500|$|Almost a {{year after}} its creation, Cagney Productions {{produced}} its first film, Johnny Come Lately, in 1943. While the major studios were producing patriotic war movies, Cagney was determined to continue dispelling his tough-guy image, so he produced a movie that was a [...] "complete and exhilarating exposition of the Cagney 'alter-ego' on film". According to Cagney, the film [...] "made money <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> great winner", and reviews varied from excellent (Time) to poor (New York's PM).|$|E

[...] The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates. Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, [...] "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> surprise to her. [...] She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God." ...|$|E

[...] "What about the successful announcers Harry von Zell or Westbrook Van Voorhis?"

2500|$|In France, {{prisoners were}} {{disappointed}} {{as they did}} not receive the honours they had hoped for. Their moral fight in the camps was not recognised: [...] "At Nîmes, they gave me 500 francs from my savings and a costume made from bad sheeting that they called the Clemenceau costume [...] A new life was beginning for me <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer the same thing. 25 years old, not a sou in my pocket, my health weakened by poison gas, bronchitis… In sum, I was disgusted by life". Bitterness took root. Prisoners {{were excluded from the}} Médaille militaire and the Croix de guerre. Wounded men could receive the Insigne des blessés but prisoners obtained no distinction and were also excluded from war memorials. The fact that one had been a prisoner was perceived as shameful by public opinion.|$|E

Upon their arrival at an Iranian naval base, the British said they were [...] "blindfolded, stripped of all our kit" [...] and then moved to another room where they were [...] "...subjected to random interrogation. The questions were aggressive and the handling rough, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> worse than that". The next morning they were flown to Tehran and subsequently taken to a prison. Here, the British sailors said [...] "the atmosphere changed completely".|$|E

Radio Times heavily praised the episode, awarding it a perfect 5/5.

If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It’s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say “Subtract income tax from pay” instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.”“ ...|$|E
