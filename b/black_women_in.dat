In 1941, an archive committee {{was formed to}} design a plan for collecting works about the achievements of African-American women. Though their plans focused primarily on written records and professional accomplishment and would thus reflect middle-class life, the committee initiated work on collecting historical records of <b>black</b> <b>women.</b> <b>In</b> 1944, Thurman became the committee's chair and her mother donated $1,000 toward creating the National Council of Negro Women's National Library, Archives, and Museum. On June 30, 1946, they held an archive drive, printing notices in newsletters and asking ministers, organizations, librarians and others to help them acquire photographs, books and mementos. They opened the first facility of the library at {{what is now the}} Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site.|$|E

25|$|Black female {{artists such}} as Queen Latifah, Missy Elliott, and MC Lyte have made great strides since the hip hop {{industry}} first began. By producing music and an image that did not cater to the hyper-sexualized stereotypes of <b>black</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> hip hop, these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of <b>black</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> hip hop. Though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists, many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative. These artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression. In this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates women's struggle.|$|E

40|$|Paule Marshall {{has charged}} that the {{portrayal}} of the <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> literature has been limited to stereotypes and fantasy figures, and that the writers of fiction have not presented the <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> as a complex and credible character. In her challenge to black writers to create such complex characters, Paule Marshall cites her own works as exemplary models of how the <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> should be portrayed. A careful examination of the <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> as a character in Paule Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s Brown Girl, Brownstones, Soul Clap Hands and Sing and The Chosen Place, The Timeless People demonstrates that Paule Marshall provides in her fiction realistic representations of the <b>black</b> <b>woman.</b> <b>In</b> these works the <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> appears <b>in</b> a variety of plots, settings and conflicts which depicts the many dimensions of black womanhood. Paule Marshall captures {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of women struggling for survival, surmounting obstacles to realize goals, and searching for identity.

25|$|More {{women are}} living in poverty due {{to changes in the}} {{traditional}} family structure. The increase in divorce rates and single parenthood are two major contributing factors to change in the family structure. Female-headed families have the poorest economic outcomes, with economic well-being dependent on the mother’s marital status and race/ethnicity. White women generally have access to other income, through marriage or relationships with the highest income earners: white men. Whereas <b>black</b> <b>women,</b> <b>in</b> comparison to white women, are less likely to have white men as partners, and tend to have partners who earn less than white males, even when equally employed. The absence of second income-earning adults is what, in some cases,impedes the well-being of minority women and children.|$|E
25|$|Headgear {{included}} a service cap for dress and semi-dress and a field cap or bush hat worn with fatigues.

Paratroopers are issued a maroon beret, Golani brown, Givati purple, Nahal lime green, Kfir camouflage, Combat Engineers gray, navy blue for IDF Naval and dark grey for IDF Air Force personnel. Other beret colors are: black for armored corps, turquoise for artillery personnel; olive drab for infantry; grey for combat engineers. For all other army personnel, except combat units, the beret for men was green and for women, <b>black.</b> <b>Women</b> <b>in</b> the navy wore a black beret with gold insignia.

25|$|In 1892, {{journalist}} Ida B. Wells-Barnett {{was shocked}} when three friends in Memphis, Tennessee were lynched. She learned it was because their grocery store had competed successfully against a white-owned store. Outraged, Wells-Barnett began a global anti-lynching campaign that raised awareness of these murders. She also investigated lynchings and overturned the common idea that they were based on black sexual crimes, as was popularly discussed; she found lynchings were more an effort to suppress blacks who competed economically with whites, especially if they were successful. As {{a result of her}} efforts at education, <b>black</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. became active in the anti-lynching crusade, often in the form of clubs that raised money to publicize the abuses. When the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was formed in 1909, Wells became part of its multi-racial leadership and continued to be active against lynching. The NAACP began to publish lynching statistics at their office in New York City.|$|E

25|$|Several {{studies have}} found that <b>black</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. are more likely to die from breast cancer even though white {{women are more likely to}} be {{diagnosed}} with the disease. Even after diagnosis, black women are less likely to get treatment compared to white women. Scholars have advanced several theories for the disparities, including inadequate access to screening, reduced availability of the most advanced surgical and medical techniques, or some biological characteristic of the disease in the African American population. Some studies suggest that the racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes may reflect cultural biases more than biological disease differences. However, the lack of diversity in clinical trials for breast cancer treatment may contribute to these disparities, with recent research indicating that black women are more likely to have estrogen receptor negative breast cancers, which are not responsive to hormone treatments that are effective for most white women. Research is currently ongoing to define the contribution of both biological and cultural factors.|$|E
