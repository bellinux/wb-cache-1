40|$|For {{modelling}} {{the wire}} <b>bond</b> <b>process</b> {{it is essential}} to know micro- and nanomaterial processes at the interface and in the <b>bonding</b> wire. These <b>processes</b> are closely related to wire and substrate surface activation and to wire deformation in z-direction. Within the bonding time an Au 8 Al 3 intermetallic phase is grown at the interface. Its thickness is controlled by ultrasonic power. At the end of the <b>bonding</b> <b>process</b> the interface is almost completely covered by intermetallic phase. Contrary to the established assumption, after the wire <b>bond</b> <b>process</b> the 50 - 100 nm thin flash-Au-layer is an eminent part of the interface structure and the electric contact. The wire deformation is accompanied by competing hardening and softening processes inside the wedge. So the interaction of ultrasonic power and bonding force results in a translation of the wire fibre texture by dynamic recrystallisation of the AlSi 1 wedge. At the end of the wire <b>bonding</b> <b>process</b> the wedge is harder than the as-received wire but its hardness is lower than the pre-deformed and cold-worked wire before ultrasonic energy has been acting. The ultrasonic power level determines the degree of wedge softening. The higher the ultrasonic power the more the wedge is softened during the wire <b>bonding</b> <b>process.</b> At the end recommendations for the choice of the bond parameters and a model for an optimised bonding wire are given...|$|R

5000|$|Silicone: The most {{commonly}} found adhesive in optical <b>bonding</b> <b>processes</b> {{that dates back}} to the 1970s as a solution. Silicone's core properties of low conductivity and chemical reactivity, thermal stability, and ability to repel water and form watertight seals make it a common solution for optical bonding. Also, because it is a soft material, it is very feasible to rework for bonds that become damaged over time. However, debris often forms {{around the edges of the}} bonds if they are rubbed during handling. To reduce this, edges of optically bonded displays should be covered or configured so that edges are not exposed.|$|E

40|$|The balloon {{catheters}} produced by Boston Scientific are manufactured using a laser <b>bonding</b> <b>process.</b> The behaviour {{of the materials}} during this laser welding process is not very well understood. In this work a computational model of this process was created which will help predict the behaviour of the materials during bonding and will increase understanding of the laser <b>bonding</b> <b>process.</b> The two parts being bonded are cylindrical and are both made of a thermoplastic polymer called PEBAXÂ®. During the <b>bonding</b> <b>process,</b> these cylindrical parts are surrounded by a heat-shrink tubing which applies a pressure to the PEBAXÂ® parts when heated. The heat and pressure cause the PEBAXÂ® to melt and flow. Modelling the heat-shrink tubing and the melt flow during the laser welding process are key aims of this work. A thermal model of the process was created by modelling the laser absorption and heat transfer through the assembly. This was compared with previous work and validated with experimental data. The PEBAXÂ® was modelled as a viscoelastic material which transitions from relatively rigid to very compliant as it passes its melting temperature. Extensive experimental testing was performed to characterise the heat-shrink tubing. The heat-shrink tubing was modelled using two shape memory models from the literature. These two models were implemented into Abaqus FEA using two user defined material subroutines (UMATs). A thermo-mechanical finite element model of the <b>bonding</b> <b>process</b> was then created in Abaqus FEA {{and the results were}} compared with experimental data. This model captures the overall behaviour of the materials during the <b>bonding</b> <b>process,</b> providing predictions of melt flow.
