5|$|During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) {{was little}} used; no jurisdictions were <b>bailed</b> in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were <b>bailed</b> in, {{including}} 16 {{local governments and}} the states of Arkansas and New Mexico. Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it did not hold Section 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. In the months following Shelby County, courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs to bail in the states of Texas and North Carolina, and in January 2014 a federal court <b>bailed</b> in Evergreen, Alabama.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions <b>bailed</b> out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that <b>bailed</b> out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas <b>bailed</b> out after the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters {{have the ability to}} bail out. After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} to set <b>bail</b> {{and the amount}} of <b>bail</b> to set are discretionary, and the central issue regarding <b>bail</b> is insuring the defendant's future appearances in court; factors to be taken into consideration are defined in [...] In practice, <b>bail</b> amounts are typically linked to charge severity rather than risk of failure to appear in court, judges overwhelmingly rely only on cash <b>bail</b> and commercial <b>bail</b> bonds instead of other forms of <b>bail,</b> and courts rarely inquire into the defendant's financial resources to understand what amount of <b>bail</b> might be securable by them.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{consider}} {{trends in}} <b>bail</b> and remand {{prior to and}} immediately following {{the implementation of the}} <b>Bail</b> Act (2013) on 20 May 2014 and the ‘show cause’ amendments on 28 January 2015. Method: Descriptive analysis of trends in police use of <b>Bail</b> CANs, police <b>bail</b> refusal, court <b>bail</b> refusal and the remand population. Results: The NSW <b>Bail</b> Act (2013) and the ‘show cause’ amendments subsequently made to it have not increased the police or court <b>bail</b> refusal rate above the level that prevailed in the two years prior to the introduction of the Act. This is despite the <b>bail</b> refusal rate for persons charged with ‘show cause’ offences being very high. It is not known whether the ‘show cause’ amendments have increased the likelihood of <b>bail</b> refusal for offences to which they apply or whether persons charged with these offences were always highly likely to be refused <b>bail.</b> The level of agreement between police and courts in relation to <b>bail</b> refusal has increased. Following the introduction of the NSW <b>Bail</b> Act 2013, there was a sharp transient fall in the percentage of defendants refused <b>bail</b> by police and courts. The police <b>bail</b> refusal rate is now around two percentage points lower than it was in 2012 and 2013. The court <b>bail</b> refusal rate has returned to the level that prevailed in 2012 and 2013. The remand population is much higher now than it was prior to the introduction of the NSW <b>Bail</b> Act (2013). The <b>bail</b> reforms at this stage appear to have made little if any contribution to this increase. Instead, it would appear to be due to two factors: (a) a sharp increase in January 2015 in the number of <b>bail</b> breaches that resulted in <b>bail</b> refusal (not the proportion) and (b) an increase in the total number of people with court proceedings commenced against them between December 2014 and March 2015. Conclusion: The NSW <b>Bail</b> Act (2013) (as amended) does not appear at this stage to have increased the percentage of persons refused <b>bail</b> or the size of the remand population. Further monitoring and analysis will be necessary to confirm this...|$|R

5|$|On 15 September 1940, {{known as}} the Battle of Britain Day, an RAF pilot, Ray Holmes of No. 504 Squadron RAF rammed a German bomber he {{believed}} was going to bomb the Palace. Holmes {{had run out of}} ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it. Holmes <b>bailed</b> out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the Dornier Do 17 bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder <b>bailed</b> out. Its pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, landed, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. During the Dornier's descent, it somehow unloaded its bombs, one of which hit the Palace. It then crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station. The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. The British pilot became a King's Messenger after the war, and {{died at the age of}} 90 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived in}} London in early January, 1695. Upon {{his arrival in}} London, he was arrested on exaggerated charges, levied by Dudley, that he had conspired to {{withhold}} customs monies.

He was buried in London at the Church of St. Mary Woolnoth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bail</b> {{applications}} are always matters of urgency. <b>Bail</b> (or the refusal thereof) is entirely non-penal in character: Its refusal may {{not serve as}} a punishment; nor may a court fix an excessive amount or onerous conditions, {{in a bid to}} harass the accused. It is not anticipatory punishment. When considering <b>bail</b> applications, the courts should ignore improper pressure: for example, the threat that the accused will go on hunger strike if <b>bail</b> is refused, or that people opposed to <b>bail</b> will resort to illegal activity if <b>bail</b> is granted. The rules of evidence for the purpose of <b>bail</b> are relaxed.|$|R
50|$|Most bounty {{hunters are}} {{employed}} by <b>bail</b> bondsmen: the bounty hunter is usually paid about 10% {{of the total}} <b>bail</b> amount, but this commission can vary on an individual, case-by-case basis; usually depending upon the difficulty level of the assignment and the approach used to exonerate the <b>bail</b> bond. If the fugitive eludes <b>bail,</b> the bondsman, not the bounty hunter, is responsible for 100% of the total <b>bail</b> amount. This {{is a way of}} ensuring clients arrive at trial. As of 2003, bounty hunters claimed to catch 31,500 <b>bail</b> jumpers per year, about 90% of people who jump <b>bail.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the <b>bail</b> {{has been}} posted, the court must again review {{the grounds for}} <b>bail,</b> and must decide either to accept or refuse the <b>bail.</b> When {{accepting}} the <b>bail,</b> the court may also require the charged person {{to stay in the}} country.|$|R

5|$|The North Weald pair, No. 504 and 257 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Dorniers with 20 Hurricanes. One German pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe {{developed}} engine trouble and lagged {{half a mile}} behind the main bomber stream. His Dornier attracted a swarm of fighters. Eventually Ray Holmes of 504 Squadron, out of bullets, rammed the bomber. The tail came off and air pressure snapped off the outer wings short of the engines. The bomber crashed onto the forecourt of London Victoria station. During its spinning dive, the gravitational force on the Dornier caused its bombs to be released, which hit or landed near to Buckingham Palace nearby, damaging the building. Zehbe <b>bailed</b> out and landed near The Oval and was severely wounded by a civilian mob. He was rescued by the British Army but died of his wounds. Holmes' Hurricane was badly damaged, crashing near the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Holmes <b>bailed</b> out injured but survived.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} various statutory presumptions surrounding <b>bail</b> {{and the risk of}} <b>bail</b> refusal. Method: A total 37, 165 cases where defendants were either granted or refused <b>bail</b> by a Local Court were analysed to determine what impact the presumptions surrounding <b>bail</b> had on the risk of <b>bail</b> refusal. Controls included in the analysis were age; gender; Indigenous status of the defendant; number of concurrent offences; the number of prior criminal convictions; whether the offender had a previous conviction for a breach offence; the number of days between the date of first court appearance and the date of finalisation; whether the defendant had legal representation in the current case; and the plea in the current case at time of finalisation. Results: After adjusting for the effects of other factors, the risk of <b>bail</b> refusal was found to be higher for those charged with offences where there was a presumption against <b>bail</b> or where <b>bail</b> should only be granted in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The risk of <b>bail</b> was also elevated for those with a larger number of prior convictions and/or concurrent offences. Three main anomalies were noted. Firstly, nearly half of those falling into the ‘exceptional circumstance’ category were on <b>bail</b> at their final court appearance. Secondly, factors such as prior criminal record, number of concurrent offences and delay in finalising a case, exert a much stronger influence on the risk of <b>bail</b> refusal than the presumptions surrounding <b>bail.</b> Thirdly, the <b>bail</b> refusal risk was higher for those charged with offences where there was no presumption for or against <b>bail</b> than for those charged with offences involving a presumption against <b>bail.</b> Conclusion: The NSW <b>Bail</b> Act may need some simplification and clarification...|$|R

50|$|<b>Bail</b> laws {{vary from}} country to country; in the United States, <b>bail</b> {{practices}} vary by state. In some countries, granting <b>bail</b> is common.

Even for lesser crimes, <b>bail</b> will not be granted if it is deemed likely that the accused will flee, tamper with evidence, or commit the same offense before trial. <b>Bail</b> amounts may vary depending on the type and severity of crime the suspect is accused of; practices for determining <b>bail</b> amounts vary.|$|R
