In his first-class career he played in 57 matches, with a respectable 32.62 average, and which included 3 centuries and 15 fifties.|$|E
40|$|Cryptosporidiosis is an enteric {{disease of}} animals and humans that can be fatal in immunocompromised individuals. There is no known {{effective}} treatment for Cryptosporidiosis. <b>Bilbies</b> are threatened marsupials and are bred in captivity {{as part of a}} recovery program to re-introduce this species to the southwest of Western Australia. Cryptosporidium muris infection was detected in the faeces of <b>bilbies</b> at a captive breeding colony. Stress associated with a high density of <b>bilbies</b> in enclosures may have predisposed some of the <b>bilbies</b> to infection with C muris. C muris has been described in mice and was found in the faeces of one mouse trapped in the breeding enclosures. It is likely the <b>bilbies</b> acquired the infection from mice by faecal contamination of food and water. The infection cleared within 2 months from some <b>bilbies,</b> however others remained infected for 6 months and treatment was attempted with dimetridazole. Subsequently the parasite was no longer be detectable in the faeces...|$|R

5000|$|In captivity, <b>bilbies</b> {{typically}} {{live for}} at least five years with some specimens reaching ten years of age. However, wild caught <b>bilbies</b> tend to be less than 12 months old. [...] Females become reproductively active at six months of age and can breed all year round if conditions are favourable.|$|R
25|$|As a Test opener, <b>Bilby</b> {{was fairly}} unspectacular, making 28 and 3 {{in the first}} Test and 3 and 21 in the second, giving himself a career batting average of 13.75. He was caught behind in three of those {{dismissals}} and caught once. He took three catches in those matches also.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bilby</b> {{made his}} full All Whites debut in a 0–4 loss to New Caledonia on 8 November 1967 and ended his {{international}} playing career with 8 A-international caps and 1 goal to his credit, his final cap a substitute appearance in a 2–4 loss, also to New Caledonia, on 18 July 1971.|$|E
25|$|The Nocturnal House is {{designed}} {{in a circular}} viewing layout that lets visitors circumnavigate the Australian mainland while viewing nocturnal animals under simulated moonlight. Vertebrates in this building include <b>bilby,</b> cane toad, chuditch, dibbler, ghost bat, green tree frog, spinifex hopping mouse, squirrel glider, water rat, southern brown bandicoot, ringtail possum, feathertail glider and brush-tailed bettong. In addition, this exhibit includes some invertebrates, such as Australian tarantulas and scorpion.|$|E
40|$|Linear clearings, such as {{roads and}} tracks, are an obvious {{anthropogenic}} feature in many remote environments, even where infrastructure is sparse. Predator {{species have been}} shown to prefer moving down linear clearings, and therefore, clearings could increase predation risk for other species. We investigated whether tracks cleared for seismic surveys are preferentially used by predators and herbivores in a landscape inhabited by <b>bilbies</b> (Macrotis lagotis), a vulnerable species of conservation concern. We used a paired camera trap array to investigate the use of cleared seismic lines at four time points after clearing (1 month, 3 months, 7 months, 48 months) by six mammal species. <b>Bilbies,</b> cattle (Bos indicus/B. taurus), dingoes (Canis familiaris), feral cats (Felis catus) and agile wallabies (Macropus agilis) preferred to use seismic lines compared with adjacent undisturbed vegetation for almost all surveys, while spectacled hare wallabies (Lagorchestes conspicillatus) avoided them. <b>Bilbies</b> and agile wallabies showed similar temporal activity patterns on and off seismic lines but feral cats, dingoes and cattle used seismic lines at different times of day to control areas. We also investigated microhabitat selection by spool tracking individual <b>bilbies.</b> <b>Bilbies</b> selected a route through vegetation that was more open than surrounding vegetation. While spatial and temporal funnelling of <b>bilbies</b> and their predators (especially cats) may increase the frequency of encounter between the two, {{it is important to note}} that <b>bilbies</b> were active at significantly different times to predators both on and off seismic lines. The identified selection for seismic lines, and changes in spatial and temporal overlap between species, can be used to develop effective management strategies, to minimize potential impacts on native species...|$|R

50|$|This {{species was}} {{previously}} {{placed in the}} family Peramelidae, along with the <b>bilbies,</b> as the subfamily Chaeropodinae by McKenna and Bell (1997). However, its form is quite distinct from the Peramelidae and <b>bilbies,</b> and recent molecular evidence supports this distinction. It {{is believed to be}} the sister group of the rest of the Peramelmorphia and has been assigned to its own family Chaeropodidae.|$|R
25|$|The Easter Bunny is {{a popular}} legendary {{anthropomorphic}} Easter gift-giving character analogous to Santa Claus in American culture. Many Americans follow the tradition of coloring hard-boiled eggs and giving baskets of candy. On Easter Monday, the President of the United States holds an annual Easter egg roll on the White House lawn for young children. Since the rabbit is a pest in Australia, the Easter <b>Bilby</b> is available as an alternative. Easter eggs are a widely popular symbol of new life in Poland and other Slavic countries' folk traditions. A batik-like decorating process known as pisanka produces intricate, brilliantly-colored eggs.|$|E

500|$|While in camp in Falmouth in late November, the {{officers}} of the 29th learned that Meagher had arranged for a green Irish Brigade flag to {{be presented to the}} regiment, recognizing their role as [...] "honorary Irishmen" [...] and their bravery during the Battle of Antietam. [...] Barnes declined the gift, however. [...] According to the regimental historian, [...] "While the Colonel would have been proud to receive the flag for the regiment as a token of the respect of their Irish comrades, yet he objected to the flag being carried by the regiment, on the ground that it was not an Irish regiment." [...] Irish Brigade historians, including Joseph <b>Bilby,</b> have observed {{that there may have been}} some controversy surrounding the issue.

However, his plan proves to be a failure when one of the tigers family members throws his Doomarang to dislodge the talismans. The portal is destroyed and the talismans become scattered. Following his family's disappearance, Ty becomes the last of his kind, and a family of <b>bilbies</b> adopt him. Ty thinks that the other Tasmanian tigers are dead during his time with the <b>bilbies.</b> Years later, Ty falls into a cave by accident while playing with the <b>bilbies.</b> While there, he encounters the Bunyip elder Nandu Gilli, who informs him about his heritage and Cass' intentions to seek out the talismans again.

At 1 to 2.4 kg, the male {{is about the same}} size as a rabbit; although male animals in good condition have been known to grow up to 3.7 kg in captivity. The female is smaller, and weighs around 0.8 to 1.1 kg. <b>Bilbies</b> have an excellent sense of smell and sharp hearing. Their fur is blue-grey with patches of tan and is very soft. The tail is black and white with a distinct crest.|$|R
40|$|Case report: A captive {{breeding}} {{colony of}} 9 greater <b>bilbies</b> (Macrotis lagotis) exhibited mild upper respiratory signs and sudden deaths with 100 % mortality over a 2 -week period. Histologically, acute necrotising and erosive epithelial lesions throughout the upper respiratory system and bronchi {{were associated with}} eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. Inclusions were also present in hepatocytes and adrenocortical cells, but were not always associated with necrosis. Transmission electron microscopy of lung sections revealed nucleocapsids forming arrays within some nuclei. A pan-herpesvirus PCR yielded a 440 -bp product, with sequencing confirming homology with the alphaherpesviruses. Viral culture in a marsupial cell line resulted in cytopathic effect consistent with an alphaherpesvirus.
