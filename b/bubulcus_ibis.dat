5|$|The Noronha skink {{probably}} lacked predators before Fernando de Noronha {{was discovered}} by humans, but several species that arrived since do prey on it, most commonly the cat (Felis catus) and cattle egret (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis).</b> These may negatively affect skink abundance at some localities on the island. The Argentine black and white tegu lizard, Tupinambis merianae, and three introduced rodents, the house mouse (Mus musculus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), have also been observed to eat Noronha skinks, but the rodents, particularly the house mouse, may have been scavenging on already dead skinks.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis)</b> is a {{cosmopolitan}} species of heron (family Ardeidae) {{found in the}} tropics, subtropics and warm temperate zones. It is {{the only member of}} the monotypic genus Bubulcus, although some authorities regard two of its subspecies as full species, the western cattle egret and the eastern cattle egret. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus Egretta, it is more closely related to the herons of Ardea. Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world in the last century.|$|E
25|$|The island hosts {{introduced}} {{bird species}} from many regions, including cattle egrets (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis),</b> Indian barred ground dove, {{also called the}} zebra dove (Geopelia striata), turtle dove (Nesoenas picturata), Indian mynah (Acridotheres tristis), Madagascar fody (Foudia madagascariensis), and chickens (Gallus gallus).|$|E
25|$|Seychelles hosts some of {{the largest}} seabird colonies in the world, notably on the outer islands of Aldabra and Cosmoledo. In {{granitic}} Seychelles the largest colonies are on Aride Island including the world's largest numbers of two species. Sooty terns also breed on the islands. Other birds include Cattle egrets (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis)</b> and Fairy terns (Gygis alba).|$|E
25|$|Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area {{provides}} {{habitat and}} breeding grounds for over 180 native and migratory bird species {{that use the}} wetlands all year round or on their annual migratory journeys. Research linking bird distributions to changing ecological conditions show that bird behaviour is an important biological indicator of change. Populations of Cattle Egret (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis),</b> Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Black-headed Ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus) species have shown to correlate with average temperatures, relative humidity and total rainfall.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of bird species around the lake. These include African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer), {{malachite}} kingfishers (Alcedo cristata), pied kingfishers (Ceryle rudis), swamp flycatchers (Muscicapa aquatica), village weavers (Ploceus cucullatus), [...] speckled mousebirds (Colius striatus), black-lored (Turdoides melanops) and arrow-marked (T. jardineii) babblers, African paradise-flycatchers (Terpsiphone viridis), scarlet-chested (Nectarinia senegalensis), bronze (N. kilimensis) and green-headed (N. verticalis) sunbirds, yellow-fronted canaries (Serinus mozambicus), green-winged pytilias (Pytilia melba), great (Phalacrocorax carbo) and white-breasted (P. lucidus) cormorants, openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus) and yellow-billed (Mycteria ibis) storks and cattle egrets (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis).</b> There is also a pair of semi-domesticated grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum) at the Jambo Beach resort in Gahini.|$|E
2500|$|The Weeping Paperbark (Melaleuca leucadendron) and the White Samet (Melaleuca cajuputi) species {{bordering}} {{both ends}} of the reserve represent the largest Melaleuca habitat in Thailand. These flood tolerant trees provide protective breeding grounds throughout the year for common native waterbird species such as the Little Cormorant (Phalocrocorax niger) and Purple Heron (Ardea purpurea), as well as other common avian species with annual breeding cycles including the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta), the Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and the Cattle Egret (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis).</b> The thick foliage of the Melaleuca forests also provides night roosting areas for migratory bird species from April to July, such as the Black-headed Ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus), an IUCN Near Threatened species.|$|E

Other known predators include the glossy watersnakes (Regina rigida), the eastern cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), and the cattle egret (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis).</b> This particular toad species avoids predators by burrowing, seeking cover, and/or nocturnal activity patterns. Chemically, they are also capable of producing mucus that produces a violent burning sensation and irritates membranes. The toxins secreted from their skin deter predators, but they also {{plays a role in}} inhibiting ant attacks when individuals forage near ant mounds.|$|E

The Argentine black and white tegu lizard, Tupinambis merianae, and three introduced rodents, the house mouse (Mus musculus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), have also been observed to eat Noronha skinks, but the rodents, particularly the house mouse, may have been scavenging on already dead skinks.|$|E
