5|$|The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called meninges. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close to the <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of the cortex.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened <b>basement</b> <b>membrane,</b> the dermis. Next to the dermis {{are at least three}} layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Affinity-purified rabbit {{antibodies}} specific for {{two large}} noncollagenous glycoproteinslaminin and fibronectin-were {{used to study}} the distribution of these proteins in normal murine kidneys. Immunofluorescence staining of conventional frozen sections demonstrates fibronectin within mesangial areas of the glomerulus. Laminin {{is also found in}} mesangial areas. However, it also appears to be distributed in typical basement membranelike patterns on glomerular and tubular <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> and Bowman's capsule. At the ultrastructural level, by labeling 600 - 800 -Á thick frozen sections with a three-stage procedure consisting of specific antibodies, biotinyl sheep antirabbit IgG, and avidin-ferritin conjugates, fibronectin is present only in the mesangial matrix and is specifically localized to areas immediately surrounding mesangial cell processes. Laminin, on the other hand, is found uniformly distributed throughout tubular <b>basement</b> <b>membranes,</b> the mesangial matrix, and Bowman's capsule. In glomerular <b>basement</b> <b>membranes,</b> laminin labeling is restricted to the lamina rara interna and adjacent regions of the lamina densa. <b>Basement</b> <b>membranes</b> are complex structures containing collagenous and noncollagenous glycoproteins and proteoglycans.

5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the <b>basement</b> <b>membrane,</b> the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its {{neighbours}} in the halogen column (chlorine and iodine), bromine is {{not known}} to have a confirmed biological role in humans. A single 2014 study suggests {{that it may be}} a necessary catalyst to make collagen IV, making it essential to <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> architecture and tissue development, but these findings have not been confirmed and the precise role posited for bromine is not certain. Aside from this, only circumstantial evidence in the form of hypothesised deprivation symptoms exists for a trace role for bromine. Nevertheless, even if bromine is not an essential element, it can be pharmacologically beneficial. For example, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, formed by the eosinophil, and either chloride or bromide ions, eosinophil peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular parasites (such as, for example, the nematode worms involved in filariasis) and some bacteria (such as tuberculosis bacteria). Eosinophil peroxidase is a haloperoxidase that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating hypobromite (hypobromous acid), although the use of chloride is possible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An active {{involvement}} of blood–brain barrier endothelial cell <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> in development of inflammatory lesions {{in the central}} nervous system (CNS) has not been considered to date. Here we investigated the molecular composition and possible function of the extracellular matrix encountered by extravasating T lymphocytes during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Endothelial <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> contained laminin 8 (� 4 � 1 � 1) and/or 10 (� 5 � 1 � 1) and their expression was influenced by proinflammatory cytokines or angiostatic agents. T cells emigrating into the CNS during EAE encountered two biochemically distinct <b>basement</b> <b>membranes,</b> the endothelial (containing laminins 8 and 10) and the parenchymal (containing laminins 1 and 2) <b>basement</b> <b>membranes.</b> However, inflammatory cuffs occurred exclusively around endothelial <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> containing laminin 8, whereas in the presence of laminin 10 no infiltration was detectable. In vitro assays using encephalitogenic T cell lines revealed adhesion to laminins 8 and 10, whereas binding to laminins 1 and 2 could not be induced. Downregulation of integrin � 6 on cerebral endothelium at sites of T cell infiltration, plus a high turnover of laminin 8 at these sites, suggested two possible roles for laminin 8 in the endothelial basement membrane: one {{at the level of the}} endothelial cells resulting in reduced adhesion and, thereby, increased penetrability of the monolayer; and secondly at the level of the T cells providing direct signals to the transmigrating cells.
