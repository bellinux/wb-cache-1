50|$|While in London, Breuer was {{employed}} by Jack Pritchard at the Isokon company; {{one of the}} earliest proponents of modern design in the United Kingdom. Breuer designed his Long Chair as well as experimenting with <b>bent</b> and formed <b>plywood.</b> Between 1935 and 1937 he worked in practice with the English Modernist F. R. S. Yorke with whom he designed a number of houses.|$|R
50|$|The Hornet was {{originally}} designed by Holt for inexpensive homebuilding using marine <b>plywood</b> <b>bent</b> over a simple frame, {{along the lines}} of his popular 14 foot GP14 design. During the 1960s composite and GRP boats were supplied by various builders, such as Doe, Baker, Dingwall, etc. but, due to large flat panels of GRP being more flexible (or heavier) than marine ply, those were generally not always competitive with the best wooden boats from the likes of Rigden, Gibbens, Cory et al.|$|R
2500|$|A chined hull {{consists}} of straight, smooth, tall, long, or short plates, timbers or sheets of ply, which are set {{at an angle}} to each other when viewed in transverse section. The traditional chined hull is a simple hull shape because it works with only straight planks bent into a curve. These boards are often <b>bent</b> lengthwise. <b>Plywood</b> chined boats made of 8'x4' sheets have most bend along the long axis of the sheet. Only thin ply 3–6mm can easily be shaped into a compound bend. Most home-made constructed boats are chined hull boats. Mass-produced chine powerboats are usually made of sprayed chop strand fibreglass over a wooden mold. The Cajun [...] "pirogue" [...] {{is an example of a}} craft with hard chines. Benefits of this type of hull is the low production cost and the (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at planing. Sail boats with chined hull make use of a dagger board or keel.|$|R

5000|$|Side by {{side with}} these rather {{advanced}} experiments, Jalk developed many simple sets of furniture for manufacturers, including a high desk and stool, a set of shelves in Oregon pine {{and a series of}} chairs with upholstered seats and backs on a curved steel base. Her industrially produced furniture has clear, comfortable lines. The pieces are especially well suited for quick, straightforward production schedules. Economic in their use of materials, they soon became competitive, increasing Denmark's international reputation for furniture design. Firms in the United States and Finland have manufactured some of her lines. The designs she developed for modern homes included a wall-mounted storage system (1961), a living-room set with a coffee table (1962), a [...] "Watch and Listen" [...] unit (1963) with compartments for a home entertainment system to house a stero system, TV, records, tapes and speakers. A 1960s rosewood three-piece suite made EUR 6,500 and Renato Zevi’s chrome rocking chair went for EUR 1,100, double its upper estimate. [...] Best known for her furniture design, including laminated plywood furniture for manufacturer Jeppesen, such as the side chair of 1962, and tubular steel furniture for manufacturer Fritz Henses, such as the easy chair of 1964. [...] In 1963, Jalk designed a moulded teak chair that used two pieces of <b>plywood</b> <b>bent</b> into almost impossible forms. The chair was manufactured for Poul Jeppesen, a company that would help Scandinavia become renowned for fine modern furniture.|$|R

50|$|The first {{furniture}} {{to be added}} to the Isokon portfolio since 1963 was designed by the duo BarberOsgerby. Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby had recently graduated from the Royal College of Art when they designed their first piece, the Loop Table, in 1996. The iconic <b>bent</b> <b>plywood</b> design was to be the first of several furniture pieces that the designers created for Isokon Plus. The most recent is the Bodleian Chair for the University of Oxford's historic Bodleian Libraries.|$|E
50|$|The slats {{that were}} set shallowly {{into the side}} element {{were not able to}} {{withstand}} abrupt burdens and so are replaced by perforated three-dimensionally <b>bent</b> <b>plywood,</b> shaped to the contours of the body. The panels are inserted between two sidepieces. The edge pieces {{on the front of the}} seat panel and the top of the back panel are replaces by glued strips.In 1954, Model No. 56 was accepted for mass production under the name Rex 120.|$|E
50|$|With the {{positive}} response at the exhibition, Summers began {{to specialize in}} malleable and free-form designs. He first designed an airplane plywood which sparked {{the beginning of the}} most creative and innovative designs. He became known for his <b>Bent</b> <b>Plywood</b> Armchair which showed off his ability of folding, bending and molding wood to achieve high standards of flexibility. Summers had the ability to transform a given wood material into a diverse, different and seamless piece of furniture with a glossy surface, combined with the modernistic touch on life.|$|E
50|$|The {{scarcity}} of materials after the Second World War encouraged {{the use of}} plywood. In the late 1940s, {{the development of new}} techniques led to the mass production of <b>bent</b> <b>plywood</b> designs by Hans Wegner and Børge Mogensen, both of whom produced chairs with a teak plywood seat and back on a beech frame. In 1951, Arne Jacobsen went even further with his sculptural Ant Chair with a one-piece plywood seat and back, bent in both directions. Collapsible chairs dating from the 1930s include Kaare Klint's Safari Chair and propeller stools which were also developed by Poul Kjærholm and Jørgen Gammelgaard.|$|E
50|$|While {{studying}} under Kaare Klint at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, he met Aksel Bender Madsen {{who became}} his partner. In 1947, they established a design studio together. The same year, they presented works made by cabinetmaker Willy Beck at the Cabinetmakers Guild's exhibition in Copenhagen where {{they continued to}} participate year after year. In addition to sculptural chair designs, they also designed living rooms, bedrooms, shelving, dining tables, and office furniture. Their most notable work is the Metropolitan Chair, in <b>bent</b> <b>plywood,</b> which was exhibited in 1949 and manufactured by Fritz Hansen from 1952. All their works have a clear, timeless, simple style which continues to please today.|$|E
5000|$|Don Charles Albinson [...] (November 22, 1921 - November 17, 2008) was an American {{industrial}} designer who made many {{contributions to the}} world of furniture. He worked with Charles and Ray Eames for 13 years, helping develop many of the seminal Herman Miller furniture pieces from the mid century - the <b>bent</b> <b>plywood</b> chair, the fiberglass shell chair, the aluminum group set, and the Eames Lounge chair, to name a few. He later developed the Knoll Stack chair, the Westinghouse office line, an update to the DoMore Series 7 landscape system named Neo 7, the Albi stack chair for Fixtures, and the Bounce chair for Stylex.|$|E

5000|$|Hardwood rims are {{commonly}} made by laminating thin, hence flexible, strips of hardwood, bending {{them to the}} desired shape immediately after the application of glue. The <b>bent</b> <b>plywood</b> system was developed by C.F. Theodore Steinway in 1880 to reduce manufacturing time and costs. Previously, the rim was constructed from several pieces of solid wood, joined and veneered, and this method continued {{to be used in}} Europe well into the 20th century. A modern exception, Bösendorfer, the Austrian manufacturer of high-quality pianos, constructs their inner rims from solid spruce, the same wood that the soundboard is made from, which is notched to allow it to bend; rather than isolating the rim from vibration, their [...] "resonance case principle" [...] allows the framework to more freely resonate with the soundboard, creating additional coloration and complexity of the overall sound.|$|E
50|$|In {{the history}} of {{industrial}} design there were multiple attempts to shape everyday objects from only one piece of semifinished industrial material like rods, tubing, wire, or sheets. There is hardly a design that better illustrates the ideal unity of material, production and form, however, than Gerald Summer's <b>Bent</b> <b>Plywood</b> Chair. The organically shaped armchair, comfortable even without cushions, involving low material and labor inputs. With its smooth surface and lack of metal connectors, it is hygienic and deteriorates only gradually. Its unusual shape probably stems from Alvar Aalto’s furniture, especially the spectacular “Paimio” chair, which was shown in London in 1933. In his own company, Makers of Simple Furniture, Ltd., founded in 1929, Summers produced only 120 units of the chair. Despite the constructive advantages, the production costs {{of the chair and}} thus the sales price were higher than the designs of the popular Scandinavian. It was certainly also a disadvantage that the back legs could not withstand great stress and snapped easily.|$|E
50|$|Whereas Aalto {{was famous}} for his architecture, his {{furniture}} designs were well thought of and are still popular today. He studied Josef Hoffmann and the Wiener Werkstätte, and {{for a period of}} time, worked under Eliel Saarinen. He also gained inspiration from Gebrüder Thonet. During the late 1920s and 1930s he, working closely with Aino Aalto, also focused a lot of his energy on furniture design, partly due to the decision to design much of the individual furniture pieces and lamps for the Paimio Sanatorium. Of particular significance was the experimentation in <b>bent</b> <b>plywood</b> chairs, most notably the so-called Paimio chair, which had been designed for the sitting tuberculosis patient. The Aaltos, together with visual arts promoter Maire Gullichsen and art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the Artek company in 1935, ostensibly to sell Aalto products but also other imported products. He became the first furniture designer to use the cantilever principle in chair design using wood.|$|E
5000|$|From 1942, he {{designed}} his own models which he {{exhibited at the}} annual Cabinetmakers Guild's exhibitions in Copenhagen. While studying at the Academy, he met Ejner Larsen who became his partner. In 1947, they established a design studio together. The same year, they presented works made by cabinetmaker Willy Beck at the Cabinetmakers Guild's exhibition in Copenhagen where they continued to participate year after year, working with Beck {{for a total of}} 25 years. In addition to sculptural chair designs, they also designed living rooms, bedrooms, shelving, dining tables, and office furniture. Their most notable work is the Metropolitan Chair, in <b>bent</b> <b>plywood,</b> which was exhibited in 1949 and manufactured by Fritz Hansen from 1952. All their works have a clear, timeless, simple style which continues to please today.

The requirements made set the design." ...|$|E
40|$|What {{will be the}} {{fundamental}} aspect and concern of today's good design? As global energy reserves deplete over the coming decades, a strategy of reduced consumption will be essential {{to the production of}} furniture and architecture, alike. A lightweight design strategy is a way for designers to participate in reducing the environmental footprint of everyday objects. We are witnessing a Paradigm shift in design and the decorative arts of a magnitude not seen since the Modernist movement in the early 20 th century. A design style embraces the combination of sustainability with building production. Today we recognizes that our resources are finite and that careful consideration should be given to the building process. Since ecological concern of materials become one of the foremost issues of today's building industry, For this project, I developed a lightweight and low-cost framing system that is collapsible and easy to assemble. My goal is to create compelling designs in the hope they will inspire people to choose sustainable design over safer and more traditional designs. Making building from thin <b>bent</b> <b>plywood</b> yields 9 - 10 times more usable wood from a log than making a building from hardwood lumber During the production of plywood, only 15 percent of the wood from a log is lost to waste. On the other hand, the average waste it takes to make a finished solid wood frame building is 1. 5 times more wood than is used in the building itself! <b>Bent</b> <b>plywood</b> has been utilized by a mere handful of designer, most notably Alvar Aalto and Charles and Ray Eames, but the application of this material remained in furniture scale. (cont.) Since the creative potential of this material is still largely unexplored. My motivation is to extend the application of this very particular thin material-plywood. by Edmund King Yip Kwong.

They were differentiated from tea shops by their style and materials as well as by their equipment, food, drinks and service.
