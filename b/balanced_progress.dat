These methods adjust the penalty parameter dynamically; by controlling the degree of linear feasibility achieved at every iteration, they promote <b>balanced</b> <b>progress</b> toward optimality and feasibility. In contrast with classical approaches, the choice of the penalty parameter ceases to be a heuristic and is determined, instead, by a subproblem with clearly defined objectives.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{productivity of}} sows {{increases the risk}} of a more pronounced negative energy balance during lactation. One possibility to prevent this is to increase the lactation efficiency (LE) genetically and thereby increase milk output for a given feed intake and mobilization of body tissue. The benefits of selection for LE depend on its heritability and the relationships with other traits of interest. The objectives of this study were to estimate genetic parameters for LE, its underlying traits, and to predict the consequences of current selection strategies in dam lines. Data from 4 farms were available to estimate genetic parameters. Heritabilities were estimated by using a univariate repeatability model, and genetic correlations were estimated bivariately. Selection index theory was used to predict the genetic progress by 3 alternative breeding programs: 1) a breeding program that aimed at <b>balanced</b> <b>progress</b> in the total number of piglets born, piglet mortality, and percent prolonged interval from weaning to estrus; 2) extension of this breeding goal with LE; and 3) a breeding goal that included only one selection criterion, litter weight gain, to demonstrate the effect of indirect selection for milk production. The heritability for LE was low (0. 12). Body fat mass (0. 52) and BW (0. 45) of sows at the beginning of lactation showed the greatest heritabilities. Protein mass at the beginning of lactation, protein loss, weight loss, and ad libitum feed intake during lactation showed moderate heritabilities (0. 39, 0. 21, 0. 20, and 0. 30, respectively). Low to moderate heritabilities were found for litter weight at birth, within-litter SD in the birth weight of piglets, litter weight gain, fat loss, and restricted feed intake during lactation (0. 19, 0. 09, 0. 18, 0. 05, and 0. 14, respectively). Within-litter SD in the weaning weight of piglets showed no genetic variability. It was predicted that a breeding goal for dam lines with an emphasis on the total number of piglets born, piglet mortality, and percent prolonged interval from weaning to estrus would not dramatically change BW or body composition at the beginning of lactation, or mobilization of body tissue and feed intake during lactation. Inclusion of LE in the breeding goal will improve stayability, as defined by the first-litter survival of sows and LE itself, without negative consequences for other economically important traits. Nevertheless, it might be worthwhile to design a breeding goal in which LE increases and feed intake remains unchanged...|$|E

40|$|To {{design an}} {{efficient}} event scheduling strategy for Time Warp on distributed systems, we study two major factors. The first {{factor is the}} amount of computation to be processed in a processor between two consecutive communication points. The computation granularity nlust be small enough to prevent Time Warp from progressing events over-optimistically, while large enough to minimize the degrading effects of performance due to the communication overhead. The second factor is the <b>balancing</b> <b>progress</b> of logical processes in a processor. Within the range of the given computation granularity, logical processes assigned to a processor progress at different speeds and this may cause more rollback situations. Considering these two factors, we propose two event scheduling schemes: the <b>Balancing</b> <b>Progress</b> by Execution Chance (BPECj scheme and the <b>Balancing</b> <b>Progress</b> by 'Virtual Time Window (BPVTW) scheme. The BPEC scheme controls the progress of a process by limiting the number of chances for the process to schedule events, while the BPVTW scheme controls the progress by using a virtual time window, which allows events to be executed only if their timestamps are within the interval of the virtual time window. We have performed experiments on a cluster of DEC Alpha workstations to demonstrate the performances of both schemes. ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{architectural}} {{trends of}} rising on-chip core counts and worsening power-performance penalties of off-chip memory accesses {{have made the}} shared last-level caches (LLC) {{one of the major}} determinants of multicore performance. In this thesis, I propose and explore hardware and software techniques for improving the performance of shared LLCs for parallel applications running on multicores. ^ This thesis has two key contributions. First, I propose a hardware-only way-partitioning policy to improve shared LLC performance for symmetric multithreaded programs running on multicores. Unlike prior work on way-partitioning for unrelated threads in a multiprogramming workload, the domain of multithreaded programs requires both throughput and fairness. Additionally, the workloads show no obvious thread differences to exploit: program threads see nearly identical IPC and data reuse as they progress (as expected for a well-written load-balanced data-parallel program). Despite the balance and symmetry among threads, I show that a balanced partitioning of cache ways between threads is suboptimal. Instead, I propose a strategy of temporarily imbalancing the partitions between different threads to improve cache utilization by adapting to the locality behavior of the threads as captured by dynamic set-specific reuse-distance (SSRD). Cumulative SSRD histograms have knees that correspond to different important working sets; thus, cache ways can be taken away from a thread with only minimal performance impact if that thread is currently operating far from a knee. Those ways can then be given to a single “preferred” thread to push it over the next knee. The preferred thread is chosen in a round-robin fashion to ensure <b>balanced</b> <b>progress</b> over the execution. The proposed algorithm also effectively handles scenarios where an unpartitioned cache might outperform any sort of explicit partitioning. This dynamic partition imbalance algorithm allows up to 44 % reduction in execution time and 91 % reduction in misses over an unpartitioned shared cache for symmetric multithreaded applications from the PARSEC- 2. 0 and SPEC OMP suites. ^ Second, I develop a hardware-software technique for shared LLC management for task-parallel programs. Task-parallel programming models with input annotation-based concurrency extraction at runtime present a promising paradigm for writing parallel programs for today’s multi or many-core heterogeneous systems. Through management of dependencies, data-movements, task assignments, and orchestration, these models markedly simplify the programming effort for parallelization while exposing higher levels of concurrency. In addition, the use of a runtime platform enables innovations in the hardware-software interface that allows the hardware to be highly responsive to the characteristics of the application and vice versa. ^ I show that, for task-parallel applications running on multicores with a shared last-level cache (LLC), the concurrency extraction framework can be used to substantially improve the efficiency of the shared LLC. I develop a task-based cache partitioning technique that leverages the dependence tracking and look-ahead capabilities of the runtime. Based on the input annotations for future tasks, the runtime instructs the hardware to prioritize data blocks with future reuse and evict blocks with no future reuse. These instructions allow the hardware to preserve all the blocks for a subset of the future tasks and evict dead blocks early. This leads to a considerable improvement in cache efficiency over what is achieved by existing thread-centric cache management policies. Thread-centric cache management policies fail to track the complex patterns of data-reuse among tasks that can be assigned to arbitrary cores and hence replace blocks for all future tasks resulting in poor overall hit-rates. The proposed hardware-software technique leads to a mean improvement of 18 % in application performance and a mean reduction of 26 % in misses over an LRU-replacement based LLC for a set of input-annotated task-parallel programs using the OmpSs programming model implemented on the NANOS++ runtime. In contrast, the state-of-the-art thread-based partitioning scheme (proposed in the first part) suffers an average performance loss of 2 % and an average increase of 15 % in misses over the baseline. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} virtual reality {{applications}} in rehabilitation and telerehabilitation medicine is increasing. Unfortunately, without telediagnostics, telerehabilitation requires frequent outpatient clinical testing. This study thus proposes a diagnostic tool for virtual-reality-supported balance training for estimating functional <b>balance</b> <b>progress</b> during telerehabilitation using objective parameters. Four weeks of physiotherapy with assessment {{before and after the}} therapy and a follow up 2 weeks after therapy were carried out with 10 sub-acute stroke subjects. Goal-based tasks for standing-frame-supported balance training were designed in a virtual environment. An accelerometer-based tilt sensor not mounted on the subjects was used. The telediagnostics apply the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to movement data and the task time and number of errors committed are analyzed. Additionally the functional progress was estimated with clinical tests (Berg Balance Scale, 10 -m walk test, Timed Up & Go test) and correlations with objective data were examined. The area under the FFT curve demonstrated balance improvement and had a moderate correlation with clinical tests, considering that all parameters showed improvement for each individual patient. The proposed tool enables the remote evaluation of the effects of virtual-reality-supported balance training. The tool may decrease the number of outpatient visits and enable the continuation of the rehabilitation process at home. However, to confirm the clinical reliability and practical value of the proposed tool, a further study with a large stroke population and healthcare business models are needed...|$|R

There was no increase in the incidence of isolates from pigs 12 days after weaning when the lesions of necrotic ear syndrome first developed, nor was there any correlation between the carrier status for S. hyicus and the likelihood of developing lesions. ^ The lesions, covered by thin scabs or thick brown crusts, developed nonrandomly as localized dermatitis at areas of trauma due to biting at the base or tip of the ear. S. hyicus along with large numbers of (beta) -hemolytic streptococci were consistently recovered from the lesions in pigs from five different swine herds. Fifty percent of the lesions healed and the <b>balance</b> <b>progressed</b> to severe necrotic ulcers. Deep ulceration developed secondarily to local cellulitis, vasculitis, thrombosis and ischemia of the auricular tissue. Initiation of the lesions depended on biting to damage the skin, but the progression to deep ulcers depended not on cannibalism but probably on local bacterial infection of the site. Histologic examination revealed numerous bacteria over the surface of ulcers, and streptococci deep in subcuticular abscesses. ^ A localized encrusted lesion, similar to the early crusted lesions of necrotic ear syndrome produced by the inoculation of S. hyicus - Sompolinsky and (beta) -hemolytic streptococci onto a local area of trauma, did not become deeply ulcerated and necrotic.

To investigate this issue, we examined whether the monitoring of personal finances is influenced by peoples’ perceptions of their progress toward financial goals and their regulatory focus (i. e. whether the goal involves attaining a positive outcome or avoiding a negative outcome). Study 1 examined how often participants logged into their online bank accounts to check their balance {{and found that the}} worse they perceived their progress toward their most important financial goal to be, the more often they checked. In Studies 2 and 3 we developed a simulation of personal financial management in which participants were given financial goals that involved attaining a positive outcome and avoiding a negative outcome. Goal progress was manipulated via the balance in participants’ account {{at the start of the}} simulation (Studies 2 and 3) and the rate at which their balance increased (Study 3). Participants in Study 2 checked their balance more often when they perceived their progress toward financial goals to be poor and when they considered avoiding the negative outcome to be important. In Study 3, the frequency with which participants checked their balance was influenced by an interaction between goal progress, the regulatory focus of the goal, and the importance of the goal. Participants who felt that gaining money was relatively important were more likely to check their <b>balance</b> when their <b>progress</b> was good, whereas participants who felt that avoiding losing money was relatively important were more likely to check their <b>balance</b> when <b>progress</b> was both good and bad.
