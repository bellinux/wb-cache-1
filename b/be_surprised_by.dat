Large birds of prey, such as northern goshawks, will take ducks from the ground, and some falcons, including the gyrfalcon, have the speed and power to catch flying birds.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, British {{warships}} bombarded Dar es Salaam {{and destroyed}} the German wireless station there. By this time, Königsbergs engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff {{needed to find}} a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the Rufiji Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the survey ship Möwe. On 3 September 1914 at high tide, Königsberg passed over {{the bar at the}} mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed {{at the mouth of the}} river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> British ships searching for them. Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply Königsberg, observed a British cruiser—Pegasus—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885.|$|E

5|$|Jonne Valtonen and Roger Wanamo, the arrangers for the Symphonic Fantasies and Symphonic Legends concerts, {{returned}} {{as the lead}} arrangers for the concert. Additional arrangements were made by Jani Laaksonen and Masashi Hamauzu, and Mikko Laine served as the lyricist for the choral components of the concert. Uematsu {{was not involved in}} any aspect of the production, even song selection, as he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the result. The style of arrangements followed {{in the tradition of the}} shows preceding Symphonic Odysseys, featuring a number of rich, sophisticated suites structured for melodic storytelling. A focus was put on presenting a balanced mix of fan favorites as well as lesser known material that was not commonly performed in orchestra concerts based on video game music. Böcker styled the concert to be a mix of Shades and Fantasies, in that there was a mix of shorter pieces with longer suites. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were the Final Fantasy series, King's Knight, Chrono Trigger, the SaGa series, The Last Story, Blue Dragon, and Lost Odyssey. Additionally, Uematsu composed an original fanfare to open the concert, which was arranged by Jonne Valtonen.|$|E

However, Phoumi still had access to a training battalion stationed outside Vientiane; on 4 August 1964, he ordered them into an attempted coup.

25|$|Promoter Vladimir Hryunov won {{the right}} to promote the fight with a purse bid of $23,333,330 and Russian {{businessman}} Andrey Ryabinsky putting up the money.

It allowed Ryabinsky to dictate the location of the fight and guaranteed the fighters the biggest purses of their careers. Based on being entitled to 75 percent of the winning bid, Klitschko got $17,499,997, while Povetkin received $5,833,333.

25|$|One of his {{trademarks}} {{was the use}} of {{two different}} bouncers. One was delivered at a slower pace and was often dealt with quite easily by the batsman. However, this was a ploy by Roberts to lull the batsman into a false sense of security. Roberts would then deliver the second bouncer, pitching in a similar spot to the first, but delivered at far greater pace. The batsman would attempt to play this delivery in the same fashion as the first slower bouncer only to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the extra pace and bounce of the ball. Many batsmen were dismissed, and many more struck painful blows, by Roberts using this ploy.|$|E

When the two arrive together at a restaurant, Beth is shocked when he removes his scarf, revealing a pair of testicles dangling from his neck. Over dinner it confuses her that Davis fails to acknowledge his anatomical abnormality, and that nobody seems to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> it. When two friends of Davis (Roy Jenkins and Katie Finneran) come by, one of them convinces him to give Beth a kiss. Davis agrees, but when he kisses her, his neck-testicles are dangling near Beth's mouth, causing her to scream and budge out of the kiss.|$|E
25|$|In 502, the Anastasian War with Sassanid Persia broke out. Thus in 503, {{along with}} Hypatius and Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus, Patricius was sent east to {{campaign}} against the Persians. He invaded the Persian province of Arzanene, sacking various forts and taking prisoners, before returning to encamp join forces with Hypatius. While Areobindus was detailed to keep watch at the Persian stronghold of Nisibis and the army of Shah Kavadh I (r. 488–531) from Dara, Patricius and Hypatius, with the main force of 40,000 men (an enormous army for the time), were tasked with the recapture of Amida. Although the siege of Amida proved fruitless, together they won a skirmish against some Hephthalite Huns. Their success, however, made them careless allowing them to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the main Persian army under Kavadh. Defeated, they retreated across the Euphrates to Samosata. In the aftermath of this, Hypatius was recalled, but Patricius stayed on.|$|E

Li Guoxing, the second person in history to have received a facial transplant, was a victim of a black bear attack. Nine people were killed by black bears in Japan between 1979–1989, and more recently, in September 2009 it was reported that a black bear attacked a group of tourists, seriously injuring four, while they were waiting at a bus station in the built-up area of Takayama, Gifu in central Japan. The majority of attacks tend to occur when black bears are encountered suddenly, and in close quarters. Because of this, black bears are generally considered more dangerous than sympatric brown bears, which live in more open spaces and are thus less likely to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> approaching humans.

500|$|The {{film was}} shot in British Columbia and Ontario, on a budget of $5 million. Funding came from the company Alliance Communications. Egoyan {{assembled}} many Canadian actors he had worked with in prior films, including Bruce Greenwood, Gabrielle Rose and Sarah Polley. Egoyan explained the benefit of working with a familiar cast, saying [...] "When you’re working on a limited production schedule, it’s a comfort {{to know that you}} know the personalities involved, you know what they need as opposed to having to discover that and <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> that." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Radar" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Britney Spears for her fifth studio album, Blackout (2007). It was written and produced by Bloodshy & Avant and The Clutch, with additional writing from Henrik Jonback, as a record that did not relate to any of her personal problems at the time. The recording sessions took place the day after Spears filed for divorce from Kevin Federline, and members of The Clutch claimed to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> her work ethic. [...] "Radar" [...] was originally planned to be released as the third single from Blackout, but [...] "Break the Ice" [...] was chosen instead. The song was then planned as the fourth single, but the release was cancelled as Spears began recording her sixth studio album, Circus (2008).

500|$|In January 1980, the {{producers}} and writers began plotting the culminating episodes for season 3. Executive producer Philip Capice says {{they decided to}} attempt {{to work in a}} ploy to hold interest over the summer. CBS ordered two extra episodes, which gave them a chance to weave many storylines into the scripts. He noted that [...] "J.R. had developed into a character we felt everyone out there wanted to see get his comeuppance. And we did need that sort of a cliffhanger to carry us over to the new season." [...] He said that there was consensus that a mystery with several suspects was optimal and that it should be a sudden event. Capice denied rumors that the shooting was a ploy to make it easy to write Hagman out of the script if his contract negotiations became too difficult. Producer Leonard Katzman, executive story consultant Art Lewis and story editor Camille Marchetta decided the actual culprit in mid-March by process of logical elimination with the belief that the audience should not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> someone who was not important to the show as the shooter.|$|E
500|$|His {{next film}} roles, in 1998, were Kissing a Fool, Six Days, Seven Nights, and Apt Pupil. In Kissing a Fool, a romantic comedy, Schwimmer played Max, a dapper, smart-mouthed ladies' man. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Fans of the sitcom Friends may <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> David Schwimmer in Kissing a Fool. [...] Take it {{from someone who}} has never seen Friends and comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions: He does just fine. As a TV sports {{reporter}} in Kissing a Fool, he oozes the command and self-satisfaction of a young, successful man". The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. In Six Days, Seven Nights, he played the boyfriend of Anne Heche's character. In Apt Pupil, adapted from a novella {{of the same name}} by Stephen King, he had a supporting role as a school guidance counselor. [...] "I was scared of the part", Schwimmer said, [...] "but I {{wanted to be part of}} the movie". At the time, he noted it was a [...] "little frustrating" [...] that people would typecast him due to his role on Friends. He subsequently appeared opposite Woody Allen and Sharon Stone in Alfonso Arau's straight-to-cable comedy Picking Up the Pieces (2000).|$|E
