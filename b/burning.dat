5|$|<b>Burning</b> Rangers is a third-person shooter game {{in which}} players {{complete}} missions involving extinguishing fires and rescuing civilians. The game {{is set in a}} futuristic society in which fire is the only danger, and stars an elite group of firefighters, the <b>Burning</b> Rangers. The player assumes control of one of two apprentice rangers, and completes tasks across the game's four levels. The primary objective is to transport stranded civilians from <b>burning</b> buildings, by collecting energy crystals dropped from extinguished fires. A minimum of five crystals are needed to transport a civilian to safety; the player receives an energy shield if they use ten. The crystals function similarly to rings in Sonic the Hedgehog games: possessing at least one crystal allows a player to survive damage from an enemy or fire. Being hit once scatters the player's crystals and renders them vulnerable to death.|$|E
