50|$|Humans {{who deal}} with the species caught in mist nets are called <b>banders</b> in the United States. <b>Banders</b> are {{responsible}} for banding the species caught in the net {{so they can be}} tracked. In the United States, in order to band a bird or bat, one must have a banding permit. Banding permits are given to people who have gone through training and whose projects contribute to the conservation and management of the bird population. <b>Banders</b> are responsible for the animals caught and thus apply their training by paying attention to stress cues (for birds these include panting, tiredness, closing of eyes, and raising of feathers). If not, the animal can severely injure itself. There are different types of banding permits for birds, the Master Permit and the Sub permit. Master Permits are given to individuals who band on their own or who supervise banding operations. Sub permits are given to individuals who will be supervised while banding by a person with a Master Permit. In order to receive a permit, one must fill out an application and return it to the nearest banding office. <b>Banders</b> must ask for special authorization in their application in order to use mist nets, cannon nets, chemicals, or auxiliary markers (North American <b>Bander’s</b> Study Guide 6).|$|R
25|$|The first {{success in}} this Anglo-Italian {{cooperation}} came in December 1910. In that month, the British Warsangali and the Italian Mijertain peacefully resolved all their outstanding disputes and, convening in <b>Bander</b> Kasim, agreed to act jointly in combating Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and his Dervishes. The Mijertain–Warsangali Accord led to a common offensive against the Mullah, whose forces were cut off from arms and munitions smuggled in from the coast. (Hess, 427) In 1920, the Dervishes unexpectedly captured Badhan and besieged Las Khorey. The British Governor at Aden soon sent RAF biplanes to contain the advance of the Dervish army into the Warsangali country. Though the air strikes that bombarded Badhan, Jidali and Talex never did considerable harm to the Dervishes, the Dervishes were still powerful but disorganized and dispersed into unknown areas. Finally, the forces of Warsangali and Dervishes met at Jidali and this {{was in fact the}} final decimation of the Dervish movement.|$|E

50|$|In 1994 Adrian Riegen {{formed the}} New Zealand Wader Study Group, {{supported}} by the trust. The group consisted of bird <b>banders,</b> and had developed from a local Miranda group within the trust, to being a nationwide group recording and reporting on bird banding results to do with waders from all over New Zealand. A group of bird <b>banders</b> called “the Miranda Banders” had been active from 1979 to 1982, but was fired up again in late 1986, when four wrybills were caught by Adrian Riegen. The next catch in February 1987 consisted of more than 800 birds on the Kaipara Harbour. Catching {{was done with the}} use of a cannon net. Since then the catching and banding of birds have become and still are an important part of the work at the Shorebird Centre. Cannon netting is one of the highlights of the annual field courses. The banding and flagging of birds brought answers to many questions concerning the migration routes of godwits and knots. Results of the banding are published in The New Zealand Wader Study Group News, which is an occasional newsletter, published through the MNT.|$|R
