Type I occurs on flat plate printings only while types II & III also occur mostly in rotary press printings and in offset printings as they were produced from photo plates made from the former printing plates. The 2-cent Type II stamp does not occur on a flat plate stamp. Because the commonly used denominations of the Washington-Franklin issues were printed in greater quantities the worn printing plates {{would have to be}} replaced in the process from time to time. Though each new plate was made from the same die transfer, the plates would still differ slightly from the previous plate in use due to the <b>bending</b> <b>process</b> to fit the plate around the rotary press printing cylinder. Plates would also differ because the transfer die itself would wear from repeated image transfers to the printing plate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPlastic {{wrinkling}} predictions and shear enforced wrinkling {{characteristics of}} Ti-alloy thin-walled tubes under combination die constraints have become key problems urgently {{in need of}} solutions {{in order to improve}} forming quality in their shear <b>bending</b> <b>processes</b> under differential temperature fields. To address this, a wrinkling wave function was developed by considering their shear bend deformation characteristics. Based on this wave function and the thin shell theory, an energy prediction model for this type of wrinkling was established. This model enables consideration of the effects of shear deformation zone ranges, material parameters, loading modes, and friction coefficients between tube and dies on the minimum wrinkling energy. Tube wrinkling sensitive zones (WSZs) can be revealed by combining this wrinkling prediction model with a thermal-mechanical coupled finite element model for simulating these <b>bending</b> <b>processes.</b> The reliability of this wrinkling prediction model was verified, and an investigation into the tube wrinkling characteristics was carried out based on the experimental conditions. This found that the WSZs are located on either a single side or both sides of the maximum shear stress zone. When the friction coefficients between the tube and the various dies coincide, the WSZs are located on both sides. The larger the value of the tube inner corner radius and/or the smaller the value of the outer corner radius, the smaller the wrinkling probability. With an increase {{in the value of the}} moving die displacement, the wrinkling probability increases at first, and then decreases...|$|R

It is a well known fact that when sheet metal is formed, it does not form the desired shape because of the springback. In the present paper the springback is predicted by using finite element analysis, for various die radii, sheet thicknesses, R/t ratios and strength coefficients, for two different materials. The simple neural network is used to map the springback obtained from finite element analysis.

50|$|Probably will be {{the first}} <b>bending</b> <b>process</b> used on cold pipes and tubing. In this process a die {{in the shape of the}} bend is pressed against the pipe forcing the pipe to fit the shape of the bend. Because the pipe is not {{supported}} internally there is some deformation of the shape of the pipe giving an oval cross section. This process is used where a consistent cross section of the pipe is not required. Although a single die can produce various shapes, it only works for one size tube and radius.|$|E

50|$|During {{the roll}} <b>bending</b> <b>process</b> the pipe, extrusion, or solid is {{passed through a}} series of rollers (typically 3) that apply {{pressure}} to the pipe gradually changing the bend radius in the pipe. The pyramid style roll benders have one moving roll, usually the top roll. Double pinch type roll benders have two adjustable rolls, usually the bottom rolls, and a fixed top roll. This method of bending causes very little deformation in the cross section of the pipe. This process is suited to producing coils of pipe as well as long gentle bends like those used in truss systems.|$|E
40|$|At high latitudes, the albedo {{and energy}} budget of shrub-tundra landscapes is {{determined}} by the relationship between the fractional snow cover and the fraction of vegetation protruding above the snowpack. The exposed vegetation fraction is affected by the bending and/or burial of shrubs in winter and their spring-up during melt. Little is known about the meteorological conditions and snowpack and shrub properties required to cause bending, and few quantitative measurements of <b>bending</b> <b>processes</b> exist. Here, a model combining the few, mostly qualitative, observations available with a biomechanical model representing branches as cantilevers is proposed to provide a first approximation of bending mechanisms. The exposed vegetation fraction is then calculated using structural parameters of shrubs measured at two sites in Canada: the Granger Basin in the Yukon Territory and Trail Valley Creek in the Northwest Territories. The exposed vegetation fraction is in turn used to calculate albedo, which is evaluated against measurements at the two sites. The model considerably improves modelled albedo compared to a model which only buries but does not bend shrubs at TVC, where shrubs become completely buried. However, the model overestimates albedo at GB where only a few shrubs get buried. The bending model is then used to calculate a compression factor for use in a simple parameterization of the exposed vegetation fraction proposed by previous investigators. The parameterization, which is simpler and computationally less expensive than the full model, is evaluated and found to perform well. Despite the need for further developments, the model provides a first approximation of <b>bending</b> <b>processes</b> and contributes to the identification of measurements that are needed in order to improve the model and our understanding of the bending of shrubs...|$|R
