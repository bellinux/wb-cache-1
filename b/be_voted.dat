5|$|Article IX {{involves}} {{amendments to}} the New Jersey state constitution. A potential amendment is submitted through the Senate or General Assembly. The amendment is voted upon by both of the houses. If it gathers at least three-fifths of both the Senate and the General Assembly, the amendment is to be submitted to <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> upon {{by the people of}} New Jersey. If a majority votes for the amendment, the amendment is passed on the thirtieth day after the vote.|$|E
5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier. This made clear that, although the Cathedral was {{one of the largest in}} the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E

5|$|On October 31, 2005, Reso's {{contract}} with WWE expired. According to wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, {{he was asked}} on the spot to sign a new contract but declined. His last match occurred during the tapings for the November 4 episode of SmackDown!. Despite his quitting, Christian appeared on the October 31 episode of Raw and at the Taboo Tuesday PPV event on November 1, 2005, fulfilling his obligations to the company, as {{he was one of}} five SmackDown! wrestlers eligible to <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> Snitsky and Chris Masters' opponents by the fans.|$|E
5|$|Once elected for a four-year-term, Federal Councillors {{can neither}} <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> {{out of office}} by a motion of no {{confidence}} nor can they be impeached. Re-election is possible for an indefinite number of terms. Parliament has decided not to re-elect a sitting Councillor only four times, and only twice (in 2003 and 2007) {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century. In practice, therefore, Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.|$|E
5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the issue to the senators, who discussed the matter by order of seniority. Unimportant matters could <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> on by a voice vote or by a show of hands, while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E

5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, {{support for}} the {{introduction}} of direct election for the Senate had substantially increased, and reformers worked on two fronts. On the first front, the Populist Party incorporated the direct election of senators into its Omaha Platform, adopted in 1892. In 1908, Oregon passed the first law that based the selection of U.S. senators on a popular vote. Oregon was soon followed by Nebraska. Proponents for popular election noted that ten states already had non-binding primaries for Senate candidates, in which the candidates would <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> on by the public, effectively serving as advisory referenda instructing state legislatures how to vote; reformers campaigned for more states to introduce a similar method.|$|E
5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even {{if he or she is}} not an elected member of parliament. The leader of the party with the second-most seats in the House becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition, and debate (formally called Oral Questions) between the parties is presided over by the Speaker of the House. When the party with the most seats has less than half of the total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> out of power by the other parties. The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa. The current assembly is the first session of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, since the confederation of Canada in 1867.|$|E

5|$|Once a vote occurred, and {{a measure}} passed, {{he could do}} nothing, since his promise to {{physically}} interpose his person against the senators was now meaningless. In addition, during a couple of instances {{between the end of}} the Second Punic War in 201 BC {{and the beginning of the}} Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal power to do so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, if there was no veto, and the matter was of minor importance, it could <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> on by a voice vote or by a show of hands. If there was no veto, and the matter was of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E
5|$|The SUPP {{attacked}} the DAP {{on the basis}} of its coalition with the Islamist PAS, arguing that “A vote for Rocket is a vote for Islamic State". Lim Kit Siang, the parliamentary leader of the DAP, said that the issue was a “killer weapon” which could “finish off” the chances of DAP's candidate winning by frightening off the Chinese and non-Muslim voters in Sibu as it did during the 1999 Malaysian General Election where both Karpal Singh and Lim himself lost their parliamentary seats. The SUPP also claimed that if the DAP was to <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> in kampua noodles could no longer be sold as they were mixed with pork lard; a reference to PAS's policy to establish Malaysia as an Islamic state.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget and should not <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill {{would have to be}} approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E

5|$|From 1987 through 1994 {{the award}} was given {{out by a}} panel of science fiction experts led by Orson Scott Card. Beginning in 1995, the {{committee}} was replaced by a group of jurors, who vote on the nominations submitted for consideration. The initial jurors were James Gunn, Frederik Pohl, and Judith Merril. Merril was replaced on the jury by former winner Kij Johnson in 1997, one of Sturgeon's children—Noel Sturgeon in most years—was added to the panel in 1999, and George Zebrowski was added to the panel in 2005. Nominations are submitted by reviewers, fans, publishers, and editors, and are collated by the current Director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction, Christopher McKitterick, into a list of finalists to <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> on by the jury. The maximum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center. The winner is selected by May of each year, and is presented at the Campbell Conference awards banquet in June at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with the Campbell Award. Winners are always invited to attend the ceremony. Since 2004 winners have received a personalized trophy, while since the inception of the award a permanent trophy has recorded all of the winners.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E
5|$|The Great Powers occupying Paris {{demanded that}} Louis XVIII {{implement}} a constitution. Louis responded with the Charter of 1814, which included many progressive provisions: freedom of religion, a legislature {{composed of the}} Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers, a press that would enjoy a degree of freedom, and a provision that the Biens nationaux would remain {{in the hands of}} their current owners. The constitution had 76 articles. Taxation was to <b>be</b> <b>voted</b> on by the chambers. Catholicism was to be the official religion of France. To be eligible for membership in the Chamber of Deputies, one had to pay over 1,000 francs per year in tax, and be over the age of forty. The king would appoint peers to the Chamber of Peers on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of them up for election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.|$|E

5|$|When the {{official}} tally was announced, Taylor had {{won by a}} vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel allies, it voted 2–1 to certify the announced vote tally. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Goebel announced his decision to contest the board's decision to the General Assembly. The Assembly appointed a committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges. The members of the committee were drawn at random, though the drawing was likely rigged – only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.)
