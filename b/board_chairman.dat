Two days of talks followed and in an attempt to close the deal, BSkyB made a final bid of £623.4million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{parliamentary}} election after the war, in 1945, Meisdalshagen was re-elected {{for a second}} term in Parliament. It was not clear that he would be nominated for the ballot, as this was not at all usual for those Labour Party members who in the summer of 1940 had agreed to the King's abdication.

He {{was a member of the}} Standing Committee on Finance and Customs and secretary of the Preparatory Credentials Committee, and also became a member of the Standing Committee on Justice in December 1946.

Although the company continued to sell over A$800 million of MIS products in the two financial years after incurring losses on its early offerings, it was not meeting sales targets, and its share price was falling.|$|E
