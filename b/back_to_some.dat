5|$|The film begins {{during the}} thirtieth {{year of the}} show. During the day, Truman notices strange occurrences that all seem {{centered}} on him (a falling spotlight, rain that only falls on him). Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back into the set, but actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure Truman, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by apparent and increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress, and during an argument with Truman, breaks character and is later taken off the show. Truman, depressed and confused, is consoled by Marlon, and Christof uses the opportunity to re-introduce Truman's father to the show properly, {{under the guise of}} having lost his memory after the boating accident, in the hope of bringing Truman <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> emotional stability and a controllable state.|$|E

Despite the fall in ratings, Another World became the first, and thus far only, soap opera to expand to 90 minutes, a move that proved unsuccessful—it remained in eighth place in the 1979–1980 television season.|$|E
25|$|Being {{a rather}} neutral grape, Australian winemakers first {{approached}} Chardonnay {{in the same}} manner they were making wine from the similarly neutral Sultana grape. Aromatic yeast were added and maceration was extended to get more flavors from skin contact. While the style of Australian Chardonnay is mostly characterized by the mass-produced products of the hot Riverland region, the cooler climates of the Southern Highlands in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania have been creating more crisp, less oaked wines with lime notes. In the Cowra region, Chardonnay's citrus notes are emphasized while Hunter Valley examples have more richness and smoky notes. The Adelaide Hills and Yarra Valley produce a more Burgundian style while Mount Barker in the Great Southern wine region of Western Australia produces Chardonnay that more closely resembles those of Chablis. A rare, isolated clone exists in the Mudgee region that locals believe traces its ancestry <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of the first vines brought to Australia in the 19th century. While the wine made from this clone is not particularly distinguished, it can still be of very good quality. Overall, there has been a shift in style since the 1980s from deep golden, oily wines with melon and butterscotch flavors to lighter, paler Chardonnays with more structure and notes of white peaches and nectarines. Sparkling wines from Chardonnay are produced in the cool regions of Geelong, Adelaide Hills, Macedon Ranges and Tasmania.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the accident, {{safeguarding}} against counterfeit aircraft parts skyrocketed. Peter Friedman, an expert on spare aircraft parts, stated in an episode of the television programme Mayday (Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency) that the Partnair accident was the [...] "seminal event" [...] that required people around the world to recognize the proliferation of counterfeit aircraft parts in parts inventories. The spare aircraft parts industry had little regulation in many places in the world {{at the time of the}} Partnair accident. The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), which oversees the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), decided to examine the scope of the spare parts in the United States. After auditing the FAA's inventory, the USDOT found that 39% of its parts were counterfeit. Those parts were traced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> parts brokers that were prominent in making spare parts; however, up to 95% of the parts in those brokers' inventories were counterfeit. Mary Schiavo, the former inspector general of the USDOT, said that American parts brokers had [...] "no regulation whatsoever." [...] Schiavo stated that [...] "an individual with a telephone and a fax machine could become a parts broker" [...] and could get their parts from [...] "a variety of sources," [...] including junkyards, scrap facilities, older aircraft, aircraft involved in accidents, and illegal parts manufacturers. Counterfeit parts were often less expensive than authentic parts, which meant that airlines that were [...] "bottom-line driven" [...] (in poor financial shape) wanted to cut costs, driving them to acquire fakes.|$|E
