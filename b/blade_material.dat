40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of wind turbines will be vital for the wind energy sector to continue growing. The drive for increased efficiency is pushing turbine manufacturers to shift from glass fibre composite blades towards carbon/glass fibre-hybrid composite blades. This shift brings significant challenges in terms of optimising the design and understanding the failure of these new <b>blade</b> <b>materials.</b> This review therefore surveys the literature on fibre-hybrid composites, {{with an emphasis on}} aspects that are relevant for turbine <b>blade</b> <b>materials.</b> The literature on tensile, flexural, compressive, and fatigue performance is critically assessed and areas for future research are identified. Numerical simulations of fibre-hybrid composites have reached a reasonable maturity for tensile failure, but significant progress is required for flexural, compressive, and fatigue failure. Fatigue failure of fibre-hybrid composites in particular, requires more careful attention from both a modelling and experimental point of view...|$|R

50|$|Air, bled {{from the}} {{compressor}} exit, passes around the combustor and is {{injected into the}} rim of the rotating turbine disc. The cooling air then passes through complex passages within the turbine blades. After removing heat from the <b>blade</b> <b>material,</b> the air (now fairly hot) is vented, via cooling holes, into the main gas stream. Cooling air for the turbine vanes undergoes a similar process.|$|E
50|$|In archaeology, a {{prismatic}} blade is a long, narrow, specialized stone flake tool {{with a sharp}} edge, like a small razor blade.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the assessment of the fatigue life of cracked steam turbine blades which operate under cyclic loading conditions. The turbine blades fatigue life estimation approach includes numerical stress-strain analysis of real rotor components, experimental study of fatigue and fracture resistance material properties and determination of crack growth rate characteristics on the round bar specimens with the single edge notch. Static and cyclic tests were performed to obtain the main mechanical properties and the fatigue life characteristics of <b>blade's</b> <b>material</b> after loading history. Both specimens with the initial surface state and specimens with high velocity air fuel (HVAF) coating were tested. As a result the fatigue life characteristics of <b>blade's</b> <b>material</b> were determined as a function of operating time. The fatigue crack growth study of surface flow was performed for round bar specimens with different initial single edge notch depth. Experimental constants describing the linear parts of the fatigue fracture diagrams were determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{scale of}} modern blades means that tip speeds {{in excess of}} 100 ms- 1 are now common in utility scale turbines. Coupling this with a {{hailstone}} terminal velocity ranging from 9 ms- 1 to 40 ms- 1, the relative impact velocity becomes highly significant. There is little published data {{on the performance of}} <b>blade</b> <b>materials</b> under these impact conditions and as such this work aims to understand the impact phenomena more clearly and consequently characterize the impact performance of the constitutive <b>blade</b> <b>materials.</b> To better understand hailstone impact, the LS-DYNA explicit dynamics code was employed to simulate hailstone impact on the blade leading edge. A Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics approach (SPH) was chosen to represent the hailstone geometry. It was found that the forces and stresses created during hail impact are significant and in some cases damaging, therefore posing both short and long term risks to the material integrity. It was also found that coating systems such as the gel coat provide essential – and in extreme conditions, sacrificial – protection to the composite substrate...|$|R
5000|$|First {{introduced}} in 1990, the basic model has a sand-blasted titanium handle and a stonewashed finish CPM S30V steel blade.There are numerous {{options for the}} embellishment of the Sebenza's titanium handles, such as computer-generated graphics, custom (unique) graphics, or inlays such as exotic wood, micarta, or mammoth ivory.Originally the Chris Reeve Sebenza was available with a blade of ATS-34 steel. [...] In 1996, the <b>blade</b> <b>material</b> was changed to BG-42 blade steel, and later in 2001, the Sebenza <b>blade</b> <b>material</b> transitioned to CPM S30V steel. CPM S30V was developed by Crucible Steel with the collaboration of Chris Reeve. [...] Damascus steel blades are also available as an option on the Sebenza. Since 2012, all Chris Reeve knives have transitioned to CPM S35VN steel.A feature of the Sebenza that is highly praised by users is the ease of maintenance, as CRK actually encourages the customer to disassemble and maintain the knife by including a hex wrench in the box. Another feature of the Sebenza {{is the use of}} a bushing system around the blade's pivot that keeps the blade at a constant tight fit which is always centered.This bushing allows the user to tighten the pivot screw completely without having to manually adjust the pivot tension.|$|E
50|$|Another major {{improvement}} to turbine <b>blade</b> <b>material</b> {{technology was}} {{the development of}} thermal barrier coatings (TBC). Where DS and SC developments improved creep and fatigue resistance, TBCs improved corrosion and oxidation resistance, both of which became greater concerns as temperatures increased. The first TBCs, applied in the 1970s, were aluminide coatings. Improved ceramic coatings became available in the 1980s. These coatings increased turbine blade temperature capability by about 200 °F (90 °C). The coatings also improve blade life, almost doubling the life of turbine blades in some cases.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} report {{investigates the}} use of abradable seal technology in industrial steam turbine applications. Abradable seals are a highly adaptable, widely applicable and cheap method of improving seal performance. By retrofitting abradable coatings to existing labyrinth seals, improvements {{in the range of}} 0. 5 % - 1 % power output are seen with cost returns within two years [1]. The intention of this investigation was to develop fundamental understanding of the seal degradation process. A Multi Oxidation and Incursion Steam Test (MOIST) rig was designed from concept, through detailed design and finally commissioned. During commissioning the capabilities of the MOIST rig were defined. Although flowing steam operation was not achieved during this investigation, a theoretically proofed steam system is in place for future development. High temperature operation was achieved, although not reliably. Reliable, repeatable atmospheric tests were developed, representative of the start-up and shut-down operations of an industrial steam turbine. These tests produced relative velocities up to 121 ms- 1 between coatings and blades, and incursion rates up to 50 μms- 1. ST 12 T, Nimonic 80 A and Nimonic 101 <b>blade</b> <b>materials</b> were tested against a bentonite-NiCrAl abradable coating. The results suggest that the bentonite-NiCrAl abradable coating tested was highly suitable as an abradable coating for all <b>blade</b> <b>materials.</b> Additionally, high temperature tests are necessary to fully prove {{the use of}} <b>blade</b> <b>materials</b> against coating systems. Simultaneously, non-MOIST rig oxidation testing was performed in the range of 580 ˚C - 800 ˚C in static air and 580 ˚C in flowing steam for exposure times up to 5000 hrs. Bentonite-NiCrAl top coat - NiAl bond coat and either a STG- 9 T or IN 625 substrate were analysed to devise mechanistic models for the oxidation of the top coat, bond coat, substrate and all associated interfaces. It was concluded that steam oxidation is intrinsically different to air oxidation and that adapting the bond coat to include Cr would significantly improve the oxidation resistance and service life of the coating system investigated...|$|R
5000|$|A {{sharp object}} works by concentrating forces which creates a high {{pressure}} {{due to the}} very small area of the edge, but high pressures can nick a thin blade or even cause it to roll over into a rounded tube when it is used against hard materials. An irregular material or angled cut {{is also likely to}} apply much more torque to hollow-ground blades due to the [...] "lip" [...] formed {{on either side of the}} edge. More <b>blade</b> <b>material</b> can be included directly behind the cutting edge to reinforce it, but during sharpening some proportion of this material must be removed to reshape the edge, making the process more time-consuming. Also, any object being cut must be moved aside to make way for this wider blade section, and any force distributed to the grind surface reduces the pressure applied at the edge.|$|E
50|$|The initial MOD-0 blades {{were made}} by Lockheed, out of aluminum. Structural {{problems}} surfaced almost immediately at the root end of the blades. Several significant changes and efforts were performed to address this. An investigation revealed that unexpectedly high cyclic loads {{were the result of}} a significant blockage of the wind by the complex truss tower structure. This caused the aerodynamic loads on the downwind rotor rapidly change. To correct this blockage, the access stairs were removed {{from the center of the}} tower. A major <b>blade</b> <b>material</b> program was started that assessed fiberglass composite, steel, wood and even concrete. NASA approached the Gougeon Brothers, Inc. of Michigan to apply their boat material technology to wind turbines. The resulting wood and composite blades replaced the aluminum blades on th Mod-0 (and later Mod-0A), eliminating the blade root structural problems. Gougeon Brothers successfully commercialized their products into the wind turbine industry with sales around the world.|$|E
5000|$|The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) {{predicts that}} wind energy will supply 15.7% of the world’s total energy needs {{by the year}} 2020, and 28.5% by the year 2030.

Based on a study {{carried out by the}} European Wind Energy Association, in the year 2010 alone, between 110 and 140 kilotons of composites were consumed by the wind turbine industry for manufacturing blades. The majority of the <b>blade</b> <b>material</b> will eventually end up as waste, and in order to accommodate this level of composite waste, the only option is recycling. Typically, glass-fibre-reinforced-polymers (GFRPs) compose of around 70% of the laminate material in the blade. GFRPs hinder incineration and are not combustible. Therefore, conventional recycling methods need to be modified. Currently, depending on whether individual fibres can be recovered, there exists a few general methods for recycling GFRPs in wind turbine blades: ...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "reverse-flow" [...] or [...] "trombone" [...] type {{of design}} as {{implemented}} {{on the second}} and third engines, although known not to be aerodynamically ideal, was devised as a means to allow use of a short compressor/turbine shaft requiring only two bearings without the need for a flexible coupling, to eliminate an expansion joint in the shaft, to give a good airflow to the combustion zones, and to lengthen the hot gas path from the combustion chamber to the turbine so that a temperature drop could occur, and to ensure that the blades were shielded from the hot combustion flame itself, the available turbine blade materials such as [...] "Stayblade" [...] and [...] "Rex78" [...] being limited in the temperatures they could withstand. With later improvements in <b>blade</b> <b>material,</b> such as Nimonic 80, this was no longer necessary, and the [...] "straight-through" [...] design became practicable, as implemented {{in the design of the}} unbuilt W.2Y and the later re-designed W.2B/500 - Rover B.26, later to become the Rolls-Royce Derwent.|$|E
50|$|Film cooling (also called {{thin film}} cooling), a widely used type, allows for higher heat {{transfer}} rates than either convection and impingement cooling. This technique consists of pumping the cooling {{air out of}} the blade through multiple small holes in the structure. A thin layer (the film) of cooling air is then created on the external surface of the blade, reducing the heat transfer from main flow, whose temperature (1300-1800 kelvins) can exceed the melting point of the <b>blade</b> <b>material</b> (1300-1400 kelvins). The air holes can be in many different blade locations, but they are most often along the leading edge. A United States Air Force program in the early 1970s funded the development of a turbine blade that was both film and convection cooled, and that method has become common in modern turbine blades.Injecting the cooler bleed into the flow reduces turbine isentropic efficiency; the compression of the cooling air (which does not contribute power to the engine) incurs an energetic penalty; and the cooling circuit adds considerable complexity to the engine. All of these factors have to be compensated by the increase in overall performance (power and efficiency) allowed by the increase in turbine temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{first modern}} {{straight}} razor complete with decorated handles and hollow ground blades {{was constructed in}} Sheffield, in England, {{the centre of the}} cutlery industry, in the 18th and 19th centuries. Benjamin Huntsman produced the first superior hard steel grade, through a special crucible process, suitable for use as <b>blade</b> <b>material</b> in 1740, though it was first rejected in England. Huntsman's process was adopted by the French sometime later; albeit reluctantly at first because of nationalist sentiments. The English manufacturers were even more reluctant than the French to adopt the process and only did so after they saw its success in France. Sheffield steel, a highly polished steel, also known as Sheffield silver steel and famous for its deep gloss finish, is considered a superior quality steel and is still used to this day in France by such manufacturers as Thiers Issard.In the 18th and 19th centuries, the wealthy had servants to shave them or could frequent barbershops. Daily shaving was not a widespread practice in the 19th century so some people never shaved. The custom of shaving every day among American men is a 20th-century innovation which was started after World War I. Men were required to shave daily so their gas masks would fit properly and this became much easier {{with the advent of the}} safety razor, which was standard issue during the war. In the 19th century, cutlers in Sheffield, England and Solingen, Germany produced a variety of razors.|$|E

To compare the performance of this fully recyclable material against commonly used less sustainable thermoset <b>blade</b> <b>materials</b> in a baseline structural MW-size blade configuration (box-spar/skins), four different <b>blade</b> composite <b>material</b> options were investigated: Glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy, glass/PA- 6, and carbon/PA- 6.

Results showed that the PA- 6 blades have similar weights and natural frequencies when compared to their epoxy counterpart. For glass fiber blades, a 10 % reduction in material cost can be expected when using PA- 6 rather than epoxy while carbon fiber blades costs {{were found to be}} similar. Considering manufacturing, processing temperatures of PA- 6 are significantly higher than for epoxy systems; however, the associated cost increase is expected to be compensated for by a reduction in infusion and curing time. status: publishe...|$|R
