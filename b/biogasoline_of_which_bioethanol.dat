Research groups are finding that current investment groups are impatient with the pace <b>of</b> <b>biogasoline</b> progress. In addition, environmental groups may demand that biogasoline that is produced {{in a way that}} protects wildlife, especially fish. [...] A research group studying the economic viability of biofuels found that current techniques of production and high costs of production will prevent biogasoline from being accessible to the general public. [...] The group determined that the price <b>of</b> <b>biogasoline</b> would need to be approximately $800 per barrel, which they determine as unlikely with current production costs. Another problem inhibiting the success <b>of</b> <b>biogasoline</b> is the lack of tax relief. The government is providing tax relief for ethanol fuels but has yet to offer tax relief for biogasoline. This makes biogasoline a much less attractive option to consumers. Lastly, producing biogasoline could have a large effect on the farming industry. If biogasoline became a serious alternative, a large percentage of our existing arable land would be converted to grow crops solely for biogasoline. This could decrease the amount of land used to farm food for human consumption and may decrease overall feedstock. This would cause an increase in overall food cost.|$|R

This study aimed to examine the use of sisal pulp in the production <b>of</b> <b>bioethanol,</b> <b>which</b> can potentially be a high efficiency process because of the cellulose content of this fiber. A previous paper addressed the hydrolysis of sisal pulp using sulfuric acid as a catalyst. In the present study, the influence of the mercerization process on the acid hydrolysis of sisal pulp was evaluated. Mercerization was achieved in a 20 % wt NaOH solution, and the cellulosic pulp was suspended and vigorously mixed for 1, 2 and 3 h, at 50 A degrees C. The previously characterized mercerized pulps were hydrolyzed (100 A degrees C, 30 % H 2 SO 4, v/v), and the results are compared with those obtained for unmercerized pulp (described in a companion paper). The starting sample was characterized by viscometry, alpha-cellulose content, crystallinity index and scanning electron microscopy. During the reactions, aliquots were withdrawn, and the liquor was analyzed by HPLC. The residual pulps (non-hydrolyzed) were also characterized by the techniques described for the initial sample. The results revealed that pretreatment decreases the polyoses content as well as causes a decrease of up to 23 % in the crystallinity and up to 21 % in the average molar mass of cellulose after 3 h of mercerization. The mercerization process proved to be very important to achieve the final target. Under the same reaction conditions (30 % and 100 A degrees C, 6 h), the hydrolysis of mercerized pulp generated yields of up to 50 % more glucose.

40|$|Biofuels {{produced}} from palm oil have shown great {{potential as a}} useful fossil fuel substitute and are environmental friendly. Utilization of palm oil as biofuel requires zeolite based catalytic technology that facilitates selective conversion of substrates to desired products, including biogasoline and biodiesel. However, the synthesis and integration of suitable zeolite based supported catalysts for the desired products are the key challenges in biofuel production. The alternative {{to overcome these problems}} is to use nano heterometallic materials supported on zeolite catalysts. In this study, Zeolite Socony Mobile- 5 (ZSM- 5) based catalysts loaded with heterometallic nano oxides were synthesized. Next, the catalysts used for the palm oil cracking to produce biogasoline were characterized by field emission electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) analysis. Taguchi method was used to assess and optimize the catalytic cracking process. The catalytic cracking results illustrated that under optimized conditions, ZSM- 5 (30), Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM- 5 (31), Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM- 5 (32) and Fe-Zn-ZSM- 5 (33) yielded 14 %, 59 %, 49 % and 56 % biogasoline, respectively.

This is aside the associated environmental degradation and economic sustainability of these fuels. These negative consequences and challenges spurred the search for sustainable energy sources such as biofuels. However, affordable feedstocks and efficient synthesis for renewable fuels remain indispensable and yet challenging line of research. Therefore, breakthroughs in plant biotechnology and mass production are essential prerequisites for ensuring the sustainability of biofuels as alternatives to petroleum-based energy. Conversely, public outcry concerning the food-for-fuel conflicts and land-use change hinder the popularity of such biofuel energy sources. Therefore, this paper reviewed the prospects <b>of</b> <b>biogasoline</b> production as sustainable alternative to ethanol and a compliment to biodiesel. Apart from reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, biogasoline promises to be cheaper and more environmental friendly. Further, inedible feedstocks such as microalgae and rubber seed oil would ensure higher net energy gain. Consequently, these will help resolve the food-for-fuel conflicts and land-use competitions.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued by some that the {{substitution}} of biofuels for gasoline could increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, rather than reduce them. The increase is attributed to the indirect land use change effects of planting new grain and corn crops {{around the world to}} replace those progressively being devoted to ethanol production. In this paper, indirect effects are minimised by allowing land to be used for both food and fuel, rather than for one or the other. We present a sugarcane ‘feed+fuel’ biorefinery, <b>which</b> produces <b>bioethanol</b> and yeast biomass, a source of single-cell protein (SCP), that {{can be used as a}} high-protein animal feed supplement. The yeast SCP can partially substitute for grass in the feed of cattle grazing on pasture and thereby potentially release land for increased sugarcane production, with minimal land use change effects. Applying the concept conservatively to the Brazilian ethanol and livestock industry our model demonstrates that it would be technically feasible to raise ethanol production threefold from the current level of 27 GL to over 92 GL. The extra ethanol would meet biofuel market mandates in the US without bringing any extra land into agricultural or pastoral use.

Lignocellulose hydrolysates, however, are highly complex and viscous media, posing challenges to oxygen transfer, product formation at low sugar concentration, product recovery, etc. Bioethanol is an exceptional product in this respect because it can be produced anaerobically, at low sugar concentrations, and can be easily removed from the broth by distillation.
