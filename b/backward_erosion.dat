40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of water retaining {{structures such as}} dikes and dams is threatened by internal erosion. Piping {{is a kind of}} <b>backward</b> progressing internal <b>erosion</b> that occurs under impervious hydraulic structures lying on a sandy soil (Fig. 1). Despite not many cases of piping-induced collapse have been documented, piping is nowadays considered a big threat due to the difficulty in recognizing clearly the traces of this mechanism before and even after collapse occurs [1, 2]. For this reason, small-scale physical models are being set up in the laboratory, in an attempt to reproduce the conditions leading to the growth of erosion channels (pipes) in sand [3]. COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ® was chosen to investigate issues related to the design of such a facility, and to analyse the coupled thermo-hydraulic behavior of groundwater flow in the soil-pipe system to the aim of early-stage detection by means of temperature sensors. In this contribution, the attention is focused on alternative strategies for modelling fluid flow in a soil sample including a pipe. The numerical model reproduces a sand sample 0. 32 m long, prepared in a box and subject to a hydraulic head difference applied between inlet and outlet of the sand box. Steady state analyses were run to model the situation when the pipe, growing backwards, reaches half the seepage length...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the failure}} {{mechanisms}} that can affect {{the safety of a}} dyke or another water-retaining structure is <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> piping, a phenomenon that results in the formation of shallow pipes at the interface of a sandyor silty foundation and a cohesive cover layer. Themodels available for predicting the critical head at which the pipe progresses to the upstreamside have been validated and adapted on the basis of experiments with two-dimensional (2 D) configurations. However, the experimental base for <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> in three-dimensional (3 D) configurations in which the flow concentrates towards one point, a situation that is commonly encountered in the field, is limited. This paper presents additional 3 D configuration experiments at two scales with a range of sand types. The critical gradients, the formed pipes and the erosion mechanism were analysed for the available experiments, indicating that the erosion mechanism is more complex than previously assumed, as both erosion {{at the tip of the}} pipe (primary erosion) and in the pipe (secondary erosion) are relevant. In addition, a 3 D configuration was found to result in significantly lower critical gradients than those predicted by an accepted calculation model calibrated on the basis of 2 D experiments, a finding that is essential for the application of the model in the field...|$|E
40|$|The {{earliest}} relation {{describing the}} risk of <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> piping, from Bligh in 1915, calculates an overall gradient over the dike. This gradient should be lower than a certain value depending on the material of the dike foundation for the dike to be safe. Later developments rationalize this number, showing the influence of grain size, permeability, density and added {{the influence of the}} thickness of the aquifer. However, the principle remains the same. The actual overall gradient is compared to a critical gradient. This contribution will show, using analytical groundwater flow calculations that for the beginning of <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> piping, not only the overall gradient but also the leakage length of the semi-confined aquifer, usually present at the landward side of the dike, is of importance. This leakage length determines the piezometric head on the landward side of the dike. This is not very new, since this is also used in the âblanket theoryâ developed and used in the USA, but a slightly different approach results in some new conclusions. It will also be shown that the influence of the leakage length on the pipe progression and in ultimo on the breach of the dike is less. This means that with a long leakage length the difference in overall head between pipe initiation and breakthrough is larger than for the situation with a shorter leakage length...|$|E

Hanson et al. (2010) analyzed variation in erodibility of different soil materials due to internal erosion in dams by conducting large-scale outdoor model tests. They observed that the rate of erosion in differing soil materials varied in orders of magnitude. Marot et al. (2012) used a triaxial cell device coupled with a hydraulic system to study the influence of angularity of coarse fraction grains on the internal erosion process. They concluded that the angularity of coarse fraction grains may increase the erosion resistance of the tested soils by a factor of five. Richards and Reddy (2012) performed laboratory experiments on the initiation of <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> in cohesive and non-cohesive soils using a triaxial test device called a true triaxial test apparatus. They observed that the primary mode of failure of non-cohesive soils was by <b>backward</b> <b>erosion,</b> which required a seepage velocity of 0.8 [*]~[*] 1.1 Â cm/s to initiate piping in uniformly graded sands. Ke and Takahashi (2012) studied the mechanical effect of internal erosion on gap-graded non-cohesive soils by conducting one-dimensional seepage tests using a fixed-wall permeameter.

40|$|<b>Backward</b> <b>erosion</b> piping is an {{internal}} erosion mechanism during which shallow pipes are {{formed in the}} direction opposite to the flow underneath water-retaining structures {{as a result of}} the gradual removal of sandy material by the action of water. It is an important failure mechanism in both dikes and dams where sandy layers are covered by a cohesive layer. Sand boils can indicate that <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> is present and they are observed regularly during high water and floods. Although failure resulting from <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> piping is not common, several dike failures in the US, China and the Netherlands have been attributed to this mechanism. Given the impact that climate change is expected to have, prediction models for <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> piping are becoming increasingly important in flood-risk assessment. The prediction models available until now, such as Blighâs rule and the Sellmeijer model, were validated in the research programme âStrength and loads on flood defence structuresâ (SBW: Sterkte en Belastingen Waterkeringen) in the period 2008 - 2010 using small-, medium- and large-scale experiments. These experiments showed that an empirical adjustment of the Sellmeijer model was required to take the effect of the sand type into account and that validation was not possible for loose sand types because the erosion mode is different in those conditions. However, the absence of a theoretical basis makes this proposed empirical adjustment unsatisfactory because it lacks robustness. The main question addressed by this dissertation is how to explain and predict the pipe-forming erosion processes in uniform sands. A review of the literature, in conjunction with additional experiments, showed that the critical head in pipe formation leading to dike failure depends on either pipe initiation or pipe progression. In some experiments, the critical head for pipe initiation exceeds that of pipe progression and equilibrium is therefore prevented. The experiments in which no equilibrium was observed allowed for the development of a model for pipe initiation. It was possible to relate the observed differences in critical gradient caused by scale, sand type and configuration to the fluidisation of sand very close to the exit, where the local gradients are high. In the field, pipe progression is likely to determine the critical gradient. The Sellmeijer model predicts the progression of the pipe on the basis of the equilibrium of particles on the bottom of the pipe. The literature, and an analysis of the pipe width, depth, gradient and erosion process in experiments, indicate that pipe progression relies on two processes: primary erosion, which causes the removal of particles at the pipe tip, and secondary erosion, which causes the erosion of the pipe walls and bottom. Although the Sellmeijer model does not include primary erosion, it does function well for sand layers with a 2 D exit configuration in which there is no variation in the grain size along the pipe path. The adaptation of the Sellmeijer model that was found necessary to account for the effect of sand type can be replaced by using the original model in combination with a variable bedding angle based on incipient motion experiments from the literature. The Sellmeijer model does not predict the critical gradient well for 3 D configurations such as flow towards a single point, or for heterogeneous soils. Variations in the grain size in the pipe path were found to result in significantly higher critical gradients than expected, whereas a strong concentration of the flow towards the exit led to a fall in the critical gradient. 3 D numerical calculations and the inclusion of primary erosion in the Sellmeijer model are needed to predict piping under these conditions.

40|$|<b>Backward</b> <b>erosion</b> piping (BEP) {{is a type}} of {{internal}} erosion that typically involves the erosion of foundation materials beneath an embankment. BEP has been shown, historically, to be the cause of approximately one third of all internal erosion related failures.

Currently, average gradient methods are predominantly used to perform these assessments, supported by mean trends of critical gradient observed in laboratory flume tests. Significant uncertainty exists surrounding the mean trends of critical gradient used in practice. To quantify this uncertainty, over 100 laboratory-piping tests were compiled and analysed to assess the variability of laboratory measurements of horizontal critical gradient.

40|$|Up to now, the {{phenomenon}} of <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> piping in uniform sands covered by a cohesive top layer has been predicted using a 2 D approach.

Arecent series of experiments indicates that the original Sellmeijer model fails to predict the critical head correctly for coarser sand types, and an empirical correction has been proposed to correct for this (Sellmeijer et al. 2011).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} twofold; on the one hand it investigates the susceptibility to suffusion of glacial till, and, on the other, it presents approaches to evaluate internal erosion susceptibility of dams composed of this type of core soil. Concentrated leak erosion, <b>backward</b> <b>erosion,</b> contact erosion, and suffusion erosion are the mechanisms associated with the initiation of internal erosion. How these interplay in the continuation phase is still a relatively unresolved issue. In engineering practice, these mechanisms have all been seen in dams with glacial till cores; <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> activity as seen in Juktan dam, Juklavatn dam, GrundsjÃ¶ndam, Wreck Cove dam, and in Brodhead dam; possible suffusion as seen in LÃ¶vÃ¶n dam and in Stenkullafors dam; and, furthermore, signs indicating concentrated leaks, such as in Songa dam. A laboratory program of tests was performed on four natural, non-plastic glacial till soils from the core or its borrow area of existing earth dams in Sweden, and on eight mixtures based on these tills, making in total 12 tests. The longest running for 77 days, and the highest applied gradient was 9. 5, in bounds of what can occur in dam cores. The tests revealed that gradations of low fines content (Â§ 60 %) are susceptible to suffusion. These are grading characteristics present in the coarse end of the envelope of glacial till cores in many existing dams. Available state-of-the-art assessment criteria for internal stability were evaluated in reference to these experimental data, yielding a modification to the Kenney-Lau adaptation by Li-Fannin. Furthermore, a screening tool for the assessment of internal erosion of dams is proposed, i. e., the unified-plot approach, which combines attributes of the filter gradation and the probable occurrence of internal erosion in a dam. Given the variety of potential mechanism interplaying in the internal erosion of dams with cores of glacial till, it lend confidence to an assessment approach which addresses, susceptibility to several mechanisms.

40|$|Internal erosion often {{occurs when}} seepage flow is {{concentrated}} into a small, unprotected opening. One such example is where sandy soil is eroded through a defect in an overlying clay layer, {{resulting in a}} sand boil in the process. The erosion initiates through the heave and backward piping mechanisms and continues beneath the clay layer through the piping process, forming a pipe that progresses toward {{the source of the}} seepage. The initiation of erosion at the seepage flow concentration is a complex mechanism involving a number of hydraulic and soil mechanics principles, including: flow concentration, soil arching, heave, detachment of soil grains, and transportation of soil grains. A laboratory testing program is being performed to investigate the mechanisms of erosion into a concentrated, unprotected exit. The study builds upon previous research on the mechanisms of piping initiation performed at Utah State University and uses a similar apparatus. A number of different soils representing a range of grain size, grain shape, and gradations are being forced to erode into a range of constricted seepage exits.

40|$|Piping {{is one of}} the {{possible}} failure mechanism for dams and levees with a sandy foundation. Water flowing through the foundation causes the onset of grain transport, due to which shallow pipes are formed at the interface of the sandy layer and an impermeable blanket layer. In the past, the mechanism has been investigated predominantly in densely packed sands, in which the process was observed to start at the downstream side (<b>backward</b> <b>erosion).</b> Recently performed experiments in loose sand (van Beek et al. 2009) showed a different failure mechanism (forward erosion). In this article additional experiments of piping in loose sands are described for investigating the relevance of the forward process for practice. In these experiments the type of process was found to be dependent on the presence of shear resistance between sand box cover and top sand grains, that causes grains to be fixed geometrically. Without this shear resistance the process was found to be forward, whereas with this shear resistance the process was found to be backward oriented. The change in degree of fixity and relative density as a result of loading is investigated with electrical density measurements. The experiments show that the forward process is not relevant for levees in practice, in which the cohesive blanket layer causes the sand grains to be fixed properly...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to help better understand the effects of exit face inclinations on critical gradients. This will lead to more practical ways to predict critical hydraulic gradients and slope stability using soil properties and exit face conditions. Current geotechnical engineering does not consider these factors because they are not thoroughly understood. Despite the attempts to better predict critical gradients, methods developed over 70 years ago to model the heave mechanism are used to model failure mechanisms such as <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> (or piping). This critical hydraulic gradient is only calculated by means of the buoyant unit weight of the soil. While modern engineering estimates critical piping gradients near unity, research has shown that calculated critical gradients can largely under-predict actual piping gradients. The results of this thesis research will help provide an empirical, but mechanism-based, grain-scale model that takes into account the effect of non-horizontal exit faces, and soil properties while assessing the potential for piping initiation to occur. This research is expected to help the understanding of the internal erosion mechanism known as piping, and eventually help to develop more practical ways of predicting and preventing conditions which are susceptible to this type of erosion. This research should be used to initiate more research, develop better methods, and eventually increase public safety with regards to designing and improving earth structures such as dams and levees...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â The {{internal}} erosion of soil results from seepage flow. It {{appears to be}} the main cause of severe hydraulic failure for dams and dikes. All around the world, 46 % of dams present a risk of {{internal erosion}}. In France, 70 critical cases have already been detected. When internal erosion is suspected, the delay to failure is hardly predictable. Then, authorities should be able to develop effective emergency action plans to prevent casualties. Previously, it is necessary to understand phenomena of internal erosion. Three main processes can be identified: <b>backward</b> <b>erosion,</b> concentrated leak and suffusion. Suffusion is the process where the fine particles of the soil are eroded. A state of the art {{can be found in the}} literature and several laboratory studies have been carried out on the subject of suffusion but mainly with the development of the Hole Erosion Tests (HET). In this paper, we present a new experimental device named Cross Erosion Test (CET), which is devoted to the measurement of the initiation of the suffusion. The test consists of the injection, in a first drilling, of clear water and the recovery, in another drilling, of water charged with particles. In a first part, this experiment is calibrated with a numerical simulation. In a second part some preliminary experimental results are analysed. Concluding remarks show the possibility to characterize internal suffusion into a specific soil. This technique can be transposable, in-situ, to consider risks of internal erosion on dams and dikes...|$|E
40|$|Piping {{failure of}} levees {{is one of}} the main {{contributors}} to flood risk. Piping occurs when the head difference over a levee results in uplift of the inland blanket, followed by <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> in the aquifer due to high local flow velocities. Whether piping occurs, highly depends on local geo-hydrological circumstances which are uncertain due to a combination of high soil variability and limited site investigation. Fragility curves, which show the failure probability as a function of water level, are increasingly used for risk assessment of levees to address this uncertainty. The objective of this paper is to show how pore water pressure measurements and visual field observations reduce or increase the calculated failure probability of a levee. The Francis levee in Mississippi (USA) is used to show the effects since this levee is historically known for being very piping sensitive. The first step is to construct fragility curves based on analytical piping models. The second step consists of using historic piezometer data to update knowledge about aquifer and blanket properties. The final step is to use historic seepage observations and sand boils to update the fragility curve. This paper shows that measurements and observations can significantly reduce the geo-hydrological uncertainties regarding a piping-sensitive subsoil. The failure probability of the Francis levees increased with a factor 10 after incorporation of all the data. This increases the prediction accuracy of levee performance at high water levels and subsequently the estimation of whether it may require reinforcement or not...|$|E
40|$|<b>Backward</b> <b>erosion</b> piping (BEP) {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of seepage {{failures}} in levees. Seepage fields dictate the BEP behaviors and are influenced by the heterogeneity of soil properties. To investigate the effects of the heterogeneity on the seepage failures, we develop a numerical algorithm and conduct simulations to study BEP progressions in geologic media with spatially stochastic parameters. Specifically, the void ratio e, the hydraulic conductivity k, and the ratio of the particle contents r of the media are represented as the stochastic variables. They are characterized by means and variances, the spatial correlation structures, and the cross correlation between variables. Results of the simulations reveal that the heterogeneity accelerates the development of preferential flow paths, which profoundly increase the likelihood of seepage failures. To account for unknown heterogeneity, we define the probability of the seepage instability (PI) to evaluate the failure potential of a given site. Using Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS), we demonstrate that the PI value is significantly influenced by the mean and the variance of ln k and its spatial correlation scales. But the other parameters, such as means and variances of e and r, and their cross correlation, have minor impacts. Based on PI analyses, we introduce a risk rating system to classify the field into different regions according to risk levels. This rating system is useful for seepage failures prevention and assists decision making when BEP occurs...|$|E
40|$|Dams and dikes {{are both}} water-retaining earth embankments. These are {{vulnerable}} to internal erosion but specific differences lead to varying vulnerabilities to different types of internal erosion: â¢ Dams are usually zoned, with potential filtering capability to arrest piping if it is initiated, while dikes are more commonly unzoned and incapable of arresting erosion. â¢ Dams are usually higher than dikes, therefore the pressures are higher and leakages are more damaging. â¢ Dams have usually been built to their present height in one stage, dikes have often been improved over time, with a present crest height considerably higher than the initial height. In case of a significant raise, the original design assumptions no longer apply and modifications to the existing structure to provide sufficient safety may be costly. â¢ Dams have a limited crest length, while dikes may extend for hundreds of kilometres. This poses quite different possibilities and challenges for inspection and monitoring. â¢ Dams are built across a stream to block it, while dikes are built along it and only guide the stream. For the design and construction of dams the flow must be sufficiently blocked, including through the foundation. Many dikes on untreated sandy foundations {{are vulnerable to}} <b>backward</b> <b>erosion.</b> â¢ Dams always require provisions to pass the flow, for dikes this is rare. Concentrated leak erosion along culverts and spillways often {{poses a threat to}} dams but rarely to dikes. Each of the above points will be illustrated by practical cases, focusing on the various mechanisms of internal erosion which are dealt with first...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{extension}} of previous work which characterises soil behaviours using the grading entropy diagram. The present work looks at the piping process in granular soils, by considering some new data from flood-protection dikes. The piping process is divided into three parts here: particle movement at the micro scale to segregate free water; sand boil development (which is the initiation of the pipe), and pipe growth. In {{the first part of the}} process, which occurs during the rising flood, the increase in shear stress along the dike base may cause segregation of water into micro pipes if the subsoil in the dike base is relatively loose. This occurs at the maximum dike base shear stress level (ratio of shear stress and strength) zone which is close to the toe. In the second part of the process, the shear strain increment causes a sudden, asymmetric slide and cracking of the dike leading to the localized excess pore pressure, liquefaction and the formation of a sand boil. In the third part of the process, the soil erosion initiated through the sand boil continues, and the pipe grows. The piping in the Hungarian dikes often occurs in a two-layer system; where the base layer is coarser with higher permeability and the cover layer is finer with lower permeability. The new data presented here show that the soils ejected from the sand boils are generally silty sands and sands, which are prone to both erosion (on the basis of the entropy criterion) and liquefaction. They originate from the cover layer which is basically identical to the soil used in the Dutch <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> experiments...|$|E
40|$|Research to {{the failure}} {{mechanism}} piping (internal, <b>backward</b> <b>erosion)</b> in the Netherlands shows that the dikes require costly berms to meet the required safety standards. According to the Sellmeijer piping-formula, the d 70 (70 %-quantile of the grain size distribution by weight) is an important parameter in the resistance against piping. Therefore a better insight in the d 70 variability in the naturally deposited sand layers beneath dikes is of great importance. High density site measurements (5 x 5 meter spacing) give insight in local heterogeneity of the d 70 and the implications for representative design values. Three test sites were developed at locations with distinct geomorphological deposits. The spatial variability in the d 70 appears to be large. Despite {{the large amount of}} data at a very dense measurement grid, there is no obvious spatial correlation in the measurements. The sites have a similar or larger coefficient of variation than the much sparser regional datasets that are normally used to derive the representative d 70. Current regulations prescribe the characteristic (5 % lower bound) value as the design parameter in the piping formula. Considering the large variation in d 70 values this approach may not be appropriate. Given the influence of the d 70 on dike dimensions, hence investment costs, establishing a method for determining a representative d 70 value is important. We recommend to develop more sites at distinct geomorphological deposits to gain insight in the spatial variability in grain size distribution and to determine design values with matching site sampling requirements. An important aspect of further research is the interaction between d 70 variability and the physical development of the piping channel...|$|E
40|$|Sediment starved passive margins, {{particularly}} those of insular slopes, display significant mass transport activity {{despite the absence of}} environmental stresses from high sedimentation rates. The âMenorca Channelâ represents the up to 120 m deep shelf sector connecting the Menorca and Mallorca Islands (Balearic Islands â Western Mediterranean). South of the Menorca Channel submarine gravitational processes have been mapped and interpreted from swath-bathymetry, TOPAS parametric echosounder and deep-towed videos. The shelf-break is located at an average depth of 140 m, and sediment instability is a widespread phenomenon. The slope region south the Menorca Channel shows a number of submarine canyons disrupting the outer shelf. The north-easternmost canyon is the more active feature, with an incised axis and scars shaping the flanks up to their edges. Headwall scarps, between 140 and 700 m depth, are up to 20 m high. The shallower scarps producing slab-type failures have carved the outer edges of planar sedimentary bodies interpreted as formed in shallow environments during previous glacial stages. Results show that a variety of sediment instability processes extensively shape the southern upper slope of the Menorca Channel. Submarine canyons develop on the Emile Bodout Escarpment (EBE), a passive tectonic feature which bounds the slope region of the study area. A number of knickpoints within the canyons suggest <b>backward</b> <b>erosion</b> control on mass wasting and, at the same time, that slope failure {{is one of the main}} drivers for canyon upslope migration. Steep gradients of the upper slope, the presence of weak layers and the action of major storms during lowstand stages are additional factors likely to influence the distribution and frequency of mass wasting processes in this area...|$|E
