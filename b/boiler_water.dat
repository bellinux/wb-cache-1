5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E

25|$|A {{steam shovel}} {{is a large}} steam-powered {{excavating}} machine designed for lifting and moving material such as rock and soil, typically in the mining industry. The steam shovel is composed of a bucket, boom and 'dipper stick', <b>boiler,</b> <b>water</b> tank and coal bunker, a steam engine, and a winch. The steam shovel was invented in 1835 by William Otis, later receiving a patent for his invention on February 24, 1839.|$|E
25|$|The first boilers {{suffered}} {{problems with}} the superheaters and with poor circulation for the tube rows in {{the centre of the}} bank, leading to overheating and tube failure. The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the feedwater pipes and by placing baffles inside the steam drum, so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation augmenter, a steel trough, was placed over the tops of the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging steam bubbles to escape and acting as a steam separator before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of top feed for steam locomotives, the feedwater was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the steam space as droplets. The cold feedwater was thus heated to the same temperature as the <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the circulation path.|$|E

25|$|Explorer was {{designed}} to be virtually fireproof and collision-proof. Of the materials used to construct her, 99.5 percent were fireproof, and Johns-Manville asbestos Flexboard paneling covered all of her interior spaces. She was built of heavy steel, and her hull plating and internal subdivision was almost twice that required for a ship of her class, greatly reducing her vulnerability to flooding {{in the event of a}} collision. Eight transverse bulkheads extending up to the main deck divided her into nine watertight compartments, and she {{was designed}} to withstand the flooding of two of the compartments without sinking; only three of the bulkheads were pierced by openings, and these could be sealed by closing electrically driven watertight doors operated from the bridge. To protect her hull from penetration by ice or rocks, Explorer had a double bottom and a 0.5-inch (12.7-mm) steel belt plate along her sides that extended six feet (1.8 meters) above and below the waterline. She was designed for six-month independent deployments, with the capability to service smaller vessels and shore stations. Explorer was equipped with a hospital, machine shop, electrical shop, carpenter shop, laundry, and marine garage. The accommodation for her crew and other embarked personnel were considered especially comfortable for the era. She could carry 99 tons of <b>boiler</b> <b>water,</b> 75 tons of drinking and cooking water, and 325 tons of fuel, giving her a cruising range of 7,000 nautical miles (8,056 statute miles; 12,964km) at a speed of 12 knots (13.8mph; 22.2km/hr).|$|E

2500|$|Rocket uses a multi-tubular boiler design. Previous {{locomotive}} boilers {{consisted of}} a single pipe surrounded by water (though the Lancashire Witch did have twin flues). Rocket has 25 copper fire-tubes that carry the hot exhaust gas from the firebox, through the wet boiler to the blast pipe and chimney. [...] This arrangement resulted in a greatly increased surface contact area of hot pipe with <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> when compared to a single large flue. Additionally, radiant heating from the enlarged separate firebox helped deliver a further increase in steaming and hence boiler efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|Low <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> did however {{have the}} {{advantage}} of shifting the blame off from the captain for demanding immediate speed following the landing, or the owners, for pushing the schedule so hard that the engineer felt compelled to keep steam up while the engines were off line. [...] Hunter makes the point that in 1838, when the spectacular explosion of the Moselle on the Ohio River near Cincinnati, caused a congressional investigation, that there was no existing body of knowledge or professional tradition for steamboat engineers. [...] By the time of the Senator explosion in 1875 and certainly by that of Annie Faxon in 1893, that would no longer have been true, and professional standards and skills would have been well established.|$|E
50|$|Package boilers are {{commonly}} called water or fire tube <b>Boilers.</b> <b>Water</b> tube <b>boilers</b> use convection heating, which draws {{the heat from}} the fire source, and passes against the generating tubes of the <b>boiler,</b> causing <b>water</b> inside those tubes to boil off into steam. The fire tube boiler arrangement utilizes conduction heating which transfers heat from physical contact. Fire tube boilers are not commonly used due to their method of conduction heating because pipes in direct contact with fire and cold water could damage the pipes. The package boiler is usually a two or three-pass fire-tube boiler with an internal furnace tube. This is similar to the much earlier Scotch boiler.|$|R

The modularization of the software design of the system disposition configuration, control points configuration, reports and trend curve and etc. were realized.

Entire water treatment system consists of plenty of equipments and many complex operating steps. And most operations are about valves. If switches and water-quality indicators are both controlled by hand, it increases not only the labor of staff, but also the possibility of wrong operation. Thus it is difficult to guarantee the security and scientificalness of the treatment system. Running status and water quality of traditional system can’t reach optimization [3].

50|$|An {{external}} belt of {{a channel}} plate riveted {{around the outside}} of the shell {{at the level of the}} upper tubeplate formed an additional steam and water space, linked below the water level by drilled holes through the shell. The <b>boiler's</b> operating <b>water</b> level was always maintained within this belt space, keeping the tubes entirely submerged. Drawbacks to this system were that the area of the water surface was reduced, leading to both an increased risk of priming and also the need to carefully maintain the <b>boiler's</b> <b>water</b> level; the ratio of volume to height becoming smaller in the belt region, a relatively small change in water volume produces a large change in level.|$|R
2500|$|When coal is {{used for}} {{electricity}} generation, it is usually pulverized and then burned in a furnace with a boiler. The furnace heat converts <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> to steam, which is then used to spin turbines which turn generators and create electricity. The thermodynamic efficiency of this process has been improved over time; some older coal-fired power stations have thermal efficiencies {{in the vicinity of}} 25% whereas the newest supercritical and [...] "ultra-supercritical" [...] steam cycle turbines, operating at temperatures over 600°C and pressures over 27 MPa (over 3900 psi), can achieve thermal efficiencies in excess of 45% (LHV basis) using anthracite fuel, or around 43% (LHV basis) even when using lower-grade lignite fuel. Further thermal efficiency improvements are also achievable by improved pre-drying (especially relevant with high-moisture fuel such as lignite or biomass) and cooling technologies.|$|E
2500|$|The Senator explosion, as {{with the}} Gazelle 21 years before, was blamed on her engineer's having allowed low water in her boilers, so that when her engines were shut off, steam {{pressure}} built up too quickly, causing boiler failure. [...] Low water in the boiler was a situation where flames and hot gases from the firebox were allowed to have {{direct contact with the}} metal boiler tubes and other critical components when there should have been a barrier of water preventing this. [...] The result would be either weakening of the metal over time or too quick a buildup in steam pressure, either one causing failure of the boiler jacket, that is, an explosion. [...] Hunter, in his thorough survey on the subject, cautions however that low <b>boiler</b> <b>water,</b> while often a cause of an explosion, was not always a good enough explanation, and that it had been shown by experiments as early as 1836 that a well-filled boiler could still explode, and that overheating caused by low water in the boiler frequently but not always led to an explosion.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{there is}} {{continuous}} withdrawal of steam and continuous {{return of condensate}} to the boiler, losses due to blowdown and leakages {{have to be made}} up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous make-up water is added to the <b>boiler</b> <b>water</b> system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of calcium and magnesium salts which impart hardness to the water. Hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers. [...] Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form pure water. Very pure DM water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{cogeneration}} plants normally {{operate at}} much lower boiler pressures than utilities. Among the reasons are: 1) Cogeneration plants face possible contamination of returned condensate. Because <b>boiler</b> feed <b>water</b> from cogeneration plants has much lower return rates than 100% condensing power plants, industries usually {{have to treat}} proportionately more <b>boiler</b> make up <b>water.</b> <b>Boiler</b> feed <b>water</b> must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized, and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water. 2) Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry, which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure. 3) Utilities {{are less likely to}} have sharp load swings than industrial operations, which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand.|$|R
