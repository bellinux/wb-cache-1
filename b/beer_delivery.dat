2500|$|Coll {{was raised}} in The Bronx by an elderly woman who took him in as her own. At age 12, Coll was first sent to a reform school. After being {{expelled}} from multiple Catholic reform schools, he joined The Gophers street gang. Run-ins with the law were almost inevitable. Vincent soon developed {{a reputation for being}} a wild child of the streets and began the first of several stints in Catholic reform school before he reached his teens. For example, at age 12 he was arrested for unlawful entry and sent to a Catholic reform school. Four years later he was arrested for carrying a gun, and by the age of 23 he had been arrested a dozen times. In the late 1920s he started working as an armed guard for the illegal <b>beer</b> <b>delivery</b> trucks of Dutch Schultz's mob.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Allied Lyons sold a 50 {{per cent}} {{stake in the}} company to Carlsberg. The brewery opened a museum on 19 March 1994. The {{attraction}} proved popular; however, redevelopment of the land surrounding the brewery led to the attraction's closure on 7 April 2000. The building is now bars and restaurants. By 1996, sales of Tetley Bitter were overtaken by sales of John Smith's, and the product has retained the number two ale position ever since. This is largely attributed to Tetley's ineffective marketing campaigns. In 1998 Tetley's was fully taken over by Carlsberg. In 2004 Tetley was dropped from the Carlsberg-Tetley name. The company is now called Carlsberg UK Limited and is a part of Carlsberg AS group. In 2006, Tetley's sold 185million pints of beer in pubs. In the same year, the brewery's dray horses, which had made <b>beer</b> <b>deliveries</b> to pubs around Leeds, were retired.|$|R
50|$|Ferolito {{joined with}} partner Don Vultaggio in the 1970s to {{establish}} a Brooklyn-based discount <b>beer</b> and soda <b>delivery</b> company, starting with a used Volkswagen bus and adding trucks as the business grew. The company ventured into flavored seltzer and its own brand of malt liquor in its early years. AriZona Iced Tea, the company's flagship product, was first introduced in 1992.|$|R
5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{of the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century, and emergency laws aimed at restricting drinking during the First World War created difficult trading conditions for brewers. In 1919 net profit was reported at £22,325 (£900,000 at 2010 prices). Samuel Wentworth Webster, a director of the company and grandson of the founder, died in 1928 with a personalty of £45,000 (£2.2million in 2010). In 1928, one of the brewery's most successful beers was launched; Webster's Green Label, a light mild ale. In 1929 the company's entire stock of properties, land and brewery buildings was valued at £468,833 (£23.2million in 2010). The company took over Joseph Stocks of Halifax in December 1932, which could trace its origins back to 1790. In 1957, Webster's took over the brewer, John Ainley & Sons of Huddersfield and Woodhead Brothers of Elland, near Halifax, a mineral water manufacturer. The company dray horses, used for local <b>beer</b> <b>deliveries,</b> were retired by the end of the 1950s. In 1961 Webster's bought Daniel Fielding & Sons of Halifax, which added 19 public houses to their tied estate. The same year the company sought out partnership with the national brewer Watney Mann in order to benefit from the technical knowledge of the much larger company. In return Webster's brewed and sold the brewery conditioned Watney's Red Barrel ale throughout their tied estate. In 1962, a reciprocal trading agreement was reached with Ind Coope's North East division which saw Webster's houses stock lager for the first time. That same year the group won the contract to bottle Tuborg for West Yorkshire.|$|R

They step inside and it {{transports}} them to a land where everyone acts like they are in a pornographic film. The police arrest them, led by Rod Cannon (Scott Caan) but they escape and are hidden from the police by Bambi Cummings (Rachel Specter) at her sorority house, Tri-Pi.|$|R
2500|$|The {{expression}} [...] "bright beer" [...] {{is commonly}} used, particularly by older established breweries, for any filtered and pasteurised beer. [...] However, the expression [...] "re-racked beer" [...] should {{be reserved for}} beer which has been racked off (decanted) from a cask of cask-conditioned <b>beer</b> immediately before <b>delivery</b> to the venue {{where it will be}} served. [...] It is often regarded as [...] "real ale" [...] because it does still contain some residual yeast, albeit a very small amount, and is otherwise handled exactly as is real ale. [...] Because there is only a very small amount of yeast, there is very little secondary fermentation, and re-racked beer has a very short shelf life of two or three days.|$|R

50|$|Detroit Beer Co. has an {{extensive}} selection of award winning ales and lagers that are brewed on-site. The brewhouse was constructed {{to fit the}} space requirements of the historic Hartz building; the basement houses four fermentation tanks. The design of the brewhouse, along with the sophisticated <b>beer</b> <b>delivery</b> system, permits the brewery to offer up to 8 house beers on tap at any time. The brewmaster, Kevin Rodger, oversees the brewery operation.|$|E

It then follows him picking up his girlfriend from a diner and taking her to a late night barn party where he performs. The video also follows {{a group of men}} stealing a keg from a <b>beer</b> <b>delivery</b> truck driver and taking it to said party.|$|E

5000|$|Eugene O'Keefe, {{a wealthy}} banker, {{purchased}} the Hannath & Hart Brewery in 1862. By 1864, {{one of his}} partners had died, while the other Patrick Cosgrave left to found his own brewery. The business was renamed O'Keefe and Company. It {{was the first to}} produce lager beer in Canada along with the traditional ale and porter. [...] In 1891 the company was incorporated as O'Keefe Brewing Company Limited. In 1911 another new brewery was built with an annual capacity of 500,000 barrels. [...] O'Keefe {{was one of the first}} to use trucks for <b>beer</b> <b>delivery,</b> the first to build a mechanically refrigerated warehouse, and one of the first to advertise extensively.|$|E
5000|$|In 1957, [...] "A Pub With No Beer" [...] {{became the}} first Australian single to become a gold record and was the biggest-selling record by an Australian at the time. It was the first single by an Australian artist to enter the British charts, {{reaching}} number three. In 1959, Dusty wrote and recorded a sequel [...] "The Answer To A Pub With No Beer", explaining {{the reason for the}} <b>beer</b> <b>delivery</b> truck's failure to arrive and describing the townsmen's efforts to solve the problem. Another sequel, [...] "The Sequel To A Pub With No Beer", shows that the town now has a guaranteed delivery, thanks to air freight.|$|E
5000|$|... icehouse: a {{term used}} in the San Antonio area to mean a {{convenience}} store. Elsewhere, this denotes an open-air tavern, the origin of which {{dates back to the}} times when fresh beer was stored in [...] "ice houses" [...] placed strategically along <b>beer</b> <b>delivery</b> routes for local and regional delivery. Over time these locations began to serve cold beer, since it was stored there already, and other conveniences, such as food items, cigarettes, etc. In more modern times, the surviving ice houses are little more than open air beer bars. It is the [...] "open air" [...] feature (often obtained with multiple garage doors in place of walls), in fact, that distinguishes an ice house from a tavern.|$|E

5000|$|Tubb {{was born}} on a cotton farm near Crisp, in Ellis County, Texas (now a ghost town). His father was a sharecropper, so Tubb spent his youth working on farms {{throughout}} the state. He was inspired by Jimmie Rodgers and spent his spare time learning to sing, yodel, and play the guitar. At age 19, {{he took a job}} as a singer on San Antonio radio station KONO-AM. The pay was low so Tubb also dug ditches for the Works Progress Administration and then clerked at a drug store. In 1939 he moved to San Angelo, Texas and was hired to do a 15-minute afternoon live show on radio station KGKL-AM. He drove a <b>beer</b> <b>delivery</b> truck in order to support himself during this time, and during World War II he wrote and recorded a song titled [...] "Beautiful San Angelo".|$|E

The award makes Drew feel like he has wasted his life and he convinces his friends Kate (Christa Miller), Lewis (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald (Diedrich Bader) to take a trip to New York City in the Buzz <b>Beer</b> <b>delivery</b> truck, so they can watch a baseball game. Once they {{make it to the}} city, the gang become stuck in a large traffic jam.

Once the traffic clears, the gang realise the truck is out of fuel.|$|E
50|$|Originally from Texas, {{and later}} Pomona, California, Dávila took up boxing {{at the age}} of 12, and worked out daily at a boxing gym for six years. He {{graduated}} from Pomona Garey High School. In his professional debut, on March 1, 1973, Dávila defeated Carlos Villareal in a four-round bout decided on points. After 13 consecutive victories, he lost for the first time against Cecil Escobido in July 1974 by a split decision. Dávila boxed with many of the best boxers of the bantamweight division during the following years. He beat Lupe Pintor by a 10-round decision in 1976, and lost to Wilfredo Gómez by a knockout in Puerto Rico, the first fight in which he was knocked out. In 1978, Dávila challenged Carlos Zarate for the WBC's world title, losing by a knockout. Later that year, he fought for the World Boxing Association championship against Panama's Jorge Luján. The bout took place in the Louisiana Superdome, and was part of the undercard for a world heavyweight championship fight between Muhammad Ali and Leon Spinks. The 15-round fight ended in a decision victory for Luján. After Pintor beat Zarate for the WBC title, Dávila was given a second chance at that belt in a 1980 rematch with the Mexican world champion, and lost by a 15-round decision. At one point, he retired from boxing for a time, working as a <b>beer</b> <b>delivery</b> man. Dávila was inactive for all of 1981, returning in early 1982 and going seven fights without a loss through April 1983.|$|E
40|$|The {{graduation}} thesis {{deals with}} the use of logistics in the brewery Pivovar Protivín a. s. The paper presents a view of the current situation of Czech breweries in the Czech Republic {{as well as in the}} world. It maps the trends of recent years in the brewing industry and shows how Czech breweries have faced up the economic crisis. The results of Pivovar Protivín are presented and compared with the results of Svijany brewery. The distribution of Protivín brewery products is analyzed. Based on the analysis, the time frame of <b>beer</b> <b>delivery</b> to customers is made. Further on, the questions of the packaging management in Protivín brewery are dealt with. Breweries are specific for complex and expensive reverse logistics of returnable packaging. The question whether producing beer in PET bottles would be appropriate for Protivín brewery is studied. Determining the level of services provided for brewery customers is examined. According to the results presented here, the greatest demands on services provided by breweries appeared to be those by the customers in gastronomy sphere. Based on the questionnaire investigation, the standards in providing brewing services were set together. Finally, I suggested possible improvements that should lead to cost savings, greater flexibility of operations and competitive advantages for the Protivín brewery as well as for the whole K Brewery Group...|$|E
