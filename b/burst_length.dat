One such bound is constrained to a maximum correctable cyclic <b>burst</b> <b>length</b> within every subblock, or equivalently a constraint on the minimum error free length or gap within every phased-burst. This bound, when reduced to the special case of a bound for single burst correction, is the Abramson bound (a corollary of the Hamming bound for burst-error correction) when the cyclic <b>burst</b> <b>length</b> is less than half the block length.|$|E

2500|$|Bursts always access an aligned {{block of}} BL {{consecutive}} words beginning on {{a multiple of}} BL. So, for example, a four-word burst access to any column address from four to seven will return words four to seven. The ordering, however, depends on the requested address, and the configured burst type option: sequential or interleaved. Typically, a memory controller will require one or the other. When the <b>burst</b> <b>length</b> is one or two, the burst type does not matter. For a <b>burst</b> <b>length</b> of one, the requested word is the only word accessed. For a <b>burst</b> <b>length</b> of two, the requested word is accessed first, and the other word in the aligned block is accessed second. [...] This is the following word if an even address was specified, and the previous word if an odd address was specified.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{sequential}} burst mode, later {{words are}} accessed in increasing address order, wrapping {{back to the}} start of the block when the end is reached. So, for example, for a <b>burst</b> <b>length</b> of four, and a requested column address of five, the words would be accessed in the order 5-6-7-4. If the <b>burst</b> <b>length</b> were eight, the access order would be 5-6-7-0-1-2-3-4. This is done by adding a counter to the column address, and ignoring carries past the <b>burst</b> <b>length.</b> The interleaved burst mode computes the address using an exclusive or operation between the counter and the address. [...] Using the same starting address of five, a four-word burst would return words in the order 5-4-7-6. [...] An eight-word burst would be 5-4-7-6-1-0-3-2. [...] Although more confusing to humans, this can be easier to implement in hardware, and is preferred by Intel for its microprocessors.|$|E
