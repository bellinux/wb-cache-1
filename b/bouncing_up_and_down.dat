500|$|The {{official}} West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club {{was founded}} on 4 October 1951. In the years since then, over 30 branches have been established throughout the United Kingdom and in Jersey, Ireland, Malta, India, Thailand and Australia. There is also a branch for fans with disabilities and a Punjabi supporters' club named Apna Albion. Albion's [...] "club anthem" [...] is The Lord's my Shepherd, a setting of Psalm 23. [...] Supporters of the team celebrate goals by <b>bouncing</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> and chanting [...] "Boing Boing". This {{dates back to the}} 1992–93 season, when the team was promoted from the new Second Division. [...] "The Liquidator" [...] instrumental by the Harry J. Allstars has also been popularly used in the stadium since the late 1960s. In recent years fans of the team have celebrated the end of each season by adopting a fancy dress theme for the final away match, including dressing as vikings in 2004 in honour of Player of the Season Thomas Gaardsøe.|$|E
500|$|During Cleveland's {{audition}} for The Bachelorette, an unused scene was created that showed both Peter and Cleveland naked, with Peter {{sitting on top}} of Cleveland and <b>bouncing</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> as if he and Cleveland were engaging in anal sex, but broadcasting standards prohibited the scene. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane comments in the DVD commentary that Walter Murphy, who composes much of the music for Family Guy, goes back and forth from standard Family Guy music to Bachelorette-style music during the episode. During the sequence where Brian and Brooke are talking in the barn, originally, the two horses in the background were intended to begin mating, but the sketch was never used. Nancy Cartwright, voice actor of Bart Simpson on The Simpsons, and Michael Bell, voice actor of Chaz Finster on Rugrats, provided their voices for the Snorks reference. The name of Quagmire's cat was originally [...] "Pussy", but broadcasting standards objected. The episode was originally to feature a sequence showing Chris breaking entry into Goldman's Pharmacy in order to destroy the acne medication wearing a Balaclava, but the scene was never shown. The promo features Quagmire in a limo finding the girl of his dreams, but the scene was also cut.|$|E

500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. I noticed that the No. 1 engine was <b>bouncing</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> quite a bit and just about the time the aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, I thought he was going to come back to the airport." ...|$|E
500|$|Soft & Cuddly was {{developed}} for The Power house by John George Jones. Jones had previously developed Go to Hell for Triple Six. Go to Hell was published in 1985 and featured [...] "...revolting, crude and downright vile images." [...] When interviewed by Sinclair User, in the October 1987 issue, the programmer was asked [...] "Whatever possessed you to write a game like Soft and Cuddly...". To this Jones responded, [...] "I didn't write the game because I'm a horrible person, I wrote it to amuse myself." [...] Jones also stated [...] "I love the reaction people give, I can't stand 'nice' inoffensive things...". The original version of the game was more gruesome; the babies were being torn apart rather than stretched and [...] "...the sheep was <b>bouncing</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on a corpse." [...] When asked how long he would retain interest in computers, Jones stated that he had already lost interest. Soft & Cuddly was released by The Power house during September 1987 in the United Kingdom. The game was later released in Spain {{during the first quarter}} of 1988. The game featured in a competition printed in the November 1987 issue of Sinclair User. The first prize was a day in the company of The Power House's staff including a trip to the London Dungeon. Other prize winners received a copy of Soft & Cuddly or a poster of the game's inlay artwork.|$|E

2500|$|This {{paid off}} by 1955–56, with a runners-up {{position}} achieved in Serie B which allowed Palermo to regain promotion. Palermo {{then became a}} sort of [...] "yo-yo club," [...] <b>bouncing</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> between the top two Italian leagues. AC Milan legend Ettore Puricelli took over as trainer for a period, and River Plate star Santiago Vernazza pulled on the colours of the rosanero, making an impressive record of 51 goals in 115 games which make him still today the second-best topscorer in the club history.|$|E
2500|$|Third, {{after the}} hammer strikes the string, the action must avoid an {{unwanted}} second blow, which could easily {{result from the}} hammer <b>bouncing</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> within the space confining it. In Cristofori's action, this was accomplished by two means. By lifting the intermediate lever with a jack that disengages in its highest position, the Cristofori action {{made it possible for}} the hammer to fall (after its initial blow) to a position considerably lower than the highest position to which the key had lifted it. By itself, this mechanism greatly reduces the chance of an unwanted second blow. In addition, the Cristofori action also included a check (also called [...] "back check"; M) that catches the hammer and holds it in a partially raised position until the player releases the key; the check also helped to prevent unwanted second blows.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II, {{the team}} {{returned}} to Serie A {{by winning the}} Serie B championship of 1947–48. The new Palermo squad featured players such as Czechoslovakian legend Čestmír Vycpálek who signed from Juventus alongside Conti, Carmelo Di Bella and Pavesi. Palermo played Serie A until they were relegated in 1954. Massive changes in the board, {{as well as the}} manager's job and the squad, proved successful and the club returned to Serie A in 1956. Palermo became a [...] "yo-yo club", <b>bouncing</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> between the top two Italian leagues. Several stars played for Palermo during this period, such as Argentine striker Santiago Vernazza (51 goals in 115 games with the Rosanero), goalkeepers Roberto Anzolin and Carlo Mattrel, Giuseppe Furino and Franco Causio. Palermo marked its best campaign in 1961–62 season, finishing in eighth place in Serie A. In 1963, however, they were relegated to Serie B, where they played for five seasons. Palermo played again in Serie A between 1968 and 1970.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that you sent me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and <b>bouncing</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E

Once he and a neighbor boy had gone to the pasture to fetch home the cows. Old Badge was there, and nothing would do but that they ride him. From the fence Kurt mounted to his broad back. Then the neighbor boy, full of the devil, had struck Old Badge with a stick. The horse set off at a gallop for home with Kurt, frantically holding on, <b>bouncing</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on his back. That had been the ride of Kurt's life.

Fits and fires were the pet afflictions, with a general massacre now and then by way of change. Nan was never tired of inventing fresh combinations, and Daisy followed her leader with blind admiration.
