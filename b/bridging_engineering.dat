40|$|Restoring {{vision to}} the blind {{has been an}} {{objective}} of several research teams {{for a number of}} years. It is known that spots of light [...] phosphenes [...] can be elicited by way of electrical stimulation of surviving retinal neurons. Beyond this, however, our understanding of prosthetic vision remains rudimentary. To advance the realisation of a clinically viable prosthesis for the blind, a versatile integrated circuit neurostimulator was designed, manufactured, and verified. The neurostimulator provides electrical stimuli to surviving neurons in the visual pathway, affording blind patients some form of patterned vision; besides other benefits (independence), this limited vision would let patients distinguish between day and night (resetting their circadian rhythm). This thesis presents the development of the neurostimulator, an interdisciplinary work <b>bridging</b> <b>engineering</b> and medicine. Features of the neurostimulator include: high-voltage CMOS transistors in key circuits, to prevent voltage compliance issues due to an unknown or changing combined tissue and electrode/tissue interface impedance; simultaneous stimulation using current sources and sinks, with return electrodes configured to provide maximum charge containment at each stimulation site; stimuli delivered to a two dimensional mosaic of hexagonally packed electrodes, multiplexing current sources and sinks to allow each electrode in the whole mosaic to become a stimulation site; electrode shorting to remove excess charge accumulated during each stimulation phase. Detailed electrical testing and characterisation verified that the neurostimulator performed as specified, and comparable to, or better than, other vision prostheses neurostimulators. In addition, results from several animal experiments verified that the neurostimulator can elicit electrically evoked visual responses. The features of the neurostimulator enable research into how simultaneous electrical stimulation affects the visual neural pathways; those research results could impact other neural prosthetics research and devices...|$|E

40|$|The idea to use AI {{in civil}} {{engineering}} {{is as old}} as AI. Since the 50 th, studies on AI applications in civil or <b>bridge</b> <b>engineering</b> have proliferated. Most of these studies have dealt with specialized isolated engineering subtasks. Few of the applications have been delivered to practitioners and were used to advance their work. This paper presents a model of the life-cycle flow of information in <b>bridge</b> <b>engineering</b> as an organizing framework for reviewing previous work on AI applications in <b>bridge</b> <b>engineering.</b> Several common patterns that emerge from the studies are summarized. A subsequent analysis of the status of the bridge stock in many countries suggests that a more integrated approach to AI applications may have a larger practical impact. Several practical areas that can benefit significantly from AI techniques are identified and several studies are proposed including the AI technology needed and the methodology according to which these applications should be developed. 1 Introd [...] ...|$|R
