25|$|Packaging is the {{operation}} {{to put the}} wine in the container in which it will be marketed. Over the ages it was kept in a barrel or cask and the client would fill his pitcher or bottle at the wine merchant. The appearance of the glass bottle revolutionized the world of wine. The absence of transfer and thus contact with the oxygen in the air has made a significant improvement {{to the quality of}} the product. Other containers have emerged: the brick from Tetra Pak, the bottle of polyethylene terephthalate or PET, the beverage can, and the <b>Bag-In-Box.</b> Their quality is in their chemical inertness in relation to wine and their hermetic character against oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Maturing {{can be done}} in a vat. It takes {{little time}} to clarify and to prepare the {{packaging}} (bottling or <b>Bag-In-Box)</b> but this may be extended by maturing of lees. This type of maturing consists of regularly adding fine lees in suspension in the wine. The dead yeast is used for the fine lees which digests itself (autolysis) giving the wine volume and body to support the fruitiness. This operation is called Bâtonnage or stirring and is traditionally done with a stick to agitate the lees {{at the bottom of the}} barrel. This technique needs to be well controlled, however, otherwise the wine may take on a Goût de réduit (Reduced taste) due to the activity of reductase sulphite from the yeast. This operation {{can be done in}} vats, as in Muscadet, barrels as in Burgundy and many chardonnays, or bottles as in champagne.|$|E
2500|$|Heinz ketchup is {{packaged}} in glass and plastic bottles of various sizes, {{as well as}} individual-serving condiment packets made of foil or plastic. Larger amounts of ketchup are packaged either in metal cans, rigid plastic jugs, flexible plastic bags and in <b>bag-in-box</b> format. The larger containers can be fitted with pumps or placed into dispensers for bulk service. A bag containing [...] is the largest offering intended for restaurants; an IBC tote containing [...] is sold to food manufacturers.|$|E

25|$|The {{first is}} to cool the wine to a {{negative}} temperature near freezing for several weeks. The potassium bitartrate crystals precipitate and can be removed by filtration prior to packaging in bottles or <b>bag-in-boxes.</b> This solution is costly in refrigeration energy and can negatively affect the organoleptic qualities of the wine.|$|R
50|$|Sidi Brahim is a {{range of}} branded wines {{produced}} in the Atlas mountains, first in Algeria, then in Morocco and now in Tunisia. The wines are blended and bottled or filled into <b>bag-in-boxes</b> in France, and are primarily sold there. It was the second-best selling foreign wine in France, behind Boulaouane (also a Castel brand), as of 2005. The production volume is around three million bottles annually. The wine has been named after the Battle of Sidi-Brahim (1845).|$|R
50|$|<b>Bag-in-box</b> {{packaging}} is less expensive, {{lighter and}} more environmentally friendly than glass-bottled wine, {{as well as}} being easier to transport and store. Typical <b>bag-in-box</b> containers hold one and a half to four 750 ml bottles of wine per box, though come a wide variety of volumes. The tap utilised by <b>bag-in-box</b> packaging greatly reduces oxidation of the wine during dispensing. Compared to wine in a bottle which should be consumed within hours or days of opening, <b>bag-in-box</b> wine is not subject to cork taint and will not spoil for approximately 3-4 weeks after breaking the seal.|$|E

50|$|A post-mix soda gun {{combines}} concentrated syrup from a <b>bag-in-box</b> and mixes it with filtered tap water, either carbonated or non-carbonated, at {{the point}} of expense. For a post-mix soda gun to function it must be connected to a <b>bag-in-box</b> system, including pumps, a chiller, water filtration system and a carbonator. Due to the complexity and expense of purchasing and configuring the entire system that runs the soda gun, in most cases the restaurant relies on their beverage supplier to supply the equipment and handle the installation and maintenance. A post-mix soda gun is able to supply any beverage product that can be dispensed in <b>bag-in-box</b> form that does not have pulp.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to present proposals and recommendations {{to increase the efficiency}} of wine logistics from Argentina to the Czech Republic. The bachelor thesis is divided into three chapters. The first one describes theoretically parts of wine logistics from Argentina regarding practical part of the thesis. The second chapter is focused on analysis of world, European and Czech wine market and furthermore analyses the results of survey held among Czech importers of wine from Argentina. The last chapter is concerned with the aim of this thesis, i. e., there are presented recommendations and proposals to make wine logistic from Argentina more effective. Third chapter is divided into two parts. In the first one are basic recommendations and the second one is focused specifically on proposal to import wine in <b>bag-in-boxes...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Bag-in-box</b> {{packaging}} can be {{made using}} form seal fill (FSF) technology, where the bags are manufactured on-line from reels of film, then the FlexTap is inserted then filled on an integral rotary head filler. This technology is currently limited to the packing of wine and soda fountain syrup products.|$|E
5000|$|Box wine (cask wine or boxed wine) is wine {{packaged}} in a <b>bag-in-box.</b> Wine {{is contained in}} a plastic [...] typically with an air-tight valve emerging from a protective corrugated fiberboard box. It serves {{as an alternative to}} traditional wine bottling in glass with a cork or synthetic seal. It is sometimes called goon or goon bag in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Baron de Lestac is a Bordeaux wine brand {{owned by}} Groupe Castel. Baron de Lestac is {{produced}} as a red wine (a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) {{and a white}} wine (a blend of Sauvignon and Sémillon), both Bordeaux AOC wines and produced with an influence of oak. The wine is sold {{in a variety of}} containers including bottles and <b>bag-in-box.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bomb is {{an energy}} drink created in 2009 in Hamilton, Ontario. It {{began as a}} BIB (<b>Bag-In-Box)</b> product for use by restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums and arenas. In 2013, Bomb Energy Drink became {{available}} in a 250 mL can in convenience and grocery stores and gas stations across Canada. On www.drinkbomb.com, the company's website, there is a partial list of where the beverage can be purchased.|$|E
5000|$|Aseptic {{containers}} may {{range in}} size from a few fluid ounces to a nearly [...] aseptic tank on an ocean-going ship. [...] Aseptic processing makes worldwide export and import of new, economical and safe food products possible. <b>Bag-In-Box</b> technology is commonly used because it provides strong containers that are lightweight and easy to handle prior to being filled. Other common package types are drink boxes and pouches.|$|E
50|$|Postmix {{refers to}} the system in which a flavored syrup (concentrate) of the soft drink is shipped to the retailer, usually in a {{returnable}} tank or a disposable <b>bag-in-box</b> container. At the point of sale, the soft drink is mixed to order from the postmix syrup, chilled and purified water, and carbon dioxide (from a gas cylinder), and usually dispensed from a soda fountain or soda gun.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bag-in-box</b> is {{also used}} {{extensively}} in the packaging of processed fruit and dairy products in aseptic processes. Using aseptic packaging equipment, products can be packed in aseptic packaging. Pasteurised or UHT treated products packed into this format can be [...] "shelf stable", requiring no refrigeration. Some products can have a shelf life of up to 2 years, {{depending on the type}} of bag that is used.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 2009 , Bomb Energy Drink {{separates}} {{itself from}} the competition with its unique <b>Bag-In-Box</b> format. This unique availability, coupled with its tart citrusy taste and value pricing had allowed it to rapidly expand {{its share of the}} Canadian market. Popularity of the beverage was furthered increased by their appearance on the Canadian edition of Dragons' Den [...] on January 2013. The pitch was unsuccessful.|$|E
5000|$|In the keg, fully made soda {{is stored}} under {{pressure}} just like standard cans and bottles. The soda {{is referred to}} as [...] "pre-mix" [...] in the industry, as compared to <b>Bag-In-Box</b> (BIB) packages which are concentrated syrup. BIB soda is cheaper but requires a high quality water source and well calibrated dispenser. Pre-mix soda costs more and takes up more space, but can be used anywhere, and the equipment is simpler and cheaper.|$|E
50|$|Most {{wines are}} {{filtered}} at some stage before bottling, although some winemakers use {{the absence of}} filtration as a marketing tool. Filtration serves to make wine completely clear and to eliminate any remaining yeast cells and bacteria, which could render the bottled wine microbiologically unstable. Wine is normally filled to glass bottles with cork stoppers, though aluminium screwcap closures and plastic stoppers are also common. Alternative containers such as <b>Bag-in-Box,</b> TetraPak and plastic bottles are also used.|$|E

A bag containing 3 gal is the largest offering intended for restaurants; an IBC tote containing 260 gal is sold to food manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|A soda {{fountain}} is {{a device}} that dispenses carbonated soft drinks, called fountain drinks. They {{can be found in}} restaurants, concession stands and other locations such as convenience stores. The device combines flavored syrup or syrup concentrate and carbon dioxide with chilled and purified water to make soft drinks, either manually, or in a vending machine which is essentially an automated soda fountain that is operated using a soda gun. Today, the syrup often is pumped from a special container called a <b>bag-in-box</b> (BIB).|$|E
50|$|In 1996, the City of Cincinnati's Health Department {{discovered}} {{high levels}} of coliformbacteria (due to inadequate daily cleansing) in the spigots of dispensers filled by automatic fresh brewed iced tea machines in several area restaurants. Approximately the same time, the Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola companies began aggressive targeted marketing campaigns aimed at replacing fresh brewed iced tea in food service establishments with the cola companies' own tea concentrate which is dispensed using the same method as fountain drinks, pumped from a <b>bag-in-box.</b> In many cases, the cola companies provided a fountain dispenser for the tea concentrate that looked similar to the containers that were previously used to dispense fresh brewed tea.|$|E
50|$|In September 2006, the Government of Ontario {{announced}} the Ontario Deposit Return Program, a recycling program for LCBO and winery store beverage alcohol containers. The program, which commenced operations on 5 February 2007, is administered {{and operated by}} Brewers Retail Inc. Under the program, consumers may return empty bottles, tetra paks, PET plastic and <b>bag-in-box</b> containers, to The Beer Store outlets. This program has been highly criticized {{by members of the}} public and employees of The Beer Store. Beer Stores were seeing upwards of 50,000 LCBO containers per week while the unprofitable nature of the program forced wage cuts and staff reductions across Ontario's primary beer distributor.|$|E

5000|$|Iced tea {{is usually}} {{prepared}} from bagged tea. In addition to tea bags and loose tea, powdered [...] "instant iced tea mix" [...] {{is available in}} stores. This is made by preparing tea and then dehydrating it, similar to instant coffee. Iced tea can be purchased, like soda, in canned or bottled form at vending machines and convenience stores; usually, this pre-made tea is sweetened with corn syrup, and sometimes some other flavoring, such as lemon or raspberry, is added. Also, like other soft drinks, it can be purchased as a fountain drink, though in some establishments it is pumped from a <b>Bag-In-Box,</b> and in others, it is simply poured from a separate container that contains freshly brewed tea.|$|E
50|$|Chameleon Cold-Brew offers {{ready to}} drink cold brew coffee. Its cold-brew coffee also comes in {{concentrate}} {{that can be}} made into cold brew coffee by adding water, milk or other liquids. Its products are made through a 16-hour brewing process that uses only fair trade, organic coffee, and limestone cured Texas Hill Country water for the brewing process. Its products are available in three main flavors; black, mocha, and vanilla. In 2015 it introduced three new ready-to-drink flavors (espresso, chicory and Mexican), which started as exclusives to Wholesale Foods Market. Other concentrate flavors that have been introduced are Caramel, Mocha and Texas Pecan. In 2016, Chameleon released its one-gallon <b>bag-in-box</b> black concentrate sold regionally. Chameleon Cold-Brew uses 100% recycled packaging for its products. It also ships using a carbon offset program through Green Mountain Energy.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>bag-in-box</b> or BiB {{is a type}} of {{container}} for the storage and transportation of liquids. It consists of a strong [...] (or plastic bag), usually made of several layers of metallised film or other plastics, seated inside a corrugated fiberboard box. The bag is supplied to the company which will fill it as an empty pre-made bag. The company filling the bag with its product generally removes the tap, fills the bag (with wine, juice or other liquid) and replaces the tap and then the bag is placed in the box. The bags are available as singles for semi-automatic machines or as web bags, where the bags have perforations between each one. These are used on automated filling systems where the bag is separated on line either before the bag is automatically filled or after. Depending on the end use {{there are a number of}} options that can be used on the bag instead of the tap. The bags can be filled from chilled product temperatures up to 85 degrees Celsius.|$|E
