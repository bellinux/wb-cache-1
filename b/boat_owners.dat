Officials set up 49shelters on the mainland to provide evacuees with food, clothing and medical attention. The Mexican Army assisted residents in evacuation, and the Navy provided medical aid and assistance to <b>boat</b> <b>owners.</b> More than 24,000people were sheltered during the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm surge}} flooded Fells Point and the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, causing {{millions}} of dollars of damage to waterfront properties. As the Inner Harbor began to flood, <b>boat</b> <b>owners</b> helped evacuate 35people in flooded homes. Winds from Isabel destroyed at least three buildings in the city. The Baltimore Museum of Industry alone suffered $1.5million in damage (2003USD, ($ USD). 70,000 were left without power in the city.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the storm, {{officials}} in China issued warnings for Zhejiang and Fujian {{for the potential}} of high winds and flooding, which was later credited for reducing casualties. The Chinese army was utilized to assist in mitigating against potential flooding. Officials told <b>boat</b> <b>owners</b> to put their property in shelter, totaling 65,000vessels ordered to return to report. Coastal facilities such as seaside bathing centers were closed. Before Fitow struck China, 177,000people evacuated in Fujian and a further 574,000 evacuated their houses in Zhejiang, totaling 751,000people. In Shanghai, 42train or bus rides were canceled, along with 40canceled flights. Two airports in Zhejiang had 49canceled flights, with another 20 canceled in Fujian.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Bermuda issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} island on September 8, which {{was followed by a}} tropical storm warning on September 9. These were replaced by a hurricane warning on September 10, coinciding with the storm's strengthening to hurricane intensity. The government urged the potentially impacted citizens to take preparations for the storm, many of whom bought supplies at local hardware stores. Residents installed storm shutters, while <b>boat</b> <b>owners</b> moved their yachts to safer locations. An emergency shelter was prepared on the island. Prior to the arrival of the storm, officials canceled bus and ferry service, and also closed all schools and {{government of}}fices on the day of impact. The Bermuda International Airport was also closed.|$|E
5|$|In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, {{feeding on}} algae, diatoms or detritus, {{but in a}} few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of Povilla burrow into {{submerged}} wood and {{can be a problem}} for <b>boat</b> <b>owners</b> in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs, the grazing of mayfly nymphs has {{a significant impact on the}} primary producers, the plants and algae, on the bed of streams and rivers.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days before}} the storm struck Florida, {{emergency}} management workers began working to prepare for its onslaught. The next day, the water levels in five lakes in Hillsborough County were decreased as a precaution. Residents prepared sandbags to prevent flooding along coastal areas, while <b>boat</b> <b>owners</b> worked to secure their boats. Some tourists near the southwest Florida coast left for areas further inland, though many stayed despite the storm. Red Cross officials opened six emergency shelters. Additionally, police departments in Clearwater, Indian Shores, and Largo expanded their workforce to handle storm-related problems. The storm resulted in the closure of some private schools {{as well as the}} Hillsborough Community College. About 21hours before Keith made its final landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning along the Florida west coast from Cape Sable to Cedar Key. The next day, a tropical storm warning was posted from Jupiter, Florida, north to Savannah, Georgia. A tropical storm warning was briefly issued for Bermuda, as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} the award depends on, in part, {{the value of the}} salved vessel, the degree of risk {{involved}} and the degree of peril the vessel was in. Legal disputes do arise from the claiming of salvage rights. To reduce the amount of a claim after an accident, <b>boat</b> <b>owners</b> or skippers often remain on board and in command of the vessel; they do everything possible to minimise further loss and seek to minimize the degree of risk the vessel is in. If another vessel offers a tow and the master or owner negotiates an hourly rate before accepting then salvage does not apply.|$|E
25|$|Dgħajjes {{are used}} daily as water taxis, from Birgu to Valletta. Today, only about 12 {{original}} dgħajjes survive, {{and they are}} used as a valuable means of transportation. Some of these have been motorized by diesel engines. The small number in existence {{is a result of}} the high maintenance costs and the fact that there are very few skilled carpenters who are capable of building these boats. The Koperattiva tal-Barklori is a co-operative of <b>boat</b> <b>owners</b> who try to preserve the few remaining dgħajsas. The oldest one still in existence is the Palomba, which was built over 150 years ago and has been restored.|$|E
25|$|Contractors Noel Fitzpatrick {{working for}} British Waterways managed {{to reopen the}} road {{within a week of}} the breach occurring. British Waterways {{announced}} on 5 November 2007 that a 16-mile (26km) stretch of the canal from Llanover to Llangynidr would be drained completely, so that a full inspection of the canal structure could be carried out. They stated that they were working with <b>boat</b> <b>owners</b> to move all boats to parts of the canal which would not be affected by this drainage, but that the towpath would remain open during this phase. Subsequently, they announced that a full geotechnical survey would be carried out, and that they expected the stretch to be closed for up to a year. Water levels on this section were reduced significantly, but engineers were then faced with the task of moving upwards of 100,000 fish before it could be drained fully.|$|E

25|$|Velator Quay and the {{surrounding}} area is used as a mooring for small boats. In 2006 Braunton council blocked vehicular access to the quay as it was found to be in danger of collapse. An engineering survey was conducted on the quay in 2010, by consultants Bolgar Sykes, as the council were hoping to make it more of an amenity. The survey revealed several possible options for repair, ranging in cost from £80,000 to £400,000. The limited budget available to the council for such work meant that only basic repairs were considered. A subsequent report by Peter Lord, one of the parish counsellors, recommended that demolition of the quay would be the best long-term option, with the provision of a slipway to assist <b>boat</b> <b>owners.</b> The quay is widely held to be a free port, this status having been awarded to Barnstaple seamen who fought against the Spanish Armada. However, the report highlighted {{the fact that this is}} likely to be just a local legend, as the quay was not constructed until 300 years after the event.|$|E
500|$|United States Navy {{officials}} in Norfolk ordered more than 40 destroyers, frigates, and amphibious ships {{out to sea}} to avoid any potential damage from the hurricane. Officials at the Langley Air Force Base in Hampton ordered about 6,000 workers to evacuate elsewhere, due to its vulnerability to flooding. About 350 National Guard workers assisted <b>boat</b> <b>owners</b> in the southeastern portion of the state. In Mathews County, two <b>boat</b> <b>owners</b> experienced fatal heart attacks as they worked to protect their boats. Officials distributed sandbags throughout the state for residents in flood-prone areas, including about 10,000 {{in the city of}} Alexandria. [...] Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel was closed, as were all campgrounds along the Blue Ridge Parkway and the primary parkway in Roanoke. In Chincoteague, the famous Chincoteague Ponies were moved by volunteer firefighters to grounds of about [...] higher. Officials closed schools, government offices, and businesses across the eastern portion of the state, leaving usually heavily congested roads as empty streets. Additionally, officials canceled trains along the Washington Metro, the Virginia Railway Express, and Amtrak lines, and several flights {{in and out of the}} Richmond International Airport.|$|E

50|$|Once the {{building}} of the boat is completed, the <b>boat's</b> <b>owner</b> will host a large launching ceremony. To celebrate, Tao women wear their agate beads necklaces and octagonal wooden hats a few days prior to the actual event. On the actual day of the launching ceremony, the Tao people gather and slaughter pigs as sacrifice, and the <b>boat</b> <b>owner</b> offers meat and taro to all of the families in his community. The men, dressed in traditional garb, circle the launching boat performing ceremonial rituals to ward off evil spirits before sending it into the water. They also throw the boat in the air several times prior to launch. The ceremony is deemed complete once the boat has remained afloat.|$|R
