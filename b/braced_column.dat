These moments could be produced by gravity loads or the lateral loads. First, the current paper presents a detailed analysis on the overall structural behavior of 15 eccentrically loaded columns as well as one concentrically loaded control one. Columns bent in either single curvature or double curvature modes are tested experimentally up to failure under the effect of different end eccentricities combinations. Three end eccentricities ratio were studied, namely, 0.1 b, 0.3 b and 0.5 b, where b is the column width. Second, an expression correlated the decay in the normalized axial capacity of the column and the acting end eccentricities was developed based on the experimental results and then verified against the available formula. Third, based on the equivalent column concept, the equivalent pin-ended columns were obtained for columns bent in either single or double curvature modes. And then, the effect of end eccentricity ratio was correlated to the equivalent column length. Finally, a simplified design procedure was proposed for eccentrically loaded <b>braced</b> <b>column</b> by transferring it to an equivalent axially loaded pin-ended slender column. The results of the proposed design procedure showed comparable results against the results of the ACI 318 - 14 code.|$|E

As an alternative solution, PVC drain pipes were replaced by steel pipes in reinforced concrete columns. The ultimate strength of the columns obtained from the present investigation is compared with the design strengths recommended by the British code of practice (BS 8110) and the American code of practice (ACI).

Inelastic analysis on <b>braced</b> <b>columns</b> have yielded higher bracing forces. To investigate the influence of inelastic behaviour of beams subject to lateral torsional buckling on the forces in a single lateral brace, geometrical and material non-linear analyses including imperfections (GMNIA) were performed on IPE 240 beams with different lengths, support conditions and types of loading. The location of the non-rigid lateral brace is varied along the length of the beam and along the height of the section. The stiffness of the lateral restraints was determined in such a way that the elastic critical moment is 95 % of the elastic critical moment with rigid lateral restraints.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the behaviour {{and design of}} unbraced rigid-jointed multi-storey steel frameworks subjected to combined vertical and horizontal loading. Design charts are presented which enable guidance to be given on whether the serviceability limit on sway or ultimate limit state under combined loading will be critical for the choice of sections in preliminary design. Parametric studies on forty-three multi-storey, multi-bay rectangular frameworks provide the verification of the Merchant-Rankine formula {{for the design of}} such frames. An alternative semi-empirical expression based on the study of the deterioration of overall frame stiffness has been developed. Comparison with the parametric study indicated a significant improvement on the Merchant-Rankine approach to estimate the failure load of frameworks. The expression has then been used as the basis of an approximate optimization procedure for the design of frames to satisfy ultimate strength under combined loading. An approximate hand method to trace the formation of plastic hinges has been developed. The method is applicable to single bay frames, and has also been extended to multi-bay frames. The latter are transformed into equivalent single bay frames. A computer analysis program for semi-rigid connections has been presented using the matrix displacement method. The technique is reduced to an analysis of a rigid-jointed framework by repeated modification of the load vector alone. The analysis program has been used to investigate the sway deflection of unbraced frames and the determination of the effective length of <b>braced</b> <b>columns...</b>|$|R

The strain state in contact zones and distribution patterns of contact pressure are extremely diverse. It depends on a number of factors affecting cohesion.

40|$|In seismic prone regions, {{buildings}} {{are designed to}} maintain sufficient stiffness during moderate earthquakes and to absorb and dissipate {{a large amount of}} the energy released due to severe earthquakes. The usual steel framing systems; the moment frames require larger member sections to satisfy stiffness requirements and have large ductility capacity, the concentrically braced frames satisfy stiffness on the expense of ductility requirements, resulting in poor energy dissipation. This study deals with the eccentrically Braced Steel Frames (EBF). EBF configuration is similar to traditional braced frames with the exception that at least one end of each brace must be eccentrically connected to the frame. The energy dissipation is achieved through the yielding of a beam segment called the link, while the other frame members, including outer beam segments, <b>braces</b> and <b>columns,</b> should remain essentially elastic. EBFs offer an economical steel framing system satisfying both stiffness and ductility requirements.

The dynamic characteristics, lateral deformation patterns, deterioration behavior, hysteretic behavior and failure mechanisms were investigated.

40|$|The {{local and}} distortional {{buckling}} behaviour of flange and web-stiffened compression members was investigated. In particular, the behaviour of web-perforated sections was investigated both numerically and experimentally. Perforation reduces the perpendicular flexural stiffness {{of the web}} and thus particularly reduces the distortional buckling strength of the section. The main task of the research {{was to develop a}} design method for estimating the compression capacity of a perforated steel wall-stud under centric loading. The influence of the gypsum sheathing on the distortional buckling strength is also taken into account. It was shown that the method given in Eurocode 3 is quite rough and sometimes gives inaccurate results for estimating the elastic distortional buckling stress of both C-sections and intermediate stiffened plates. In the case of C-sections, the method developed by Lau and Hancock and the method developed by Schafer and Peköz correlate better with the results defined numerically. The Finite Strip Method (FSM) and Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) provided particularly good tools with which to analyze local and distortional buckling modes. It was also shown that interaction between different distortional buckling modes should be taken into account when analysing sections having both web and flange stiffeners. Distortional buckling stress of the web-perforated C-section with or without web stiffeners can be determined by replacing the perforated web part with an equivalent plain plate corresponding to the same perpendicular bending stiffness. Distortional buckling stress may be determined by some numerical method such as FSM or GBT. For the web-perforated C-section, an analytical method for the distortional buckling is also presented. Gypsum sheathing connections give rotational restraint to the wall–stud, thus improving distortional buckling strength. Some practical guidelines are given for calculating the rotational restraint. Buckling analysis showed that relatively small restraint may double the distortional buckling stress of the web-perforated section. Buckling analysis and experimental research showed that screw pitch also has a considerable effect on the distortional buckling stress. Using restraint values given by the connection tests, the predicted values for the gypsum board <b>braced</b> <b>columns</b> are in good accordance with the test results. In practical design, utilizing the gypsum board in the determination of the distortional buckling stress requires that the sheathing retains its capacity and stiffness for the expected service life of the structure. Furthermore, the connection characteristics should be carefully examined. Based on the results of the experimental and theoretical studies, design proposals were made for the design of compressed web-perforated steel wall studs. Some practical guidelines were also given for taking into account the gypsum sheathing. These design proposals are also valid for solid steel wall studs, especially for slender sections, which are sensitive to distortional buckling. reviewe...|$|R
