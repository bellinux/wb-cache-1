40|$|Dynamic {{relaxation}} is a form-finding {{and analysis}} method that has proven its effectiveness {{in the context}} of tension/compression structures such as cable nets, membranes and tensegrity structures. Recently, however, an increasing interest in bending-active structures has stimulated researchers to include the effects of bending and torsion in the dynamic relaxation process, using either Three-Degree-of-Freedom (3 -DoF) <b>beam</b> <b>elements</b> (Barnes et al. [4]), or 4 -DoF <b>beam</b> <b>elements</b> (Du Peloux et al. [12], D’Amico et al. [10]), or 6 -DoF <b>beam</b> <b>elements</b> (Li and Knippers [13]). The stability and convergence speed of the dynamic relaxation solver depends on the choice of the fictitious masses for all degrees of freedom. Although 6 -DoF <b>beam</b> <b>elements</b> are in principle preferred over 3 -DoF and 4 -DoF <b>beam</b> <b>elements</b> because of their higher accuracy (D’Amico et al. [10]), their use in dynamic relaxation is hindered by the fact that no heuristic rules are available for the choice of the fictitious masses. In this paper the numerical stability of the dynamic relaxation solver is investigated for 6 -DoF <b>beam</b> <b>elements</b> using modal analysis. A fictitious mass matrix proportional to the stiffness matrix is put forward as the most suitable choice considering numerical stability and convergence, as it causes all eigenfrequencies of the structure to coincide. Moreover, it is shown that for this choice of mass matrix and a specific choice for the damping ratio and the time step, the dynamic relaxation method becomes identical to the Newton-Raphson method, which is well known for its fast convergence. For numerically challenging problems, the stability of the classic Newton-Raphson method can be improved by increasing the damping ratio and/or decreasing the time step. We applied the proposed approach to three test cases involving bending-active structures in order to verify its accuracy and convergence speed. The results show that the dynamic relaxation routine indeed converges in {{a very small number of}} iterations, while still maintaining the accuracy of 6 -DoF <b>beam</b> <b>elements.</b> The combination of high accuracy and low computation time makes this approach well-suited for both the form finding and the analysis of spatial structures undergoing large displacements. status: publishe...|$|R

The attention is mainly on the choice of shape functions that allow for free shear locking effects in slender beams. For this purpose, interdependent/anisoparametric interpolations are adopted to approximate the four independent kinematic variables. To achieve simpler (with a reduced number of nodal dofs) elements, a constraint condition on the axial variation of the effective transverse shear strain is adopted, which consists in reducing the polynomial degree of the shear strain measure (or, equivalently, the shear force), by one order. The issues investigated for the assessment are (i) shear locking, i. e., strategies for formulating shear-locking free C 0 refined zigzag <b>beam</b> <b>elements,</b> (ii) computational efficiency, and (iii) predictive capability and accuracy. Accuracy and predictive capabilities of the proposed class of higher-order <b>beam</b> <b>elements</b> are numerically assessed by analyzing cantilevered beams over a range of loading conditions, lamination sequences, heterogeneous material properties, and slenderness ratios.

50|$|To {{accommodate}} the low or zero bending stiffness problem, very early versions of Flexcom {{were based on}} a 2D hybrid beam-column element. In this approach the axial force appeared as an explicit nodal solution variable, and was interpolated independently of the axial strain. The stress-strain compatibility relationship was applied outside of the virtual work statement by means of a Lagrangian constraint. This proved an accurate approach, and was subsequently extended to three dimensions. Further developments resulted in the addition of an extra Lagrangian constraint on the torque degree of freedom, {{in order to make the}} scheme more robust and accurate when this variable plays a significant role in the solution.
