5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, {{a symbol of}} her indifference and wild power. It {{is not clear whether}} Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E
60|$|When {{the duchess}} appeared, I {{thought she looked}} handsomer by {{daylight}} than in the evening. She was dressed in white muslin, with a drab velvet basque slashed with satin of the same color. Her hair was confined by a gold and diamond net on the <b>back</b> part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} {{if we go}} off and leave him with her?--" [...] Mrs. Wix put the {{question}} to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pupil's <b>head.</b> [...] "It WON'T help him. It will be his ruin. He'll have got nothing. He'll have lost everything. It will be his utter destruction, for he's certain after a while to loathe her." ...|$|R
50|$|In July 2006, after {{attending}} a political {{meeting in the}} Harare suburb of Mabvuku, MP Trudy Stevenson was attacked and suffered panga wounds to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck and <b>head.</b> The MDC leadership immediately claimed that the attack {{was carried out by}} ZANU militants. However, while recovering in hospital, Stevenson identified her assailants as members of a rival faction of the MDC.|$|R
5|$|The last of {{the murders}} in the Whitechapel file was {{committed}} on Friday 13 February 1891 when prostitute Frances Coles was murdered under a railway arch. Her body was found by PC Ernest Thompson only moments after the attack at 2:15am at Swallow Gardens, a passageway under a railway arch between Chamber Street and Royal Mint Street, Whitechapel. Minor wounds on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> suggest that she was thrown violently to the ground before her throat was cut at least twice, {{from left to right}} and then back again. Otherwise there were no mutilations to the body. Superintendent Arnold and Inspector Reid arrived soon afterwards from the nearby Leman Street police station, and Chief Inspectors Donald Swanson and Henry Moore, who had been involved in the previous murder investigations, arrived by 5am. A man named James Sadler, who had been seen with Coles earlier, was arrested by the police and charged with her murder. A high-profile investigation by Swanson and Moore into Sadler's past history and his whereabouts {{at the time of the}} previous Whitechapel murders indicates that the police may have suspected him to be the Ripper. However, Sadler was released on 3 March for lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a bald spot on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{painting}} generally titled The Lady with an Ermine (about 1483) {{he sets the}} figure diagonally to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid {{of her head and}} across her breast and hand the light is diffused {{in such a way that}} the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.|$|E
60|$|As I gazed ruefully at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> haughty, royal <b>head</b> a {{gate at the}} {{opposite}} end of the garden opened and a man entered. As he did so he turned and slipped something into the hand of the yellow guardsman beyond the gate, nor was the distance too great that I might not see that money had passed between them.|$|R
50|$|When {{it became}} clear that Kaplan would not {{implicate}} any accomplices, she was executed in the Kremlin´s Alexander garden on September 3, 1918 with a bullet to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the <b>head.</b> <b>Her</b> corpse was bundled into a barrel, and set alight. The order came from Yakov Sverdlov who, just six weeks before, had ordered the execution of the tsar and his family.|$|R
50|$|On May 9, 1996, Nina Yefimova, 25-year-old, {{was found}} dead from a shot to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the <b>head.</b> <b>Her</b> 73-year-old mother was also killed, after they were both {{abducted}} from their apartment {{on the outskirts of}} Grozny. Yefimova's body was found the following morning in Grozny's Leninsky District, while her mother's was found that evening in a deserted canned food factory in Grozny.|$|R
25|$|Because of her {{dispute with}} the Daughters of Darkness Zoe is forced to stay the night and agrees to sleep with Jerome. Act 1 scene 2 begins the next morning with Jerome working on two short {{compositions}} using secretly sampled sounds of Zoe. The first, using her laugh, she finds entertaining although she suggests some changes. The second, using sounds of their love-making, horrify her and after arguing she exits in disgust, never to reappear. This leaves Jerome with nobody to act as though she is his fiancée at next week's meeting. As he experiments with using Nan to create new sounds, he suddenly has {{the idea of having}} Nan play the part instead of an actress. The act ends as he removes the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in preparation for re-programming.|$|E
25|$|The film {{features}} two {{allusions to}} Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on {{the back wall of}} the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember what she looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E
25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin {{was soft and}} moist, with muscles that still allowed for {{her arms and legs}} to flex at the joints. All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in her veins. There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Ana Beque de Packman at age sixty, 1942. Packman is shown from her upper torso to <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{and is looking}} straight ahead. She is wearing a loose-fitting, dark blouse and three pearl necklaces. A pair of large round earrings are set in her hears. Her short, dark, wavy hair is combed <b>back</b> on top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> She has a wide nose and wide lips, as well as dark eyebrows. Negative sleeve contains two articles on Ms. Packman...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of Susana Ruiz de Sepulveda, [s. d. ]. She {{can be seen from}} the chest up facing to the right. Her graying hair is pulled back from her face and fixed at the <b>back</b> and crown <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> She is wearing a lacy patterned dress of stripes and small dots with a brooch of {{a portrait}} of a man with a beard at her throat. She is chubby. Her ample breast is uplifted and corsetted tightly. The photo is visible in an oval cutout...|$|R
60|$|A high velvet hat, audaciously {{turned up}} in front, {{with a bunch of}} pink roses and a {{sweeping}} plume, was cocked over one ear, and, with her curls braided into a club at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, Rose's <b>head</b> looked more like that of a dashing young cavalier than a modest little girl's. High-heeled boots tilted her well forward, a tiny muff pinioned her arms, and a spotted veil, tied so closely over her face that her eyelashes were rumpled by it, gave the last touch <b>of</b> absurdity to <b>her</b> appearance.|$|R
25|$|Sonya {{speaks to}} the police and then goes to the reception. Toadie and Sonya give speeches, perform a special wedding dance and cut the cake. Outside, Callum {{compliment}} Rani's dress, but Rani believes he is making fun of her and after telling Priya that she hates her, Rani leaves. Mason turns up to work as a waiter. As Sonya puts her drink down on his tray, she spots Mason's belt buckle and remembers it from the robbery earlier. With most of the party outside, Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) comes inside to get a drink, while Priya tells her husband, Ajay (Sachin Joab), that she is going to text Rani. Outside the marquee, a shocked Sonya prepares to throw her bouquet, while one of the waiters changes the gas bottle. As Sonya throws the bouquet, a fire breaks out and the marquee explodes. Rhys comes to and tries to stand up, while Toadie discovers Sonya is bleeding from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Ajay runs into the collapsed marquee to find Priya. Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) advises Toadie not to move Sonya, before going to help out with the other injured guests.|$|E
500|$|In 1870, aged eleven, Ellen {{began work}} as a nursemaid in nearby Marlow, but she began {{suffering}} periods of somnolence and her employment was terminated. She was subsequently attended by a local doctor, Henry Hayman F.R.C.S., from nearby Stokenchurch. Ellen had been suffering for 13weeks from [...] "glandular swellings" [...] or an abscess on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and symptoms consistent with a spinal disease. The family {{did not have much}} money, so the parish vicar, The Reverend Studholme, asked Hayman to secure Ellen's admission to a local hospital, where her condition worsened. Ellen stayed at the hospital for 18weeks before being [...] "discharged as incurable" [...] in March 1871.|$|E
500|$|To draw Lisa's {{head and}} hair, {{most of the}} show's animators use {{what they call the}} [...] "three-three-two arrangement". It begins with a circle, with two curving lines (one vertical, one horizontal) {{intersecting}} in the middle to indicate her eyeline. The vertical line continues outside of the circle to create one hair point, with two more added towards the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Three more points are then added in front (in the direction Lisa is facing), with two more behind it. Several Simpsons animators, including Pete Michels and David Silverman, consider Lisa the most difficult Simpsons character to draw. Silverman explains that [...] "her head is so abstract" [...] due to her hairstyle.|$|E
6000|$|She turned {{round on}} a sudden, and beat her hands wildly on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the ottoman. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> {{dropped on the}} cushions; and she burst out crying. Before I had time to feel shocked, at this, I was horror-struck by an entirely {{unexpected}} proceeding {{on the part of}} Mr. Godfrey. Will it be credited that he fell on his knees at her feet?--on BOTH knees, I solemnly declare! May modesty mention that he put his arms round her next? And may reluctant admiration acknowledge that he electrified her with two words? ...|$|R
60|$|But she was {{youthful}}, very youthful still; {{and in her}} youthfulness {{appeared at}} breakfast, before going away, in a new bonnet made express, and a travelling robe that was embroidered and braided like an old baby's. It {{was not easy to}} put her into a fly-away bonnet now, or to keep the bonnet in its place on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> poor nodding <b>head,</b> when it was got on. In this instance, it had not only the extraneous effect of being always on one side, but of being perpetually tapped on the crown by Flowers the maid, who attended in the background during breakfast to perform that duty.|$|R
5000|$|She {{served as}} MDC's {{national}} secretary for Policy and Research {{in a smaller}} faction of the MDC. She {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "Mugabe does not frighten me, I feel it is my duty to stand up for the rights of all." [...] In July 2006, after attending a political meeting in the Harare suburb of Mabvuku, Stevenson was attacked and suffered panga wounds to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck and <b>head.</b> The leadership of the rival faction of the MDC immediately claimed that the attack was carried out by ZANU militants. However, while recovering in the hospital, Stevenson positively identified her assailants, in fact, as members of the MDC-T faction, which is led by Morgan Tsvangirai.|$|R
500|$|Mary was not {{beheaded}} with {{a single}} strike. The first blow missed her neck and struck the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> The second blow severed the neck, except for a small bit of sinew, which the executioner cut through using the axe. Afterward, he held her head aloft and declared, [...] "God save the Queen." [...] At that moment, the auburn tresses in his hand {{turned out to be}} a wig and the head fell to the ground, revealing that Mary had very short, grey hair. A small dog owned by the queen, a Skye Terrier, is said to have been hiding among her skirts, unseen by the spectators. Following the beheading, it refused to be parted from its owner's body and was covered in her blood, until it was forcibly taken away and washed. Items supposedly worn or carried by Mary at her execution are of doubtful provenance; contemporary accounts state that all her clothing, the block, and everything touched by her blood was burnt in the fireplace of the Great Hall to obstruct relic-hunters.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Disturbia" [...] begins in a surrealistic, circus-like torture chamber where Rihanna is seen dressed in black, wearing dark make-up and having long black nails while she presses the keys {{of a big}} dark piano and looks into the camera. As the song starts {{different}} images of Rihanna are shown. In one of the scenes she is seen imprisoned wearing lenses that make look as if her eyes have rolled into the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Rihanna stays in the prison with two men watching on her from the both sides. Other scenes include Rihanna sitting on a throne chair and singing the song, while two strange women (one is played by American drag queen Detox Icunt) are around her. Then, multiple people around her are holding {{her in front of}} a gas chamber. As the chorus starts Rihanna is seen tied up in a bed from which she can't get out. At the bridge of the song Rihanna and her dancers are performing a Thriller-esque dance routine. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is seen holding a column and fire is around her. As the song continues, Rihanna drags a man doll around a metal web. In the second chorus she wears a metal spines corset while one tarantula is upon her arm. In the later scene, Rihanna is in a very tiny room, with her hands and legs been tied up. The video ends with Rihanna turning around on her chair.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Mwng feature quite solemn, {{personal}} lyrics, which reflect on a difficult few years for Rhys. The single, [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog", is about [...] "looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment", while [...] "Pan Ddaw'r Wawr" [...] deals {{with the death of}} rural communities. The singer claims to have wept—rather than sung—the album's last track, [...] "Gwreiddiau Dwfn" [...] / [...] "Mawrth Oer Ar y Blaned Neifion", which features lyrics [...] "so bleak it's almost comic" [...] about [...] "being rooted to a sad piece of land [...] being doomed to live somewhere and that's all you have and that's what you're stuck with". Rhys has described Datblygu's [...] "Y Teimlad" [...] as being about [...] "not knowing what love is or what love means." [...] "Drygioni" [...] is a song about [...] "sleaze [...] about good versus evil, and a person's need for both", and [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] is a [...] "moody song about war" [...] whose title is a Welsh insult that translates into English as [...] "Liverface". In contrast, [...] "Nythod Cacwn" [...] is a comedic song, based on an incident involving drummer Dafydd Ieuan being chased by bees after he disturbed a beehive while attempting to build a bonfire on a beach. It features lyrics that were [...] "made up on the spot" [...] by Rhys. [...] "Dacw Hi" [...] is inspired by one of Rhys's former teachers who claimed she had eyes in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "Sarn Helen" [...] is about the decline of the Roman road of the same name that was built between North and South Wales. [...] "Ymaelodi Â'r Ymylon" [...] is partly inspired by the ostracisation the band felt from some areas of the Welsh musical community due to their decision to sing in English on earlier albums. The track's lyrics feature the old Welsh idiom [...] "y cythraul canu", which means [...] "the demon in music" [...] and refers to the friction this can create between people.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few moments}} a figure clad in white and guarded by several men was seen {{advancing}} {{from the direction of}} the arms-house. This figure came on through the moonlight with a swift agile step, looking neither to the right nor to the left, till it arrived in front of the verandah and halted. Then it was that Leonard first saw Juanna Rodd. She was very tall and slight, her dark hair was twisted into a single knot at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shapely <b>head,</b> <b>her</b> features were small, her face fair in colouring and somewhat rounded in form. So much he saw at a glance, but it was not until she looked up and round her that Leonard discovered the girl's peculiar glory, the glory <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes. Then and in that light he was unable to distinguish their colour, a difficult task at any time, for they varied from grey to blue according to the shadows which fell upon them, but he could see that they were wide and splendid, fearless and yet soft. For the rest she was clad in an Arab robe richly worked, and wore sandals upon her feet.|$|R
6000|$|On the day {{of which}} we write, Young and Adams found the square {{above-mentioned}} in possession of the infantry, under command of their self-elected captain, Otaheitan Sally, who was now, according to John Adams, [...] "no longer a chicken." [...] Being in her eleventh year, and, like her country-women generally at that age, far advanced towards big girlhood, she presented a tall, slight, graceful, and beautifully moulded figure, with a sweet sprightly face, and a smile that was ever disclosing her fine white teeth. <b>Her</b> profusion <b>of</b> black hair was gathered into a knot which hung low on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pretty round <b>head.</b> She was crowned with a wreath of wild-flowers, made and presented by her troops. It is needless to say {{that every one of}} these, big and little, was passionately attached to Sally.|$|R
50|$|The risk of {{head injury}} is {{two to six}} times greater for snowboarders than for skiers and {{injuries}} follow the pattern of being rarer, but more severe, with experienced riders. Head injuries can occur both {{as a consequence of}} a collision and when failing to carry out a heel-side turn. The latter can result in the rider landing on his or her back and slamming the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>head</b> onto the ground, resulting in an occipital head injury. For this reason, helmets are widely recommended. Protective eyewear is also recommended as eye injury can be caused by impact and snow blindness can be a result of exposure to strong ultra-violet light in snow-covered areas. The wearing of ultra-violet-absorbing goggles is recommended even on hazy or cloudy days as ultra-violet light can penetrate clouds.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the same}} day, doctors {{performed}} emergency surgery to extract skull fragments {{and a small}} amount of [...] tissue from her brain. The bullet passed through Giffords's head without crossing the midline of the brain, where the most critical injuries typically result. Part of her skull was removed to avoid further damage to the brain from pressure caused by swelling. Doctors who first treated Giffords said the bullet entered the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and exited through the front of her skull, but physicians later concluded that it had traveled in the opposite direction.|$|E
2500|$|He also {{performed}} the autopsy on Frances Coles (also known as Frances Coleman, Frances Hawkins and nicknamed [...] "Carrotty Nell"), born in 1865 and killed on 13 February 1891. He {{believed that the}} minor wounds on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> suggested that she was thrown violently to the ground before her throat was cut three times. Otherwise there were no mutilations to the body. Phillips {{did not believe that}} her murderer displayed any medical knowledge. Cole's body was found under a railway arch in Swallow Gardens, Whitechapel.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 September 2002, Fredriksson {{complained of}} feeling unwell after jogging with her husband. She {{collapsed}} {{in a bathroom}} after becoming nauseous, {{with the impact of}} the fall fracturing her cranium. She then had an epileptic seizure. Scans later indicated that she had a brain tumor in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> The diagnosis led to the cancellation of Roxette's planned performance at the 2002 Night of the Proms concert series. After waiting several weeks for the fracture and resulting concussion to subside, she underwent successful surgery to remove the tumor. It proved to be malignant, and she endured months of chemotherapy and radiation treatments.|$|E
6000|$|The Larkins {{sisters had}} done wonders with grey sateen. The idea of orange blossom and white veils had been {{abandoned}} reluctantly {{on account of the}} expense of cabs. A novelette in which the heroine had stood at the altar in [...] "a modest going-away dress" [...] had materially assisted this decision. Miriam was frankly tearful, and so indeed was Annie, but with laughter as well to carry it off. Mr. Polly heard Annie say something vague about never getting a chance because of Miriam always sticking about at home like a cat at a mouse-hole, that became, as people say, food for thought. Mrs. Larkins was from the first flushed, garrulous, and wet and smeared by copious weeping; an incredibly soaked and crumpled and used-up pocket handkerchief never left the clutch <b>of</b> <b>her</b> plump red hand. [...] "Goo' girls, all of them," [...] she kept on saying in a tremulous voice; [...] "such-goo-goo-goo-girls!" [...] She wetted Mr. Polly dreadfully when she kissed him. Her emotion affected the buttons down the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bodice, and almost the last filial duty Miriam did before entering on her new life was to close that gaping orifice for the eleventh time. Her bonnet was small and ill-balanced, black adorned with red roses, and first it got over her right eye until Annie told <b>her</b> <b>of</b> it, and then she pushed it over her left eye and looked ferocious for a space, and after that baptismal kissing of Mr. Polly the delicate millinery took fright and climbed right up to the <b>back</b> part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and hung on there by a pin, and flapped piteously at all the larger waves of emotion that filled the gathering. Mr. Polly became more and more aware of that bonnet as time went on, until he felt for it like a thing alive. Towards the end it had yawning fits.|$|R
50|$|With {{some members}} in {{fugitive}} status after the Pine Ridge shootout, suspicions about FBI infiltration remained high. For various reasons, Anna Mae Aquash, the highest-ranking woman in AIM, was mistakenly {{suspected of being}} an informant, even after she had voiced suspicions about Durham. Aquash had also been threatened by FBI agent David Price According to testimony at trials in 2004 and 2010 of men convicted <b>of</b> <b>her</b> murder, she was interrogated {{in the fall of}} 1975. In mid-December she was taken from Denver, Colorado, to Rapid City, South Dakota, and interrogated again, then taken to Rosebud Reservation and finally to a far corner of Pine Ridge Reservation, where she was killed by a gunshot wound to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the <b>head.</b> <b>Her</b> decomposing body was found February 1976. After the coroner failed to find the bullet hole in Aquash's head, the FBI severed both <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands and sent them to Washington, DC, allegedly for identification purposes, then buried her as a Jane Doe. Aquash's body was later exhumed and given a second burial.|$|R
50|$|Other white MPs {{elected in}} 2000 {{included}} David Coltart (a prominent human rights lawyer and founding legal {{secretary of the}} MDC) and Michael Auret (a civil rights activist of long standing who had opposed white minority rule in the 1970s). Trudy Stevenson was a white American {{who had lived in}} Uganda until 1972, before fleeing from the regime of Idi Amin. Stevenson served as the MDC's Secretary for Policy and Research before being elected to Parliament. In July 2006, after attending a political meeting in the Harare suburb of Mabvuku, Mrs Stevenson was attacked and suffered panga wounds to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck and <b>head.</b> The MDC leadership immediately claimed that the attack was carried out by ZANU militants. But, while recovering in hospital, the MP for Harare North positively identified her assailants as members of a rival faction of the MDC. This serves to illustrate the violent and faction ridden nature of Zimbabwean politics. Zimbabwean politicians (black and white) routinely accuse each other of murder, theft, electoral fraud, conspiracy and treason. It is often difficult to know the truth of these matters.|$|R
