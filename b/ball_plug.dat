40|$|Six ball plugs {{were used}} to seal the oil lines in Jaguar {{cylinder}} heads using the press-fit process. The balls were made out of the 7075 Al alloy and were produced by forging, whereas the heads were made from the 319 Al alloy and were low pressure cast at the Essex Aluminum Plant (EAP), and machined at the Cleveland Engine Plant (CEP). The ball plugs were inserted at the CEP. Leaking was observed through the ball plugs during the CEP engine quality control operation. An investigation was launched to determine and eliminate {{the cause of the}} leaks. In order to isolate the main leak culprits, tests were subdivided into sections, which included: the heat treatment parameters applied to the 319 Al cylinder heads; metallurgical and geometrical characterization of the <b>ball</b> <b>plug</b> including: ball and casting microstructural analysis, hardness and homogeneity analysis, casting scratch and compression tests, characterization of the ball/casting hole wall interface, <b>ball</b> <b>plug</b> insertion and pressure tightness tests, effect of the insertion speed, ball lubrication and casting microhardness on the insertion force; geometrical investigation of the cylinder head boss design; leak mechanisms SEM/EDS investigation, as well as the Finite Element Analysis of the stress distribution in the ball and cylinder plug systems. As a result of these studies it was recommended that the cylindrical plugs should replace the ball plugs. CEP acted on this recommendation by replacing the ball plugs with the cylindrical plugs at 4 of the 6 plug locations where the leaks occurred most frequently.

40|$|Comparisons of {{experimental}} and calculated pressure losses are pre-sented for Newtonian ad non-Newtonisn materiels. The non-Newtonian ma-terials were slurries of titanium dioxide particles suspended {{in water and}} of magnesium particles suspended in a hydrocarbon fluid. One of the slur-ries showed Bingham plastic flow behavior, while the other one behaved like a pseudoplastic material. The pressure-loss data were obtained for lsminar, transitional.,and turbulent flow through straight pipelines and pipe tran-sitions of l-inch and 3 / 8 -inch nominal pipe size. The pipeline transitions considered are 90 ° elbows; gate, <b>ball,</b> <b>plug,</b> and globe valves; contractions; and expansions. Transition loss coefficients, which are independent of the flow rate in the pipelines, even for laminar flow in the pipeline system, were determined for the transitions and are compared with those {{reported in the literature}} for Netionian fluids. The transition loss coefficients obtained for the Newtonian and non-Netionian materials and those reported in the literature for Newtonian fluids sgree within the errors of experiment. 5 s, these studies indicate that, for the design of pipeline systems, such as fuel systems, where the slurries have flow characteristics similar to those treated in this paperj the transition loss coefficients f’orNewtonian design calculations...|$|E

40|$|The term "valve " {{applies to}} a variety of devices for {{controlling}} the flow of liquid. Various valves allow for on-off control, modulation of the flow rate through the system, and prevention of back flow. They can also be used for pressure relief or as a safety device. In general, valves can vary from simple manual on-off devices to sophisticated control equipment which act as metering instruments and deliver predetermined amounts of water to the system. ON-OFF SERVICE VALVES For normal on-off control the best choices are gate, <b>ball,</b> and <b>plug</b> valves.

40|$|The {{class of}} Schur-Agler {{functions}} over a domain D ⊂ C d {{is defined as}} the class of holomorphic operator-valued functions on D for which a certain von Neumann inequality is satisfied when a commuting tuple of operators satisfying a certain polynomial norm inequality is plugged in for the variables. Such functions are alternatively characterized as those having a linear-fractional presentation which identifies them as transfer functions of a certain type of conservative structured multidimensional linear system. There now has been introduced a noncommutative version of the Schur-Agler class which consists of formal power series in noncommuting indeterminants satisfying a noncommutative version of the von Neumann inequality when a tuple of operators (not necessarily commuting) coming from a noncommutative operator <b>ball</b> are <b>plugged</b> in for the formal indeterminants. Formal power series in this noncommutative Schur-Agler class in turn are characterized as those having a certain linear-fractional presentation in noncommuting variables identifying them as transfer functions of a recently introduced class of conservative structure multidimensional linear systems having evolution along a free semigroup rather than along an integer lattice. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to extend the previously developed interpolation theory for the commutative Schur-Agler class to this noncommutative setting. 1...|$|R
50|$|Many valves are {{controlled}} manually with a handle {{attached to the}} stem. If the handle is turned ninety degrees between operating positions, the valve is called a quarter-turn valve. Butterfly, <b>ball</b> valves, and <b>plug</b> valves are often quarter-turn valves. If the handle is circular with the stem as the axis of rotation {{in the center of}} the circle, then the handle is called a handwheel. Valves can also be controlled by actuators attached to the stem. They can be electromechanical actuators such as an electric motor or solenoid, pneumatic actuators which {{are controlled}} by air pressure, or hydraulic actuators which are controlled by the pressure of a liquid such as oil or water. Actuators can be used for the purposes of automatic control such as in washing machine cycles, remote control such as the use of a centralised control room, or because manual control is too difficult such as when the valve is very large. Pneumatic actuators and hydraulic actuators need pressurised air or liquid lines to supply the actuator: an inlet line and an outlet line. Pilot valves are valves which are used to control other valves. Pilot valves in the actuator lines control the supply of air or liquid going to the actuators.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—When acid {{is pumped}} into damaged {{reservoirs}} for damage removal/stimulation, distorted inflow of acid into the formation occurs caused by acid preferentially traveling into highly permeable regions over low permeable regions, or (in general) {{into the path}} of least resistance. This can lead to poor zonal coverage and hence warrants diversion to carry out an effective placement of acid. Diversion is desirably a reversible technique of temporarily reducing the permeability of high perm zones, thereby forcing the acid into lower perm zones. The uniqueness of each reservoir can pose several challenges to engineers attempting to devise optimum and effective diversion strategies. Diversion techniques include mechanical placement and/or chemical diversion of treatment fluids, further sub-classified into <b>ball</b> sealers, bridge <b>plugs,</b> packers, particulate diverters, viscous gels, crosslinked gels, relative permeability modifiers (RPMs), foams, and/or the use of placement techniques, such as coiled tubing (CT) and the maximum pressure difference and injection rate (MAPDIR) methodology. It is not always realized that the effectiveness of diverters greatly depends on reservoir properties, such as formation type, temperature, reservoir permeability, heterogeneity, and physical well characteristics (e. g., completion type, well deviation, length of treatment interval, multiple intervals, etc.). This paper reviews the mechanisms by which each variety of diverter functions and discusses the effect of various reservoir properties on the efficiency of diversion techniques. Guidelines are recommended to help enhance productivity from zones of interest by choosing the best methods of diversion while pumping an optimized amount of treatment fluid. The success of an overall acid treatment often depends on the effectiveness of the diverting agents. Keywords—Acid treatment, carbonate, diversion, sandstone...|$|R
