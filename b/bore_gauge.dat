40|$|Abstract: The use of {{measurement}} system Repeatability and Reproducibility (R&R) studies is widespread in industry. Such analyses have become mandatory for many companies who supply {{the automotive industry}} and is now {{an integral part of}} the QS 9000 automotive industry standard. R&R study allow one to estimate the contribution of variation attributable to the measurement system itself and is used to ensure that a company measurement system is acceptable. If the measurement system R&R study indicate that the recorded measurements may be unreliable, this may impact all subsequent analyses, e. g. control charts, capability analyses etc. It is the aim of this paper to address such issues and to show a measurement system R&R case study that was made in a major automotive company. A measurement system used to measure a bore diameter of a part, having a specification of 18. 1 to 18. 3 mm was to be evaluated. Ten parts have been selected for measurements by three operators. Each part was measured twice with a dial <b>bore</b> <b>gauge.</b> Because R&R value was between 10 % and 30 %, it had required further analysis to find the sources {{of measurement}} error. The supposition was that the dial <b>bore</b> <b>gauge</b> was not adequate to measure this bore diameter, so it was replaced by an internal micrometer and another measurement system R&R study was made. The conclusion was that the new measuring system is excellent...|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{styles of}} small-hole gauges: full-ball and half-ball. The full-ball gauges {{are easier to}} set {{correctly}} and maintain, {{under the pressure of}} measurement, a better representation of the <b>bore.</b> Half-ball <b>gauges</b> tend to spring just a little bit, and this may be enough to make a measurement incorrect. A lighter [...] "touch" [...] is required to accurately use the half-ball gauges.|$|R
5000|$|To measure larger diameters, you may use {{extended}} beam gauges. It {{is designed}} to measure internal and external diameters. The major challenge is handling these gauges is slightly difficult compared to other <b>bore</b> <b>gauges.</b> It should be lightweight, have low coefficient of thermal expansion, high modulus and stiffness. Mostly we use low carbon fiber or aluminium. It has stem with ball at both ends. The length range of the stem depends upon {{the width of the}} part. [...] In order to measure the diameter of the bore, place the beam at one end and slide the other end on the diameter and watch the dial indicator. The values initially increases and at one point starts decreasing; stop that point, it is called max point on the circle. That is the diameter of the component. Repeat the procedure in 3 different places and get the average value of the diameter of the component. This is the most common way to measure the larger bore. It is available in different ranges; normally you can use this from 300 mm to 4000 mm for external diameter.|$|R
40|$|For online {{quality control}} of car engine production, {{pneumatic}} measurement instrument plays an unshakeable role in measuring diameters inside engine block {{because of its}} portability and high-accuracy. To the limitation of its measuring principle, however, the working space between the pneumatic device and measured surface {{is too small to}} require manual operation. This lowers the measuring efficiency and becomes an obstacle to perform automatic measurement. In this article, a high-speed, automatic measuring system is proposed {{to take the place of}} pneumatic devices by using a laser-based measuring unit. The measuring unit is considered as a set of several measuring modules, where each of them acts like a single <b>bore</b> <b>gauge</b> and is made of four laser triangulation sensors (LTSs), which are installed on different positions and in opposite directions. The spatial relationship among these LTSs was calibrated before measurements. Sampling points from measured shaft holes can be collected by the measuring unit. A unified mathematical model was established for both calibration and measurement. Based on the established model, the relative pose between the measuring unit and measured workpiece does not impact the measuring accuracy. This frees the measuring unit from accurate positioning or adjustment, and makes it possible to realize fast and automatic measurement. The proposed system and method were finally validated by experiments...|$|E

50|$|Cannulae are hollow {{flexible}} {{tubes of}} varying <b>bore,</b> usually 16-22 <b>gauge</b> thick. They are commonly made {{of stainless steel}} or PTFE for chemical resistance. Stainless steel cannulae are usually 2-3 feet long, due to their relative inflexibility, while PTFE cannulae can be much shorter.

50|$|Small-hole gauges {{require a}} {{slightly}} different technique to the telescopic gauges, the small hole gauge is initially set smaller than the bore to be measured. It is then inserted into the bore and adjusted by rotating the knurled knob at the base, until light pressure is felt when the gauge is slightly moved in the <b>bore.</b> The <b>gauge</b> is then removed and measured with a caliper or micrometer. To accurately detect the maximal distance between {{the two halves of}} the gauge head, move the head of the gauge around while making the measurement to insure you get the maximal reading. Grasp the gauge near the head to aid in your maneuvering of the gauge while adjusting the micrometer so it just stops the gauge's motion at one spot only. A bit of practice will quickly give you the idea.|$|R

By far the most common gauges are 12 (0.729 in, 18.5 mm diameter) and 20 (0.614 in, 15.6 mm), although [...]410 (= 67), 32, 28, 24, 16, and 10 (19.7 mm) gauge also exist.|$|R
40|$|The AGR- 1 {{irradiation}} experiment {{ended on}} November 6, 2009, after 620 effective full power {{days in the}} Advanced Test Reactor, achieving a peak burnup of 19. 6 % FIMA. The test train was shipped to the Materials and Fuels Complex in March 2010 for post-irradiation examination. The first PIE activities included non-destructive examination of the test train, followed by disassembly of the test train and individual capsules and detailed inspection of the capsule contents, including the fuel compacts and the graphite fuel holders. Dimensional measurements of the compacts, graphite holders, and steel capsules shells were performed using a custom vision measurement system (for outer diameters and lengths) and conventional <b>bore</b> <b>gauges</b> (for inner diameters). Gamma spectrometry of the intact test train gave a preliminary look at {{the condition of the}} interior components. No evidence of damage to compacts or graphite components was evident from the isotopic and gross gamma scans. Neutron radiography of the intact Capsule 2 showed a high degree of detail of interior components and confirmed the observation that there was no major damage to the capsule. Disassembly of the capsules was initiated using procedures qualified during out-of-cell mockup testing. Difficulties were encountered during capsule disassembly due to irradiation-induced changes in some of the capsule components’ properties, including embrittled niobium and molybdenum parts that were susceptible to fracture and swelling of the graphite fuel holders that affected their removal from the capsule shells. This required various improvised modifications to the disassembly procedure to avoid damage to the fuel compacts. Ultimately the capsule disassembly was successful and only one compact from Capsule 4 (out of 72 total in the test train) sustained damage during the disassembly process, along with the associated graphite holder. The compacts were generally in very good condition upon removal. Only relatively minor damage or markings were visible using high resolution photographic inspection. Compact dimensional measurements indicated diametrical shrinkage of 0. 9 to 1. 4 %, and length shrinkage of 0. 2 to 1. 1 %. The shrinkage was somewhat dependent on compact location within each capsule and within the test train. Compacts exhibited a maximum diametrical shrinkage at a fast neutron fluence of approximately 3 × 1021 n/cm 2. A multivariate statistical analysis indicates that fast neutron fluence as well as compact position in the test train influence compact shrinkage...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, on {{the basis}} of the stress {{analysis}} of an equivalent model, the stress intensity factors (SIF) of a crack have been evaluated. In the stress analysis, the crack is substituted by an equivalent hole equal in size to the length of the crack. The method is based on the evaluation of the hoop stress on the free border of the equivalent hole and the subsequent calculation of the J-integral (JVρ) as a parameter related to the SIF. Alternatively, if the hoop stress on the free border cannot be evaluated, the stress analysis can be performed on the surface in the neighbourhood of the hole. In order to validate the method, two experimental cases have been considered: a plate with two different bore diameters of 50 % and 20 % of the plate width, respectively. The stress analysis was performed by means of strain gauges attached to the free border. For the plate with the smaller <b>bore,</b> the strain <b>gauges</b> were also attached to the surface near the hole. In this way, the strain approach can be extended to thin plates or when it is not possible to attach the strain gauges to the free border of the hole...|$|R

[2006]. The 220 km 2 Bowen irrigation area is data-rich with 260 observation <b>bores</b> plus stream <b>gauging,</b> metering of irrigation bores and detailed land use mapping. The method uses Darcy’s Law, which defines the volumetric rate of flow through a tube of saturated medium as {{a relationship between the}} hydraulic conductivity of the medium, the hydraulic gradient in the tube and the cross-section area of the tube. The groundwater components in the study area are discretised into polygons to which Darcy’s Law is applied to estimate the magnitude of the water balance components. The study calculated that, on average, aquifer recharge is 87 % from rainfall and irrigation, 12 % from rivers, and less than 1 % from lateral inflow from adjacent groundwater storage. Of the groundwater discharges, on average, 66 % is due to evapotranspiration, 28 % is from groundwater pumping, 4 % is submarine discharge, and 2 % becomes river baseflow. The method proved cost and time effective and provided important insights to the groundwater dynamics of the area. The modelling approach is generally applicable to data-rich aquifers...|$|R

50|$|Similarly, Connecticut {{industry}} became {{well known}} in allied fields. Hardware and tools continue to be manufactured by Stanley Corporation in New Britain, despite having almost moved elsewhere for financial reasons. Connecticut was a major area for development and manufacture of machine tools. In 1818, Simeon North designed America's first milling machine. Machinist Elisha Root first designed machinery for the Collins Company of Collinsville which manufactured axes which became world-famous, then was hired by Colt in 1849 to modernize firearm production by designing precision drop hammers, <b>boring</b> machines, <b>gauges,</b> jigs, etc., and improving the milling machines designed by Francis A. Pratt for the George S. Lincoln company in Hartford; the resulting Lincoln miller became world-famous, selling over 150,000 machines. Another Colt engineer, William Mason, patented 125 inventions for manufacture of firearms, as well as steam pumps and power looms. Christopher Spencer invented the automatic turret lathe (which in its small- to medium-sized form {{is known as a}} screw machine) for machining screws, as well as the variable cam cylinder used to control the turret. Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney invented a thread milling machine in 1865; Whitney also perfected various measurement instruments, and Pratt designed the aforementioned original milling machine manufactured by the George S. Lincoln company of Hartford. Simon Fairman invented the lathe chuck in West Stafford in 1830, and his son-in-law, Austin F. Cushman, invented the self-centering Cushman Universal Chuck in 1862. Edward P. Bullard designed the vertical boring mill in 1883. Charles E. Billings perfected the drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator central to the operation of electrical generators and motors. Edwin R. Fellows of Torrington in 1896 designed and built a new type of gear shaper and founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company, which made a vital contribution to the manufacture of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the nascent automotive industry. The name Bridgeport on machine tools continues to be a guarantee of high quality around the world, for people who have no idea that the machinery is named after a city in Connecticut.
