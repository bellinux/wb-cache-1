25|$|In the 1930s Scott {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of stationary engines {{with the aim of}} raising funds following the decline in motorcycle sales. Some of these engines were derived from motorcycle units, for instance the DSE was a watercooled version of the Lightweight Squirrel engine and the SE had the same bore and stroke dimensions as the long stroke Flyers. It has come to light that the SE does not have the same <b>bore</b> <b>size</b> as the Long Stroke Flyer (73mm) but has a <b>bore</b> <b>size</b> of 78mm, this has been confirmed on two Scott SE engines. The PA stationary engine however was different. Designed to meet a Ministry requirement for a portable electrical generator for the Bofors anti-aircraft gun and its Kerrison Predictor, it was produced during the Second World War by both Scott and its former partners Jowett.|$|E
25|$|The {{euphonium}} {{is part of}} {{the family}} of brass instruments. It is sometimes confused with the baritone horn. The euphonium and the baritone differ in that the <b>bore</b> <b>size</b> of the baritone horn is typically smaller than that of the euphonium, and the baritone is primarily cylindrical bore, whereas the euphonium is predominantly conical bore. The two instruments are easily interchangeable to the player, with some modification of breath and embouchure, since the two have identical range and essentially identical fingering. The cylindrical baritone offers a brighter sound and the conical euphonium offers a mellower sound.|$|E
25|$|The {{tools are}} usually mounted in a {{dedicated}} bore finishing machine, however {{they can also}} be mounted in a milling machine. In either case the tool, workpiece, or both are rotated and the tool is plunged into the bore and removed. The part is then transferred to the next station or a larger tool is mounted and a larger bore machined, and the process repeated until the desired bore geometry is reached. The number of tools required to achieve the desired <b>bore</b> <b>size</b> is dependent on the workpiece material, the amount of stock to be removed and geometrical requirements, with four to six tool pieces being common. Each tool is progressively larger than the last, but in diminishing increments; as the stock removal is reduced, so is the tool's diamond grit size.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} design range were the 4 and 5 types with smaller <b>bore</b> <b>sizes</b> and the 29 type with larger <b>bore</b> <b>sizes.</b> These were {{replaced}} with the 74, 75 and 89 and then, later, by the 274, 275 and 289 types.|$|R
50|$|The {{more modern}} Concentric, {{developed}} and introduced for the 1967 Model Year, was initially designated 600 and 900. The 600 series had <b>bore</b> <b>sizes</b> of 22mm, 24mm and 26mm, being known as 622, 624, and 626 respectively. Similarly, the 900 series with <b>bore</b> <b>sizes</b> of 28mm, 30mm and 32mm, {{were known as}} 928, 930, and 932 respectively.|$|R

2500|$|A station wagon, {{marketed as}} the Lakewood joined the lineup in 1961 with its engine located under the cargo floor and {{offering}} 68ft³ (1.9m³) of cargo room; 58ft³ {{in the main}} passenger compartment, and another 10ft³ in the front trunk. The Corvair engine received its first size increase to [...] via {{a slight increase in}} <b>bore</b> <b>size</b> and was rated at [...] The base engine was still rated at [...] when paired with the manual transmissions and [...] when mated to the optional automatic transmission in Monza models. To increase luggage capacity in the front trunk, the spare tire was relocated to the engine compartment (in cars without air-conditioning) and new [...] "direct air" [...] heater directed warmed air from the cylinders and heads to the passenger compartment. The gasoline heater remained available as an option through 1963. Factory air conditioning was offered as a mid-1961 option introduction. The condenser lay flat atop the horizontal engine fan. A large, green-painted reverse rotation version of the standard GM Frigidaire air conditioning compressor was used, and an evaporator housing was added under the dash with integrated outlets surrounding the radio housing. Air conditioning was not available on wagons, Greenbrier/Corvair 95, or the turbocharged models introduced later, due to space constraints.|$|E

The <b>bore</b> <b>size</b> is cast {{on the top of the}} block near the back of the right bank cylinder head. The block features a deep skirt where the casting extends below the crankshaft centerline, forming a very rigid crankcase gallery. The oil system feeds a central gallery to the cam and crankshaft first from front to rear, and then dividing at the front to feed the two lifter galleries from front to rear. From the rear of the two lifter galleries oil is then supplied up to the two rocker arm shafts which serve as galleries to lubricate the valve train. The fore and aft direction changes are designed to eliminate stale oil areas which tend to form sludge deposits. Juxtaposed with the Rambler V8, the Chevrolet small-block engine feeds both lifter galleries and the central cam and crankshaft galleries simultaneously through a three way split from the rear, having oil proceed to the front of the engine, the lifter galleries feeding oil to the valve train through hollow pushrods.|$|E

A review of high-speed rolling-element bearing state-of-the-art performance and lubrication is presented.

2500|$|The {{aforementioned}} Buick 215 V8, {{was ordered}} {{by less than}} two percent of its customers {{in the two years}} it was available, 1961 and 1962. Today, the 215 cars are among the most sought-after of all Tempests. In 1963, Pontiac replaced the 215 with a [...] "new" [...] 326 which was really a 336 with a bore of 3.78 and stroke of 3.75 ( [...] same stroke as the 389 [...] ), an iron block mill that had the same external dimensions and shared parts with the 389, but an altered, reduced bore. The car's body and suspension was also changed to be lower, longer and wider. The response was {{that more than half of}} the 1963 Tempests and LeMans (separate lines for that one year only) were ordered with the V8, a trend that did not go unnoticed by management. The next year, the 326 would become a true 326 with a new <b>bore</b> <b>size</b> of 3.72. The Tempest's popularity helped move Pontiac into third place among American car brands in 1962, a position Pontiac would hold through 1970. The Buick 215 V8 would remain in production for more than thirty five years, being used by Britain's Rover Group after it had bought the rights to it. GM attempted to buy the rights back, however, Rover wished, instead, to sell the engines directly.|$|E
2500|$|Gun {{development}} and design in Europe reached its [...] "classic" [...] {{form in the}} 1480s. The so-called Classic Gun is referred to thus for its longer, lighter, more efficient, and more accurate design compared to its predecessors only three decades prior. Indeed, cannons of the 1480s show little difference and surprising similarity with cannons three centuries later in the 1750s. This 300-year period during which the classic cannon dominated gives it its moniker. The early classical European guns are exemplified by two cannons from 1488 now preserved in a plaza in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. The Neuchâtel guns are 224 centimeters long, with a bore of 6.2 centimeters {{and the other is}} slightly longer, 252 centimeters, with the same <b>bore</b> <b>size.</b> Classical guns such as these are differentiated from older firearms by an assortment of improvements. Their longer length-to-bore ratio imparts more energy into the shot, enabling the projectile to shoot further. Not only longer, they were also lighter as the barrel walls were made thinner to allow for faster dissipation of heat. Classical guns also no longer needed the help of a wooden plug to load since they offered a tighter fit between projectile and barrel, further increasing the accuracy of gunpowder warfare. Classical guns were deadlier due to the combination of new weapon developments such as gunpowder corning and the iron shot, which had been gradually adopted in Europe during the 1400s. When these guns reached China in the 1510s, the Chinese were highly impressed by them, primarily for their longer and thinner barrels.|$|E

5000|$|The Parrott rifle, {{invented by}} Robert Parker Parrott, was {{manufactured}} in different sizes, from 10-pounders {{up to the}} rare 300-pounder. The 10- and 20-pounder versions were used by both armies in the field. The smaller size was much more prevalent; it was made in two <b>bore</b> <b>sizes,</b> 2.9 in and 3.0 in. Confederate forces used both <b>bore</b> <b>sizes</b> during the war, which added to the complication of supplying the appropriate ammunition to its batteries.
