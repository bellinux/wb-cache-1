40|$|Abstract. The {{origin of}} the East African Plateau and rift valleys is poorly {{understood}} largely because {{little is known about}} the crust and upper mantle beneath East Africa. The center of the plateau is composed of the Arcbean Tanzania Craton and is flanked by the Proterozoic Kibaran, Ubendian and Mozambique Belts to west, southwest, and east, respectively. Cenozoic faults of the East African rift system lie primarily within the mobile belts. New estimates of Moho depths, mean shear velocity (Vs), and Poisson's ratio for the crust of the East African Plateau are presented and used to address questions related to the tectonic development of the plateau and rift valleys. The new constraints on crustal structure are obtained by separately modeling receiver functions and Rayleigh wave phase velocities from teleseismic earthquakes recorded by a deployment of 20 broadband seismic stations spread across Tanzania in 1994 and 1995 and then by combining the results of the separate analyses to obtain estimates of mean crustal structure that satisfy both sets of observations. For the Tanzania Craton, Vs is 3. 79 km_/s, Moho depths lie between 37 and 42 kin, and estimates of Poisson's ratio are between 0. 24 and 0. 26. For the Mozambique <b>Belt,</b> <b>V</b> • is 3. 74 km/s, Moho depths range between 36 and 39 kin, and estimates of Poisson's ratio are between 0. 24 and 0. 27.

40|$|Background &# 38; Aims: Central obesity {{promotes}} gastroesophageal reflux {{and this}} may be related to increased intra-abdominal pressure. We investigated the effect of increasing abdominal pressure by waist belt on reflux in patients with reflux disease. Methods: We performed a prospective study of patients with esophagitis (n= 8) or Barrett’s esophagus (n= 6); their median age was 56 years and their median body mass index, 26. 8. Proton pump inhibitors were stopped at least 7 days before the study and H 2 receptor antagonists were stopped for at least 24 hours before. The severity of upper gastrointestinal symptoms was assessed, and measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference taken. Combined high-resolution pH measurement and manometry were performed in fasted state for 20 minutes and for 90 minutes following a standardized meal. The squamocolumnar junction was marked by endoscopically placed radiopaque clips. The procedures were performed with and without a waist belt (a weight-lifter belt applied tightly and inflated to a constant cuff pressure of 50 mmHg). We compared variables between groups using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and tested for correlations using Spearman Rho bivariate analysis. Results: Without the belt, intragastric pressure correlated with waist circumference (r= 0. 682; P=. 008), with the range in pressure between smallest and largest waist circumference being 15 mmHg. The belt increased intragastric pressure by a median of 6. 9 mmHg during fasting (P=. 002) and by 9. 0 mmHg after the meal (P=. 001). Gastroesophageal acid reflux at each of the pH sensors extending 5. 5 cm proximal to the peak lower esophageal sphincter pressure point was increased by approximately 8 -fold by the belt (all P<. 05). Following the meal, the mean number of reflux events with the <b>belt</b> was 4, <b>vs</b> 2 without (P=. 008). Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations were not increased by the belt but those associated with reflux were increased (2 vs 3. 5; P=. 04). The most marked effect of the belt was impaired esophageal clearance of refluxed acid (median values of 23. 0 seconds without <b>belt</b> <b>vs</b> 81. 1 seconds with belt) (P=. 008). The pattern of impaired clearance was that of rapid re-reflux after peristaltic clearance. Conclusions: In a prospective study of patients with esophagitis or Barrett’s esophagus, we found belt compression increased acid reflux following a meal. The intragastric pressure rise inducing this effect is well within the range associated with differing waist circumference and likely to be relevant to the association between obesity and reflux disease...|$|R

For {{cutting down}} {{the stress and}} {{displacement}} of banded wedge and synchronous <b>V</b> <b>belt</b> drive in the transmission process, promoting the transmission mechanism, and improving quality of the belt drive, the working principle of the transmission mechanism was introduced briefly.

The simulation results were analyzed. The simulation results show that the maximal equivalent stress and maximal total deformation of the transmission mechanism are determined {{by the size of the}} tensioning force when the active force is small. Augmenting the active force of the transmission mechanism the maximal equivalent stress increases effectively and the maximal total deformation changes little when the active force is large. Reducing becomingly the tensioning force in ensuring natural belt drive shall reduce effectively the maximal Von Mises stress of the transmission mechanism.

50|$|The Planet V {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} a fifth terrestrial planet created the Late Heavy Bombardment when its meta-stable orbit entered the inner asteroid belt. The hypothetical fifth terrestrial planet, Planet V, had a mass {{less than half}} of Mars and originally orbited between Mars and the asteroid <b>belt.</b> Planet <b>V's</b> orbit became unstable due to perturbations from the other inner planets causing it to intersect the inner asteroid belt. After close encounters with Planet V, many asteroids entered Earth-crossing orbits producing the Late Heavy Bombardment. Planet V was ultimately lost, likely plunging into the Sun. In numerical simulations, an uneven distribution of asteroids, with the asteroids heavily concentrated toward the inner asteroid belt, {{has been shown to be}} necessary to produce the LHB via this mechanism. An alternate version of this hypothesis in which the lunar impactors are debris resulting from Planet V impacting Mars, forming the Borealis Basin, has been proposed to explain a low number of giant lunar basins relative to craters and a lack of evidence of cometary impactors.|$|R
50|$|Models 27 and 28 do {{not have}} a motor mount {{hardpoint}}; the hardpoint appeared later on the models 127 and 128. Without a hardpoint, screw holes must be manually drilled and tapped into the pillar for the motor mounting bolts. Unfortunately there is not a standard location for these screw holes, and so the add-on motor can be mounted anywhere within a two-inch range on the pillar. Consequently, the belt race length can vary from the standard race lengths of the 127 and 128. If it does vary, then the standard Singer <b>V</b> <b>belts</b> can be too long or too short. In that case a stretch belt (good over a range of several inches) will suffice instead.|$|R
