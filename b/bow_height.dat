40|$|In this study, {{numerical}} simulations {{are conducted}} {{to investigate the}} effects of bowed outlet guide vanes (OGVs) on endwall heat transfer and aerodynamic performance. Both on- and off-design conditions are studied. For bowed vanes, the bowed angle varies from 10 degrees to 40 degrees and the normalized <b>bowed</b> <b>height</b> ranges from 0. 1 to 0. 3. Results are included for Nusselt number distributions on the endwall, the energy losses, the yaw angles, and near-wall flow structures. For the convenience of comparison, the straight vane is also studied as a baseline. It is found that the bowed vanes can effectively reduce the endwall heat transfer. Among the tested parameters, a bowed angle of 40 degrees and a normalized <b>bowed</b> <b>height</b> of 0. 3 provide the best-controlled heat transfer for both the on- and off-design conditions. However, the bowed vanes have different effects on the energy losses and the yaw angles depending on the operating conditions. For the on-design condition with the inlet angle of 30 degrees (the incidence angle is 0 degrees) and the off-design condition with the inlet angle of 0 degrees, the bowed vanes do not significantly increase the energy losses and yaw angles, whereas for the off-design condition with the inlet angle of - 30 degrees, significant changes are observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{positively}} bowed blade on the aerodynamic performance of annular compressor cascades with large camber angle were experimentally investigated under different incidences. The distributions of the exit total pressure loss and secondary flow vectors of compressor cascades were analyzed. The static pressure {{was measured by}} tapping on the cascade surfaces, and the ink-trace flow visualizations were conducted. The {{results show that the}} value of the optimum bowed angle and optimum <b>bowed</b> <b>height</b> decrease because of the increased losses at the mid-span with the increase of the caber angle. The C-shape static pressure distribution along the radial direction exists on the suction surface of the straight cascade with large r camber angles. When bowed blade is applied, the larger bowed angle and larger <b>bowed</b> <b>height</b> will further enhance the accumulation of the low-energy fluid at the mid-span, thus deteriorate the flow behavior. Under 60 ° camber angle, flow behavior near the end-wall region of some bowed cascades even deteriorates instead of improving because the blockage of the separated flow near the mid-span keeps the low-energy fluid near the end-walls from moving towards the mid-span region, and as a result, a rapid augmentation of the total loss is easy to take place under large bowed angle. With the increase of camber angle, the choice range of bowed angle corresponding to the best performance in different incidences become narrower...|$|R
40|$|This thesis gives {{a summary}} and {{discussion}} of results from five studies concerned with: the distribution of compression wood in relation to external stem and log geometry {{and the impact of}} the compression wood distribution on deformations of sawn timber. Moreover the straightening process of trees is discussed. In order to study the distribution of compression wood in stems and logs, 63 trees of Norway spruce and Scots pine representing different age and curvature categories were sliced into 621 discs. In order to study the impact of compression wood on deformations of sawn timber, 146 logs of Scots pine and Norway spruce were processed into studs and battens. Before crosscutting, the external geometry of stems and logs were assessed. A 3 D-logscanner was used for the assessment of logs. Deformations such as bow, spring and twist were measured on studs and battens at green condition, at 18 % moisture content and at 12 % moisture content. Compression wood content in thin cross sections of discs, studs and battens were analysed using transmitted light and image analysis. The analyses showed that a majority of all discs and cross sections contained compression wood. In all studies, the pith eccentricity was significantly correlated to the discs´ compression wood content. For the 6 -year-old Scots pine trees, the compression wood content was significantly correlated to the size of basal sweep but not to out-of-roundness. For the 22 -year-old Scots pine trees, the compression wood content was not correlated to either <b>bow</b> <b>height</b> or size of basal sweep. For the 60 -year-old Norway spruce trees, the compression wood content was significantly correlated to compression wood content in log ends, pith eccentricity and <b>bow</b> <b>height.</b> For sawn timber, the compression wood content and its position was significantly correlated to bow and spring but not twist. Twist was significantly correlated to grain angle measured on tangential faces of studs and spiral grain angle measured under bark on the surface of logs. Results indicate that eccentric growth and compression wood formation play major roles in the development of stem straightness. Moreover, young trees with basal sweep will be straighter over time. Consequently, the straightness of a log is not a reliable measure of the compression wood content within the stem. By combining data describing external geometry with information regarding compression wood content and pith eccentricity obtained from log ends it is possible to detect logs that are prone to contain compression wood. The results also indicate that the distribution of compression wood in sawn timber influences the direction and size of bow and spring...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of compression wood {{in relation to}} eccentric growth and development of stem straightness was studied in a 22 -year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in central Sweden that was established with container-grown seedlings. Stem straightness was measured on the same 440 trees in 1986 and 1997. The number of stems with straight base sections increased from 60 % in 1986 to 89 % in 1997. Measurements of 72 sample trees in 2001 showed that 96 % of the trees had developed straight stem bases. External geometry data of the logs was obtained with a Rema 3 D log scanner. A sub-sample of 16 trees was randomly selected for analysis of compression wood distribution and eccentric-ity measurements. From each tree, 11 discs were cut at every 60 cm along the stem. All discs, except one, contained compression wood. Compression wood and pith eccentricity was most pronounced near the stem base but not significantly correlated to basal sweep. Severe compression wood content was correlated to pith eccentricity and <b>bow</b> <b>height.</b> In general, correlations were better for the basal sections of the logs. Even though most trees were straight, they contained large amounts of compression wood. It is evident that eccentric growth and compression wood formation play major roles {{in the development of}} stem straightness. In several stems, a spiral compression wood distribution pattern was found. Reasons for this are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Sawn {{wood from}} curved logs {{is prone to}} have cross grain and contain {{compression}} wood, both of which affect the dimensional stability. Different types of curvature can, however, have different effects on both the sawing process and board quality, which is why a stand-ard measure of <b>bow</b> <b>height</b> alone {{is not enough to}} sort logs or set the log quality. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the repeatability when sorting curved saw logs using a 3 D log scanner. In the study, 56 logs were categorized into five different curvature types and four different degrees of curvature severity. The logs were run through a Rema 3 D log scanner four times, and the external geometry was recorded. From the geometry data, variables describing log shapes were calculated and used to develop models using linear discriminant analysis, which was used to classify the logs according to curvature type. The accuracy and repeatability were evaluated for the classifications with Cohen’s simple Kappa coefficient. The results of this study showed that it is possible to sort logs by curve type using a 3 D log scanner, although sorting by curve type was largely dependent on curve severity. The repeatability test determined that the chance of a curved log being graded identically two consecutive times was 0. 40, measured as kappa...|$|E

40|$|Roll forming is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} automotive industry to form High Strength Steel (HSS) and Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for structural components. Because of the large variety of applications of roll forming in the industry, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{is increasingly}} utilized for roll forming process design. Bending is the dominant deformation mode in roll forming and sheet materials used in the process are often temper rolled (skin passed), roller- or tension-levelled. These processes introduce residual stresses into the material, and {{recent studies have shown}} that those affect the material behaviour in bending. A thickness reduction rolling process available at Deakin that leads to material deformation similar to an industrial temper rolling operation was used in this study to introduce residual stresses into a dual phase, DP 780, steel strip. The initial and thickness reduced strips were then used in a 5 -stand experimental V-section roll forming set-up to identify the effect of residual stress on the final shape. The influence of residual stress and the effect of plastic deformation on the material behaviour in roll forming are separately determined in numerical simulation. The results show that the thickness reduction rolling process decreases the maximum <b>bow</b> <b>height</b> while the springback angle and end flare increase. Comparison with experimental results shows that using material data from the conventional tensile test in a numerical simulation does not allow for the accurate prediction of shape defects in a roll forming process if a residual stress profile exists in the material. On the other hand including the residual stress information leads to improved model accuracy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of an industrial computed tomography scanner for the sawmilling industry {{raises the question of}} how to find a production strategy that uses a computed tomography scanner in the sawmill production line to its full potential. This study was focused on a Scandinavian sawmill processing Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The potential value increase when allowing an alternative log rotation other than the horns down position was investigated using a log breakdown simulation. The resulting data was analysed with respect to the size of the log rotational step, an introduced rotational error of the sawing machine and different price differences between the quality grades. It was also of interest to define the outer log properties that characterise the logs sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position compared to logs sawn for a greater profit return in a different log rotation. Such characteristics can be used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in an optimisation and consider instead other parameters, such as positioning and sawing pattern. Other defects such as pitch pockets, splits and rot are also of interest. The results shows that there is a potential value increase when applying the log rotation that maximises the value for each log instead of processing all logs in the horns down position. However, the potential value increase depends on the rotational error of the used sawing machine and the price differences between the quality grades. The log properties that differ between logs sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position compared to a different log rotation are the <b>bow</b> <b>height</b> and the log taper. Unfortunately, predictability of log rotation for greatest profit return based on the outer properties of logs is poor. It is not possible to differentiate logs which would be sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position from those where a different log rotation results in the greatest profit return, based only on their outer properties...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} thermoplastic deformation in as-received, single-side polished, 4 H-SiC wafers {{and also}} residual stresses in homoepitaxially grown epilayers on wafers by radius curvature measurements. The wafers studied had n-type resistivities of 0. 010 - 0. 011 Ω-cm and p-type resistivities of 4. 42, 4. 72, 9. 57 Ω-cm. In a first thermal excursion to 900 oC in vacuum, the <b>bow</b> <b>height</b> of the bare substrates {{in all cases}} decreased with temperature. Upon cooling down, however, the bow heights remained largely unchanged from their values at 900 oC. A second cyclic excursion to 900 oC did not yield any {{significant change in the}} curvature, thus indicating that the substrates had thermoplastically deformed in the first heating cycle. Epilayers having nitrogen doping between 5 x 1017 and 2 x 1019 cm- 3 grown on the n- and p-type substrates resulted in compressive stresses ranging between 190 and 400 MPa in the epilayers. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination of the n-type epilayer (with doping levels of 5 x 1017 cm- 3 and 5 x 1018 cm- 3) on the n-type substrate, revealed bands of stacking faults (SFs) confined within the epilayers after the bicrystals were further annealed at 1150 °C in nitrogen for thirty minutes. These doping levels are approximately one and two orders of magnitude below the reported threshold value of 3 x 1019 cm- 3 previously suggested for the onset generation of SFs in annealed n-type 4 H-SiC epilayers. The calculated residual stresses in all the epilayers were above the critical stress for the motion of dislocations above 1000 °C in 4 H-SiC. Thus the SFs that form by glide of pre-existing partial dislocations may actually be stress induced and occur across a much wider range of doping levels. Therefore, it is possible that a significant mechanism for formation of the stacking faults and 3 C bands observed in thermally treated 4 H-SiC wafer is stress relief via the generation and motion of new and pre-existing partial dislocations on the basal planes o...|$|E

40|$|The aim of log grading for pricing is {{to apply}} an {{economic}} value based on volume and log grade. However, unlike many other commodities logs are hard to characterize into different grades. The reasons are: internal properties are hard to decide from the external appearance, the wood properties are often heterogeneous {{and there are a}} variety of different grading criterias. In Sweden, as in many other countries, the log grading is based on visual assessment of log characteristics, which can be considered intricate, time consuming and monotonous. Moreover, factors like increasing labour cost, structural changes among sawmills and the introduction of new technology, are all changing the possibilities and demands for the sawmills. New technology is important in order for the sawmill industry to remain competitive and therefore the log grading system for pricing needs to become more flexible and adaptable to the new technology. This thesis investigates two different methods using automatic measuring techniques to grade logs for pricing. In the first method a 3 D log scanner is used to estimate log shape and this information is used to grade the log. The accuracy when using 3 D log scanning to grade logs, according to the grades in the current Swedish national grading system, was comparable with but somewhat lower than manual grading of logs. Scanner data were used to estimate curvature type and compression wood content. Models based on log scanner data could discriminate between curvature types if the curvature was severe and <b>bow</b> <b>height</b> larger than 0. 8 %. The models predicting compression wood were significant even though models using log end information were better. Analysis of whole stems showed that compression wood content was most pronounced near ground level and that stems with basal sweep more often had large amounts of severe compression wood. The second technique used acoustics and the results indicate that the technique has potential for grading logs by the stiffness of the sawn timber. The stiffness criterion was more important for spruce saw logs since spruce lumber is more often used for construction purposes. Using 3 D scanning, acoustic methods and other techniques would probably reduce costs and make log grading for pricing more efficient. To enable this, the log grading system needs to be simplified and adapted to the new automatic technologies. Based on the findings in this thesis, a base for a new grading system for pine and spruce is proposed...|$|E

5000|$|There {{are five}} primary models of Zon Bass guitars: the Mosaic series, the Sonus series, the Legacy Elite, the VB and the Hyperbass. Many models are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} configurations such as five or six-string models or models with custom electronics or woods. A signature feature of the Zon basses is the use of Phenowood instead of wood as the material for the fingerboard, laid on top of a neck made of wood composite. Phenowood is wood, often birch, that has been impregnated with a phenolic resin, layered and compressed under heat. [...] The necks of Zon guitars that use these rigid materials usually do not have truss rods, since they are not subject to <b>bowing.</b> String <b>height</b> is adjusted from the bridge. The tone generated by these materials is clear and bell-like, and players such as Manring and Zander Zon use these qualities to incorporate harmonics prominently in their playing.The Hyperbass is a fretless four-string model which has a radical body shape featuring an extended cutaway to give access to a three-octave fretless fingerboard. The biggest departure from traditional construction is the use of four detuning heads (usually basses have at most one) and a unique bridge design, which allows selective tuning changes of one or more strings. This design allows quick changes to a vast selection of altered tunings. The design also incorporates four separate transducers mounted in various locations on the instrument and uses a special output connector to allow access to these individual signals in addition to the signal from the magnetic pickup.|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the walking stability of R. dominica on a flat and smooth surface. The study was based on the determination of mortality, morphology and walking stability of the insect outside the grain mass, on a flat and smooth surface. Mortality of adults of this Coleoptera in conditions with and without food was similar, which explains the difficulty that this insect had for accessing the food source on the flat and smooth surface. The measurements of body length (BOL), width (<b>BOW)</b> and <b>height</b> (BOH) of R. dominica were compared with those of Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), which showed good ability to walk in these conditions. This study indicated that the former presents lower BOL and BOW, and greater BOH than the second, and all these variables showed differences when analyzed simultaneously by means of the construction of multivariate morphometric indices (Width × Height, Length × Height and Height × Length × Width). These morphometric variables, together with the definition of the geometry most similar to the body shape, resulted in determination of the center of gravity (CG) and static rollover threshold (SRTgeom) for both species. Rhyzopertha dominica and T. castaneum presented CGs considered high and low, respectively, and together with the values obtained for SRTgeom, may justify that R. dominica can be considered a less stable species during movement, and presents greater risk of rollover on flat and smooth surfaces...|$|R
