50|$|The BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) {{connector}} is {{a miniature}} quick connect/disconnect radio frequency connector used for coaxial cable. It features two bayonet lugs on the female connector; mating is fully achieved with a quarter {{turn of the}} coupling <b>nut.</b> BNC <b>connectors</b> are used with miniature-to-subminiature coaxial cable in radio, television, and other radio-frequency electronic equipment, test instruments, and video signals. The BNC was commonly used for early computer networks, including ARCnet, the IBM PC Network, and the 10BASE2 variant of Ethernet. BNC connectors are made to match the characteristic impedance of cable at either 50 ohms or 75 ohms. They are usually applied for frequencies below 4 GHz and voltages below 500 volts.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the search}} for a seismic {{isolator}} for low-rise buildings, this paper proposes a marble-graphite slide seismic isolation system composed of marble-graphite slides, an upper foundation beam, the lower counter{{part of the}} upper beam, and the corresponding stop blocks, with the stop blocks consisting of restrictive screws, positioning plates, <b>nut</b> <b>connectors</b> and stop holes linking the two foundation beams. To provide the desired isolation performance, plain mortar bars can be included at the beam interface to better control the initiating loads for foundation slippage. Tests of low-reversed cyclic loading were performed on four different masonry specimens: a recycled brick wall, a clay brick wall, an integrated recycled brick wall with flay ash blocks sandwiched between, and its clay brick counterpart. The four specimens were provided with marble-graphite slide isolators placed at the foundations. The isolator thickness was 20 mm, and the graphite and the marble served as a lubricant and a bearing, respectively. This paper then analyses all of the specimens in terms of the damage that occurred, the initiating load for slippage, the hysteretic performance, the bearing capacity and the performance of the stop blocks. The results indicate that mortar bars embedded in the marble-graphite slide isolator offer effective control of the initiating load, and the isolation system delivers good hysteretic performance. The stop blocks are capable of withstanding a large-magnitude earthquake and are a good choice for constraining the slippage displacement. Damage or failure of the specimens occurs only when the low-reversed cyclic loading continues after slippage takes place. The design is shown to be an outstanding and flexible seismic scheme for use in low-rise buildings...|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, an {{optional}} locking mechanism consisting of an outer hex nut encasing a captured threaded barrel {{was added to}} the 874 line. [...] It {{can be seen in the}} photograph of a GR-900 to GR-874 adapter,. The locking assembly is not captive and can be backed off the RF connector. The threaded barrel is supplied on each connector. The threaded barrel was withdrawn into the <b>nut</b> on one <b>connector</b> and extended on the other to allow the barrel to engage the nut of both mating connectors. This style of locking mechanism was continued in GR-874's thematic successors; the GR-900 precision 14 mm connector that retains a crenelated hermaphroditic mechanical anti-spin feature to protect the sexless RF interface from rotating and galling when the locking mechanism is tightened, and the fully sexless APC-7 7 mm connector.|$|R
40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. Self-drilling screws or rivets {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. Blind rivets and <b>nuts</b> as <b>connectors</b> are considered in the frames of this paper. Rivets have some benefits over self-drilling screws. They are: we can obtain more dense connection when using rivets. So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost of riveted connection; a large variety of installation tools for riveted connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to rivets. In the paper 4 types of rivets are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) blind rivets, zinc-coated steel blind rivets, stainless steel blind rivets and blind nuts. The features of each type of rivets are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear of riveted connections is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types of riveted connections subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by blind nuts. A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by rivets. As {{a result of the}} experiment the authors found out that the local deformations occuring under rivet head in the thick element significantly affect the behaviour and bearing capacity of the connection. That’s why the results of connection's bearing capacity obtained in tests were lower than the bearing capacity of rivet declared by manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{conventional}} {{composite construction}} involving hot-rolled steel section, the composite action is usually achieved by using conventional headed shear studs connectors. However, use of headed studs is not practical for cold-formed steel (CFS) section {{due to its}} very thin form {{that is difficult to}} weld. A suitable bolt and <b>nut</b> type shear <b>connector</b> was proposed; experimental tests were carried out to evaluate its performance. This study also investigated the use of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) integrated with CFS by means of bolted shear connectors to develop composite action. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to investigate the performance of bolted shear connectors in SCC integrated with CFS section as composite beam system. Eighteen push-out test specimens comprising of M 12, M 14 and M 16 sized bolted shear connector of grade 8. 8 with longitudinal spacings of 150 mm, 250 mm and 300 mm centers were fabricated, cast and tested until failure. The experimental results showed that all bolted shear connectors possessed a good shear resistance capacity. Not much difference in strength capacity of specimens with M 14 and M 16 bolted shear connectors was found, perhaps due to CFS failure. Varying the size and longitudinal spacing of the bolted shear connectors revealed that the connectors' strength capacity changed slightly between M 14 and M 16 bolts specimens but, significantly for M 12 bolt specimens...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} world {{population}} {{will be the}} challenge of the century regarding the carbon footprints. The human activities produce both direct and indirect carbon emission that is contributing to the climate change. The construction industry itself contributes around 30 percent of total carbon emissions in the world. Thus, the challenge is {{to solve the problem of}} meeting the increasing needs and expectations of a growing population while at the same time modifying the current production and consumption patterns to achieve a more sustainable development model. Based on this, the need for the sustainable structural element is inevitable. Extending the exploitation life of the structural element is one of the solutions that should be looked. Reusing instead of recycling the structural element is one of the ways to extend the exploitation life which can reduce the carbon emission. Therefore the innovation in the structural design to reduce the carbon emission is important. The purpose of this thesis is to study the feasibility of a conceptual design of demountable structural system. On the first part of the thesis, it investigated the structural behaviour of a composite floor beam that consists of steel beam, prefabricated concrete deck and a single embedded <b>nut</b> bolt shear <b>connector</b> in the SLS condition. To accommodate fabrication tolerance and construction process, the bolt shear connector must have enough clearance. Various bolt-hole gap in bolt shear connector is applied to see the effect on structural performance of composite floor beam in SLS. The study of demountable composite floor beam is performed by mean of analytical calculations and finite element analysis. It is found that the bolt-hole gap clearance influences the deflection of composite floor beam due to partial interaction between prefabricated concrete deck and steel beam which leads to incomplete interaction of composite floor beam. The bigger hole clearance, the higher deflection occurs on composite floor beam. The second part of the thesis explores the conceptual design of plug and play beam-column connection. The purpose of developing a plug and play beam-column connection is to reduce the construction time so that it is easy to be mounted and demounted. Two conceptual designs have been developed and were evaluated through FEA. The resistance of those two conceptual designs is found to be higher than fin-plate connection while the rotational stiffness of this plug-play connection can be classified as a nominally pinned joint. The last part of the thesis aims to see the possibility of having a non-symmetrical column splice connection on the column. This is interesting for the architect as it provides aesthetic benefit for the façade. The non-symmetrical column splice connection located on the corner is evaluated by FEA. The connection is a combination of end-plate and cover plate splice column connection. Due to unsymmetrical nature of the connection, the resistance and failure mode of the connection is different in a different orientation of the loading...|$|R
