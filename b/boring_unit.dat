40|$|AbstractThe {{action of}} pulling a solid {{continuum}} through a fluid filled stepped <b>bore</b> tubular <b>unit</b> of larger <b>bore</b> size than the continuum itself, {{gives rise to}} hydrodynamic pressure and resistance to axial pull. Depending on the relative dimension of the unit and the continuum and also the rheological properties of the fluid, the combined effect of the hydro-dynamic pressure and the axial pull may become sufficient to induce plastic yielding and subsequent permanent deformation in the continuum. In order to fully understand {{the mechanics of the}} deformation process, a mathematical model involving non-linear equations has been formulated. A finite difference numerical technique was then used to solve these equations without having to pre-describe the deformation profile of the continuum being pulled through a stepped <b>bore</b> <b>unit.</b> The fluid has been assumed to possess Newtonian characteristics during the passage through the unit...|$|R

40|$|A {{combined}} geometry plasto-hydrodynamic {{pressure unit}} {{has been investigated}} theoretically and experimentally. Previous investigators have used either stepped parallel or tapered <b>bore</b> pressure <b>unit</b> for die-less drawing and/or coating of wires, tubes and stripes. In the present study a combined parallel and tapered <b>bore</b> <b>unit</b> {{has been used in}} conjunction with polymer melts as pressure fluid. In this present work a pressure unit is heated to convert the polymer feed into a viscous melt and the pressure in the fluid is generated by hydrodynamic action when a wire is drawn through it. Experimental work has been carried out on different pressure units with similar external but different internal geometries to investigate the performance of new pressure unit. Different types of polymer were used as the pressure medium. In this work analytical models based on Newtonian and pseudo-Newtonian characteristics have been developed to investigate the performance of the pressure unit and to optimise the process. The predicted results showed reasonable agreement those observed experimentally in magnitudes of maximum pressure. Experimental and theoretical results, showed that there exists a gap ratio (optimum) for which the pressure is maximum. For greater or smaller values of the gap ratio than the optimum value, a decreased magnitude for the maximum pressure was obtained. The maximum pressure at that gap ratio(optimum) is much higher compared to those obtained using either stepped or tapered <b>bore</b> pressure <b>unit</b> at similar conditions...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the coating}} of fine wires using {{hydrodynamic}} pressure technique {{has been investigated}} theoretically and experimentally. One of the principal aims of the project is to establish the minimum possible coating thickness on fine wires which can be applied by means of hydrodynamic technique. Models based on steady, uniform and laminar flow of Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian fluid for polymer coating for the process of plasto-hydrodynamic wire coating in a stepped <b>bore</b> <b>unit</b> have been developed. The closed form analytical solution is established in cylindrical coordinate since the practical case is a mathematical axisymmetric problem. The comparison of theoretical results between Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid, and Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems has been made. The experimental procedures and methods have been outlined, a melt chamber and a die unit have been designed and used, and investigations into {{a wide range of}} coating and drawing conditions have been carried out. The experimental work includes by the polymer of low density polyethylene (Escoren) coating on stainless steel wires with three diameters ranging from 0. 1 - 0. 4 mm, varying the temperature of the polymer melt between 120 - 155 °C, converting the different diameters of dies ranging from 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm, and shifting the drawing speed between 0. 08 - 1. 31 m/s. The experimental data have been processed and presented graphically. Some significant conclusions have been made...|$|R
40|$|In plasto-hydrodynamic die-less {{wire drawing}} process, the {{conventional}} reduction die {{is replaced by}} a pressure unit of certain internal geometry. The deformation is induced by the combined effect of hydro-dynamic pressure and stress generated in the unit due to the motion of the wire and the viscous action of the polymer melt. The dimensions of the unit are such that the smallest bore size is greater than the incoming wire diameter. In this system, larger magnitude of the hydro-dynamic pressure is advantageous in obtaining greater deformation. In the present study, theoretical models have been developed for both the combined parallel and tapered geometry and simple taper <b>bore</b> pressure <b>units,</b> assuming non-Newtonian characteristics of the pressure medium, which enabled prediction of the maximum pressure and drawing stress, which gives better indication about the unit and it’s performance. The pressure and the viscosity coefficients were derived from the available data in the literature.

40|$|A finite {{elements}} method (FEM) -analysis {{has been carried}} out with the purpose to study dynamics of carrying system in a machine tool of unique height. This is a one-off machine with high traveling column and a support with horizontal slide can move vertically along the column. Spindle milling and <b>boring</b> <b>units</b> are mounted telescopically at slide butt end. The FEM-analysis of the machine tool has been made due to its renovation. Machine resonances, responses to cutting force, static and dynamic rigidity in spindles have been estimated in the paper. The machine carrying system is subtle, heavy and structurally complicated. Its structural chain includes a carriage, a column, a support, a slide, spindle units interconnected with the help of hydro-static guides. While varying main parameters their influence on rigidity has been investigated in the paper. Height of  support lifting, column material and rigidity of longitudinal drive have been changed during the investigations. Static, modal and harmonic MEF-analyses have been executed in the paper. Frequency-response characteristic of the machine has been constructed in the process of the investigations. Two support bending resonances have been detected in the column at low frequency. Such Due to this there are limits for usage of the machine in sub-resonance and static frequency range. The most powerful resonance has been observed at frequency of 27. 8 Hz. The resonance has manifested itself as torsional oscillations of the column together with the support and the slide. Slide bending resonances have been revealed at higher frequencies 65 – 105 Hz. Three intervals which are fit for machine operation have been determined between resonance ranges. There is a prospective usage of the machine in inter-resonance (32 – 65 Hz) and super-resonance (more than 105 Hz) intervals. It has been shown that rigidity in spindle is a sequence higher in dynamic intervals than in a static interval. Machine subtility can be compensated by its transition to high-speed machining. </p...|$|R

But all these battalions went through the process of recruiting, training, and working up in Canada before going overseas, thereby developing their own unit personality, traditions, and esprit de corps.

40|$|AIM:  to {{evaluate}} the flow, working time, setting time, film thickness and solubility of a novel root canal sealers (MTA Fillapex) in comparison with a zinc oxide-eugenol– based sealer (Tubli-Seal), epoxy resin-based sealers (AH 26), a calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Apexit Plus), and a silicone-based sealer (ReokkoSeal Automix). MATERIALS AND METHODS: ISO 6876 / 20012 specifications were followed except for the solubility test. Solubility {{was measured by the}} amount of material extracted from the specimens left in water over 24 hr period. Film thickness was measured as the distance between weighted glass slides containing a standard quantity of sealer. Flow was assessed by rate of sealer extrusion through a standard <b>bore</b> diameter, after <b>unit</b> time. Working time was taken as the point at which flow rate was reduced by 10 %. The indentation test using a modified Gilmore needle was employed to investigate the setting times. RESULTS: ReokkoSeal Automix and MTA Fillapex were the least soluble, whilst Tubli- Seal was the most unstable in water. Also, Tubli-Seal had the highest film thickness. All sealers showed comparable flow rates. The working time varied from 30 min for MTA Fillapex to 4 hr for AH 26. The range of setting times recorded was from 64 min for Tubli-Seal Xpress to more than 5 hr for AH 26. CONCLUSIONS: MTA Fillapex and RoekoSeal Automix showed the greatest stability in Solution. The film thickness values in increasing order were: AH 26 < Apexit plus = RoekoSeal Automix < MTA Fillapex < Tubli-Seal Xpress. The flow rates for Tubli-Seal xpress, AH 26, and RoekoSeal Automix are statistically similar, while Apexit plus and MTA Fillapex are statistically similar.
