30|$|Both {{simulations}} and {{experiments have}} shown that when a MWCNT is treated by ion irradiation, some carbon atoms can be knocked off, leaving vacancies in the tubes of the MWCNT [27]. Upon heating, the carbon atoms near the vacancies tend to form covalent bonds with other similar carbon atoms in a neighboring tube, driven by the reduction of high-energy dangling bonds of these carbon atoms. As a result, the tubes in the MWCNT are covalently bridged, leading to a significant increase of the inter-tube shear rigidity of the MWCNT. In other words, the relative inter-tube sliding in such a bridged MWCNT involves breaking the covalent C-C <b>bridging</b> <b>bonds,</b> thus is energetically unfavorable. The ion irradiation induced vacancies are also used to facilitate the <b>bridging</b> <b>bond</b> formation among SWCNTs to form CNT bundles [28, 29]. Inspired by these previous studies, next we demonstrate that vacancies can facilitate the formation of interlayer <b>bridging</b> <b>bonds</b> in a CNS, which in turn can effectively suppress the interlayer relative sliding in the CNS.|$|R

The cubic SiC (3 C-SiC) porous structures have not received as much attention because of the special conditions required to grow crystals of this polytype [10]; however, cubic pSiC exhibits promising properties for use in fast-response hydrogen (H) sensors [11].

Our study involves the physisorption of oxygen molecules, chemisorption of oxygen atoms and formation of an oxide, and deals with the equilibrium binding geometry and corresponding electronic energy structure. The binding energies of an oxygen molecule physisorbed at different sites are determined by calculating short and long range interactions. The triplet state of the physisorbed oxygen molecule is energetically favorable, whereas the nonmagnetic (spin paired) state yields a relatively stronger binding energy. An oxygen atom is adsorbed {{on top of the}} carbon-carbon bond. The zigzag bonds of the nanotubes are weakened and eventually are replaced by a carbon-oxygen-carbon <b>bridge</b> <b>bond.</b> Chemisorption of atomic oxygen and physisorption of an oxygen molecule modify the electronic energy structure of the bare tube in different ways.
