This grade is made up of mechanical pulp in between two layers of chemical pulp.The top layer is of bleached chemical pulp with an optional pigment coating. This is a low-density material with high stiffness and has a slightly yellow colour, mainly on the inside. The major end uses of folding <b>boxboard</b> are health and beauty products, frozen, chilled and other foods, confectionaries, pharmaceuticals, graphical uses and cigarettes.|$|E

50|$|The {{discovery}} of salt deposits in Rittman in 1897 {{led to the}} founding of Wayne Salt, which later became Ohio Salt. In 1948, Ohio Salt became Morton Salt - today one of Rittman's major employers. E.J. Young, who started the salt company, needed a way to package both his salt and his matches, which were made in nearby Wadsworth. Young formed the Ohio <b>Boxboard</b> Co. in 1903. That company became a major employer also, bringing to town many new employees and helping business grow. Ohio <b>Boxboard</b> was acquired by Packaging Corporation of America (PCA) in 1965, then Rittman Paperboard, boasting of over 1200 employees in its prime. Rittman Paperboard closed its doors in early 2006.|$|E

50|$|In 1983 Cascades' shares began {{trading on}} the Montreal Stock Exchange. That same year, its entry into the United States began with the {{start-up}} of Cascades Industries Inc. in Rockingham, North Carolina. In Québec, Cascades began producing kraft paper in East Angus and acquired a <b>boxboard</b> plant in Joncquière the following year.|$|E
50|$|One {{of these}} {{customers}} was Rock City. Its consumption of Tennessee Paper's board grew from about 1,000 tons in 1944 to about 37,000 tons in 1972, when it took 44 percent of Tennessee Paper's total <b>boxboard</b> production. Between 1965 and 1968 Tennessee Paper bought 29.5 percent of Rock City's common stock, preparing {{the way for}} the eventual merger of the two companies. By then Rock City owed Tennessee Paper more than $4 million in loans.|$|E
50|$|From {{the mid-19th}} century to the early 20th century a section of Tonawanda was known as Goose Island. Goose Island was a manmade island in the Niagara River formed by the Erie Canal. Goose Island was a {{triangular}} piece of land bordered on one side by the Niagara River, on the second side by the Tonawanda Creek, and on the third by the Erie Canal. It was then famous with seamen the world over as the terminus of the Erie Canal and for the Goose Island girls. The Goose Island Section of Tonawanda had many cheap boarding houses, cheap hotels, bars, and houses of ill repute. Canalers often wintered over on Goose Island. Goose Island {{was known as a}} bad section of Tonawanda, with drunkenness, brawling, and bawdy displays being commonplace. The gentrification of Goose Island began with the decline of the lumbering port business in Tonawanda and the building of a <b>boxboard</b> mill there on the island. Then the canal was motorized, eliminating mules and many canal men. Next the section of the canal from Tonawanda to Buffalo was abandoned in 1918. That section of the canal was filled in and Goose Island was no longer an island. The establishments in the Goose Island section of Tonawanda came under community pressure in the 1920s and 1930s and were closed, with more of the land there being given over to the <b>boxboard</b> mill. In the 1970s the <b>boxboard</b> mill closed and was razed along with many remaining Goose Island structures. Goose Island street names Tonawanda, First, Clay and Chestnut disappeared. At the turn of the millennium waterfront dwellings were built along the Niagara River, completing the gentrification of this area.|$|E
50|$|Cascades Énergie {{paved the}} way for a series of {{acquisitions}} in which Cascades' activities were largely diversified. The purchase of Rolland and Paperboard Industries Corporation in 1992, Perkins Papers in 1995, Provincial Papers in 1997 and, that same year, the creation of Norampac in partnership with Domtar, led to the restructuring of Cascades into five distinct corporate groups whose operations were focused as much in the sector of specialized packaging as in those of containerboard, tissue paper, fine papers and <b>boxboard.</b>|$|E

The company {{continued}} to operate the smelter at a loss until 2002, hauling in ore concentrate by rail to Sandy Beach and exporting refined copper ingots. In 2002 the Gaspésia Paper Mill in Chandler closed, effectively ending any regular freight service east of New Richmond. In 2006, the Smurfit-Stone <b>boxboard</b> plant in New Richmond shut down, putting an end to any regular freight service east of Nouvelle. Today, the only regular freight service on the line serves the Temrex sawmill in Nouvelle-Ouest.|$|E
50|$|Corrugated (also called pleated) {{paper was}} {{patented}} in England in 1856, {{and used as}} a liner for tall hats, but corrugated <b>boxboard</b> was not patented and used as a shipping material until 20 December 1871. The patent was issued to Albert Jones of New York City for single-sided (single-face) corrugated board. Jones used the corrugated board for wrapping bottles and glass lantern chimneys. The first machine for producing large quantities of corrugated board was built in 1874 by G. Smyth, {{and in the same}} year Oliver Long improved upon Jones's design by inventing corrugated board with liner sheets on both sides. This was corrugated cardboard as we know it today.|$|E
50|$|The Scottish-born Robert Gair {{invented the}} pre-cut {{cardboard}} or paperboard box in 1890 - flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came {{about as a}} result of an accident: he was a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, and one day, while he was printing an order of seed bags, a metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes. Applying this idea to corrugated <b>boxboard</b> was a straightforward development when the material became available around the turn of the twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{entering}} the new millennium, {{the scope of}} the tissue paper sector grew in 2001 with the acquisition of the mills in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin. Two years later, the group sustained its momentum and set up shop in Alberta, in New York, in Arizona, in Oregon and in Tennessee. In 2004, the <b>boxboard</b> sector stood out with the acquisition of Dopaco Inc., a leader in the packaging products sector destined for the quick service restaurant industry. Not to be left out, Norampac proceeded with the implementation, between 2001 and 2006, of several ultra-modern corrugated cardboard mills in Canada and in the United States.|$|E

Tomlinson and John Stagmaier, two of Tennessee Paper's three founders, were Athens, Tennessee, businessmen who already owned box factories. The company's third founder was A.M. Sheperd of Vincennes, Indiana, a <b>boxboard</b> manufacturer. Tennessee Paper Mills was incorporated in 1917 with Stagmaier as president, Tomlinson as vice-president, and Sheperd as general manager. With $300,000 raised from stock offerings, the three men established a paperboard factory in Chattanooga, where operation began in July 1918.

This new expansion took shape in 1986 {{with the creation of}} Cascades S.A. and the acquisition of another French <b>boxboard</b> mill in Blendecques. From 1987 to 1989, other mills located in Sweden and Belgium became part of the Cascades Group as well: Djupafors AB in Sweden and Kartonfabriek van Duffel NV in Belgium. The Belgian mill was renamed Cascades Duffel NV but ceased its production in 1993 after heavy losses and then was immediately transformed into a cutting center for the other European mills of the group. Declared definitively closed in the accounts of 1997, it was reconverted in 2002 by the ex-President of the Board of Cascades, Laurent Lemaire, to a so-called internal commercial agency, under the name with slightly modified orthography of Cascade Duffel NV, and having only one unit of establishment called Korton Fabrick van Ouffel, located at the exact address of the old mill Kartonfabriek van Duffel which was resold by Cascades to another company in 1998. This so-called agency (before different fiscal controles ...), without collaborator working in Belgium, was implied at the time of exports of cartonboard out of Europe, in particular those in transit by the port of Antwerp (according to Boards of directors of Cascades SA of June 28, 2002 and Nov 3, 2003).

40|$|Alkaline {{peroxide}} mechanical pulping of paulownia wood {{harvested from}} exotic tree plantations in northern Iran was investigated. The fiber length, width, and cell wall thickness of this wood were measured as 0. 82 mm, 40. 3 μm, and 7. 1 μm, respectively. The chemical composition including cellulose, lignin, and extractives soluble in ethanol-acetone, 1 % NaOH, {{hot and cold}} water was determined as 49. 5 %, 25 %, 12. 1 %, 26. 9 %, 11. 4 %, and 8. 1 % respectively. The ash content of this wood was 0. 45 %. Pre-washed chips were chemically treated at 70 °C for 120 minutes with different combinations of three dosages (1. 5, 3, and 4. 5 %) of hydrogen peroxide and three dosages (1. 5, 3, and 4. 5 %) of sodium hydroxide prior to defibration. Other chemicals including DTPA, sodium silicate, and MgSO 4 were constant at 0. 5 %, 3 %, and 0. 5 %, respectively. The results showed that using a 1. 5 % hydrogen peroxide and 4. 5 % sodium hydroxide charge, the brightness of APMP pulp reached 68. 7 % ISO and higher chemical dosages did not improve the brightness; however, to produce APMP pulp with higher strength, a sodium hydroxide charge of 4. 5 % was needed. The tensile strength, tear strength, burst strength indices, and bulk density of the APMP pulp produced from 1. 5 % hydrogen peroxide and 4. 5 % sodium hydroxide were measured as 15. 5 Nm/g, 6. 54 mN. m 2 /g, 0. 56 kPa. m 2 /g, and 3. 47 cm 3 /g, respectively.

40|$|Työssä selvitettiin kahden erilaisen jauhinterätyypin toimivuutta. Testattiin OptiFiner Pro-kartiojauhimeen uutta terää ja TwinFlo-levyjauhimeen tarkoitettua puristusjauhatusterää. Selvitettiin myös mäntysellun lujuuspotentiaalia ja käsiarkkien kuivatusmenetelmien eroavaisuuksia. Kirjallisuusosassa tarkasteltiin taivekartongin rakennetta, sellun jauhatusta ja kuitujen käyttäytymistä jauhatuksessa. Käsiteltiin myös yleistä jauhatusteoriaa ja puristusjauhatusta, sekä työssä käytettyjä jauhintyyppejä. Työn kokeellisessa osassa tutkittiin koivu-/mäntyselluista tehtyjen käsiarkkien ominaisuuksia. Tavoitteena oli selvittää saadaanko uusilla OptiFiner Pro:n terillä parempaa vetolujuutta. Nitrobar-koeterillä tavoitteena oli myös parantaa vetolujuutta, mutta myös selvittää koeterien puristusjauhatusmenetelmän toimivuutta. Kokeellisessa osassa ilmeni, että vetolujuus ei parantunut OptiFiner Pro:n terillä. Nitrobar-koeterillä ei saatu toivottua vaikutusta aikaiseksi, eli puristusjauhatusmenetelmä ei onnistunut. Syynä saattoi olla liian kovat teräkuormat. Työssä selvisi, että jatkotutkimuksia ja kehitystä molemmilla terillä kannattaa jatkaa. Näiden tutkimusten perusteella osoittautui myös, että käsiarkkien kuivatusmenetelmillä ei ole huomattavia kutistumiseroja ja että mäntysellulla on vielä lujuuspotentiaalia, eli sitä kannattaa jauhaa enemmän. Two {{different}} kinds of refiner plates were tested in this work. One of the plates tested was for an OptiFiner Pro conical refiner {{and the other for}} a TwinFlo disk refiner. The test-plates for the disk refiner were designed for internal refining. In both cases of the tests, the objective was to attain higher tensile strength to the product. The tensile strength potential of pine pulp and differences between two drying methods of hand sheets were also evaluated. The profile of folding <b>boxboard,</b> refining of pulp and the impact on the fibres before and after refining was discussed in the theory part of the work. The most common refining theories and theory behind internal refining was also discussed, likewise the refiners use in this work. The features of the hand sheets were deliberated in the experimental study. The main goal was to determine if the pulp obtained better tensile strength during the refining with the OptiFiner Pro plates. This was also the case with the Nitrobar internal reining plates, but the aim was also to examine the performance of the internal refining technique. In the experimental study {{it turned out that the}} tensile strength did not developed with the OptiFiner Pro test plates. A desired effect did not either occur with the Nitrobar plates. The conclusion is that the internal refining technique did not work in this case. The result of this study is that further development and trials are needed to accomplish the targets of both refining plates. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two drying methods in order of shrinkage and the pine pulp could be refined further to optimize its tensile strength potential...|$|E
