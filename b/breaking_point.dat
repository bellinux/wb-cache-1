5|$|The Law of Prairial was the <b>breaking</b> <b>point</b> for {{opponents of}} Robespierre. Resistance to the Terror spread {{throughout}} the Convention, and Saint-Just was compelled to address the division. Bertrand Barère and other Thermidorians have claimed that he proposed a dictatorship for Robespierre, but nonetheless some of them considered him to be redeemable, or at least useful – until he delivered his uncompromising public defence of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794).|$|E
25|$|A <b>break</b> <b>point</b> occurs if the receiver, not the server, has {{a chance}} to win the game with the next <b>point.</b> <b>Break</b> <b>points</b> are of {{particular}} importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 30–40 or advantage), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has <b>break</b> <b>point,</b> double <b>break</b> <b>point</b> or triple <b>break</b> <b>point,</b> respectively. If the receiver does, in fact, win their <b>break</b> <b>point,</b> the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have converted their <b>break</b> <b>point.</b> If the receiver fails to win their <b>break</b> <b>point</b> it is called a failure to convert. Winning <b>break</b> <b>points,</b> and thus the game, is also referred to as breaking serve, as the receiver has disrupted, or broken the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a <b>break</b> <b>point</b> it is referred to as breaking back. Except where tie-breaks apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the consistency of}} trend <b>break</b> <b>point</b> estimators {{when the number of}} breaks is underspecified. The consistency of <b>break</b> <b>point</b> estimators in a simple location model with level shifts has been well documented by researchers under various settings, including extensions such as allowing a time trend in the model. Despite the consistency of <b>break</b> <b>point</b> estimators of level shifts, there are few papers on the consistency of trend shift <b>break</b> <b>point</b> estimators in the presence of an underspecified break number. The simulation study and asymptotic analysis in this paper show that the trend shift <b>break</b> <b>point</b> estimator does not converge to the true <b>break</b> <b>points</b> when the <b>break</b> number is underspecified. In the case of two trend shifts, the inconsistency problem worsens if the magnitudes of the breaks are similar and the breaks are either both positive or both negative. The limiting distribution for the trend <b>break</b> <b>point</b> estimator is developed and closely approximates the finite sample performance...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the strong}} win, bitter {{feelings}} at Johns Hopkins {{continued to grow}} into the next season. The school's attitude towards the series worsened {{to the point where}} the 1889 game was rescheduled away from the traditional Thanksgiving Day playing and was moved to a week earlier. That year's game ended in a 36–0 shutout victory for the Naval Academy, and wound up being the <b>breaking</b> <b>point</b> for Johns Hopkins. Hopkins decided to terminate the series following that game. However, Hopkins' students returned to the Naval Academy the following year, yet again to root against Navy, this time supporting Lehigh.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 {{the fragile}} {{relations}} between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile finally reached their <b>breaking</b> <b>point</b> when, on April 13, the Germans announced via the Katyn Commission {{the discovery of the}} bodies of 20,000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the Soviets and buried in Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, Russia. Stalin claimed that the atrocity had been carried out by the Germans, while Nazi propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels successfully exploited the Katyn massacre to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, did not acknowledge responsibility for this and similar massacres of Polish officers until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations {{had tried}} {{several times to}} {{reconcile}} {{the government of the}} Congo with the State of Katanga, which had declared independence under Moïse Tshombe with Belgian support in 1960. Though initially limiting its actions, the United Nations Operation in the Congo became increasingly impatient towards Katanga and Tshombe and drew up plans to resolve the situation through force. Tshombe continuously violated agreements he had made with the United Nations and the Congolese government by building up his forces and bringing foreign mercenaries into the conflict. The situation came to a <b>breaking</b> <b>point</b> in December 1962 when Katangese gendarmes attacked peacekeeping forces in Katanga. United Nations Secretary-General U Thant authorised a retaliatory offensive to eliminate secessionist opposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{fight at}} P'ohang-dong {{was the final}} <b>breaking</b> <b>point</b> for North Korean units already {{on the verge of}} {{exhaustion}} from continuous combat. North Korean supply lines were overextended to the point of breaking down, causing a collapse in resupply that is seen as a primary factor in turning the tide of the battle. Moreover, U.S. air superiority was also crucial to the engagement, since repeated bombing runs by U.S. aircraft prevented North Korean ground forces from reaching and holding their objectives.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} of the separation and constant press attention began to take its toll of Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The <b>breaking</b> <b>point</b> came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.|$|E
5|$|At <b>Breaking</b> <b>Point,</b> Punk {{defeated}} The Undertaker in a submission {{match to}} retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Undertaker originally won the match with his Hell's Gate submission hold. SmackDown general manager Theodore Long restarted the match after stating that the ban that former general manager Vickie Guerrero had placed on the move was still in effect. Punk won the match with his Anaconda Vise when referee Scott Armstrong called for the bell despite Undertaker never submitting (reminiscent to the Montreal Screwjob, {{which took place in}} the same venue in 1997). The feud between the two continued and at the Hell in a Cell PPV, Punk lost the World Heavyweight Championship to The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. He lost two subsequent rematches against The Undertaker on SmackDown and in a Fatal Four Way match at Bragging Rights also involving Batista and Rey Mysterio.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Dickey and Fuller {{proposed}} the tests for unit root hypotheses in a uni-variate time series. Perron [1989] extended the t-ratio type unit-root tests {{so that they}} allow for {{a break in the}} deterministic trend and / or in the intercept term. In practice, it seems difficult to specify the <b>break</b> <b>point</b> correctly. Zivot and Andrews [1992] proposed a test in which the <b>break</b> <b>point</b> is statistically determined. Morimune and Nakagawa [1999] studied the effect of a miss specified <b>break</b> <b>point</b> on the Perron tests, and the accuracy of the asymptotic expression is examined under various specifications of the error. This paper proposes to set an interval that possibly covers a <b>break</b> <b>point</b> in the Perron tests. This helps to avoid miss specifying the <b>break</b> <b>point,</b> and the unit root test is less susceptible to the choice of a particular <b>break</b> <b>point.</b> Furthermore, an orthogonal decomposition of the F-ratio type test is proposed to find the correlation between the first difference of the series and the trend.

Another tool Bolton and Hand develop for behavioural fraud detection is <b>Break</b> <b>Point</b> Analysis. Unlike Peer Group Analysis, <b>Break</b> <b>Point</b> Analysis operates on the account level. A <b>break</b> <b>point</b> is an observation where anomalous behaviour for a particular account is detected. Both the tools are applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to carry out the Bayesian {{analysis}} of a two-phase regression model with an unknown <b>break</b> <b>point.</b> Essentially, there are two problems associated with a changing linear model. Firstly, one will want to be able to detect a <b>break</b> <b>point,</b> and secondly, assuming that a change has occurred, to be able to estimate it as well as other parameters of the model. Much o f the classical testing procedure for the parameter constancy (as the Chow test, CUSUM, CUSUMSQ, tests and their modifications, predictions tests for structural stability) indicate only that the regression coefficients shifted, without specifying a <b>break</b> <b>point.</b> In this study we adopt the Bayesian methodology of investigating structural changes in regression models. The <b>break</b> <b>point</b> is identified as the largest posterior mass density, the peak of the posterior discrete distribution of a <b>break</b> <b>point.</b> It seems to work well with artificially generated data. The Bayesian framework also seems to be promising for extending the analysis of a single break to that of multiple breaks.
