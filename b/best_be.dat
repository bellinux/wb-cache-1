5|$|Before {{turning to}} the {{district}} court's rulings, we must acknowledge a certain awkwardness in deciding whether the Act encompasses the Tribe without considering {{at the same time}} whether the Act encompasses the controverted land transactions with Maine. Whether the Tribe is a tribe within the Act would <b>best</b> <b>be</b> decided, under ordinary circumstances, along with the Tribe's specific land claims, for the Act only speaks of tribes {{in the context of their}} land dealings.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could <b>best</b> <b>be</b> reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
5|$|The United States naval gunfire support {{debate is}} an ongoing debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and {{independent}} groups like the United States Naval Gunfire Support Association over what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role can <b>best</b> <b>be</b> provided. At {{the heart of the}} issue is the role that naval gunfire support—the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range—should play in the U.S. Navy of the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} layers {{deposited}} varies with {{location in the}} Lake Lewis basin. This can <b>best</b> <b>be</b> understood {{as the result of}} multiple floods; the variable levels correspond to Lake Missoula breaching the ice dam at varying lake levels, releasing different volumes of flood waters. This would suggest the time between floods is variable.|$|E
5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Zygoballus rufipes, with whom its range overlaps. The male can be distinguished from Z.rufipes by the large spot of white scales {{at the beginning of}} the thoracic slope (which is lacking in Z. rufipes), and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp (Z. rufipes has a transverse division). The female can <b>best</b> <b>be</b> distinguished by the form of the epigyne (the external genital structure).|$|E
5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became {{manager of the}} Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could <b>best</b> <b>be</b> physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E

5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would <b>best</b> <b>be</b> visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the White Paper, the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow could <b>best</b> <b>be</b> accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the White Paper required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{his stature}} within the archaeological establishment, the {{government}} appointed Wheeler as the British representative on a UNESCO project {{to undertake a}} programme of rescue archaeology in the Nile Valley ahead {{of the construction of}} the Aswan Dam, which was going to flood large areas of Egypt and Sudan. Personally securing UK funding for the project, he deemed it an issue of national and personal shame when he was unable to persuade the British government to supply additional funding for the relocation of the Abu Simbel temples. In October 1968, he took part in a UNESCO visit to Pakistan to assess the state of Mohenjo-daro, writing the project's report on how the archaeological site could <b>best</b> <b>be</b> preserved. His involvement with UNESCO continued {{for the rest of his}} life, and in March 1973 he was invited to the organisation's conference in Paris.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} Super Mario Galaxys {{gameplay}} originated from ideas taken from Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000 to exemplify the processing {{power of the}} GameCube. The demonstration's director (and future director of Super Mario Galaxy), Yoshiaki Koizumi, desired {{that one of its}} distinguishing features, spherical-based platforms, should be used in a future game, but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons. Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested to work on the next large-scale Mario game after Nintendo EAD Tokyo finished development on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004, pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised. A prototype of the game's physics system took three months to build, where it was decided that the game's use of spherical platforms would <b>best</b> <b>be</b> suited to planetoids in an outer space environment, with the concept of gravity as a major feature. During development, the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto from his office in Kyoto, where he would make suggestions to the game design. According to Koizumi, many ideas were conceived before development of the Wii console itself begun.|$|E
