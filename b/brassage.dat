The military demanded that the CNDP soldiers undergo <b>brassage,</b> mixage having failed, and three months of standoff ensued as relations between soldiers loyal to Nkunda and loyalist troops grew increasingly tense. Matters reached a breaking point when the army chief of staff declared that the offensive against the FDLR would be halted.

5000|$|General Laurent Nkunda {{had been}} a senior officer in the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (Goma faction) after 1998. Following {{the end of the}} Second Congo War in 2003, he was offered a {{position}} in the army of the transitional government but refused to join out of fear that he would be arrested due to the International Criminal Court investigation against him. In 2004 his troops attacked Bukavu before retreating, but he rebelled again in November 2006 and attacked Goma. After sustaining heavy casualties in battle with the Pakistani battalion of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC), he entered negotiations with the government and agreed to put his men into mixage, which involved mixing rebel and non-rebel units together but is not <b>brassage.</b> Perhaps inspired by the recently concluded general elections, when Nkunda engaged in negotiations with Major General John Numbi, at that time head of the Congolese air force, he declared the group he led to be the National Congress for the Defence of the People on 30 December 2006. [...] Nkunda benefited greatly from mixage; before 2007, he had two brigades while mixage created five mixed brigades. While numbers are disputed, Nkunda's two original brigades (the 81st and the 83rd) numbered about 2,200 men but by May 2007 some 8,000 to 8,500 men considered themselves under his command. [...] This expansion was at least partially accomplished because Nkunda began incorporating all manner of men with unclear backgrounds into the brigades under his control, including former Rwandan soldiers, members of former militias who had been demobilized and had no skills outside of war, and others simply attracted to his populist Tutsi rhetoric.|$|E

40|$|Dans la retenue hypereutrophe de Grangent, le {{phytoplancton}} estival est dominé par la cyanobactérie Microcystis aeruginosa. Dans le but de lutter contre {{la formation}} de ces blooms cyanobactériens, une expérimentation de <b>brassage</b> artificiel épilimnique par aération a été réalisée en 1997 - 1998. Ce dispositif avait pour but de créer des turbulences supprimant l'avantage adaptatif que constitue, chez M. aeruginosa, la faculté de réguler sa flottabilité. Il devait également permettre l'homogénéisation des teneurs en oxygène dissous, la réduction des pics de pH, de la turbidité des eaux superficielles et des teneurs en ammonium. Les résultats escomptés ont été vérifiés pour les paramètres physicochimiques. Les valeurs se sont révélées plus homogènes, mais seulement à proximité des lignes de <b>brassage</b> et uniquement jusqu'à 10 m de profondeur. En revanche, les blooms cyanobactériens n'ont pas été réduits. Il apparaît même au contraire que, sous l'influence du mélange, les cyanobactéries ont eu à leur disposition une plus grande quantité de nutriments qu'elles ont utilisés pour constituer des réserves glucidiques. Ainsi, en aval de la zone brassée, ces réserves ont permis une synthèse protéique plus importante. Sur la retenue de Grangent, le dispositif de <b>brassage</b> peut offrir une solution palliative du point de vue touristique en limitant l'accumulation de cyanobactéries en surface, mais il ne permet pas d'éliminer, ni même de diminuer, les proliférations de M. aeruginosa en période estivale. In the reservoir of Grangent, a highly eutrophic lake {{located on the}} upper part of the Loire River, about 10 miles south of Saint-Étienne (France), Microcystis aeruginosa usually dominates the phytoplankton community in late summer and early autumn for many years. Mass developments of this cyanobacterium led to serious difficulties in multi-purpose usage. In order to fight against blooms, an epilimnic artificial mixing was experimented. M. aeruginosa is adapted to stable stratification of the water column. Therefore, partial destratification or bubbling with air are employed to replace M. aeruginosa by better grazable, non- " blooming " and non-toxic species. This cyanobacterium is supposed to lose its advantage of buoyancy and to reduce his growth. This system was also employed to reduce peaks of pH, turbidity of surface waters and concentration of NH 4 and to homogenize the dissolved oxygen concentration inside the water column. Three lines of mixing were tested in 1998 : one located at "Châtelet", upstream of reservoir, measuring 700 m at 11 m depth; one near the beach of Saint-Victor, with the same length and immersed to 15 m depth and, finally, a line of 400 m, near the port, at 16 m depth (figure 1). Data were collected from representative sites, upstream, near and downstream the artificial mixing. They were sampled weekly since April to November 1998. At each site the vertical profiles of temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured (figure 2). For each sample, the parameters following were analyzed: pH, NO 3, NH 4, PO 4, carbohydrates, proteins, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton enumeration. Concerning the physicochemical parameters, the assumptions were checked: the values appeared more homogeneous near the lines of mixing than at the other stations. For example, the average temperatures varied between 20, 6 °C (at 10 m depth) and 21, 3 °C (at 0, 5 m depth) at Saint-Victor. This variation reached 1, 3 °C at the station Camaldules. On the other hand, this effect was perceived only up to 10 m of depth and at a limited distance of mixing. In the same way, the colonies of M. aeruginosa were mixed in the water column but only up 10 m depth and near mixing. Moreover, their growth has not decreased on the whole of reservoir. In period of bloom (August 25), G/P ratio was higher in the mixing zone than in the neighbourhoods, primarily because of an increase in carbohydrates (figure 3). In the mixed zone, M. aeruginosa seemed to benefit greater quantity of mineral elements it could use to constitute carbohydrates reserves (figure 4). In this way, when the conditions that became less favourable, like downstream, cyanobacteria were able to follow their development by synthesizing proteins starting from their reserves in carbohydrates. In the reservoir of Grangent, artificial mixing did not allow to fight effectively against blooms of cyanobacteria. Colonies of M. aeruginosa were simply diluted in the water column near mixing but did not reduce their growth...|$|E
40|$|Air {{bubbling}} systems prevent {{ice formation}} {{on the surface}} of a body of water because the warm water at depth can be brought to the surface by rising air bubbles. The amount of heat available in the water must be known to calculate the thermal reserve. Lake temperatures are largely controlled by convection overturning, but fresh water has a maximum density at 39. 2 degrees F which affects circulation and the resulting temperature. Canada's lakes are mostly of the temperate type and therefore have two turnover periods, in spring and in fall. Wind action is also very important. River water temperatures are nearly the same throughout because of mixing. Although sea water air bubbling systems have been used, careful studies must be made to ensure ice can be melted by this method. Maximum density does not occur at 39. 2 degrees F, hence convection mixing may occur until ice forms at the surface. To design an air bubbling system to prevent ice formation the thermal regime of the fresh water body and its surroundings must be known. The area of influence of each jet {{and the size of the}} hole must also be known. Design studies so far have been mostly empirical. No engineering procedure has been developed. Some experimental studies have been reported and details are given of the flow patterns of various orifices for use in ice prevention at the Grand Coulee Dam. Work needs to be carried out on how the heat stored at depth under an ice surface can be used efficiently to prevent further ice growth.

40|$|International audienceSaint Philip Neri, {{though an}} emblematic {{figure of the}} Catholic Reformation in Rome, {{illustrates}} {{the fragility of the}} boundary between Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy. The devotions he encouraged have frequently been suspected of Heterodoxy. They often reflect the " long-term " phenomena of permanence and survival that enter into conflict with a History based on legislations. These devotions reflect the probable influence of the Devotio Moderna, the Savonarolism claimed by Neri, but also the spirituality of Juan de Valdés, which was transmitted to Neri by the Barnabite Bonsignore Cacciaguerra, who had frequented the followers of Valdés in Naples. Music fully partakes of this spiritual identity, as a fundamental element of the devotions, but also because the Spanish influence via Naples has a bearing on polyphonic writing {{as well as on the}} spirituality of Juan de Valdés; and because Spanish musicians at the Roman Oratory also transmitted spiritual influences and encouraged exchanges with the Roman Spanish parishes. Soto de Langa translated Juan de Ávila's treatise into Italian. These diverse influences are not contradictory; the subtle relation between Savonarolism and Valdesianism in Neri's ideas still needs to be studied. S. Filippo Neri, figura centrale della Riforma cattolica a Roma, ha sintetizzato varie influenze intellettuali e spirituali, non tutte ortodosse. Tramite la poesia, la musica e la devozione si possono rintracciare alcune fonti ideologiche, come ad esempio quella napoletana, valdese e filospagnola.

40|$|L'évolution spatio-temporelle, {{qualitative}} et quantitative du peuplement phytoplanctonique a été suivie au lac municipal de Yaoundé. Pour cela des prélèvements hebdomadaires ont été effectués de novembre 1996 à décembre 1997, {{au niveau}} d'une station de la zone centrale du lac. Trois descripteurs (indice de diversité spécifique, régularité et diagrammes rangs-fréquences) ont été utilisés pour l'analyse de la dynamique de la structure du peuplement. L'indice de diversité spécifique obtenu à partir des biomasses spécifiques, par la formule dérivée de celle de SHANNON et WEAVER (1949), est compris entre 0, 68 et 4, 64 bits/µg. La régularité (PIELOU, 1966) varie de 0, 14 à 0, 84; les faibles valeurs correspondant dans l'ensemble à la présence des espèces fortement dominantes. Les profils des diagrammes rangs-fréquences, établis en coordonnées log-log, associés aux faibles valeurs de la diversité, sont essentiellement caractéristiques des stades pionniers (1 et 1 ') de l'évolution d'un lac tel que décrits par MARGALEF (1967) et FRONTIER (1976). Le stade 2 est rare alors que le stade 3 est absent. Une analyse simultanée basée sur les variations spatio-temporelles de la densité cellulaire et de l'indice de diversité spécifique, sur les valeurs de la régularité, et sur les profils des diagrammes rangs-fréquences révèle le caractère immature permanent des populations phytoplanctoniques inféodées à ce biotope, et caractérise ainsi un milieu eutrophe à hypereutrophe où aucun stade d'équilibre n'est atteint. La richesse du milieu en éléments biogènes et sa faible profondeur (Zmax= 4, 3 m) sont à l'origine de sa vulnérabilité. L'événement susceptible d'interrompre la succession des populations s'est avéré être le <b>brassage</b> des eaux, provoqué aussi bien par les pluies que les vents dont l'énergie cinétique est fréquemment suffisante pour entraîner un <b>brassage</b> complet d'une colonne d'eau de hauteur aussi faible. The Yaounde municipal lake (3 ° 52 'N, 11 ° 32 'E) is a shallow hypertrophic water body (Z max= 4. 3 m), situated downstream from Yaounde. It is an artificial lake {{resulting from a}} dam constructed in 1951 across a small river named Mingoa. Like many other water bodies in urbanised areas, this ecosystem switched rapidly from being mesotrophic to hypertrophic during the 1980 's, due {{to the expansion of}} human activity and an inefficient treatment of wastewater in its catchment area. This study was carried out with the objective to analyse the ecological succession and the spatio-temporal fluctuations of the phytoplankton population structure in this shallow equatorial lake. Samples were collected at weekly intervals from November 1996 to December 1997, at a station near its central zone (depth= 3. 5 m), using an opaque horizontal PVC Van Dorn sampler. Sampling operations were conducted at the following levels: surface; - 0. 5 m; - 1 m; - 1. 5 m and - 2. 5 m. Individual phytoplankton from 1 % iodine acid preserved subsamples (BOURRELLY, 1990) were enumerated with an inverted microscope (Olympus CK 2) at 200 X magnification, using a Sedgwick-Rafter counting cell, according to UTHERMÖHL (1958). At least 400 individuals (colonies, bundles or trichomes, depending on existing life forms) were counted on each subsample. Specific biomass was then obtained using the biovolume method. To evaluate the population structure dynamics, the SHANNON and WEAVER (1949) specific diversity index method and the evenness (PIELOU, 1966) method were computerized using specific biomass, the evenness being the ratio between the real and the maximal diversity (log 2 S, where S is the number of species). Also, rank-frequency diagrams were carried out in logarithmic co-ordinates according to FRONTIER (1969), using integrated samples obtained from grab samples collected over the entire water column. Cell densities were highest in the uppermost meter of the water column {{at the beginning of the}} rainy season, due to the exponential development of species such as Planktothrix mougeotii, Chlamydomonas sp., Eudorina elegans, Euglena gracilis, Gonyostomum semen, Euglena texta, Phacus helicoïdes, Closterium limneticum, Cryptomonas ovata, Peridinium cf. gutwinskii, Trachelomonas hispida var. crenulatocollis and Cyclotella meneghiniana. The specific diversity index varied 0. 68 and 4. 64 bits/µg, and values gradually decreased from the first uppermost meter to the bottom of the water column. Evenness varied from 0. 14 to 0. 84 with a somewhat similar spatio-temporal variation as the diversity index. Low values of these descriptors generally correspond to the presence of a highly dominant species. The rank-frequency diagrams were mainly S-shaped, indicating the predominance of one species which in this study was either Chlamydomonas sp or Planktothrix mougeotii. A simultaneous analysis of the ecological succession and the spatio-temporal variations of the phytoplanktonic structure revealed that the functioning of this ecosystem was essentially allogenic in nature and was strongly influenced by the supply of decayed organic matter from the Mingoa stream, and effluents from ministerial buildings and hotels located near the lake. This permanent supply of abundant biogenic elements, coupled with the low depth of the ecosystem, makes it vulnerable. Ecological succession, frequently limited to the pioneer stages (1 and 1 '), reflected the briefness of the different phases of phytoplankton growth, and the consequences of disturbances regularly undergone by the phytoplankton community. The second stage was scarcely reached while the third was absent. These successions were mainly controlled by rainfall, as well as wind, which is responsible for the mixing of such a shallow water column. These results can be considered important for the Yaounde municipal lake and other water bodies close to densely populated areas in Cameroon for which there is no management plan. Urgent actions need to be carried out to rehabilitate this ecosystem that fluctuates between the eutrophic and hypertrophic status...|$|E

Starting from statistical tests and experimental measurements, the legitimacy in real RC is verified with the various assumptions relating to the electromagnetic fields generated in "ideal" reverberating environment. Under this condition, the study of a line of transmission showed the influence of directivity in the relation between the electric fields of calibration in Anechoic Chamber (AC) and RC, for an identical value of the current induced at its termination. In addition, it is important to apprehend in which direction the environment in RC can "be compared" with that generated inside half-closed enclosures (vehicle) subjected to an external disturbing electromagnetic field. In order to bring first steps of answers to this question, it is presented a comparison of the statistical parameters of the electromagnetic field, characterizing these two types of environments. Lastly, the assumptions checked in high frequency ("ideal" environment reverberating, losses of the prevalent walls), {{led to the development of}} an original probabilistic model consisting of assimilating the RC to a cavity whose walls are characterized by a random conductivity. The probabilistic density function of this random variable is established starting from formulation and measurement results validated in the high frequencies. This model of conductivity is then proposed for the resolution of the Maxwell's equations by a stochastic collocation method. It is shown that a low number of simulations of the cavity without stirrer can replace the deterministic modelling of the RC as a whole, for the estimation of the statistical parameters of the electric field generated in the working volume of the structure. In addition, the application of the stochastic collocation method to the formalism previously validated for the study of wires immersed in a cavity led to an effective and realistic modelling of a radiated wire in RC. L'utilisation croissante d'appareils électroniques et la multiplicité des sources de perturbation ont conduit à l'étude de nouveaux moyens d'essais permettant d'améliorer la répétitivité des mesures en Compatibilité ElectroMagnétique (CEM), en particulier aux fréquences supérieures au GigaHertz. Dans ce contexte, la Chambre Réverbérente à <b>Brassage</b> de Modes (CRBM) représente un outil attractif, tant au niveau des mesures en immunité qu'en émission. Cependant, de nombreuses questions restent encore ouvertes quand au comportement des CRBM, en présence ou non de l'équipement sous test : les travaux représentés dans ce mémoire ont pour but d'apporter une contribution au volet probabiliste de l'étude du champ électromagnétique en CRB...|$|E
40|$|The renown or infamy of Henry VIII's Great Debasement (1542 - 1553), {{which the}} {{government}} of his successor, Edward VI, continued for another six years after his death, has unfairly obscured his earlier and far more modest coinage changes and public-spirited monetary policies. Furthermore, despite the renown of and the ample literature devoted to the Great Debasement this unusual episode in early-modern monetary history still lacks a fully accurate exposition and explanation. For example, did it begin in 1542 or 1544 ? How did it work, and why and how did it prove to be successful or profitable'. This study seeks to provide such an accurate exposition and explanation, and thus to provide a proper contrast with Henry VIII's earlier coinage changes and monetary policies while also providing a brief comparison with those of Edward IV, whose debasements of 1464 - 65 were the last undertaken before those of Henry VIII. The subject of coinage debasements remains an arcane subject, ill understood not only by students of European history but also {{by many of the}} historians and economists who have published on topics in monetary history. A major problem is that historians have not clearly asked one fundamental question: were debasements fundamentally aggressive or defensive in nature? The second question to be asked {{is the nature of the}} goals sought from debasement: were they fundamentally monetary or fiscal? The fiscal aspect of coinage debasements is derived from the fact that in pre-modern western Europe minting was a princely or government monopoly from which the prince or government derived a fee known as seigniorage. The central thesis of this study is that aggressive' coinage debasements were undertaken primarily as fiscal policies to increase mint profits: profits from an increased mint output and from a increased seigniorage rate. In most, of not all cases, the fiscal motive was to finance warfare, even if indirectly. As this study shows, aggressive coinage debasements worked best if the offending mint could lure coinage and bullion from not only domestic but also foreign sources. Since neighbouring lands were thus affected and afflicted by such coinage debasements, their rulers were so often forced to respond with retaliatory if purely defensive coinage debasements, to protect their own mints and also their domestic money supplies from the effects of Gresham's Law. Indeed, some variant of Gresham's Law can be found as an excuse for coinage debasements in western Europe, especially from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries so that it is often difficult to tell from an ordinance whether a debasement is aggressive or defensive. The other defensive aspect of such coinage debasement was the consequence of long-term wear and tear', clipping', sweating', counterfeiting, and other factors that over time diminished the mean precious metal contents of the circulating coinage. The result was that legal-tender coins lost their agio over bullion an agio justified by circulating coins at tale', rather than measuring them, thus saving on transaction costs. The loss of that agio prevented bullion from being delivered to the mints; and the consequences were another variant of Gresham's Law (as examined in this paper). In sum this paper explains why Henry VIII's two related coinage debasements of August and November 1526 were purely defensive, and as such monetary policies, while the Great Debasement was an aggressive fiscal policy, and one highly effective in financing Henry VIII's wars with France and Scotland. The Great Debasement was not, however, medieval England's only aggressive debasement, for the same can be shown of Edward IV's debasements of 1464 - 65. The proof for these assertions lies in the mint accounts and the evidence for the mintage fees: low with purely defensive debasements; high with aggressive debasements (a factor that would not have been true if aggressive debasements were monetary in their motivations). Finally, this study also presents proof that the extent of inflation during the Great Debasement (1542 - 1553) was less than that anticipated by monetary formulae, so that inflation did not nullify the merchants' gains from spending debased coins (a reason some have cited to challenge the logic and utility of medieval coinage debasements). coinage debasements, gold, silver, bullion, bullionist policies, mints, mint outputs, seigniorage, <b>brassage,</b> inflation, deflation, fiscal policies, warfare, taxation...|$|E
40|$|Often it {{may seem}} that electroacoustic music {{provides}} fewer resources and less evidence for musicologists to work on when investigating creative processes. Electroacoustic works are produced in the studio,often composed directly onto disc and {{there may not be}} sketchbooks with musical notation of drafts of passages, or diagrams or notes. Often digital sketches may be overwritten or discarded as the creative process moves on. Software and hardware used in a composition may become obsolete over time and its method of operation may not have been recorded in detail. One of the goals of the our 30 -month project TaCEM, finishing in March 2015, is to try and trace such compositional processes in electroacoustic works,and to emulate the techniques used by composers and to study how they were deployed in creating particular works. In some respects, the project is related to work analysing the technical and musical aspects of electroacoustic music using software in the form of Interactive Aural Analysis (Clarke 2012). Other related work includes: Battier (2003) on a constructivist approach to analysis, and Baudouin (2007) and Dahan (2007) on the preservation and reconstruction of technology related to creative practice. The overall goal of the project is {{to examine the relationship between}} technological innovation and creative potential in electroacoustic music. We are doing this by examining eight case studies, ranging across the repertoire, in which new technological innovation has played a key part in enabling composers to bring to fruition new creative approaches. We are studying the context of each work, investigating the technology employed and analyzing the music. One of our first completed case studies is Trevor Wishart’s Imago (2002). The way that Wishart worked and the software he used (his own Sound Loom software package) have resulted in an unusually rich resource for tracking the composer’s creative process over time and examining the relationship between the technical resources he used and the final musical outcome. The Sound Loom software works by taking an input sound file and applying a transformational process to this file (e. g. transposition, time stretching or <b>brassage),</b> using parameter data entered either directly into the program or as a data file, so as to create a new output sound file. The program does not operate in real time but generates sounds one at a time with clearly defined processes and parameters. This way of working leaves behind a trace, a set of date-stamped audio files which represent the evolution of the work over time. The development of sound materials, from an original source sound through a sequence of processes, can be traced potentially, and the gradual assembly of components for the final piece can be tracked over time. Furthermore, the data files used to control the various processes can provide information about the details of the different transformations that were deployed. If, as is the case with Imago, these materials have been to a large extent preserved an extremely rich resource is available for tracing the creative process as it evolved. How might such a digital resource best be used by musicologists for researching the creative process and for analyzing the musical work? Central to the methodology employed is the use of software both in undertaking our research and in presenting our facilitates engagement with musical works as sound and the investigation of the techniques used through software emulations. So our primary means of researching the archive of sound and data files relating to Imago has been through software. One resource we have created is a calendar of activity. Set out like a traditional calendar this shows which files were created at what time and on which day. This calendar is not simply visual, the calendar being in software, each file is represented by an onscreen button and this can be used to play the sound or open the text file. It is therefore possible to trace in detail the process by which the work evolved day-by-day and hour-by-hour. Another software resource we have produced shows the relationships between the sounds. A network of inter-related sounds, leading from the original source sound (Imago is built entirely from one single short recorded sound) through sequences of transformations branching out in different directions, to the completed work, is represented on screen. Each node is an on-screen button that can play the sound concerned. A slider control also allows the user to move through the evolution of the work in time, so that nodes on the diagram (i. e. sounds) gradually appear on screen in the order they were created. It is possible to see the temporal evolution of the work and to hear it by playing the files. We can discover whether sections were composed in the order they appear in the work (mostly they weren’t), whether materials for a particular section were all developed in close temporal proximity or not (sometimes they were) and how the overall form of the work took shape. This leads to a related chart that also shows the relationships between sound files but this time focusing on the genealogy of the sounds –how different sounds are related through similar branches of processing. Again the nodes of the tree can be played. Furthermore, in this case it is possible to learn in detail about how sounds are interrelated. The processes that link sounds can be opened in an associated window on the screen. It is then possible to recreate that transformation using our own emulation of the Sound Loom software. The data used by the composer can be entered to produce an exact or very close replication of what Wishart himself did, or alternative settings can be tried to learn more about the processes and their potential and about the choices the composer was faced with. Imago is a long work, over 25 minutes, and the archive comprises well over 1000 files and employing many different processes. We have not therefore been able to analyse the whole piece at this level of detail but have chosen representative passages for in depth examination. In summary, we have used software to help us understand more about the creative process involved in the composition of Imago. We have been able to track its temporal emergence moment by moment. We can follow each step in the creative process over time and see what that involved in terms of technical manipulations of the sounds. This technical and analytical work has been carried out alongside discussions and interviews with the composer so that we can cross-reference the composer’s thoughts on the creative process with our own interpretations. The outputs resulting from this research, which include interactive software, text and recordings of interviews with the composer, provides the reader with a multi-dimensional resource for exploring the structure of Imago and for developing an understanding of the creative process that led to its creation. Our presentation will include a demonstration of the software we have developed as well as discussion of Wishart’s creative process in composing Imago...|$|E
40|$|An {{issue has}} emerged {{following}} previous questioning about social network practices: does the massive exposure of young people's private {{lives on the}} Web create new identities and standards of judgment? this research will be developed from several surveys on social networking use since 2007 by young people aged between 17 and 22. in particular, we have focused our analysis on the way photos {{of boys and girls}} were judged by their peers, of both sexes. the processing of data about other people, in a socialized context, is one of our main themes of research. it was particularly interesting to consider this process as mediated by the Facebook network, both {{in order to understand the}} peculiarities of the contextual effect of networks in the logic of the underlying regulations and because it seems that technical systems are themselves implicit accelerators enhancing the socio-cognitive processes involved. our approach was created empirically on the basis of field surveys, which were completed every year over a 4 -year period. among the most telling results, obtained as soon as 2009, we notice in particular that: - all assessments were much more damaging for girls - "bad reputation", "risk for later employment" "their parents mustn't see this". But there was more sympathy for boys. - Photos "exposed on Facebook" were considered differently from "paper" photos. the verdict was generally more severe, especially for girls, as the "reputation" and "risk for the future" factors were quite naturally aggravated. - although girls were judged less favourably, they were also the most rigorous. Girls themselves were the most severe towards other girls. Selective sorting on the three essential criteria: - the fact of already being known in real life or not - the number of shared friends - the photo the processes of cooptation of friends are also simplified and radicalised, thus strengthening social logics and norms: "We have very little information about the person. if we don't already know them, the only information is the photo and the number of shared friends. " therefore, the "shared friends" criterion is paramount as it is placed in the forefront by the architecture of the site itself - everything works to focus on this factor and render it preponderant. We note that although the selection criteria or "standards" are very similar to those governing face-to face situations, cooptation is accelerated, and processing information about others on just a few membership criteria may encourage the emergence of radical groups and reduce social mixing and diversity. in the process of social selection mediated by the network, judgment standards are created on the basis of a few "socially desirable" values in the constitution of groups that therefore operate real "selective sorting". Comments gathered during the interviews seem to confirm this: "i cannot necessarily allow myself to accept ugly girls as my friends [...] . ", "i can't accept shifty-looking blokes, even if i know they are clean", "Yes, i think political or religious views can play a more important role than in life, afterwards it's still there" identity construction set: to build his identity the young person exposes himself on Facebook, he exhibits his representations of himself, which can sometimes be multiple. Communicating on Facebook takes effort to produce a satisfactory image, another self, he has to feed his profile regularly, improve or modify his wall. There is an intention to appear in a secondary or "artificial mode". But one does not totally invent a virtual character as in some video games. the intention is more to "enhance" reality by tolerating some discrepancies (touched-up photos, especially for girls). the things establishing the relational fabric are linked to the site's digital framework. the relationship is orchestrated by the page shape, the characters of the fonts, the location and size of images, photos, videos, publications [...] . the identity is translated via the interface and normalizes bland images which all tend to resemble each other, at least insofar as their format is concerned. the site's options also enable selection of "friend candidates" according to similarity criteria that determine the assembly of "close" profiles in terms of age, tastes and opinions, etc., along the lines of the old saying "birds of a feather flock together". Discussion While putting the results of our study into perspective with the reference population, we have seen, within this strict framework that:- on Facebook, relational and identity logic is exacerbated and modified at the same time. There is simultaneous reproduction and creation of new standards. - We also see dominance of form at the expense of substance in the opinion of others, in the way friends are co-opted and the formation of these virtual groups. only the "easily treatable" signs are taken into account - on the one hand because of the cognitive limits of the subjects, which have to simplify their relational approaches and on the other because of the site's structure, which encourages focus on certain behaviour and attitudes rather than others, thus acting as real obligatory standards. - We cannot consider the judgment standards in the cooptation process without understanding that, beyond the process of building the image and resulting identity, there is a kind of attribution of self-esteem. "My profile is often visited. i have many friends. i have lots of messages [...] . iam somebody who is "loved", someone "good. "" the famous "like Facebook" is a measure of the attractiveness of the images that you display as an extension of your own image. this is both recognition and a label that people "naturally" accept by agreeing to comply with the underlying sets of regulations. The implicit norms of "selective sorting" on Facebook Between innovation and social reproductionA la suite d'un questionnement précédent sur les pratiques des réseaux sociaux, une problématique s'est dessinée : l'exposition massive de la vie privée des jeunes sur le Web, sécrète-t-elle de nouvelles identités et normes de jugement ? Cette recherche sera développée à partir de plusieurs enquêtes réalisées sur les usages des réseaux sociaux par des jeunes de 17 à 22 ans depuis 2007. en particulier nous avons centré notre analyse sur la façon dont les photos de garçons et de filles étaient jugées par leurs pairs, des deux sexes. le traitement de l'information sur autrui en contexte socialisé est un de nos thèmes principaux de recherche. il était particulièrement intéressant d'envisager ce processus dans un contexte médiatisé par le réseau Facebook. Ceci dans le but d'appréhender les particularités de l'effet contextuel des réseaux dans les logiques de régulations sous-jacentes, mais aussi parce qu'il semble que les dispositifs techniques soient eux-mêmes des accélérateurs implicites rendant saillants les processus sociocognitifs en œuvre. notre démarche fut construite de façon empirique, à partir d'enquêtes de terrain qui, chaque année depuis 4 ans, ont été complétées; les 2 premières années grâce à un questionnaire sphinx on line puis, ensuite, grâce à des questionnaires en vis-à-vis et des entretiens individuels et de groupes Parmi les résultats les plus éloquents, obtenus dès 2009, on constatait notamment que : - toutes les appréciations étaient beaucoup plus pénalisantes pour les filles : " mauvaise réputation " " risque de ne pas se faire embaucher plus tard " " il ne faut pas que les parents voient cela " [...] . a l'inverse les garçons recueillaient davantage de sympathie. - les photos dites " exposées sur Facebook " étaient jugées différemment de celles dites " diffusées sur papier ". le jugement était en général plus sévère, surtout pour les filles, le facteur " réputation " et " risque pour l'avenir " étant tout naturellement exacerbé. - Si les filles étaient moins bien jugées, elles étaient aussi les plus rigoristes. Les filles étaient elles-mêmes les plus sévères envers les autres filles. Le tri sélectif sur 3 critères essentiels : - le fait ou pas d'être déjà connu dans la vie - le nombre d'amis commun - la photo les processus de cooptation d'amis sont eux aussi simplifiés et radicalisés, renforçant ainsi les logiques et les normes sociales : " on a très peu d'informations sur la personne, si on ne la connait pas déjà, les seuls infos sont la photo et le nombre d'amis en commun ". De ce fait, le critère " amis en commun " est prépondérant puisqu'il est mis en avant par l'architecture du site lui-même : tout incite à s'intéresser à ce facteur et à le rendre déterminant [...] . nous constatons que si les critères ou " normes " de sélection sont très proches de celles qui régissent les situations de vis-à-vis, la cooptation est accélérée et le traitement des informations sur autrui, autour de quelques critères d'appartenance seulement, risque de favoriser l'émergence de groupes radicaux, de diminuer le <b>brassage</b> social et la diversité. Ceci semble à mettre en parallèle avec les observations de P. lardellier, dans le cadre de ses études sur les rencontres amoureuses sur le net " les sites de rencontres exacerbent les logiques sociales [...] . ". Dans ce processus de sélection sociale médiatisé par le réseau, des normes de jugements se schématiseraient autour de quelques valeurs " socialement désirables " dans la constitution des groupes opérant ainsi un véritable " tri sélectif ". Des remarques recueillies au cours des entretiens semblent le confirmer : " Je ne peux pas forcément me permettre d'accepter des filles moches dans mes amis [...] . " " Je ne peux prendre des types louches, genre racaille, même si je les connais et que je sais qu'ils sont cleans " " oui je pense que les opinions politiques ou religieuses, ça peut jouer plus que dans la vie, qu'après ça reste [...] . " Construction identitaire paramétrée Pour construire son identité le jeune s'expose sur Facebook, il expose les représentations qu'il a de lui-même, qui peuvent parfois être multiples. Communiquer sur Facebook demande un effort pour se fabriquer une image satisfaisante, un autre soi, alimenter son profil régulièrement, améliorer ou modifier son mur. Il y a une intention de paraître sur un mode secondaire ou " artificiel ". Mais on ne part pas d'un personnage virtuel totalement inventé comme dans certains jeux vidéo. il s'agit plutôt " d'améliorer " le réel en tolérant quelques écarts (photos retouchées surtout pour les filles). Ce qui constitue la trame relationnelle est lié au cadre numérique du site. la relation est rythmée par la forme de la page, les caractères des polices, l'emplacement et la taille des images, photos, vidéos, publications [...] . l'identité est traduite par l'interface qui lisse et normalise des images qui tendent toutes à se ressembler au moins au regard de leur mise en forme. Par ailleurs les options du site permettent de sélectionner les " candidats amis " en fonction de critères de similitude qui déterminent l'assemblage de profils " proches " en termes d'âges, de goûts, d'opinions [...] . allant dans le sens du vieux dicton " qui se ressemble s'assemble ". Discussion : tout en relativisant les résultats de notre étude à la population de référence, nous avons pu constater, dans ce cadre strict, que : - Sur le réseau Facebook, les logiques relationnelles et identitaires seraient exacerbées et modifiées tout à la fois. Il y a aurait simultanément reproduction et création de normes. - nous observons aussi une prégnance de la forme au détriment du fond dans le jugement d'autrui, dans les modes de cooptation d'amis et dans la constitution de ces groupes virtuels. Seuls les indices " faciles à traiter " sont pris en compte : d'une part à cause des limites cognitives des sujets qui doivent simplifier leurs approches relationnelles et d'autre part à cause de la structure du site qui incite à privilégier certains comportements plutôt que d'autres, agissant ainsi comme de véritables prescriptions normatives. - nous ne pourrons envisager les normes de jugement dans les processus de cooptation, sans comprendre qu'au-delà du processus de construction de l'image et de l'identité qui en découle, il y a une sorte d'attribution d'estime de soi. "Mon profil est souvent visité, j'ai beaucoup d'amis, j'ai beaucoup de messages [...] . Je suis quelqu'un d' "aimé", quelqu'un de " bien". le fameux " j'aime de Facebook " permet de mesurer l'attractivité des images que l'on affiche comme prolongation de sa propre image. il s'agit à la fois d'une reconnaissance et d'une désignation que les individus endossent " naturellement " en acceptant de se conformer aux jeux de régulations sous-jacentes (techniques et cognitives) ...|$|E
