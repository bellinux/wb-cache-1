50|$|In geology and geophysics, {{the most}} common method for {{consolidated}} rock samples is the divided bar.

Heat is supplied {{at the top and}} made to move downwards to stop any convection within the sample. Measurements are taken after the sample has reached to the steady state (with zero heat gradient or constant heat over entire sample), this usually takes about 30 minutes and over.|$|R
