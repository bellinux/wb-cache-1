500|$|The booklet, {{along with}} every other album by Korn, does not feature printed lyrics to the songs. The band has {{explained}} that the reason the booklets do not feature this is because Davis believes fans should not rely on printed lyrics because it limits the experience in listening to the music. As Davis told MTV's Serena Altschul, [...] "I think music is something that every individual has their own meaning to the song. They {{can come up with}} whatever the hell I'm saying and that's the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and that's what I wanna keep there." ...|$|E

The designer talked {{of what was to}} happen to the dress after the awards show, [...] "The dress will be put in an archive with all of her dresses. The Gaga Archives, I suppose. It won't last, that's the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> When it is brought out again, hopefully it will be in a retrospective, {{and it will be a}} different dress, which is the best thing. I like the idea of it changing and evolving into something else". He later explained that the dress would be preserved and made into a type of jerky before being archived.|$|E
500|$|Yorke {{said that}} the {{starting}} point for the record was the [...] "incredibly dense and terrifying sound" [...] of Bitches Brew, the 1970 avant-garde jazz fusion album by Miles Davis. He described the sound of Bitches Brew to Q: [...] "It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that's the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It was at the core of {{what we were trying to}} do with OK Computer." [...] Yorke identified [...] "I'll Wear It Proudly" [...] by Elvis Costello, [...] "Fall on Me" [...] by R.E.M., [...] "Dress" [...] by PJ Harvey and [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] by the Beatles as particularly influential on the album's songwriting. Radiohead drew further inspiration from the recording style of film soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone and the krautrock band Can, musicians Yorke described as [...] "abusing the recording process".|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reviews of}} the album, published by the LA Weekly and Newsweek, were positive. Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard wrote that [...] "Octagon's verses often feel unfocused and random, but when he bears down he can be mesmerizing, channeling his quick-tongued rhymes with streetwise brassiness and cosmic vibrations." [...] Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album [...] "doesn't always {{make a lot of}} sense, but that's the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts. Its elements are all on the very edge of control, which is both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time; if it works, it could bring us to where we've never been, protect us from what may be, but if it fails, it could kill us all." [...] Hip Hop DX reviewer B. Love wrote, [...] "This is Kool Keith's best album in years—arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst—and marks a fine return to form for one of rap music's most distinctive and original talents." ...|$|E
500|$|When You Reach Me is {{classified}} in the science fiction and mystery genres, but includes features of some other genres. Monica Edinger of The New York Times found When You Reach Me to be [...] "a hybrid of genres, it is a complex mystery, a work of historical fiction, a school story and one of friendship, with a leitmotif of time travel running through it." [...] Augusta Scattergood of the Christian Science Monitor wondered, [...] "Is When You Reach Me science fiction? Time travel? A highly imaginative girl's completely conceived experience? Maybe it's historical fiction. After all, it is set in 1979." [...] According to Mary Quattlebaum of The Washington Post, the novel is of the science fiction and time travel genres. Quattlebaum found that, unlike the usual time travel stories, When You Reach Me does not involve [...] "cheesy time travel machines and rock-'em-sock-'em action [...] far surpasses the usual whodunit or sci-fi adventure to become an incandescent exploration of 'life, death, and the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all.'" [...] Both Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly found that despite the book's science-fiction devices, the setting was still [...] "firmly rooted in reality." ...|$|E
500|$|The initial {{location}} for principal photography for True Detective was Arkansas; however, Pizzolatto later opted to film in southern Louisiana {{to capitalize on}} generous statewide tax incentives and the area's distinctive landscape, which he felt illustrated a striking paradox. [...] "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all," [...] the native Louisianan noted. [...] "Everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable. On the other hand you have the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all from a distance." [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] and subsequent episodes were shot in 35 mm film, and principal photography for the season consumed 100 consecutive days. The crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside of Erath, Louisiana which, because it was partially burned, inspired a [...] "moody and atmospheric" [...] backdrop for corresponding scenes. Fukunaga recruited Adam Arkapaw, previously director of photography for Top of the Lake, as project cinematographer and employed minimalistic lighting for layering composition. Also involved in production was Alex DiGerlando, who Fukunaga had previously worked with on Benh Zeitlin Glory at Sea (2008). The director remarked in an interview, [...] "I knew what Alex accomplished in the swamps of Louisiana and given some money, how much more amazing {{he could be in}} building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{character}} development of Shane in the episode, {{as well as}} the execution of Otis. Nate Rawlings of Time felt that it was a dark moment for the series, and felt that it added anticipation to future development. He wrote: [...] "At some point, Shane will have to come clean with Rick about what happened to Otis. Given Rick’s extremely rigid morale [...] code and Shane’s now demonstrated willingness {{to do whatever it takes}} to survive, the showdown promises to be bigger than just a battle of two alpha males. The Rick/Shane divide is a battle of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that [...] "both the multi-layered opening [...] illustrates how Shane’s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior." [...] Handlen appreciated the character development of Shane, writing, [...] "Shane has long been the dark horse of the group, the one most likely to go off the morality reservation, and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness. It's not the subtlest moment [...] but, given how friendly and cool Otis was, and given how well the two seemed to be working together, it's a strong twist." [...] He added that because of the death of Otis, the show now has a sense of direction. [...] "His decision to sacrifice Otis is easy enough to rationalize; somebody had to get back for Carl's sake, Shane was faster, and both of them probably weren't going to make it. That's the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> In a certain light, he made the right choice." [...] Morgan Jeffrey wrote: [...] "This week's installment delivered even more scares than usual — Shane's escape from the high school was almost unbearably tense." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, True Detective {{first season}} {{was due to}} shoot in Arkansas, but Pizzolatto later chose to film in Louisiana to take {{advantage}} of state tax incentives and the area's distinctive landscape: [...] "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all...everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable. On the other hand you have the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all from a distance." [...] Principal photography took three months (between 100 and 110 days), from January to June 2013. Approximately five minutes of film were shot per day. Production staff constructed various set pieces, among them a scorched chapel, Joel Theriot's tent revival, and the Louisiana State Criminal Investigations Division offices, the last of which they built inside an abandoned light bulb warehouse near Elmwood. For the Dora Lange crime scene, the crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside Erath which, because it was partially burned, inspired what DiGerlando called a [...] "moody and atmospheric" [...] backdrop for the corresponding interior scenes. The scene in which Cohle, taking Ginger hostage, escapes a housing complex amidst gunfire, was captured in Bridge City as a single six-minute tracking shot, a technique Fukunaga had employed in Sin Nombre (2009) and Jane Eyre (2011). Shot in seven takes, preparation for the scene was extensive and demanding: McConaughey trained with Mark Norby to master a fighting style for his character, {{and the nature of the}} shoot required a team of stunt coordinators, make-up artists, and special effects crew on hand during its entire course. Elsewhere, shooting took place at the old Kenner High School campus and nineteenth-century Fort Macomb, located outside New Orleans.|$|E

[...] That, according to Mirsky, was an exceptionally ill-judged forecast. [...] "Now more than ever Leskov is being read and praised for his inimitable form, style and manner of speech," [...] the critic wrote in 1926. Many critics and colleagues of Leskov wrote about his innovative style and experiments in form. Anton Chekhov called him and Turgenev his two [...] "tutors in literature." ...|$|E

2500|$|Decades {{after its}} {{original}} release, Black Sunday {{has continued to}} maintain a positive critical reputation. [...] Pauline Kael described it as [...] "a rich draught of vampire's blood. With its crypts and cobwebs and eerie old castles set in batty, steamy forests, its sumptuous enough to have acquired a considerable reputation." [...] In [...] The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural (1986), Timothy Sullivan wrote, [...] "A supremely atmospheric horror film, Black Sunday was Mario Bava's first and best directorial job, and {{the first of the}} 1960s cycle of Italian Gothic cinema [...] remains [...] greatest achievement, without a doubt one of the best horror films ever made." [...] Phil Hardy's [...] observed, [...] "Bava's first (and best) film as a solo director [...] The movie derives its lyrical force and indeed its sense of horror from the knowledge that a woman's sexuality cannot be eliminated and will return, bearing the scars of the violence with which it was repressed, to challenge the order of things." [...] Danny Peary, in his Cult Movies book, wrote, [...] "Black Sunday is as impressive as it is because it reveals Bava's background – almost everything is conveyed visually...It is with his camera that Bava [...] creates an atmosphere where the living and dead coexist (but not harmoniously) [...] Black Sunday convinced many of us that Mario Bava would be {{a force to be reckoned}} with in the horror field for many years to come. Unfortunately, he never made another picture half as good." [...] Allmovie has noted, [...] "Generally considered to be the foremost example of Italian gothic horror, this darkly atmospheric black-and-white chiller put director Mario Bava on the international map ... The atmosphere is so heavy and the imagery so dense that the film becomes nearly too rich in texture, but the sheer, ghastly <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all is entrancing." [...] Glenn Erickson, in reviewing the Anchor Bay DVD release of the film, wrote, [...] "Mario Bava's first credited feature is still the number one film of the Italian horror renaissance, startlingly original and genuinely creepy [...] The budget may have been low, but Black Sunday is more atmospheric and cinematically active than any of Hollywood's classic horror films." [...] The film has an 84% favorable rating on the [...] "Critical Tomatometer" [...] at the Rotten Tomatoes website, out of nineteen internet reviewers surveyed.|$|E
