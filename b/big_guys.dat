500|$|Bentley's {{early career}} was spent with several senior teams {{throughout}} Saskatchewan. [...] He first played {{in his hometown}} of Delisle for the Tigers hockey team in 1932–33 before playing a year in Saskatoon, then another in Regina before settling in Moose Jaw for three seasons beginning in 1935–36. He led the South-Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League in scoring in 1936–37 with 37 points and added another 14 in the playoffs, also leading the league. In 1937, Bentley, along with future Hall of Famer Elmer Lach attended the Toronto Maple Leafs training camp; both were rejected as too small for the National Hockey League. According to Lach, Conn Smythe, manager of the Leafs, saw Bentley and Lach and said “They were sending me <b>big</b> <b>guys</b> from the West, but instead they’ve sent me peanuts.” He moved to Alberta with brother Reg, and joined elder brothers Max, Wyatt and Roy with the Drumheller Miners of the Alberta Senior Hockey League (ASHL) for the 1938–39 season. [...] When not playing hockey, Doug helped run a gas station that the family purchased in Drumheller.|$|E
500|$|Bosh has {{traditionally}} played the power forward position, including {{during his first}} season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6ft 11in (2.11m) and 235pounds (107kg), Bosh possesses excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size. He is particularly noted {{for his ability to}} drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he is also proficient—but he is also known for his well-developed jump shot. Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: [...] "We've tried over the years to put <b>big</b> <b>guys</b> on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work either. I don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth." [...] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions. He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left. It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his [...] "arrival" [...] to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime. When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot [...]343 from the three point arc for the season; he improved to [...]400 the following season. Despite his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.|$|E

2500|$|Led by Perry's late-season scoring surge, the Ducks {{finished}} with 99 points, {{good for the}} fourth seed in the West, setting up a series with the Nashville Predators in the 2011 Western Conference Quarterfinals. After being held to zero points in Game 1, Perry scored the Ducks' first goal on a power play in Game 2 against Pekka Rinne, later assisting on Ryan Getzlaf's goal that gave the Ducks a 3–1 lead. Near {{the end of the}} game, Perry then assisted on Bobby Ryan's empty-netter as the Ducks won 5–3. In Game 3, Perry recorded another two assists, but the Ducks fell 4–3. In Game 4, he set up Cam Fowler's power play goal early in the first period, and early in the third, Perry scored a short-handed goal to give Anaheim the lead in an eventual 6–3 victory. [...] "He's always scored big goals for us at big times, and your <b>big</b> <b>guys</b> got to be your <b>big</b> <b>guys</b> in big games," [...] Ryan Getzlaf said. [...] "There’s no doubt about it. He’s been doing it … all year, and we expect nothing less come playoff time." [...] However, Perry recorded no points in the last two games, both of which the Ducks lost, eliminating them from the playoffs. Perry finished the series with two goals and six assists.|$|E
2500|$|Edwards {{was hired}} as {{athletic}} director and head football coach at Wittenberg, his alma mater, in 1955. He put in a pro-style offense and focused on passing because his players were smaller than many opponents. [...] "We had small players, but little guys can throw the football and little guys can catch it, whereas you need <b>big</b> <b>guys</b> to block for a running game," [...] he said in 1973. Under Edwards, the Wittenberg Tigers were a major success, amassing a 98–20–4 record in 14 seasons and winning the NCAA College Division national championship poll in 1962 and 1964. Edwards's teams were unbeaten three times and lost one game in five of his seasons there. He was named Ohio College Football Coach of the Year in 1957 by his fellow coaches. The American Football Coaches Association named him {{coach of the year}} in 1963 and 1964, when the Tigers won all of their games. He was called [...] "a combination of Genghis Khan and Santa Claus" [...] by Sports Illustrated for being both tough and sympathetic to his players.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{getting the}} job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early [...] "mood reels" [...] saying, [...] "I don’t know what the {{situation}} would be, {{but that would be}} a person he’d want to get in trouble with." [...] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that [...] "at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death." [...] He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet, and that filming would begin in June 2016. In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt. It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay, and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch; both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay. The pair had proposed a take on the character that was [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a [...] of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them in this film. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character and [...] "what {{it would be like to}} be a real kid who gets superpowers", rather than the [...] "drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well. Daley called the film [...] "an origin story of him finding his place in the Marvel [...] Universe", with the writing team wanting the film to [...] "focus on [...] coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses," [...] such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, [...] "Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie." [...] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as [...] "the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington D.C." [...] One of the first sequences they pitched was [...] "seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. If you have a character that you’re so familiar with, and you’re familiar with the sort of areas he’s been in, why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven’t seen before?" [...] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, [...] "low-stakes" [...] approach than previous films, in part to Spider-Man existing in a world with the Avengers, since [...] "if the threat became world-threatening, you would obviously bring in the <b>big</b> <b>guys</b> to handle it." ...|$|E
