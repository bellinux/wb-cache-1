5|$|The {{division}} of Nicholas Altomanović's lands created friction between Tvrtko and George of Zeta, since the latter seized coastal župas which Tvrtko {{had expected to}} annex. In early 1377, Tvrtko successfully plotted with the Travunians the takeover of Trebinje, Konavli, and Dračevica, making his final conquests of the Serbian lands. By that time, Serbia had <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> a patchwork of independent lordships.|$|E
5|$|The {{expenditures}} that Caracalla {{made with}} the large bonuses he gave to soldiers prompted him to debase the coinage soon after his ascension.

Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} three East Bosnian Shock Battalions, the Partisan General Staff of Bosnia-Herzegovina first {{attempted}} to cross the Bosna to follow the Partisan Supreme Headquarters and main force to western Bosnia, but instead retreated to Birač, where they joined forces with the Birač Detachment {{at the end of}} May. The Birač Partisan Detachment was the only Partisan or volunteer detachment in East Bosnia not to suffer a pro-Chetnik coup in March–May 1942.

5|$|Blue whale hunting {{was banned}} in 1966 by the International Whaling Commission, and illegal whaling by the Soviet Union finally halted in the 1970s, {{by which time}} 330,000 blue whales had {{been caught in the}} Antarctic, 33,000 {{in the rest of the}} Southern Hemisphere, 8,200 in the North Pacific, and 7,000 in the North Atlantic.

They saw only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided to ignore their raid.|$|E

5|$|By 1912, {{all three}} ships had <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> the reserve fleet and were {{primarily}} employed as training ships. They continued {{in this role}} during World War I, training men to operate the machinery of warships and transports for the war effort. They were all decommissioned by 1920. Illinois was loaned to the New York Naval Militia and was converted into a floating arsenal. Renamed Prairie State in 1941, she was eventually sold for scrapping in 1956. Wisconsin was broken up for scrap in 1922, while Alabama was expended as a target ship in September 1921 in bombing tests with the US Army Air Service.|$|E

They were already obsolete and were decommissioned immediately after the war, although their hulks survived as naval training facilities and accommodation space for a decade. All three ships were broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E
5|$|By 1975, {{peregrine}} falcons had <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> 324 pairs in North America, {{primarily as}} a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
