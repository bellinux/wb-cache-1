5|$|Donal {{meanwhile}} {{turns to}} alcohol, devastated {{at the fact}} that he has <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> god who, according to Donal's religion, should not even exist. However, Reed's analysis leads him to believe that the final component needed to deal with the rift is lightning, and Donal is convinced to turn into the Viking god once more.|$|E
5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the basal ganglia structures) were the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967 and <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble, France, emerged as a possible treatment.|$|E
5|$|Glasnost {{reforms in}} the same year <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{relaxation}} of press censorship; consequently reports started to appear in the Soviet press suggesting that the Soviet military knew the location of the wreckage and had possession of the flight data recorders. On December 10, 1991, Senator Jesse Helms of the Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Boris Yeltsin requesting information concerning the survival of passengers and crew of KAL007 including the fate of Congressman Larry McDonald.|$|E

5|$|No further {{specimens}} {{were collected}} until 1845, when Spencer Baird, {{a professor at}} Dickinson College, discovered a colony near New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania. It was redesignated G.brachycera in 1846 by Asa Gray {{on the basis of}} Baird's specimens. (Gaylussacia was not recognized as a genus separate from Vaccinium until 1819.) The discovery <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> friendship between Gray and Baird that ultimately resulted in the latter's appointment as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Towton {{was fought}} during the English Wars of the Roses on 29 March 1461, {{near the village}} of Towton in Yorkshire. It <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> change of monarchs in England, with the victor, the Yorkist Edward, Duke of Yorkwho became King Edward IV (1461–1483) having {{displaced}} the Lancastrian King Henry VI (1422–1461) as king, and thus drove the head of the Lancastrians and his key supporters out of the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} of Arsène Wenger {{as manager of}} Arsenal in 1996 <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> successful period for the club. In Wenger's first full season, 1997–98, Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup to complete a domestic double. Though the club failed to win another trophy {{in the next three}} seasons, they vied for domestic honours with Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. Arsenal won their second double in 2001–02, before Manchester United regained the league the following season. In 2003–04, Arsenal won the league without a single defeat – a record of 26 wins and 12 draws.|$|E

5|$|The {{highlights}} of the match included the sending-off of Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira for a second bookable offence, for an incident that also <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> booking for Manchester United centre-forward Ruud van Nistelrooy, and the decision by referee Steve Bennett to award Manchester United a penalty kick in the last minute of the match. Players from both teams were charged by The Football Association (the FA) for their reactions {{at the end of}} the game, five Arsenal players and two Manchester United players were forced to pay fines.|$|E
5|$|These {{reactions}} {{have also}} <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> change in policies. The film, only {{ten days after}} its debut, influenced the Central Board of Secondary Education to provide extra time to special children—including the visually impaired, physically challenged and dyslexic—during exams. In 2008, Mumbai's civic body also opened 12classrooms for autistic students. In Chandigarh, the education administration started a course to educate teachers {{on how to deal}} with children with learning disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{has lost}} caste considerably, {{not only by}} his {{adhesion}} to Spiritualism, but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the British Association, <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> discussion on Spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings...

5|$|Another death <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{creative}} renewal. The {{passing of}} Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to {{write for the}} Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it {{in the last four}} years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed {{to maintain the status quo}} and believed that her country's military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on their terms. Egypt, on the other hand, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
50|$|Talks {{which began}} between {{leaders of the}} two churches in the 1930s blossomed into {{full-fledged}} preparations throughout the 1940s that <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> actual plan {{by the end of}} that decade.|$|R

5|$|From the 17th century onward, the Enlightenment {{questioned}} {{the power and}} influence of the Catholic Church over Western society. In the 18th century, writers such as Voltaire and the Encyclopédistes wrote biting critiques of both religion and the Catholic Church. One target of their criticism was the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV of France, which ended a century-long policy of religious toleration of Protestant Huguenots. The French Revolution of 1789 <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> shifting of powers from the Church to the State, destruction of churches {{and the establishment of}} a Cult of Reason. In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte's General Louis Alexandre Berthier invaded Italy, imprisoning Pope Pius VI, who died in captivity. Napoleon later re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801. The end of the Napoleonic Wars brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States.|$|E
5|$|In August 1849 the MCS {{appointed}} Joseph Bazalgette to {{the position}} of assistant surveyor. He had been working as a consultant engineer in the railway industry until overwork had <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> serious breakdown in his health; his appointment to the commission was his first position on his return to employment. Working under the chief engineer, Frank Foster, he began to develop a more systematic plan for the city's sewers. The stress of his position was too much for Foster and he died in 1852; Bazalgette was promoted into his position, and continued refining and developing the plans {{for the development of the}} sewerage system. The Metropolis Management Act 1855 replaced the commission with the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), which took control of the sewers.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the New York Daily Tribune {{as long as}} he was sure that the Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> new editorial policy. No longer was the Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E
25|$|During 19431944 ethnic {{cleansing}} operations {{took place in}} Ukraine (commonly known as the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia) which <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> estimated 100,000 deaths and an exodus of ethnic Poles from this territory.|$|R

5|$|Ottoman {{pressure}} also <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> rapprochement between Hungary and Poland. Vladislaus met {{his four}} brothers, including John Albert and Sigismund, in Lőcse (now Levoča in Slovakia) in April 1494. They planned a crusade against the Ottoman Empire. However, John Albert wanted to strengthen Polish suzerainty over Moldavia and to dethrone Stephen {{in favour of}} Sigismund, which gave rise to new tensions between Poland and Hungary. Shortly after the conference, John Albert decided to launch a campaign against the Ottomans to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă. Fearing that the subjugation of Moldavia was John Albert's actual purpose, Stephen made several attempts to prevent his campaign. With Ivan III's support, he persuaded Alexander of Lithuania not to associate himself with John Albert. As reported by the Bychowiec Chronicle, the Lithuanian magnates also condemned the war, and simply refused to cross the Southern Bug.|$|E
5|$|Rajam died of typhoid in 1939. Her death {{affected}} Narayan {{deeply and}} he remained depressed {{for a long}} time; he was also concerned for their daughter Hema, who was only three years old. The bereavement <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> significant change {{in his life and}} was the inspiration behind his next novel, The English Teacher. This book, like his first two books, is autobiographical, but more so, and completes an unintentional thematic trilogy following Swami and Friends and The Bachelor of Arts. In subsequent interviews, Narayan acknowledges that The English Teacher was almost entirely an autobiography, albeit with different names for the characters and the change of setting in Malgudi; he also explains that the emotions detailed in the book reflected his own at the time of Rajam's death.|$|E
5|$|Rojhaz {{is in fact}} Steve Rogers, {{the future}} costumed superhero known as Captain America. After {{fighting}} against a future fascist government dictatorship of the 21st century run by the President-For-Life, Rogers was captured. Wanting to dispose of Rogers so completely that not even his ashes would remain to inspire future rebellion, the President-for-Life had Rogers placed into a machine which should have killed him but instead sent him into the 1602 timeline. His presence not only <b>brought</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> rift that will destroy the universe, but it also caused the heroes {{of the twentieth century}} to appear centuries earlier to counter the Forerunner's negative effects.|$|E
