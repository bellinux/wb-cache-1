5|$|By 1587, the Catholic <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the Protestants {{had become}} a {{campaign}} across Europe. Elizabeth I of England's execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, on 8 February 1587 outraged the Catholic world. Philip II of Spain prepared for an invasion of England. The League took control of much of northern France to secure French ports for his armada.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the {{external}} environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic movement. Famines continued to sweep the globe through the 20th century. Through the effects of climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|President Roosevelt sought {{re-authorization}} of NIRA on February 20, 1935. But the <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the New Deal, {{coupled with}} continuing congressional {{concern over the}} Act's suspension of antitrust law, left the President's request politically dead. By May 1935, the issue was moot as the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled Title I of NIRA unconstitutional.|$|E

40|$|One {{traditional}} and oft-repeated {{explanation of the}} political impetus behind free banking connects the rise of Jacksonian populism and {{a rejection of the}} privileges associated with corporate chartering. A second views free banking as an ill-informed inflationist, pro business response to the financial panic of 1837. This chapter argues that both explanations are lacking. Free banking was the progeny of the corruption associated with bank chartering and reflected social, political and economic <b>backlashes</b> <b>against</b> corruption dating to the late- 1810 s. Three strands of political thought [...] Antimasonic egalitarianism, Jacksonian pragmatism, and pro-business American Whiggism [...] converged in the 1830 s and led to economic reform. Equality of treatment was the political watchword of the 1830 s and free banking was but one manifestation of this broader impulse. ...|$|R
40|$|During the 1980 s, {{women in}} country music enjoyed {{unprecedented}} success in record sales, television, film, and on pop and country charts. For female performers, {{many of their}} achievements were due to their abilities to mold their images to mirror American norms and values, namely increasing political conservatism, the <b>backlashes</b> <b>against</b> feminism {{and the civil rights}} movement, celebrations of working and middle class life, {{and the rise of the}} South. This dissertation divides the 1980 s into three distinct periods and then discusses the changing uses of gender, race, class, and region in female country music and links each to larger historical themes. It concludes that political and social conservatism influenced women’s country performances and personas. In this way, female country music is a social text that can be used to examine 1980 s America...|$|R
40|$|This article {{suggests}} that despite consistent {{support for the}} rhetoric of noninterference China’s implementation of the policy has become varied and contextualized in reaction to Africa’s increasingly diversified political and economic landscape since the early 2000 s. As Sino-African linkages have deepened, they have created economic winners and losers within African states, creating “anti-China” special interests. Countries with competitive economic relations (high export similarity) have seen concentrations of anti-China sentiment among negatively impacted populations. Manifestations of anti-China sentiment have varied across regimes: ranging from organized violence against Chinese firms and nationals by insurgent groups in Sudan and Ethiopia {{to the adoption of}} anti-Chinese campaign slogans in Zambia. In addressing <b>backlashes</b> <b>against</b> growing engagement and maintaining relatively high public approval, Beijing has modified its approach of noninterference in African relations: Single-party engagement in consolidated autocracies, e. g. Sudan and Ethiopia. Multiparty engagement in consolidated democracies, e. g. Ghana. Flexible engagement in transitional regimes, e. g. Zambia and Nigeria...|$|R
5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E
5|$|A pagan <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> Christianity {{followed}} Æthelberht's {{death in}} 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus {{to flee to}} Gaul. The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, hoping that the Frankish king would intervene and restore them to their sees, and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king. Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow {{him to return to}} London; after Laurence's death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters of encouragement from Pope Boniface V (619–625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian J. M. Wallace-Hadrill assumes that both letters were general statements of encouragement to the missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Glam metal lost {{mainstream}} {{interest in}} the early 1990s as the perceived excesses of glam metal created a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the genre. A factor in the decline of glam metal was the rise of grunge in the early 1990s, which had a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style. Glam metal has enjoyed a revival since the late 1990s with reunions of many popular acts from the genre's 1980s heyday, {{as well as the}} retro styling of newer bands including The Darkness from Lowestoft, the United Kingdom, Santa Cruz from Helsinki, Finland, and Steel Panther from Los Angeles, America.|$|E
5000|$|On 11 November 2015 Overkill {{announced}} {{the contents of}} a previously sold DLC investment called the [...] "Completely Overkill Pack" [...] would be a single random skin unique to said pack with a special EXP or Money boost for the team, after promising originally that the contents of the pack will be completely cosmetic. They also announced that seven other DLC packs would be made available for free to owners of the pack, but again, fans <b>backlashed</b> <b>against</b> this seemingly unfair revelation, including the people who bought the Completely Overkill Pack, as the store page for the pack declared it would not contain one of the DLC packs it ultimately contained, and it left the people who bought both the Completely Overkill and Overkill packs feeling short-changed. In response, Steam community moderators for Payday started a protest against this treatment abuse by fans by refusing to moderate the community until granted an interview with Almir Listo, producer of the game.|$|R
5000|$|Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi in Qatar has {{denounced the}} {{kidnapping}} and killings {{committed by the}} Abu Sayyaf towards civilians and foreigners, asserting {{that they are not}} part of the dispute between the Abu Sayyaf and the Philippines government. He stated that it is shameful to commit such acts in the name of the Islamic faith, saying that such acts produce <b>backlashes</b> <b>against</b> Islam and Muslims worldwide. During the 2000 Sipadan kidnappings, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) condemned the kidnapping and offered to help secure their release. OIC Secretary General Azeddine Laraki who represents the world's largest Islamic body, told the Philippine government he was prepared to send an envoy to help save the hostages and issued a statement condemning the rebels. [...] "The Secretary General has pointed out that this operation and the like are rejected by divine laws and that they are neither the appropriate nor correct means to resolve conflicts", the statement said.|$|R
40|$|Harold James {{examines}} the vulnerability and fragility of processes of globalization, both historically {{and in the}} present. This book applies lessons from past breakdowns of globalization—above all in the Great Depression—to show how financial crises provoke <b>backlashes</b> <b>against</b> global integration: against the mobility of capital or goods, but also against flows of migration. By a parallel examination of the financial panics of 1929 and 1931 {{as well as that}} of 2008, he shows how banking and monetary collapses suddenly and radically alter the rules of engagement for every other type of economic activity. Increased calls for state action in countercyclical fiscal policy bring demands for trade protection. In the open economy of the twenty-first century, such calls are only viable in very large states—probably only in the United States and China. By contrast, in smaller countries demand trickles out of the national container, creating jobs in other countries. The international community is thus paralyzed, and international institutions are challenged by conflicts of interest. The book shows the looming psychological and material consequences of an interconnected world for people and the institutions they create...|$|R
5|$|Other bull terriers like Saxa {{filled in}} as mascot until World War II, when {{athletics}} {{at the school}} paused during the war. After the war, a series of Great Danes, named Bo, Butch, and Hobo, served as mascot. William Peter Blatty, author of The Exorcist, {{was one of the}} students to care for Butch. During this time period mascot abductions by rival schools became a common threat to the animal's safety. A bull terrier costume was also briefly used by the school, but in 1951, the school suspended the football program {{as part of a larger}} <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> university sports. This left the school without a mascot.|$|E
5|$|Saint Anselm {{came out}} of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s with no major {{disturbances}} or riots on campus despite various bomb threats called into campus, often from parties outside the college. Fr. Placidus Riley, O.S.B. successfully led the college through these challenging times. Despite the <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the U.S. military on college campuses nationwide, the presence of a National Guard armory did not result in any major problems. However, in May 1970, final exams for that year were made optional as students showed support for the students of Kent State after the massacre of several unarmed college students protesting the Vietnam War. Students, faculty and members of the monastic community held prayer services and rallies throughout campus after the shootings.|$|E
5|$|The <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> {{the socialist}} Second Republic {{brought about the}} {{democratic}} Third Republic under consecutive presidents Albert Zafy (1991), Ratsiraka (1997) and Marc Ravalomanana (2001), followed by a Fourth Republic under Andry Rajoelina, who {{came to power in}} a 2009 coup d'état. Although Dama performed at political rallies in Paris during the eight-month political standoff following the 2001 presidential elections that brought Ravalomanana to power, Mahaleo as a full group has never sided with any particular politician, instead expressing through their lyrics the social and political views and concerns of the average Malagasy citizen. They tend to promote collective, grassroots action as the best solution to the country's problems, rather than entrusting the work to politicians and international development partners.|$|E

30|$|From the outset, {{revolution}} and migration were intrinsically linked. Within {{the first few}} months of 2011, the absence of Tunisian border controls resulted in a temporary hike of irregular emigration of Tunisians towards Italy and the much larger and prolonged arrivals of refugees, labor migrants and Libyan citizens from Libya (see Boubakri, 2013; Natter, 2015). The political events of 2011 set migration on the public and political agenda - triggering two contradictory trends. On the one hand, the unprecedented increase in civil liberties prompted significant civil-society activism. Existing CSOs embraced migrants’ rights in their work, such as the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights (FTDES) or the Tunisian Association of Sub-Saharan Students (AESAT), and new CSOs were created to protect irregular migrants and workers, such as Terre d’Asile Tunisie (TAT). On the other hand, the liberalization of the public sphere also led to racist <b>backlashes</b> <b>against</b> migrants. While protected by Ben Ali’s regime, sub-Saharan migrants report a growth of verbal and physical racist attacks after 2011, as their presence in Tunisia was intimately related to the old regime. These particularly complex interlinkages between migration and politics have hindered the solidarization between Tunisians and migrants in the post-revolutionary period.|$|R
5|$|The genre {{entered a}} new level {{following}} the release of Little Caesar (1931), which featured Edward G. Robinson as gangster Rico Bandello. Caesar, along with The Public Enemy starring James Cagney as Tom Powers and Scarface (1932), featuring Paul Muni as Tony Comante, were, by standards of the time, incredibly violent films that created {{a new type of}} anti-hero. Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began to subside after the end of Prohibition. The <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> gangster films was swift. In 1931, Jack Warner announced that his studio would stop making them and that he himself had never allowed his 15-year-old son to see them.|$|E
5|$|During the interwar {{period of}} the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist {{historian}} Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed {{that it was a}} subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{financial}} expertise and {{his friendship with}} Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination after an hour of debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends in the next four years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the <b>backlash</b> <b>against</b> the diminution of silver coinage.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{application}} of social identity theory to feminist consciousness and activism. For women, strong gender identifications may enhance support for equality struggles, whereas for men, they may contribute to <b>backlashes</b> <b>against</b> feminism. University students (N � 276), primarily Euroamerican, completed a measure of gender self-esteem (GSE, that part of one’s self-concept derived from one’s gender), and two measures of feminism. High GSE in women and low GSE in men were related to support for feminism. Consistent with past research, women were more supportive of feminism than men, and in both genders, support for feminist ideas was greater than self-identification as a feminist. For many feminists working {{as part of the}} American women’s movement, feminism is an important group identity. For instance, members of the National Organization for Women generally identify themselves as femi nists. Negative stereotypes of feminism may threaten involvement in the women’s movement. People may agree with goals of the movement, but may avoid labeling themselves as feminists for fear of being associated with this socially stigmatized label. This fear may interfere with the development of the group identification linked to collective action...|$|R

2500|$|As {{with any}} {{scientific}} work, claims about {{sex differences in}} the brain and their relation to behavior are subject to debate. Future research could be usefully targeted at exploring further the effects of believing in hardwired sex differences on society and how to reverse the negative consequences. Current research shows that believing in such claims increases gender bias in evaluations of others and <b>backlash</b> effects <b>against</b> females who violate gender norms. Such claims could result in parents and teachers perceiving and treating children more stereotypically, given the rising influence of gender specific [...] "brain-based" [...] educational strategies recommended to schools.|$|R
