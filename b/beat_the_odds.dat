Gosling portrayed Noah Calhoun and commented on the role: [...] "It gave me an opportunity to play a character over a period of time – from 1940 to 1946 – that was quite profound and formative." [...] Gosling sought to imbue his character with [...] "quiet strength" [...] and was inspired by the performance of Sam Shepard in Days of Heaven. Shepard co-starred in The Notebook. Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, in late 2002 and early 2003. Although Gosling and McAdams became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on the set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was uncooperative. The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads and noted that, [...] "against your better judgment, you root for the pair to <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> against them." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Gosling's [...] "beguiling unaffectedness" [...] and noted that [...] "it's hard not to like these two or begrudge them a great love together".

The dose given in these trials may be far too small to produce any useful effect. In most research, these early trials may involve healthy people, but cancer studies normally enroll only people with relatively severe forms of the disease in this stage of testing.
