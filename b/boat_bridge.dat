500|$|On 24 February, Wellington {{launched}} a new offensive against Soult's army. For this operation, Hill was reinforced by the 6th and Light Divisions. Beresford with two divisions mounted a feint attack against {{the northern end of}} the French line. Picton was supposed to demonstrate opposite Sauveterre but he exceeded his orders. He found an apparently unguarded ford about [...] from the bridge and pushed four light companies from John Keane's brigade across. After a steep climb, they reached high ground only to be overpowered by a battalion of the 119th Line Infantry from Villatte's division. In their flight down the slope and across the river, about 30 men were captured and a few drowned; about 80 of the 250 men became casualties. Hill built a <b>boat</b> <b>bridge</b> and thrust 20,000 troops across the Gave d'Oloron at Viellenave-de-Navarrenx between Sauveterre and Navarrenx. With his latest position compromised, Soult ordered a retreat to Orthez on the Gave de Pau River.|$|E
500|$|Maxentius {{prepared}} for {{the same type of}} war he had waged against Severus and Galerius: he sat in Rome and {{prepared for}} a siege. He still controlled Rome's praetorian guards, was well-stocked with African grain, and was surrounded on all sides by the seemingly impregnable Aurelian Walls. He ordered all bridges across the Tiber cut, reportedly on the counsel of the gods, and left the rest of central Italy undefended; Constantine secured that region's support without challenge. Constantine progressed slowly along the Via Flaminia, allowing the weakness of Maxentius to draw his regime further into turmoil. Maxentius' support continued to weaken: at chariot races on 27 October, the crowd openly taunted Maxentius, shouting that Constantine was invincible. Maxentius, no longer certain that he would emerge from a siege victorious, built a temporary <b>boat</b> <b>bridge</b> across the Tiber in preparation for a field battle against Constantine. On 28 October 312AD, the sixth anniversary of his reign, he approached the keepers of the Sibylline Books for guidance. The keepers prophesied that, on that very day, [...] "the enemy of the Romans" [...] would die. Maxentius advanced north to meet Constantine in battle.|$|E

Maharajah Ranjit Singh started construction of new bridge but he quickly received the news that a large number of Ghazis had encircled his army across the river and the Khalsa army had a chance of being wiped out there. Maharajah Ranjit Singh ordered the army to swim across the river and the Sikh forces were successful without much loss of men and luggage and Maharajah Ranjit Singh reached Jahangira. During this time Jai Singh Attariwala who had left the Sikh Army in 1821 and joined Azim Khan came back to Ranjit Singh who instantiated him into his former rank. Here the army was strategically divided into three formations. 800 cavalry and 700 infantry soldiers was placed under Akali Phula Singh.|$|E

Gates saw Marion as an embarrassment and got rid of him by giving him orders to scout the British, and destroy <b>boats,</b> <b>bridges</b> and other items that might be useful to the British.|$|R

50|$|In 369 an {{important}} battle was fought between the Romans, led by emperor Flavius Valens and the Thervingi led by Athanaric. Valens' army crossed {{the river at}} Noviodunum (Isaccea) using a <b>boat</b> <b>bridge</b> and met the Gothic army in Bessarabia. Although Valens obtained {{a victory for the}} Romans, they retreated (possibly because of the lateness of the season) and the Goths asked for a peace treaty, which was signed {{in the middle of the}} Danube, the Goths taking an oath to never set foot on Roman soil.|$|E
50|$|Persian King Darius I the Great, in {{an attempt}} to subdue the Scythian {{horsemen}} who roamed across the north of the Black Sea, crossed through the Bosphorus, then marched towards the River Danube. His army crossed the Bosphorus over an enormous bridge made by connecting Achaemenid boats. This bridge essentially connected the farthest geographic tip of Asia to Europe, encompassing at least some 1,000 metres of open water if not more. Years later, a similar <b>boat</b> <b>bridge</b> would be constructed by Xerxes I on the Dardanelles (Hellespont) strait, during his invasion of Greece.|$|E
5000|$|Years later, {{a similar}} <b>boat</b> <b>bridge</b> would be {{constructed}} by Xerxes the Great (Xerxes I), in his invasion of Greece.

5000|$|It is {{possible}} that a <b>boat</b> <b>bridge</b> made of around 500 boats across the Forth could have been constructed by Septimius Severus and his son Caracalla during their campaign in Scotland [...] Divided in the middle by Inchgarvie, a 1.25 mi bridge made of boats secured to long mooring ropes was within {{the capabilities of the}} Romans at the time, and with several tens of thousands of men campaigning north of the river such an investment may have been worthwhile. Whilst {{there is no evidence of}} such a bridge being built at Queensferry, the Romans are known to have built such bridges elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|Because it is {{surrounded}} by wetlands and is accessible only by <b>boat,</b> <b>Bridge</b> Island Meadows is a [...] "private favorite of intrepid paddlers." [...] The town of Millis offers three canoe launch points into the Charles River near this 80 acre greenspace. [...] One can approach the property by paddling a kayak or other small, maneuverable boat up the Charles River and turning west near the Medfield State Hospital up a small stream that leads to South End Pond. The passage to South End Pond through Bogastow Brook is even more challenging {{as it is a}} small, intermittent tributary that is thick with vegetation.|$|E
50|$|On August 10 Traun {{launched}} an elaborate sortie against the Spanish blockade, which {{had grown to}} over 15,000 men. In addition to raiding Spanish supplies, he targeted a <b>boat</b> <b>bridge</b> the Spanish had set up across the Volturno River. Sending several battalions out the Naples and Rome gates {{in the middle of}} the night, they spent several hours attempting to reach and destroy the bridge. The Spanish were able to fend off the attacks, but they were only cover for the true operation, in which a picked company of 500 successfully raided the countryside. Around dawn, this force returned with 150 cows, 90 water buffalo, 1,000 sheep. The attempt on the bridge had cost the Austrians over 300 casualties, although they killed more than 350 Spanish and took 52 prisoners (who Traun promptly released).|$|E
