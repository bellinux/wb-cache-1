500|$|Billy, [...] or William Johnson Hippopotamus, (1920s – October 11, 1955) was a pygmy {{hippopotamus}} given as a pet to U.S. President Calvin Coolidge. Captured in Liberia, {{he was given}} to Coolidge by Harvey Samuel Firestone in 1927. [...] Billy {{spent most of his}} life in the National Zoo in Washington D.C.. [...] In addition to his fame as an exotic presidential pet—which afforded him a trip to the 1939 New York World's Fair—Billy is also notable as the common ancestor to most pygmy hippos in American zoos. [...] By the time of his death in 1955, <b>Billy</b> <b>had</b> sired 23 calves, 13 of whom survived at least a year.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Newsom's {{grandson}} Coffee Wainscott was {{the next}} witness to take the stand. He testified that had been [...] "up in the cherry tree {{early in the morning}} grandpa was missing," [...] and that Celia had offered him [...] "two dozen walnuts" [...] if he would carry the ashes out of her cabin. Coffee testified that he had agreed to Celia's offer and taken the ashes and spread them {{along the side of the}} path, where he later witnessed the search party [...] "picking bones up out of the ashes." [...] In their cross-examination of Coffee Wainscott, the defense questioned him about his grandfather's sleeping arrangements on the night of his murder, much like they had questioned his mother, Virginia Wainscott. Coffee provided the defense with little information, other than the fact that his four-year-old brother, <b>Billy,</b> <b>had</b> been sleeping in the same room as their grandfather that night.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Billy Burroughs {{was eating}} dinner {{with his father}} and Allen Ginsberg in Boulder, Colorado, at Ginsberg's Buddhist poetry school (Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics) at Chogyam Trungpa's Naropa University when he began to vomit blood. Burroughs senior had not seen his son for over a year and was alarmed at his {{appearance}} when Billy arrived at Ginsberg's apartment. Although <b>Billy</b> <b>had</b> successfully published two short novels in the 1970s, and was deemed by literary critics like Ann Charters as a bona fide [...] "second generation beat writer", his brief marriage to a teenage waitress had disintegrated. Billy was a constant drinker, and there were long periods when he was out of contact with any of his family or friends. The diagnosis was liver cirrhosis so complete that the only treatment was a rarely performed liver transplant operation. Fortunately, the University of Colorado Medical Center was one of two places in the nation that performed transplants under the pioneering work of Dr. Thomas Starzl. Billy underwent the procedure and beat the thirty-percent survival odds. His father spent time in 1976 and 1977 in Colorado, helping Billy through additional surgeries and complications. Ted Morgan's biography asserts that their relationship was not spontaneous and lacked real warmth or intimacy. Allen Ginsberg was supportive to both Burroughs and his son throughout the long period of recovery.|$|E
