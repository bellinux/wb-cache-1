5|$|Various factors {{lay behind}} this sudden mass response. Economically, the news {{had reached the}} US {{at the height of}} a series of {{financial}} recessions and <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> in the 1890s. The gold standard of the time tied paper money to the production of gold and shortages {{towards the end of the}} 19th century meant that gold dollars were rapidly increasing in value ahead of paper currencies and being hoarded. This had contributed to the Panic of 1893 and Panic of 1896, which caused unemployment and financial uncertainty. There was a huge, unresolved demand for gold across the developed world that the Klondike promised to fulfil and, for individuals, the region promised higher wages or financial security.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{believed}} that the Populists' embrace of free silver would be the main issue to attract new members to the party. After the election, he attended {{a meeting of the}} American Bimetallic League, a pro-silver group, and gave speeches advocating an inflationist monetary policy. In the meantime, the Panic of 1893 caused <b>bank</b> <b>failures,</b> factory closures, and general economic upheaval. As the federal gold reserves dwindled, President Cleveland convinced Congress to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which ensured the government would purchase less silver for coining and which further disconcerted free silver supporters. While depletion of gold reserves slowed after the repeal, the country's economy still floundered.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{gold standard}} {{was established in}} 1821 by the United Kingdom as the Bank of England enabled redemption of its banknotes for gold bullion. France, Germany, the United States, Russia, and Japan each embraced the standard one by one from 1878 to 1897, marking its international acceptance. The first departure from the standard occurred in August 1914 when these nations erected trade embargoes on gold exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes. Following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Russia, and Poland began experiencing hyperinflation. Having informally departed from the standard, most currencies were freed from exchange rate fixing and allowed to float. Most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels. A number of countries, including the United States, made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former gold standard. The {{early years of the}} Great Depression brought about bank runs in the United States, Austria, and Germany, which placed pressures on gold reserves in the United Kingdom {{to such a degree that}} the gold standard became unsustainable. Germany became the first nation to formally abandon the post-World War I gold standard when the Dresdner Bank implemented foreign exchange controls and announced bankruptcy on July 15, 1931. In September 1931, the United Kingdom allowed the pound sterling to float freely. By the end of 1931, a host of countries including Austria, Canada, Japan, and Sweden abandoned gold. Following widespread <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> and a hemorrhaging of gold reserves, the United States broke free of the gold standard in April 1933. France would not follow suit until 1936 as investors fled from the franc due to political concerns over Prime Minister Léon Blum's government.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Bank erosion {{consists}} of two processes: basal erosion due to fluvial hydraulic force and <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> {{under the influence of}} gravity. Because bank resistance force varies with the degree of saturation of bank material, the probability of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> is the probability of the driving force of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> being greater than the bank resistance force. The degree of saturation of bank material increases with river stage; therefore, the frequency of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> is correlated to the frequency of flooding. Consequently, the rate of bank erosion is due to both basal erosion and <b>bank</b> <b>failure,</b> and <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> is a probabilistic phenomenon. In this paper, for cohesive bank material experiencing planar <b>bank</b> <b>failure,</b> a deterministic approach was adopted for basal erosion analysis, whereas the probability of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> was included in the analysis of <b>bank</b> <b>failure.</b> A method for calculating the rate of bank erosion was derived that integrates both basal erosion and <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> processes, and accounts for the effects of hydraulic force, bank geometry, bank material properties, and probability of <b>bank</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R

25|$|The gold {{standard}} {{was the primary}} transmission mechanism of the Great Depression. Even countries that did not face <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> and a monetary contraction first hand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher interest rates in countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with lower interest rates. Under the {{gold standard}}'s price–specie flow mechanism, countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline (deflation).|$|E
25|$|During the Crash of 1929 {{preceding}} the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%. Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, {{which could not}} be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. <b>Bank</b> <b>failures</b> led to the loss {{of billions of dollars in}} assets.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a model that studies the impact of a {{tightening}} monetary policy on <b>banking</b> <b>failure</b> in a developing country. Design/methodology/approach – The interest rate on treasury bills is included in the model to measure monetary policy. Since the model considers developing countries with low-income level, the paper assumes that a secondary market does not exist. Findings – The model shows that, despite treasury bills constituting an alternative source of profit for banks in developing countries, a tightening monetary policy increases the probability of <b>banking</b> <b>failure.</b> In addition, the model shows that efficiency level explains the asymmetric effect of monetary policy on the profit of the banks. Practical implications – The policy implication of the results of the paper is that the central bank should take into account the adverse effect of a tightening monetary policy on <b>banking</b> <b>failure,</b> when planning policy decisions. Originality/value – The paper offers insights into the linkage between monetary policy and <b>banking</b> <b>failure</b> in developing countries. <b>Banking,</b> Business <b>failures,</b> Developing countries, Interest rates, Monetary policy...|$|R

25|$|The Federal Reserve allowed {{some large}} public <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> – {{particularly}} {{that of the}} New York Bank of United States – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed. He claimed that, if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks, or simply bought government bonds {{on the open market}} to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell, {{all the rest of the}} banks would not have fallen after the large ones did, and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did.|$|E

The state budget was still in deficit, and the state's sparse population was producing very little revenue.

25|$|In {{addition}} to changing regulations, {{changes in the}} industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and OCC.

The remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator. While banks struggle {{to keep up with}} the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators, less time spent with each institution, and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks, potentially resulting in an overall increase in <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> across the United States.|$|E
