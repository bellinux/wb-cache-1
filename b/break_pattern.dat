40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to gain {{epidemiological}} knowledge about musculoskeletal pain in the upper body in light physical work, in relation to gender, psychosocial factors, and computer use; and to compare different methods for analyzing common and recurrent binary outcomes. Two study groups were investigated using questionnaire data: (a) computer users in the Swedish workforce and (b) a cohort of university students. Regression models used were ordinary logistic model, Cox model (for calculating prevalence ratios), marginal logistic model (GEE), random intercept logistic model (GLMM), Markov logistic model and Poisson model. Effect measures used were odds ratio, risk ratio and risk difference. Musculoskeletal pain in the upper body was more prevalent among women than among men, even among young adults. Risk factors among computer users in the workforce were high work demands, and using the computer most of the work-day (women). Protective factors were work control and to learn and develop at work, and for women support from superiors. In the university cohort stress, high work/study demands and computer use <b>break</b> <b>pattern</b> were identified as risk factors for neck pain. Stress was a risk factor associated both with developing and ongoing neck pain, and {{had an impact on}} both the group-average risk and the subject-specific risk of neck pain. Computer use <b>break</b> <b>pattern</b> {{had an impact on the}} group-average risk for neck pain, but on the subject-specific risk only for women. Among women stress and computer use <b>break</b> <b>pattern</b> interacted. The effect of presence of both factors exceeded the additive effect of each. Simple questions, about present neck pain and neck pain period past year, captured features of pain, such as general health, sleep disturbance, stress, and general performance. Neck pain period past year did not reflect more serious pain compared to present neck pain. The choice of statistical model should be based on whether a group-average risk or a subject-specific risk is of clinical relevance. Women and men differed more in the absolute effect measures than in the relative, regarding neck pain. The causality between risk factors and neck pain may differ between women and men...|$|E

A greater formation of hydrogen bonding results in a stronger interfacial adhesion, consequently improving the mechanical strength of the membrane. The elongation at <b>break</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is in contrast to}} the tensile stress pattern. A lower tensile stress results in a higher elongation at break percentage. Elongation at break indicates to what extent the membrane film can be stretched until the maximum point, which is also known as flexibility. Table 1 compares several membranes from previous studies with the membrane of the current study in terms of elongation at break [51 – 56]. The different patterns between tensile stress and elongation at break are logical. As mentioned above, the presence of SGO in the membrane increases the interfacial linkage due to the hydrogen bonding, thus reducing the flexibility of the membrane.|$|E

The mechanisms leading to the precedence of certain buds over the others are not yet fully explained, but the availability of soluble sugars may play a significant role, {{especially those in the}} xylem sap {{at the onset of the}} growing period. Here, we measured carbon availability in the different tissues (bud, xylem and bark). To assess the capacity of buds to use the xylem sap carbohydrates, the fluxes between xylem vessels and parenchyma cells, bark and buds of walnut (Juglans regia cv ‘Franquette’) were measured during the rest period until bud break. This uptake capacity varies according to the temperature, the sugar and the position on the branch of the fragment studied. Between December and March, in xylem tissues, the active component of sucrose uptake was predominant compared with diffusion (90 % of the total uptake), whereas the active component accounted for more moderate amounts in buds (50 % of the uptake). The active uptake of hexoses took place belatedly (April) in xylem. The flow rates between xylem vessels and buds increased 1 month before bud break and reached 2000 µg sucrose h− 1 g DW− 1. Fluxes seemed to depend on bud position on the branch. However, this study strongly suggests that they were mainly dependent on the sink strength of the buds and on the sink competition between bud, xylem parenchyma and bark...|$|E
40|$|Adv. Hort. Sci. In {{the current}} context of global changes, {{phenology}} {{is expected to}} be one of the major processes affected by temperature increase, notably through the dynamics of endodormancy release. However, the actual impact on bud <b>break</b> <b>pattern</b> is difficult to predict due to poor knowledge about the spatial extent of chilling sensing, which likely affects bud break heterogeneity. Indeed, contrary to a widely held opinion, the strictly local perception of the chilling air signal has never been demonstrated. The present experiment addresses this issue through local chilling or heating of selected nodal groups of buds on shoots of peach tree under endodormancy. A temperature-conditioned localizable air-jet device was designed to provide the sharpest possible temperature contrast between selected treated buds and the 'not-treated' rest of the tree structure, including adjacent axis tissue. Different chilling doses were tested over two experimental seasons, and a heat treatment was applied on single nodes in a cold environment. Chilled vegetative buds did not break when the local chilling dose received was less than 50 % of the requirements even though neighboring axis tissue received the standard chilling dose. The maximum rate of bud break reached 80 % at chilling completion and most of the broken buds produced long shoots. We conclude that temperature sensing occurs on a very local scale with the signal not reaching neighboring untreated buds, meaning that endodormancy release should be considered a very local process. The local response permits analysis of the intra-canopy heterogeneity of bud break and the possible relationship between bud status and intra-canopy heterogeneity of bud temperature...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Long range flights operate {{around the}} clock with long duty periods for pilots. To {{mitigate}} the effects of fatigue, these flights are operated by augmented crews, providing each pilot with the opportunity for sleep in on-board rest facilities. This thesis used a mixed methods approach to investigate the use of in-flight sleep and {{the factors that influence}} it. Methods: Retrospective survey data (291 pilots, five studies) were analysed to provide an overview of pilots’ sleep at home and investigate potential relationships with in-flight sleep. A second project monitored the sleep, fatigue and performance of 35 pilots operating a B 767 flight route between Atlanta and Lagos. These projects were supplemented by thematic analysis of pilots’ logbook comments on in-flight sleep (N= 123) and on the way they manage their fatigue (N= 629). Results: Pilots viewed in-flight sleep as an important fatigue management strategy and actigraphic sleep monitoring confirmed that the B 767 pilots made good use of their in-flight breaks for obtaining sleep. Self-ratings of in-flight sleep quality reflected ratings at home, but were usually poorer. Pilots indicated that the type, location and design of rest facilities affected sleep quality and duration, and identified strategies for minimizing sleep disturbances and improving alertness. Comments indicated that prior knowledge of inflight break allocations can influence the planning of pre-trip sleep, use of naps, and in-flight sleep. Actigraphic measures of sleep indicated that the B 767 pilots obtained more sleep in the 24 hours prior to departure than during baseline days regardless of their subsequent pattern of in-flight breaks, but it is unclear when they were advised about their <b>break</b> <b>pattern.</b> Ratings of sleepiness and fatigue increased across the B 767 flights, but psychomotor vigilance task performance at the start of duty and at top of descent was not associated with prior wakefulness, prior sleep duration or in-flight sleep duration. Conclusions: In-flight sleep is a well-utilized and effective fatigue mitigation strategy that may be supplemented by other strategies such as flight preparation techniques. To further reduce pilot fatigue risk on long range flights, additional research is warranted into the effects of flight preparation techniques and in-flight break patterns...|$|E

40|$|The City of Holbæk has {{implemented}} {{the concept of}} ’smoking-free working hours’, which prohibits employees of the City to smoke during the time spent at work regardless of whereabouts. This thesis investigates within social constructionism the implementation of ’smoking-free working hours’ in the City of Holbæk from a power and healthism perspective. Theoretically, it draws on ideas from the writings of Michel Foucault and Nikolas Rose. The following questions are raised in the thesis: What are {{the consequences of the}} implementation of ‘smoking-free working hours’ on the employees’ well-being in a Danish municipality and what paradoxes appears? The analytical approach is interactionistic on an individual as well as organisational level. The empirical methods are based on interviews with four smoking employees and a joint union delegate, interviews with representatives from Kræftens Bekæmpelse (Danish NGO within the field of cancer research and management) as well as an analysis of the City of Holbæk’s strategy for implementation of ‘smoking-free working hours’. The analysis shows a paradox between vision and goals in the City of Holbæk’s overarching health policy compared to the strategy concerning ‘smoking-free working hours’. The City’s health policy is focusing on improvement of employees well-being, whilst the new strategy is about prohibitions and imposes restrictions on the smoking employees' working hours. Kræftens Bekæmpelse, a consultant for the City of Holbæk, is a powerful actor during the implementation phase of ‘smoking-free working hours’. The consequences of ‘smoking-free working hours’ are shifts in <b>break</b> <b>pattern</b> and a change in inter-collegial relationships. Employees can be sanctioned by lay-offs in the event of rule violations and a potential for reporting on colleagues to the management has emerged. Further, as a reaction to the management’s increased control and monitoring, a sense of fundamental resistance has developed in some employees. We argue that employees’ perception of democracy as well as their general well-being is threatened by the implementation of ‘smoking-free working hours’. Finally, it is discussed whether the health discourse is legitimizing an erosion of the boundaries between private and professional life. In view of the conclusion of this thesis a potential future health discourse is discussed, and the question is raised, whether the boundaries to the private life sphere will be crossed in the name of praising health...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In the {{literature}} there are {{discussions on the}} choice of outcome {{and the need for}} more longitudinal studies of musculoskeletal disorders. The general aim of this longitudinal study was to analyze musculoskeletal neck pain, in a group of young adults. Specific aims were to determine whether psychosocial factors, computer use, high work/study demands, and lifestyle are long-term or short-term factors for musculoskeletal neck pain, and whether these factors are important for developing or ongoing musculoskeletal neck pain. Methods Three regression models were used to analyze the different outcomes. Pain at present was analyzed with a marginal logistic model, for number of years with pain a Poisson regression model was used and for developing and ongoing pain a logistic model was used. Presented results are odds ratios and proportion ratios (logistic models) and rate ratios (Poisson model). The material consisted of web-based questionnaires answered by 1204 Swedish university students from a prospective cohort recruited in 2002. Results Perceived stress was a risk factor for pain at present (PR = 1. 6), for developing pain (PR = 1. 7) and for number of years with pain (RR = 1. 3). High work/study demands was associated with pain at present (PR = 1. 6); and with number of years with pain when the demands negatively affect home life (RR = 1. 3). Computer use pattern (number of times/week with a computer session ≥ 4 h, without break) was a risk factor for developing pain (PR = 1. 7), but also associated with pain at present (PR = 1. 4) and number of years with pain (RR = 1. 2). Among life style factors smoking (PR = 1. 8) was found to be associated to pain at present. The difference between men and women in prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was confirmed in this study. It was smallest for the outcome ongoing pain (PR = 1. 4) compared to pain at present (PR = 2. 4) and developing pain (PR = 2. 5). Conclusion By using different regression models different aspects of neck pain pattern could be addressed and the risk factors impact on pain pattern was identified. Short-term risk factors were perceived stress, high work/study demands and computer use pattern (<b>break</b> <b>pattern).</b> Those were also long-term risk factors. For developing pain perceived stress and computer use pattern were risk factors. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we review the {{symmetry}} breaking mechanism of gauge theories. On the first chapters of this thesis, we review {{the concept of}} symmetry as the action {{of a group that}} leaves an object invariant, in particular Lagrangians and actions, and then develop the corresponding globally and gauge symmetric theories and the relationship between them. It also reviewed the concept and general framework of the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry for renormalizable potentials. Correspondingly, two main results for global symmetries, Noether’s theorem and Goldstone’s Theorem, are reviewed in a general setting. Chapter 3 is {{the most important part of}} this work. The Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism is explained and used to retrieve the symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>patterns</b> for the vector and all the second rank tensor irreducible representations of the O(n) and SU(n) groups. In general we will retrieve the vacuum expectation value (vev) for the particular representation and value of the parameters of the potential. Then, for this vev, we calculate the number of massive vector bosons of the theory. Following BEH mechanism and Goldstone’s theorem, this number is equal to the number of broken generators delining thus the particular symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>pattern.</b> Chapter 4 is a review of the Standard Model with an aim towards Grand Unified Theories (GUTs).

40|$|We study a 5 D {{bottom-up}} holographic {{model that}} is expected to describe the dynamics of the minimal composite Higgs model characterized by a SO(5) → SO(4) global symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>pattern.</b> We assume that the fundamental degrees of freedom are scalars transforming under some representation of SO(5) and subject to some unspecified strong interactions. The holographic description presented here is inspired by previous studies performed in the context of QCD and it allows for the consideration of spin one and spin zero resonances. The resulting spectrum leads in a natural way to a variety of resonances. Namely, those transforming under the unbroken SO(4) subgroup exhibit an exact degeneracy between the two Regge trajectories of vector and scalar channels, while the resonances with quantum numbers in the SO(5) / SO(4) coset lie on a trajectory of (heavier) spin one states and a non-degenerated one of scalar resonances where the four lowest lying ones are massless. These correspond to the four Goldstone bosons in 4 D associated to the global symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>pattern.</b> Restrictions derived from the experimental constraints (Higgs couplings, S parameter, etc.) are then implemented and we conclude that the model is able to accommodate vector and scalar resonances with masses in the range 1 TeV to 2 TeV without encountering phenomenological difficulties.
