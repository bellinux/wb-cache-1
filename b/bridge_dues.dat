40|$|On the {{aeroelastic}} {{response of}} long-spanned suspension <b>bridges</b> <b>due</b> to the random gust, afew kinds of model tests are performed in turbulent shear flow {{generated in the}} wind tunnel. Inturbulent flow comparatively large oscillations are observed for low wind speed region below thecritical flutter velocity. The power spectrum of this response is in good agreement with thetheoretical predictions, obtained by the modified quasi-steady theory in which the dynamic effects ofstructures are considered. Besides, as its applications to real structures, some numerical evaluationsare made for estimating the aerodynamic random response of Honsho-Shikoko connecting suspen-sion Bridge (Akashi Strait <b>Bridge)</b> <b>due</b> to the random gust...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{reported}} about vibration characteristics of steel <b>bridges</b> <b>due</b> to vehicle movement. However, there are few studies concerning PC bridges. Therefore, this study is concerned with dynamic response analysis in PC connected girder <b>bridges</b> <b>due</b> to vehicle movement. In this study, the analysis was simulated about the bridge with different span length and different bearing stiffness. Road-surface of the sine wave generated from IRI value 3. 5 also was used. The analyzed {{results show that the}} response of the superstructure becomes the maximum from 5 to 11 m of sine wavelength, and increases along with the span length...|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{originally}} known as Tudor <b>Bridge,</b> <b>due</b> {{to the historical}} tradition that it was built by Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford, who was also Baron Abergavenny. This supports a construction date of the mid-15th century.|$|R
50|$|The larger ocean-going {{cruise ships}} that visit the port {{currently}} dock at the Pinkenba Wharf, {{located on the}} north side of the Brisbane River, north of the Gateway <b>Bridge,</b> <b>due</b> to height restrictions placed by the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Class 2000 Locomotives are {{maintained}} by Diesel Workshop at Pahartali, Chittagong. These locomotives {{are not allowed}} to cross Bangabandhu <b>Bridge</b> <b>due</b> to mechanical restrictions. Therefore, they cannot go to Central Locomotive Workshop (CLW) at Parbatipur, Dinajpur for maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|... 13. Bridge of Le Bourdais Street (Road 153) in Saint-Tite. This {{bridge is}} about 1.9 km {{upstream}} by water from Du Moulin Street <b>Bridge,</b> <b>due</b> to the sinuosity {{of the river}} (or 1 kilometre in a direct line).|$|R
50|$|To {{the south}} east is another iconic landmark, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, {{also known as}} the Red <b>Bridge</b> <b>due</b> to its colour. It connects Limpertsberg to the European {{district}} of Kirchberg over the Pfaffenthal and the Alzette river.|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} some north of the river or south of the river distinctions in the Perth {{metropolitan}} region over time, especially in the time up to {{the completion of the}} Causeway and Narrows <b>bridges,</b> <b>due</b> to the time and distances to cross the river.|$|R
500|$|There {{are several}} small Scottish islands that are {{dominated}} by a castle or other fortification.

50|$|Cooper was {{reluctant}} to film the fight scene with <b>Bridges</b> <b>due</b> to ongoing problems with his back, but did, {{without the use of}} a stunt double. He wore no makeup, to emphasize his character's anguish and fear, which was probably intensified by pain from recent surgery to remove a bleeding ulcer.|$|R
