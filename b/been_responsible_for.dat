5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E

The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E
