5|$|Denver has {{a strong}} mayor/weak city council government. The mayor can approve or veto any {{ordinances}} or resolutions approved by the council, makes sure all contracts with the city are kept and performed, signs all bonds and contracts, {{is responsible for the}} city budget, and can appoint people to various city departments, organizations, and commissions. However, the council can override the mayor's veto with a nine out of thirteen member vote, and the city budget must be approved and can be changed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> majority vote of the council. The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually based on financial reasons.|$|E
5|$|Desperate for {{materials}} and short on funds, the palace was initially built {{entirely out of}} wood, its various structures surrounded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> log palisade. On 10 June 1782, the king ceremonially crossed the river from Thonburi to take permanent residence in the new palace. Three days later on 13 June, the king held an abbreviated coronation ceremony, thus becoming the first monarch of the new Rattanakosin Kingdom. Over {{the next few years}} the king began replacing wooden structures with masonry, rebuilding the walls, forts, gates, throne halls and royal residences. This rebuilding included the royal chapel, which would come to house the Emerald Buddha.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{contributed to}} these {{developments}} by linking {{them with the}} 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made.

Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, {{the government may}} decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> majority vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the theory}} of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These are methods that take a collection of points as input, and create a hierarchy of clusters of points by repeatedly merging pairs of smaller clusters to form larger clusters. The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two clusters but use different definitions of the distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E

The president serves as the head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the presidential veto <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> majority vote of all members of parliament.|$|E
5|$|Since antiquity {{the concept}} of force has been {{recognized}} as integral to the functioning {{of each of the}} simple machines. The mechanical advantage given <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of work. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of Archimedes who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant forces inherent in fluids.|$|E

5|$|The LU {{decomposition}} factors matrices as {{a product}} of lower (L) and an upper triangular matrices (U). Once this decomposition is calculated, linear systems can be solved more efficiently, <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> technique called forward and back substitution. Likewise, inverses of triangular matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate. The Gaussian elimination is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form. Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary matrices, which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row. Singular value decomposition expresses any matrix A {{as a product}} UDV∗, where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix.|$|E
