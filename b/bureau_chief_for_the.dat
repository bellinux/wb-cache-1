500|$|Clinton's {{choice was}} criticized as {{unconventional}} because rather than picking {{a running mate}} who would diversify the ticket, Clinton chose a fellow Southerner who shared his political ideologies and who was nearly {{the same age as}} Clinton. The Washington <b>Bureau</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Baltimore Sun, Paul West, later suggested that, [...] "Al Gore revolutionized the way Vice Presidents are made. When he joined Bill Clinton's ticket, it violated the old rules. Regional diversity? Not with two Southerners from neighboring states. Ideological balance? A couple of left-of-center moderates. [...] And yet, Gore has come to be regarded by strategists in both parties as the best vice presidential pick in at least 20 years." ...|$|E
500|$|On 10 June 1963, U.S. correspondents were {{informed}} that [...] "something important" [...] would happen the following morning on the road outside the Cambodian embassy in Saigon. Most of the reporters disregarded the message, since the Buddhist crisis had at that point {{been going on for}} more than a month, and the next day only a few journalists turned up, including David Halberstam of The New York Times and Malcolm Browne, the Saigon <b>bureau</b> <b>chief</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Associated Press. Đức arrived as part of a procession that had begun at a nearby pagoda. Around 350 monks and nuns marched in two phalanxes, preceded by an Austin Westminster sedan, carrying banners printed in both English and Vietnamese. They denounced the Diệm government and its policy towards Buddhists, demanding that it fulfill its promises of religious equality. Another monk offered himself, but Đức's seniority prevailed.|$|E

[...] Subsequently, he became assistant editor (news and features), assistant editor (features) in 1987, executive editor the following year and associate editor in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2017, sexual {{harassment}} charges were leveled against Michael Oreskes, {{senior vice president}} of news and editorial director since 2015.

After a report on the Times accusations was published in The Washington Post, NPR put Oreskes on administrative leave, and the following day his resignation was requested. CNN's Brian Stelter reported that NPR staffers were dissatisfied with the handling of Oreskes, were demanding an external investigation, and that [...] Oreskes poisoned the newsroom atmosphere by abusing his position to meet young women.|$|E

2500|$|Unofficial {{estimates}} of the death toll have usually been higher than government figures, and {{go as high as}} several thousand. Nicholas D.

In a 1990 article addressing the question, Time magazine said that the Chinese Red Cross had given a figure of 2,600 deaths on the morning of June 4, though later this figure was retracted.
