The increasing worldwide use of bio-fuels constitutes one of the measures considered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Bio-fuels also have an important part to play in promoting the security of energy supply, and promoting technological development and innovation. Di-butyl ether (DBE) is used as <b>blending</b> <b>agent</b> in reformulated gasoline and has been included in recent international regulations on {{the promotion of the}} use of energy from renewable sources for transport. The DBE is a non-polluting, high octane number <b>blending</b> <b>agent.</b> DBE could be also used as cetane enhancer in bio-diesel fuel, and can be obtained as an added valued additive to second generation bio-fuels. Second generation bio-fuels could be obtained from ligno-cellulosic biomass and waste materials. Ether + alkane mixtures are of interest as model mixtures for gasoline in which the ether act as renewable, high octane number <b>blending</b> <b>agent.</b> From this point of view the study of the binary mixtures dibutyl ether + heptane, are very interesting. Heptane has been chosen {{as a representative of the}} linear alkanes that contain real gasoline. Density of the binary mixtures DBE + heptane and its pure compounds have been measured under pressure and reported in this work using a vibrating tube densitometer. Accurate PVT properties of pure ethers and its mixtures are required to develop and test equations of state, because equations of state are critical to design storage and transport systems in the fuel industry. Moreover, high temperature and pressure data serve to validate equations of state which are reliable for the increasingly use of industrial and engine processes under hard conditions. Experimental densities (826 points) for the compressed liquid phase of the binary systems DBE + heptane have been measured at 298. 15, 313. 15, 333. 15, 353. 15, 373. 15 and 393. 15 K and at pressures up to 140 MPa, with an absolute uncertainty of 0. 7 kg·m- 3.

40|$|Gasoline {{anti-knock}} quality, {{defined by}} the research and motor octane numbers (RON and MON), is important for increasing spark ignition (SI) engine efficiency. Gasoline knock resistance can be increased using a number of blending components. For over two decades, ethanol has become a popular anti-knock <b>blending</b> <b>agent</b> with gasoline fuels due to its production from bio-derived resources. This work explores the oxidation behavior of two oxygenated certification gasoline fuels and the variation of fuel reactivity with molecular composition. Ignition delay times of Haltermann (RON =[*] 91) and Coryton (RON =[*] 97. 5) gasolines have been measured in a high-pressure shock tube and in a rapid compression machine at three pressures of 10, 20 and 40  bar, at equivalence ratios of φ[*]=[*] 0. 45, 0. 9 and 1. 8, and in the temperature range of 650 – 1250  K. The {{results indicate that the}} effects of fuel octane number and fuel composition on ignition characteristics are strongest in the intermediate temperature (negative temperature coefficient) region. To simulate the reactivity of these gasolines, three kinds of surrogates, consisting of three, four and eight components, are proposed and compared with the gasoline ignition delay times. It is shown that more complex surrogate mixtures are needed to emulate the reactivity of gasoline with higher octane sensitivity (S = RON–MON).

Waxy wheats carry three non-functional (null) alleles (Wx-A 1 b, Wx-B 1 b, and Wx-D 1 b) at the genetic loci encoding the enzyme granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS, EC 2. 4. 1. 21) (Nakamura et al., 1995). GBSS also is known as the “waxy” protein. Waxy wheats produce endospermstarch that is nearly devoid of amylose. Such starch confers unique functional properties to derived wheat flour. Suggested uses for waxy wheats include the production of modified food starches, a <b>blending</b> <b>agent</b> to create flours with optimal amylose concentration for the production of a variety of sheeted and baked food products, and as an animal feed (reviewed by Graybosch, 1998). Waxy wheats also are useful as donors of the Wx null alleles, which may be used to develop partial waxy or reduced-amylose wheats. The presence of one or two such alleles can result in wheat flours with superior performance in certain food applications including white salted noodles (Epstein et al., 2002).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research efforts}} made {{in three different}} phases {{with the objective of}} improving the fuel economy of and reducing exhaust emissions from conventional, carbureted, two-stroke spark ignition (SI) engines, which are widely employed in two-wheel transportation in India. A review concerning the existing two-stroke engine technology for this application is included. In the first phase, a new scavenging system was developed and tested to reduce the loss of fresh charge through the exhaust port. In die second phase, the following measures were carried out to improve the combustion process: (1) using an in-cylinder catalyst, such as copper, chromium, and nickel, in the form of coating; (2) providing moderate thermal insulation in the combustion chamber, either by depositing thin ceramic material or by metal inserts; (3) developing a high-energy ignition system; and (4) employing high-octane fuel, such as methanol, ethanol, eucalyptus oil, and orange oil, as a <b>blending</b> <b>agent</b> with gasoline. Based on the effectiveness of the above measures, an optimized design was developed in the final phase to achieve improved performance. Test results indicate that with an optimized two-stroke SI engine, the maximum percentage improvement in brake thermal efficiency is about 31 %, together with a reduction of 3400 ppm in hydrocarbons (HC) and 3 % by volume of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions over the normal engine (at 3 kW, 3000 rpm). Higher cylinder peak pressures (3 - 5 bar), lower ignition delay (2 - 4 {degrees}CA) {degrees} and shorter combustion duration (4 - 10 {degrees}CA) are obtained.

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} emissions regulations, rising oil prices, and {{an increased}} focus on environmental awareness are driving the search for clean, alternative fuels. Derived from natural gas, coal, and even biomass Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels are one such alternative. The inherently clean nature of FT diesel coupled {{with the fact that}} FT diesel exhibits similar physical properties to those of conventional diesel make FT diesel an ideal candidate as both a <b>blending</b> <b>agent</b> with and eventual replacement for conventional petroleum-based diesel fuels. The potential for emissions reduction with FT diesel fuels in laboratory engine tests and on-road vehicle tests is well documented. While a number of chemical and physical characteristics of FT fuels have been attributed to the observed reduction in emissions, the actual effects of both the fuel properties and in-cylinder combustion characteristics in modern diesel engines are still not well understood. In this study a 2002, six-cylinder, 5. 9 liter, Cummins ISB 300 diesel engine, outfitted with an in-cylinder pressure transducer, was subjected to a subset of the Euro III 13 -mode test cycle under steady-state operating conditions. (cont.) Emissions and in-cylinder pressure measurements were conducted for neat FT diesel, low sulfur diesel (LSD), ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD), and a blend of FT/LSD. The experimental results show a significant reduction in regulated emissions with the neat FT fuel and a more than proportional reduction in particulate emissions for the blend. In order to provide further insight into the emissions behavior of the fuels, combustion characteristics were determined from a heat release analysis based on the in-cylinder pressure measurements. In addition, a detailed chemical analysis of the fuels and particulate emissions was carried out. The differences in the measured combustion characteristics and fuel properties were compared to the emissions variations between the fuels studied, and an explanation for the observed emissions behavior of the fuels was developed. by Alexander G.

40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{a range of}} ketone biofuels produced from the alkylation of isoamyl alcohol and isobutanol were examined as potential <b>blending</b> <b>agents</b> with Jet A- 1 aviation kerosene. The fuels were synthesized under solvent-free conditions using a Pd/C catalyst with K 3 PO 4, previously reported for the alkylation of acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) fermentation mixtures. Reasonable yields and selectivity were achieved for branched alkylation products with up to 61 % produced from isoamyl alcohol and 64 % from isobutanol. The key aviation fuel properties of the mixtures were tested unblended and in 50 % and 20 % blends with Jet A- 1 aviation kerosene. The freezing points of the fuels were all found to be below the required − 47 °C irrespective of blend or {{the temperature of the}} reaction. The energy density of the unblended fuels ranged between 30. 4 and 41. 36 MJ/kg depending on the temperature of the reaction and whether remaining alcohols were removed. While this is below the higher heating value (HHV) of the Jet A- 1 used (45. 69 MJ/kg), the energy densities of the 50 % and 20 % blends were more suitable with the isoamyl alcohol derived fuels having a maximum HHV of 44. 31 MJ/kg at 50 % blending and 44. 99 MJ/kg at 20 % blend with Jet A- 1. The fuels derived from isoamyl alcohol produced above 140 °C were found to satisfy the flash point criterion (> 38 °C) of the Jet A- 1 specification, though the isobutanol derived fuels did not, producing fuels with flash points between 33 and 35 °C. The kinematic viscosities of the fuels were also tested at − 20 °C. Unblended {{only a few of the}} fuels analyzed met the maximum viscosity requirement at − 20 °C of 8 mm 2 s– 1, though this fuel property was improved substantially on blending with jet fuel.

40|$|The {{recently}} heightened {{attention to}} US petroleum consumption {{and the associated}} environmental and economic impacts {{has resulted in a}} resurgent interest in biofuels as an alternative source of energy for transportation. The production and use of biofuels for transportation is not a new idea and in fact has been around {{as long as we have}} had cars. The difference today is a combination of factors – economic, environmental, technical, and political – that have combined to create an atmosphere in which biofuels are viewed as having the potential to replace a significant percentage of our transportation energy needs. This paper is an attempt to understand the most significant factors that have contributed to this situation and to use that understanding to provide insight about the impact of future policies and business decisions on the market. The transportation biofuels market in the US has grown substantially in the last few years with sales reaching almost 4 billion gallons in 2005, up from 2 billion in 2002. Sales are expected to exceed 5 billion in 2007 (see Figure 1) with an additional 6. 2 billion gallons capacity under construction over the next several years. The recent growth in the market in the US is driven almost entirely by the use of ethanol as a <b>blending</b> <b>agent</b> for gasoline to increase octane and as an “oxygenate” for cleaner combustion. Ethanol can be blended into gasoline up to concentrations of 10 % without any modification of the vehicle or retail infrastructure required. The use of ethanol in concentrations greater than this, which would currently require either a dedicated alcohol or “flex-fuel” vehicles (FFV) and capable retail fuel dispensers, has been minimal. In this sense, the current demand for biofuels as a true ‘alternative fuel’ is nearly non-existent.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of coal-derived syngas to C{sub 2 +} alcohols and oxygenates has attracted great attention {{due to their}} potential as chemical intermediates and fuel components. This is particularly true of ethanol, which {{can serve as a}} transportation fuel <b>blending</b> <b>agent,</b> as well as a hydrogen carrier. A thermodynamic analysis of CO hydrogenation to ethanol that does not allow for byproducts such as methane or methanol shows that the reaction: 2 CO + 4 H{sub 2 } {yields} C{sub 2 }H{sub 5 }OH + H{sub 2 }O is thermodynamically favorable at conditions of practical interest (e. g, 30 bar, {approx}< 250 C). However, when methane is included in the equilibrium analysis, no ethanol is formed at any conditions even approximating those that would be industrially practical. This means that undesired products (primarily methane and/or CO{sub 2 }) must be kinetically limited. This is the job of a catalyst. The mechanism of CO hydrogenation leading to ethanol is complex. The key step is the formation of the initial C-C bond. Catalysts that are selective for EtOH can be divided into four classes: (a) Rh-based catalysts, (b) promoted Cu catalysts, (c) modified Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, or (d) Mo-sulfides and phosphides. This project focuses on Rh- and Cu-based catalysts. The logic was that (a) Rh-based catalysts are clearly the most selective for EtOH (but these catalysts can be costly), and (b) Cu-based catalysts appear to be the most selective of the non-Rh catalysts (and are less costly). In addition, Pd-based catalysts were studied since Pd is known for catalyzing CO hydrogenation to produce methanol, similar to copper. Approach. The overall approach of this project was based on (a) computational catalysis to identify optimum surfaces for the selective conversion of syngas to ethanol; (b) synthesis of surfaces approaching these ideal atomic structures, (c) specialized characterization {{to determine the extent to}} which the actual catalyst has these structures, and (d) testing at realistic conditions (e. g., elevated pressures) and differential conversions (to measure true kinetics, to avoid deactivation, and to avoid condensable concentrations of products in the outlet gas) ...|$|E

The study has shown, that presently used secondary raw materials and fuels result in some cases in a slight increase in trace element concentrations in cement. However, a general assessment of the use of wastes in cement production and of its impact on trace element input can not be performed. Furthermore, future developments can hardly be estimated. The release of trace elements from concrete elements is negligible small during the phase of use. An increased release of trace elements is possible under special assumptions after demolition. However, the present knowledge is not sufficient for a definite assessment. Existing regulations concerning the production and use of cement do not presently contain defaults for allowed concentrations of pollutants. However, changes can be expected in future due to demands which are presently worked out for the EU. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} the {{closed-cell}} sponge of chloroprene rubber(CR) were produced by foaming agent Azodicarbonamide (AC) and Oxybis (benzene sulfonyl) hydrazide (OBSH). The <b>blend</b> blowing <b>agent</b> AC/OBSH {{was more effective}} than the pure AC as it could produce chloroprene foam with greater cell porosity, more uniform and better cell distributions. The CR foam prepared with AC/OBSH had better tensile strength and tear strength than pure AC, but higher Shore C hardness. The Polyethyene glycol (PEG) modified Zinc Oxide (ZnO) could accelerate curing and foam process simultaneously. Increase the content of PEG, CR foam has bigger swell ratio, smaller cell size, and better softness...|$|R

So, as to utilize these soils in an effective way, proper treatment to the soil is required. With the same intention, an attempt is made to modify engineering properties of black cotton soils by using RBI Grade 81. Lateritic soil contains more amounts of finer particles like medium sand, fine sand, silt and clay. It could be described as a red friable clay surface in a temperature countries, it could also described as a very hard homogenous vescular massive clinker lateritic soils as a group rather than well defined materials are most commonly found in a leached soils of humid tropic which is enriched in iron and aluminium. In order to fully appreciate the usefulness of lateritic clay soil, its problem (both in field and laboratory but as per project only laboratory experiments will be done) would have to be identified and useful solutions applied, like a soil stabilization, soil stabilization can be divided into two categories namely mechanical and chemical Mechanical stabilization is the blending of different grades of soils to obtain a required grade. Chemical stabilization is the blending of the natural soil with chemical <b>agents.</b> Several <b>blending</b> <b>agents</b> have been used to obtain different effects.

The fold surface free energy &# 963;e of pure PET and PET/nucleating <b>agent</b> <b>blends</b> were calculated by Hoffman-Lauritzen theory. The {{results indicate that the}} three kinds of nucleating agents increase the crystallization rate constant through promoting their nucleating effect for PET crystallization, among which SB is the best one with the same content. The crystallization mode of PET might shift from three-dimensional growth to two-dimensional growth by the addition of the nucleating agents. The values of &# 963;e of PET/nucleating <b>agent</b> <b>blends</b> are much less than that of pure PET, and PET/SB (99 : 1) blend has the least value of &# 963;e (18. 2 mJ/m 2).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop improved transportation fuels by producing higher ethers and oxygenates for use as additives and <b>blending</b> <b>agents</b> in reformulated gasolines and ultra clean diesel fuels. The addition of oxygenates to gasoline and diesel fuels raises combustion temperatures, improves engine efficiencies, and causes the fuel to burn more cleanly, resulting in lower levels of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust stream. Ethers are the favored oxygen-containing additives for reformulated gasoline since they have high octane numbers and burn cleanly. Using higher ethers as fuel additives would help achieve the goal of adding oxygenates with lower vapor pressures and lower water solubilities to the fuels while simultaneously increasing the energy density of the added oxygenate. Single-Step Liquid Phase Process The focus of this research is to develop a single-step, liquid phase process to produce higher ethers from synthesis gas. The conventional method of producing ethers is first to produce methanol from synthesis gas and then to convert the methanol to an ether. For example, this process is typically used to produce dimethyl ether (DME) from methanol by either a gas or a liquid phase reaction (Snamprogetti; Peng et al., 1998; Sofianos and Scurrell, 1991; Espino and Pletzke, 1973). The conversion of syngas to methanol can be increased by removing, either chemically or physically, the alcohol as it is formed, because this removal lowers the thermodynamic constraints and promotes syngas conversion (Wender, 1996). A single-step, liquid phase DME synthesis reaction has been developed that converts DME directly from synthesis gas using a bifunctional catalyst that promotes methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration for forming DME (Lewnard et al., 1990). Performing this single-step reaction in a liquid phase environment offers the advantage of heat dissipation, thereby allowing a lower reaction temperature to be maintained. The liquid phase reaction results in less catalyst deactivation and longer catalyst lifetime (Brown et al., 1991...|$|R
