5|$|In a 1990 {{morphological}} phylogenetic study, Kiyonori Nishida {{concluded that}} the deepwater stingray and the sixgill stingray (Hexatrygon bickelli) were the most basal stingrays (suborder Myliobatoidei). Therefore, he moved this species to its own genus, Plesiobatis, and family, Plesiobatidae; the name {{is derived from the}} Greek plesio ("primitive") and <b>batis</b> ("ray"). Subsequent morphological studies have corroborated the basal position of Plesiobatis, but disagreed on its relationships to nearby taxa. John McEachran, Katherine Dunn, and Tsutomu Miyake in 1996 could not fully resolve the position of Plesiobatis, thus they assigned it provisionally to the family Hexatrygonidae. McEachran and Neil Aschliman in 2004 found Plesiobatis to be the sister taxon of Urolophus, and recommended that it be placed in the family Urolophidae. Until the phylogeny is better-resolved, authors have tended to preserve the family Plesiobatidae.|$|E

25|$|Research {{published}} in 2009 and 2010 {{suggests that the}} species should be split into two, the smaller southern D. cf. flossada (blue skate), and the larger northern D. cf. intermedia (flapper skate). Under this taxonomic arrangement, the name D. <b>batis</b> is discarded.|$|E
500|$|The {{spotted eagle}} ray was first {{described}} by Swedish botanist Bengt Anders Euphrasén as Raja narinari in 1790 from a specimen collected at an unknown location (possibly the coast of Brazil) during a trip he made to the Antilles, and was later classified as Stoasodon narinari. Its current genus name is Aetobatus, derived from the Greek words aetos (eagle) and <b>batis</b> (ray). The {{spotted eagle ray}} belongs to the Myliobatidae family, which includes the well known manta ray. [...] Most rays in the Myliobatidae swim in the open ocean rather than close to the sea floor.|$|E
500|$|Alexander the Great besieged Gaza—the last city {{to resist}} his conquest on his path to Egypt—for five months, finally {{capturing}} it 332 BCE. Led by a eunuch named <b>Batis</b> and defended by Arab mercenaries, Gaza withstood the siege for two months, {{until it was}} overcome by storm. The defenders, mostly local elements, fought to the death and {{the women and children}} were taken as captives. The city was resettled by neighboring Bedouins, who were sympathetic to Alexander's rule. He then organized the city into a polis or [...] "city-state" [...] and Greek culture took root in Gaza which gained a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenic learning and philosophy. Belonging at first to the Ptolemaic kingdom, it passed after 200 BCE to the Seleucids.|$|E
2500|$|The {{common skate}} or blue skate (Dipturus <b>batis,</b> syn. Raja <b>batis)</b> {{is the largest}} skate in the world {{attaining}} a length of up to [...] Historically, {{it was one of}} the most abundant skates in the northeast Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Despite its name, today it appears to be absent from much of this range. Where previously abundant, fisheries directly targeted this skate and elsewhere it is caught incidentally as bycatch. The species was uplisted to Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2006 and it is protected within the EU.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{published}} in 2009 and 2010 {{found that there}} are distinct genetic and morphological differences within the common skate as traditionally defined, leading to the suggestion of splitting it into two species: The smaller (up to about [...] in length) southern D. cf. flossada (blue skate), and the larger and slower-growing northern D. cf. intermedia (flapper skate). Under this taxonomic arrangement, the name D. <b>batis</b> is discarded. Alternatively, the scientific name D. <b>batis</b> (with flossada as a synonym) is retained for the blue skate and D. intermedia for the flapper skate.|$|E
6000|$|According to {{the people}} of the upper river the Fán were {{expelled}} by the Bati or Batti--not [...] "Bari" [...] as it has been written-from their ancient seats; and they are still pushing them seawards. The bushmen are said to live seven to ten short marches (seventy to a hundred miles) to the east, and are described by Mr. Tippet, whom they have visited, as a fine, tall, slender, and light- skinned people, who dress like the Fán, but without so much clothing, and who sharped the teeth of both sexes. Dr. Barth heard of the Bati, and Herr Petermann's map describes them[FN#20] as [...] "Pagans, reported to be of a white colour, and of beautiful shape, to live in houses made of clay, to wear cloth of their own making, and to hold a country from which a mountain is visible to the south-west, and close to the sea." [...] The range in question may be the Long Qua (Kwa), which continues the Camarones block to the north-east, and the <b>Batis</b> may have passed south-westward from Southern Adamáwa.|$|E
60|$|The {{salmon is}} not the only fish in which the teeth differ in the two sexes. This is the case with many rays. In the thornback (Raia clavata) the adult male has sharp, pointed teeth, {{directed}} backwards, whilst those of the female are broad and flat, forming a pavement; so that these teeth differ in the two sexes of the same species more than is usual in distinct genera of the same family. The teeth of the male become sharp only when he is adult: whilst young they are broad and flat like those of the female. As so frequently occurs with secondary sexual characters, both sexes of some species of rays, for instance R. <b>batis,</b> possess, when adult, sharp, pointed teeth; and here a character, proper to and primarily gained by the male, appears to have been transmitted to the offspring of both sexes. The teeth are likewise pointed in both sexes of R. maculata, but only when completely adult; the males acquiring them at an earlier age than the females. We shall hereafter meet with analogous cases with certain birds, in which the male acquires the plumage common to both adult sexes, at a somewhat earlier age than the female. With other species of rays the males even when old never possess sharp teeth, and consequently both sexes when adult are provided with broad, flat teeth like those of the young, and of the mature females of the above-mentioned species.[9] As the rays are bold, strong and voracious fishes, we may suspect that the males require their sharp teeth for fighting with their rivals; but as they possess many parts modified and adapted for the prehension of the female, it is possible that their teeth may be used for this purpose.|$|E
