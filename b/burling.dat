5|$|In April 1974, Nixon {{announced}} that he would appoint Cooper to be the US Ambassador to East Germany, but during the final negotiations between the countries for the US to establish an embassy in the country, Nixon resigned. His successor, Gerald Ford, officially appointed Cooper to the ambassadorship, and Cooper took leave from Covington & <b>Burling</b> to accept it. He arrived in East Germany in December 1974 and served as ambassador until October 1976. After returning to the US, he resumed his work at Covington & <b>Burling.</b> In his last act of public service, he again served as an alternate delegate to the UN General Assembly in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Dates {{are also}} {{relevant}} to this autobiographical reading. According to the text, Pym arrives at the island of Tsalal on January 19 — Poe's birthday. Scholars, including Burton R. Pollin and Richard Wilbur, suggest that the character of Augustus was based on Poe's childhood friend Ebenezer <b>Burling</b> or on Poe's brother William Henry Leonard Poe, who served in South America and elsewhere as a sailor aboard the USS Macedonian. In the novel, the date of Augustus's death corresponds {{to that of the}} death of Poe's brother. The first chapter features Pym's sloop named the Ariel, the name of a character once played by Poe's mother Eliza Poe, and also the name of Percy Bysshe Shelley's boat, on which he died, originally named Don Juan in honor of Lord Byron.|$|E
5|$|Weinstein {{was born}} and raised in Washington, D.C. to Rosa and Harris Weinstein. His mother is the {{director}} of the Himmelfarb Mobile University which provides education for the elderly, while his father is a lawyer for Covington & <b>Burling.</b> He has a brother, Jacob, and a sister, Teme. Weinstein attended St. Albans High School in Washington, D.C., where he met and became best friends with Bill Oakley in the eighth grade. The two created the school humor magazine The Alban Antic in 1983. He later attended Stanford University, where he served as editor-in-chief of the Stanford Chaparral. Weinstein is an honorary member of the Harvard Lampoon as he worked on some of Lampoons parody publications with Oakley over the summers between course years.|$|E
50|$|For example, ash <b>burl</b> {{consistently}} {{looks like}} ash <b>burl</b> and maple <b>burl</b> like maple <b>burl.</b> However, sometimes a <b>burl</b> will not exhibit its telltale character traits —- {{it may have}} the traits {{of more than one}} species or just some of them, but then have an altogether unfamiliar trait. To identify this we can just make an educated guess. Nearly 90 percent of <b>burl</b> treen in North America was fashioned from black ash <b>burl.</b> It is a common misbelief that the majority of <b>burl</b> was fashioned from maple or walnut <b>burl.</b> It should be stressed that not every piece of wood that exhibits a strong or decorative grain is <b>burl.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Redwoods {{may also}} {{reproduce}} using <b>burls.</b> A <b>burl</b> is a woody lignotuber that commonly appears on a redwood tree below the soil line, though usually within [...] in depth {{from the soil}} surface. Coast redwoods develop <b>burls</b> as seedlings from the axils of their cotyledon, a trait that is extremely rare in conifers. When provoked by damage, dormant buds in the <b>burls</b> sprout new shoots and roots. <b>Burls</b> are also capable of sprouting into new trees when detached from the parent tree, though exactly how this happens {{is yet to be}} studied. Shoot clones commonly sprout from <b>burls</b> and are often turned into decorative hedges when found in suburbia.|$|R
25|$|Two {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward regarding the origin of Burlington's name.

While no <b>Burling</b> family members are listed as grantees of the town, the family held large tracts of land in nearby towns, some of which were granted on the same day as Burlington.|$|E
25|$|The Resolution sailed {{with the}} Jefferson as her tender. On 19 May 1793 the vessels reached the Pacific Northwest Coast, entered the Columbia River.

Its fate was later learned from several sources, including logs from the merchant ships Ruby and Despatch. The Resolution was captured by Haida chief Cumshewa and his people in 1794. All the crew but one were killed, including Captain <b>Burling</b> and Solomon Kendrick. The lone survivor was later rescued by the Boston ship Despatch. In 1799 the merchant ship Eliza under Captain Samuel <b>Burling</b> visited the Kaigani Haida of Dall Island.

50|$|Amboyna <b>burl</b> is a {{particularly}} expensive type of <b>burl,</b> much more than bigleaf maple <b>burl,</b> for example. It comes from padauk trees (Pterocarpus spp.) of Southeast Asia.

The amboyna is usually a deep red, although the more rare moudui <b>burl</b> is the same species but the color is from golden yellow to yellow-orange. The sapwood is creamy white with brown streaks.

50|$|<b>Burl</b> is a {{cancerous}} growth {{on a tree}} or bush. This irregular cell growth makes determining the species difficult unless {{a portion of the}} host or straight grain is available. Though <b>burl</b> is an irregular growth, there is some consistency within the irregularities in that species of trees that are prone to developing <b>burls</b> produce the same kind of <b>burl</b> over and over again.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the value}} of <b>burls,</b> ancient redwoods in National Parks in Western United States have {{recently}} been poached by thieves for their <b>burls,</b> including at Redwood National and State Parks. Poachers often cut off the <b>burls</b> from the sides of the trunks using chainsaws, which exposes the tree to infection and disease, or fell the entire tree to steal <b>burls</b> higher up. Because of risk of poaching, Jeff Denny, the state park’s redwood coast sector supervisor, encourages those buying <b>burl</b> to inquire where it came from and to ensure it was obtained legally. Legal acquisition methods for <b>burl</b> include trees from private land cleared for new development and from lumber companies with salvage permits.|$|R
