The <b>bogie</b> and <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> design had been closely supervised by NZR CME J.Black and were excellent, and while there was significant sway at speed, it was nowhere {{as bad as the}} ugly movement of the older Vulcan and Standard railcars cornering at speed. [...] Unfortunately the design of the power train could not be supervised [...] and while initially in 1955, the Fiat engines were not considered a problem, by early 1957 it was obvious that the Fiat engines were flawed and unsuited to the fast intercity and steeply graded New Zealand routes.|$|R
40|$|While a {{wheelset}} is centring {{itself in}} the gauge clearance due to the coupling of the wheel rotation and the wheel profiles, this effect is missing at independently rotating wheels. Therefore, a railway <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> with independently rotating wheels needs an additional system to ensure a good dynamic behaviour. This {{can be done by}} a mechatronic system that detects the lateral position of each wheel pair and controls the wheel rotation speed. The single axle <b>running</b> <b>gears</b> of the DLR Next Generation Train (NGT) are planned with independently rotating wheels. The necessary research issues for a realisation of the mechatronic track guidance for the NGT, a first <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> design and a MBS simulation study of the <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> are presented...|$|R
40|$|The DLR {{internal}} project “Next Generation Train” (NGT) {{deals with}} a high-speed train in a double-deck configuration. To realize the two continuous floors, a single wheel <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> configuration is selected. Equipped with independently rotating wheels instead of a usual wheel-set, a track guidance control becomes necessary. In terms of an advanced control and observer development the implementation of validated simulation models is absolutely essential. Therefore, the paper gives a short overview of the hardware of the scaled Experimental <b>Running</b> <b>Gear</b> on the DLR roller rig representing the NGT single wheel <b>running</b> <b>gear.</b> Using the DLR RailwayDynamics Library three different models of the <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> are implemented, which vary in complexity {{and can be used}} for different analysis methods. Finally, some significant simulation results of the particular simulation models are presented and discussed...|$|R

The current vehicle, introduced in November 2003, is the Eagle IV, {{which is based on}} the Duro IIIP chassis. The original MOWAG Eagle used the chassis and <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> of the American Humvee, while the Eagle II and Eagle III use the chassis and <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> of the Humvee ECV. A Prototype is now part of the Military Museum Full. The MOWAG Eagle IV and V used the chassis and <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> of the Mowag Duro.|$|R

40|$|<b>Running</b> <b>gears</b> with {{independently}} rotating {{wheels are}} a major issue of the DLR longterm research project ”Next Generation Train”. This concept relies on mechatronic track guidance and on an appropriate control design. To this aim, a development environment has been implemented that consists of a scaled experimental <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> in hardware and associated simulation models that consider several levels of details, each tailored for a specific step of the control elaboration. The model based control synthesis covers a feed-forward control exploiting the inversion of a non-linear plant model, a Kalman filter that is implemented taking measurement noise into account, and robust state feedback control using gain scheduling in order to stabilize the <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> dynamics. The paper introduces the experimental <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> hardware, reports on the used models, comments on control synthesis steps and finally presents simulation results in order to demonstrate {{the properties of the}} designed control...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} Ford P100 Pickups {{which have been}} {{modified}} by their owners. The <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> from any Sierra and certain <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> from the Ford Granada can fitted {{to the front of}} the P100. The rear suspension is vehicle specific, with the Capri/Mk1/2 Escort atlas axles being interchangeable, however it requires much more modification (other than simply bolting in) to fit Sierra independent or any other rear <b>running</b> <b>gear.</b> Many modifiers have converted their P100 to Sierra XR/Cosworth drivetrain and <b>running</b> <b>gear.</b> The very fact that they are so easily modified under the bonnet and inside the cab has made the P100 extremely popular in modifying and cruise circles. The Cosworth BOA 24v and YB 16v engines are a popular choice with the YB offering tuning potential for a price while the BOA boasts unbeatable reliability and an astonishing engine note. Rover and Ford V8's are also a common swap, the former being the same weight as the Pinto unit.|$|R

50|$|Beneath the {{carriage}} body is the undergear or undercarriage (or simply carriage), {{consisting of the}} <b>running</b> <b>gear</b> and chassis. The wheels and axles, in distinction from the body, are the <b>running</b> <b>gear.</b> The wheels revolve upon bearings or a spindle {{at the ends of}} a bar or beam called an axle or axletree. Most carriages have either one or two axles. On a four-wheeled vehicle, the forward part of the <b>running</b> <b>gear,</b> or forecarriage, is arranged to permit the front axle to turn independently of the fixed rear axle. In some carriages a 'dropped axle', bent twice at a right angle near the ends, allows a low body with large wheels. A guard called a dirtboard keeps dirt from the axle arm.|$|R
