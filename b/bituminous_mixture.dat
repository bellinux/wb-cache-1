Eleven larger reinforced concrete bridges and several full or half viaducts were specially designed for the Multnomah County portion of the highway, taking the road over streams or along steep hillsides with a minimum of earthmoving. Masonry was used for retaining walls, which kept the highway from falling off the hillside, and guard walls, which kept drivers and pedestrians from falling off the road. At Oneonta Bluff, the highway passed through the first of five tunnels, as the land to the north was taken by the rail line. With the completion of the Oneonta Tunnel and a number of bridges, the road was open to traffic west of Warrendale, near Horsetail Falls, by October 1914.

[...] Also, the rapid application of roofing underlay protects the roof deck during construction until the roofing material is applied and is required for roofs required to meet Underwriters Laboratory (UL) fire ratings. The separation of the roof covering from the roof deck protects the roof covering from resins in some sheathing materials and cushions unevenness and old nails and splinters in re-roofing applications. The underlayment also sheds water, which penetrates the roof covering from an ordinary leak, a leak from wind-driven rain or snow, wind damage to the roof covering, or ice dams. However, the application of underlays may increase the roof temperature, which {{is the leading cause of}} ageing of asphalt shingles and felt paper wrinkles when it gets wet, which (rarely) shows through asphalt shingles.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of bituminous mixtures {{depend on the}} adhesion between mastic and aggregate, {{as well as on}} the cohesion within the mastic. These properties vary as a function of the composition of the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture,</b> of the chemical and physical features of the aggregate and bitumen and of the condition under which the mixing is carried out. It is thus fundamental to develop an adhesion test, which is of easy execution and, at the same time, represents correctly the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixture</b> and its mechanical behaviour, essentially the aggregate-mastic adhesion. The test described here simulates the behaviour of a small representative specimen of the bituminous material subject to increasing tension or shear force, inducing rupture of the aggregate-mastic bond. The specimens have a prismatic shape and comprise a single large piece of aggregate between two layers of mastic. The efficiency of the aggregate-mastic bond will be evaluated by the necessary force to rupture the specimen and by the form of rupture.

For single load application tests, stress-strain relationships of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> were investigated under various loading conditions at various temperatures, and, at the same time, dynamic responses under repeated applications of load and fatigue properties of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> were investigated. For conventional <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures,</b> {{it was found that}} strain at failure was in the order of 10 ^[- 5] to 10 ^[- 2], depending upon the loading and temperature conditions. In {{spite of the fact that}} strain at failure in the single load application test was in the order of 10 ^[- 3] to 10 ^[- 2], it was shown that the strain level of 10 ^[- 4] and 10 ^[- 5] in the repeated applications of load and temperature conditions caused fatigue failure. Most of single load application tests were carried out by means of flexure; and the mode of failure, relationships between strength vs. temperature, strain at failure vs. temperature, and stiffness at failure vs. temperature were obtained; and convergence of the strain in ductile failure zone, (2 ~ 5) × 10 ^[- 2], and in the brittle failure zone, (1 ~ 2) × 10 ^[- 3], was obtained. As a result of beam flexure tests, the movement of the transition point at which the mode of failure showed a change in the mode from brittle to ductile was observed. It was found that the movement depended upon the rate of strain, binder content, and type of mixture, but failure strains at transition points converged to 4 × 10 ^[- 3] to 6 × 10 ^[- 3], independently of the type of binder, rate of strain etc. The effects of rate of strain, binder content, type of mixture and type of binder on rheological properties (strength, strain at failure etc.) of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> were investigated.

40|$|In my diploma thesis I {{dealt with}} the use of black steel slag in road construction. In the {{introductory}} part of my work I discussed the general characteristics of the materials used in road construction and later on in the paper I focused exclusively on black steel slag. I described the history of the use of slag in the construction industry, various types of iron and steel slags, and the processing of black and white steel slag. I was interested in positive and negative characteristics of slag and its influence on the properties of asphalt roads. In exploring these properties I used technical articles from Slovenia as well as from abroad and they were of tremendous help to me. In addition, I described and analyzed the good practices from Germany, Great Britain and Croatia. The main part of the thesis was the analysis of the results of bituminous mixes with the slag grains. Data were acquired in the company Gorenjska gradbena družba (hereinafter GGD) and its subsidiary Cestno podjetje Kranj. I separated the data into two groups. In the first set, I compared and analyzed <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> with natural eruptive and carbonate grains and grains of slag. In the second part I dealt with <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> with grains of slag, for which I used two different types of bitumen. In both sets I analyzed the basic properties of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> and properties of the mixture resistance to permanent transformation. In the conclusion of the thesis I checked the differences between the prices of different <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{blistering}} {{phenomenon is}} one of the major damages in bituminous pavement during a hot summer. The phenomenon was believed to be caused by water permeating from outside via channels of connected pores in <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures.</b> However, the surface course in bituminous pavement is not permeable to water, particularly near the blistering area. Therefore, permeation of liquid water is unlikely to be responsible for the water accumulation that causes the blistering phenomenon. Moisture vapor in the air is important in water intrusion into <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures.</b> This study examined moisture transfer mechanisms in bituminous pavements, focusing on the coefficient of permeability of pavement mixtures of both liquid water and humid air (i. e. air containing water vapor). ブリスタリング現象は，夏季の特に暑い時期に生じるアスファルト舗装の主要な損傷の一つである。この現象は，アスファルト混合物中の連続空隙を通して外部から浸入した雨水が原因であるとされてきた。しかしながら，アスファルト舗装の表層，特にブリスタリング等の損傷が生じる箇所周辺は不透水である。つまり，ブリスタリング現象を引き起こす滞留水の要因として，液体状態での水の浸透は考えにくい。著者らは，大気中の湿気が水蒸気として透過し結露することが舗装体内への水分浸入の鍵を握る現象であることを既報で指摘した。本研究では，アスファルト舗装混合物中の水分移動機構の検討として，水および湿潤空気の透過係数に注目することにより，ブリスタリング現象において鍵となる水分浸入の要因を実験検討した研究成果を報告する...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{need for}} high quality <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> in road construction, {{rehabilitation}} and maintenance is currently satisfied {{by means of}} techniques to produce polymer-modified bitumen, or {{by the addition of}} additives to mixtures during in-plant mixing operations. A rigorous rheological approach {{in the study of the}} bitumen modification process enables researchers to rationally compare different modifying agents and to evaluate their relative efficiency for specific field applications. As far as additives are concerned, the binder is not the only element involved in the evaluation; both binding mastics and <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures</b> must be evaluated to get a complete understanding of the characteristics. Moreover, the advantages that may stem from the use of fibers should be carefully taken into consideration since they may offer alternative strategies for the enhancement of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixtures.</b> As a result of these observations, the authors have devised an experimental research project focused on the analysis of the effects of different types and dosages of cellulose-based fibers on the main performance-related properties of bituminous road materials: compaction properties, volumetric characteristics and mechanical performance. This paper provides an overview of the results obtained and some details of the specific protocols followed during the research project...|$|R
