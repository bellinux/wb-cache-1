5|$|Markov {{processes}} are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, {{that have the}} Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process. In other words, {{the behavior of the}} process in the future is stochastically independent of its <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, given {{the current state of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be counter-intuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.|$|E

40|$|A Eulerian-Eulerian model {{incorporating}} the kinetic theory of granular flow is adopted {{to describe the}} gas-solid two-phase flows in a multizone circulating propylene polymerization reactor. Corresponding simulations are carried out in a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Fluent. First, the model is validated by comparing simulation results with the experimental data. Entire fields <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reactor composed of a riser and a downer are also obtained numerically. Furthermore, the model is used to distinguish <b>the</b> flow <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> riser and the downer. The effects of riser-outlet configuration and operation gas velocity on <b>the</b> flow <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reactor are also investigated numerically. The simulated results show that <b>the</b> flow <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> riser of MZCR {{are different from those}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> downer of MZCR. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> simulation results also show that both the exit configuration of the riser and the operation gas velocity can significantly affect <b>the</b> flow <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MZCR.

The black-throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue warbler requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining.|$|E

5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though her <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer and fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she}} had come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E

5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E
5|$|Many Massachusetts {{residents}} of the time perceived the quake as punishment from God for immoral <b>behavior.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> days after the earthquake, special prayer services were held and civic authorities declared fast days. A number of sermons and other writings were published as a consequence, including Jeremiah Newland's Verses Occasioned by the Earthquakes in the Month of November, 1755 and Thomas Prince's Earthquakes the Works of God and Tokens of his Just Displeasure. Not all explanations of the event were theological; John Winthrop, a Harvard professor, proposed an alternate explanation {{having to do with}} heat and chemical vapors inside the surface of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Paulo {{was written}} to be unlikable, {{with the hope}} he would redeem himself when his backstory was {{revealed}} in his final episode. Paulo either resents or is indifferent toward the often heroic actions {{of some of the}} survivors, spending much of his time golfing. He complains to Nikki about not being included; however, he does little to help out around the camp and does not try to improve his status in the survivors' hierarchy. When he does get chances to participate in treks, for example, when Hurley finds a car, Paulo is uninterested and discourages Nikki from joining Hurley on his adventure. Nikki tries to participate, tending to a wounded Mr. Eko and volunteering to go with Locke to the Pearl station, much to the surprise of Paulo. Paulo accompanies her, and he exhibits a constant sarcastic <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pearl.|$|E

5|$|Speculation on the pack-hunting {{habits of}} Albertosaurus {{were made by}} a few {{researchers}} who suggest that the younger members of the pack may {{have been responsible for}} driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower. Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator niches between those of the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than an adult Albertosaurus in mass. However, as the preservation of <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. Phil Currie speculates that the Daspletosaurus formed packs to hunt, although this cannot be stated with certainty. There is no evidence of such gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual <b>Behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E

5|$|The pudú is {{a solitary}} animal whose <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild is largely unknown {{because of its}} secretive nature. Pudús are crepuscular, most active in the morning, late afternoon, and evening. Their home range {{generally}} extends about , much of which consists of crisscrossing pudú-trodden paths. Each pudú has its own home range, or territory. A single animal's territory is marked with sizable dung piles found on paths and near eating and resting areas. Large facial glands for scent communication allow correspondence with other pudú deer. Pudús do not interact socially, other than to mate. An easily frightened animal, the deer barks when in fear. Its fur bristles and the pudú shivers when angered.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{feeding behavior}} of individuals of Herichthys minckleyi, the Cuatro Ciénegas cichlid, under laboratory conditions and freely behaving {{in their natural}} environment using high-speed video imaging. In a multivariate analysis of suction feeding behaviors there was no clear grouping of feeding events based on the environment, which suggests that most of <b>the</b> variability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> data was unrelated to differences between lab and field <b>behaviors.</b> <b>In</b> fact, <b>the</b> variability within an environment was far greater than the variability between the two environments. These results suggest that laboratory studies can accurately describe the kinematics of <b>behaviors</b> seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. However, although lab based studies can quantify <b>behaviors</b> seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field, natural habitats are complex and provide individuals {{with the opportunity to}} exploit a wide range of food types and microhabitats, which may elicit <b>behaviors</b> not observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory. However, feeding <b>behaviors</b> observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lab are representative of frequently used feeding <b>behaviors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field, at least for this species. Thus, we suggest that laboratory studies of feeding behavior, particularly those that test biomechanical or performance-based hypotheses can be extrapolated to natural environments...|$|R
