50|$|By {{adjusting}} the window where the Doppler shift is calculated, {{it is possible}} to measure the relative velocity between the instrument and the bottom. This feature is referred to as bottom-track. The process has two parts; first identify the position of the bottom from the acoustic echo, then calculating the velocity from a window centered around the bottom position. When an ADCP is mounted on a moving ship, the <b>bottom</b> <b>track</b> velocity may be subtracted from the measured water velocity. The result is the net current profile. <b>Bottom</b> <b>track</b> provides the foundation for surveys of the water currents in coastal areas. In deep water where the acoustic signals cannot reach the bottom, the ship velocity is estimated from a more complex combination of velocity and heading information from GPS, gyro, etc.|$|E

The acoustical backscatter intensity of the ADCP’s are commonly used to estimate the suspended sediment load. When the measurement platform with down-looking ADCP is kept stationary, the <b>bottom</b> <b>tracking</b> measurement principle {{can be used to}} detect and estimate the bed load transport. However, the measurements of the <b>bottom</b> <b>tracking</b> is experimental. To assess the uncertainty of these measurements, a flume (W = 1. 2 m, L = 25 m and H ADCP's (different types) are installed above the sand bed. Measurements of bed load transport velocity from the <b>bottom</b> <b>tracking</b> feature are performed. Different settings of the instruments are tested and compared, together with a range of flow regimes. Also optical measuring techniques (camera’s, turbidity sensor) are used, both down-looking and side-looking. The side-looking cameras are installed to map the depth (and also velocity) of the mobile layer above the bed. Down-looking cameras are installed to look in a restricted view area to follow the individual sediment grains in the bottom-top layer. Combining, the pictures with PIV or PTV algorithms, the velocity of the individual sediment grains can be detected. The different measurement techniques are compared...|$|R
40|$|When {{a survey}} area is {{populated}} with biological growth such as kelp and seagrass, the range performance of lidar is challenged. Aquatic vegetation {{can lead to}} bottom miss-tracking or even absence of the optical signal return. The former results in shoal biased soundings; the latter results in datagaps.

With ground truthing data (e. g. underwater photography, acoustics) vegetation presence or tracking of mid-water vegetation can be identified, although these datasets are commonly not available during a lidar survey. Incorporating characterized SHOALS 3000 green laser waveform data yields a method to validate lidar soundings.

50|$|The {{new designs}} were successful, but they {{introduced}} many challenges, {{especially as the}} availability of experienced track maintenance staff became acutely difficult, and poorly maintained flat <b>bottom</b> <b>track</b> seemed more difficult to keep in good order than poorly maintained bullhead track. The greater stiffness of flat-bottom was an advantage, but it tended to straighten out between the joints on curves; and flat bottom’s rigidity led to high vertical impact forces at badly maintained joints and this resulted in high volumes of fatigue fractures at the joints. Moreover, the elastic rail fastenings had little resistance to rail creep - the propensity of the rails to move gradually {{in the direction of}} traffic, and the workload of pulling back the rails to regulate the joints was surprisingly high.|$|E
40|$|Moving bottom bias in {{acoustic}} Doppler current profiler (ADCP) bottom tracking {{has been}} used as an estimate of apparent bedload velocity (Rennie et al., 2002). However, it remains unknown if the apparent bedload velocity is an unbiased estimate of average bedload particle velocity. This paper presents a controlled laboratory calibration of ADCP bedload velocity, which was performed in the Main Test Channel at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory as part of the National Centre for Earth-Surface Dynamics SedT project. The length of the sediment-recirculating mobile bed test section was 20 m. Both sand-bed (d 50 = 0. 98 mm) and gravel-bed (d 50 = 11. 06 mm) bedload transport experiments were conducted, with five flow rates tested for each sediment. <b>Bottom</b> <b>track</b> data were collected with both 600 and 1200 kHz Rio Grande ADCPs, and over a range of <b>bottom</b> <b>track</b> pulse lengths (&R 20 to &R 40). Actual bedload transport rates were measured using (1) conventional samplers, (2) five automatic weigh pans spread across the channel {{at the end of the}} test section, (3) dune tracking by means of eight sonars, and (4) high speed digital videography. In this paper, measured apparent bedload velocity is compared to bedload transport rate from the weigh pans and dune tracking. In addition, the influence of <b>bottom</b> <b>track</b> pulse length and operating frequency on measured bedload velocity is assessed. The results show correlation between ADCP bottom tracking and measured bedload transport rates, with coefficient of determination (r 2) ranging from 0. 59 to 0. 93 with RMSE (root mean square error) ranging from 0. 059 m/s to 0. 106 m/s for sand bed. For the gravel bed, correlation was found between capture rates and dune tracking with r 2 0. 52 to 0. 97; however, the results were scattered. Initial experimental test results verified that moving bottom bias in acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) bottom tracking can be used as an estimate of bedload velocity. A comparison was achieved successfully with measured flux of capture rates and dune tracking transport rates. The preliminary results were promising for sand bed experiments; however for gravel bed it appears that the flow depths were insufficient for the operation of ADCP...|$|E

40|$|Acoustic Doppler {{instruments}} {{measure the}} velocity of water relative to the instrument (relative water velocity). To obtain the true water velocity in a stream when the instrument is mounted onto a boat, the instrument must accurately measure the speed {{and direction of the}} boat and correct the relative water velocity for the boat motion. Boat speed and direction usually are measured by means of <b>bottom</b> <b>tracking.</b> <b>Bottom</b> <b>tracking</b> uses acoustic pulses to measure the boat velocity relative to the streambed, similar to those used to measure the water velocity. This technique can be accurate and is resistant to errors in the internal compass of the instrument; however, streams often transport fine sediments and sand as suspended load near the streambed or as bed load. During flood flows streams may transport appreciable volumes of larger sediments. The acoustic Doppler instrument measures a “moving bed ” when the transported sediment causes a Doppler shift in the bottom-tracking pulses. This moving-bed condition will cause the instrument to measure an upstream boat velocity greater than the true boat velocity. When this boat velocity is used to correct the relative water velocity, it results i...|$|R

40|$|Maps of {{apparent}} bedload velocity are presented along with maps of associated channel change. Apparent bedload velocity is the bias in acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) <b>bottom</b> <b>track</b> (Doppler sonar) due to near-bed particle motion (Rennie et al. 2002). The apparent bedload velocity is correlated to bedload transport (Rennie and Villard 2004), and thus {{serves as an}} indicator of local bedload transport. Spatially distributed aDcp surveys in a river reach can be used to generate maps of channel bathymetry, water velocity, bed shear stress, and apparent bedload velocity (Rennie and Church 2010). It is possible to relate the observed spatial patterns of bedload and forcing flow. In this paper, the technique is used to measure bedload flux pathways during two sequential aDcp spatial surveys conducted in a Rees River, New Zealand braid bar diffluence-confluence before and after a major flood event that inundated the entire braid plain. The aDcp surveys were complemented with terrestrial laser scans (TLS) of the bar topography. Linking aDcp bathymetry and TLS topography allowed for generation of complete digitial elevation models (DEMs) of the reach, from which morphological change between surveys were determined. Most intriguingly, the primary bedload pathway observed during the first survey resulted in sufficient deposition during the major flood event to fill and choke off an anabranch. This is perhaps the first direct field measurement of spatially distributed bedload and corresponding morphological change...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 A moored oceanographic array was {{deployed}} on the Beaufort Sea {{continental slope}} from August 2008 -August 2009 to measure Arctic sea ice near-inertial motion {{in response to}} rapidly changing wind stress. Upward looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers detected sea ice and measured ice drift {{using a combination of}} <b>bottom</b> <b>track</b> and error velocity. An analysis of in-situ mooring data in conjunction with data from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis suggest that many high and low pressure systems cross the Beaufort in winter, but not all of these create a near-inertial ice response. Two unusually strong low pressure systems that passed near the array in December 2008 and February/March 2009 were accompanied by elevated levels of near-inertial kinetic energy in the ice. The analysis suggests pressure systems which have a diameter to ground track velocity ratio close to 3 / 4 of the local inertial period can excite a large near-inertial response in the sea ice. It is conjectured that this results from the combined effect of resonance arising from similar intrinsic timescales of the storm and the local inertial period and from stresses that are able to overcome the damping of sea ice arising from ice-mechanics and damping in the ice-ocean boundary layer. Those systems whose intrinsic times scales do not approach resonance with the local inertial period did not excite a large near- inertial response in the sea ice. From an analysis of two storms in February 2009, and two in December 2008, it appears that wind stresses associated with previous low pressure systems preconditioned the ice pack, allowing for larger near-inertial response during subsequent events...|$|E

40|$|Water Column imaging, using hydrographic-grade multibeam echo {{sounders}} is {{now available}} commercially. Such a capability was originally developed primarily for fisheries imaging, but provides significant advantages for hydrographic data quality control. Most immediately apparent {{is the ability to}} view the near 2 -D scattering field around wrecks or other man-made objects. Robust <b>bottom</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithms have to be optimized for likely seabed geometry. To avoid excessive outlier density, mistracking on spurious echoes is often discouraged by the use of gating or neighbour-proximity rules. Such methods, however, can fail spectacularly on abrupt non-continuous surfaces, commonly found over submerged man-made structures like wrecks or oil and gas infrastructure. These structures are often unsuspected and imaged only in a random pass of a regular survey. Based on prior experience, the least depth determination is often questionable from the real-time <b>bottom</b> <b>tracking</b> solutions. The main submerged superstructure is usually apparent but concern over protruding features can result in the need for bar or wire sweep investigations. Nevertheless, if the complete water-column trace from each beam is retained it is possible to review the full volume of scattering targets {{in the vicinity of the}} suspected object during post-mission feature examination. The interpretation of such imagery is prone to error unless the operator fully comprehends the imaging geometry. Particularly significant is the role of sidelobe echoes, both from the transmit and receive beams, producing secondary, ghost-like targets in the vicinity of point scattering features, such as masts or abrupt hull forms. This paper will review the imaging geometry and resulting scattering field that would be produced by such targets.

Fülöp and Dubina (2004) tested three X-braced screw-connected wall specimens (3.6  m long ×  2.44  m high) under in-plane lateral loading. Of the three wall specimens, one was tested monotonically and two cyclically. The walls were constructed of a cold-formed steel frame. The screw connection configuration was selected to facilitate yielding {{along the length of the}} brace, i.e., to avoid net section fracture of the strap through the screw holes. Chord members were constructed of double stud members, such that inelastic deformations and ultimate failure of the walls would be limited to the braces. U profiles were placed in the tracks at corner locations to increase the hold-down capacity and rigidity. Local buckling of the lower track was observed during loading with damage being concentrated in corner areas. Plastic elongation of the strap did take place; however because of the unexpected failure of the corners, the results of the experiments may not necessarily reflect the true ductility of a braced wall if yielding (and failure) had been limited to the straps. Fülöp and Dubina suggested that the ideal configuration of the corners would be such that the uplift force is directly transmitted from the brace or corner stud to the anchoring bolt, without inducing bending in the <b>bottom</b> <b>track.</b> Failure to strengthen the corners can have a significant effect on the initial rigidity of the system and can be the cause of larger than expected in-plane shear deformations of the wall and premature failure of the braced frame.|$|E

This study addresses these limitations by (i) developing a heading sensor integration algorithm that corrects compass errors from magnetic interference, (ii) testing a Total Station based technique for spatial ADCP data referencing and (iii) evaluating a recently proposed data processing technique that reduces bias from spatial flow heterogeneity. The integration of these techniques on a radio control ADCP platform is illustrated downstream of a weir with fish pass on the River Severn, UK.
