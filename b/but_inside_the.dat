5|$|Some {{nucleic acids}} of RNA viruses {{function}} directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses. In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses {{rely on the}} cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called negative-sense RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production {{is similar to that}} of the cell. The species of viruses called retroviruses behave completely differently: they have RNA, <b>but</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.|$|E
5|$|In 1709, {{the main}} fort at Viborg {{consisted}} of five frontal bastions named Holtz, Neuport, Klein-Platform, Wasserport and Eleonora, connected by the Viborg town wall, {{in the eastern}} section of the town. The {{western part of the}} town, connected to the main section, had three bastions named Valport, Pansarlax, and Europa. To the west of the wall between Pansarlax and Europa, there was a ravelin and two caponiers, and {{to the west of the}} wall between Evrop and Eleonora was another ravelin. Both ravelins were, apparently, earthen, <b>but</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> main eastern fort, all structures were stone. Most of the structures in the western part of the fort were wooden, with the exception of the stone guard tower, named the Petersburg tower. Separate from these fortifications, on the small central island east of the town (now the Zamochnyy Island), was Schloss (Castle) Viborg, which stands to this day. The fort had 151 guns at its defense.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{received}} NC State's kickoff {{and returned}} it to their 25-yard line, where Tech's offense returned to the field. After picking up short yardage on two rushing plays, Tech quarterback Erik Chapman completed a pass to tight end Steve Johnson to give the Hokies a first down at their 48-yard line with just over four minutes {{to go in the}} quarter. Tech continued to drive into Wolfpack territory, <b>but</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> NC State 35-yard line, Tech committed a 15-yard illegal block penalty that pushed the Hokies back to the Wolfpack 47-yard line and had them facing a first down and 25 yards. Though unable to gain the 25 yards needed for another first down, Tech did make up most of the penalty yards, putting the ball at the Wolfpack 30-yard line. Facing fourth down, Tech sent in kicker Chris Kinzer to attempt a 46-yard field goal, which was successfully completed. The score gave Tech a 107 lead with 1:06 remaining the first quarter.|$|E

2500|$|The new DAB+ {{standard}} has incorporated Reed-Solomon ECC as an [...] "inner layer" [...] of coding that {{is placed}} around the byte interleaved audio frame <b>but</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> [...] "outer layer" [...] of convolutional coding {{used by the}} older DAB system, although on DAB+ the convolutional coding uses equal error protection (EEP) rather than UEP since each bit is equally important in DAB+. This combination of Reed-Solomon coding as the inner layer of coding, followed by an outer layer of convolutional coding – so-called [...] "concatenated coding" [...] – became a popular ECC scheme in the 1990s, and NASA adopted it for its deep-space missions. One slight difference between the concatenated coding used by the DAB+ system and that used on most other systems is that it uses a rectangular byte interleaver rather than Forney interleaving {{in order to provide}} a greater interleaver depth, which increases the distance over which error bursts will be spread out in the bit-stream, which in turn will allow the Reed-Solomon error decoder to correct a higher proportion of errors.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Chiefs {{loss to the}} New York Jets in the 2007 season finale, {{general manager}} Carl Peterson {{announced}} that both he and head coach Herman Edwards {{would return to the}} Chiefs in 2008.

Hunt spoke out weeks later and stated that the Chiefs were his [...] "No. 1 priority" [...] and that [...] "to have the best chance of success in 2008, having Carl here makes a lot of sense.” Hunt wanted to avoid having a new general manager come in with a new head coach, and starting from scratch again.

2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} first {{election}} win in 1995, Mike Harris faced his first crisis as Premier.

In the inquiry following the shooting, {{it was determined that}} while some protesters were carrying rocks, sticks and baseball bats, none were carrying firearms.

[...] The government and the OPP maintained that there was no political involvement in the shooting, <b>but</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Legislature where Parliamentary privilege outweighs any civil claims, several opposition politicians suggested that the attack may have been ordered by the Premier's office, and called for an independent judicial inquiry. In a court case that went all the way the Supreme Court of Canada, Deane maintained that he was not under orders to shoot and was convicted of criminal negligence causing death. An inquiry, headed by commissioner Justice Sidney Linden, was called after the government of Dalton McGuinty was elected in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|The boiler resembled two {{elongated}} marine Yarrow boilers, placed end to end. Both had {{the usual}} Yarrow arrangement {{of a central}} large steam drum above two separated water drums, linked by four rows of slightly curved tubes. The upper drum was shared, but the lower water drums were separate. The rearward [...] "firebox" [...] area was wide and spanned the frames, placing the water drums at {{the limits of the}} loading gauge. The forward [...] "boiler" [...] region was narrow-set, with its water drums placed between the frames. Although the outer casings were of similar width, the tube banks for the forward section were much closer. The space outboard of the tubes formed a pair of exhaust flues leading forwards. A large space outside these flue walls <b>but</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> boiler casing was used as an air duct from the air inlet, a crude rectangular slot beneath the smokebox door, which had the effect of both pre-heating the combustion air and of cooling the outer casing to prevent overheating. Longitudinal superheater tubes were placed in the central space between the steam generating tubes. The third area forwards contained superheater headers, the regulators and the smokebox, but no deliberate heating surface. The external boiler casing remained at much the same width throughout, giving an overall triangular, but curved, appearance. The lower edge of each section stepped upwards, and was obvious externally.|$|E
