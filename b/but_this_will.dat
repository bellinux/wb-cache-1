5|$|The {{cloud cover}} {{is such that}} typical surface light levels are similar to a partly cloudy day on Earth, around 5000–10000 lux. The {{equivalent}} visibility is about three kilometers, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> likely vary with the wind conditions. Little to no solar energy could conceivably be collected by solar panels on a surface probe. In fact, due to the thick, highly reflective cloud cover, the total solar energy received by {{the surface of the}} planet is less than that of the Earth.|$|E

25|$|Initially, it {{was thought}} that the wolf and moose populations would reach a stable balance, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> no longer be possible. During the nearly sixty years of the study, the populations of both species have fluctuated up and down with the number of moose ranging from a high of nearly 2500 down to 500 and the number of wolves ranging from a high of 50 down to 2 in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The second defender is for {{security}} {{if the first}} defender is passed. In that case, he takes over as first defender, and ideally one of the third defenders takes over as second defender. The team should be organised in a manner to make this transition as fast as possible. The typical ideal distance between the second and first defender is about six metres, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> vary strongly from situation to situation. The most important factor is the opponent's speed. If he's moving fast, the distance should be longer. If he's standing still, the second and first defender may in some cases join forces and work as two first defenders.|$|E

25|$|Diatoms should {{normally}} {{never be}} present in human tissue unless water was aspirated, and their presence in tissues such as bone marrow suggests drowning, however, they are present in soil and the atmosphere and samples may easily be contaminated. An absence of diatoms does not rule out drowning, as they are not always present in water. A match of diatom shells {{to those found in}} the water may provide supporting evidence of the place of death. Drowning in salt water can leave significantly different concentrations of sodium and chloride ions in the left and right chambers of the heart, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> dissipate if the person survived for some time after the aspiration, or if CPR was attempted, and have been described in other causes of death.|$|E
25|$|For {{this reason}} {{the scope of}} implied {{licenses}} is strictly limited in New Zealand. The Supreme Court has said an implied license is unlikely to exist if {{the purpose of the}} entry was not to make a reasonable inquiry or if it cannot be assumed that the occupier would have consented to the police entering had they known the particular purpose for the entry. An implied license can extend to allow entry into a private premises in certain circumstances <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> be in the minority of cases and there will generally be no right of access even where, for example, the door to the premises is open. An implied license can be revoked by the occupier through a clear unequivocal revocation, further, the existence of gates or signs may amount to a physical revocation.|$|E
25|$|A {{inverter}} or capsizing {{line can}} {{be attached to the}} top of the bag. This line should be long enough and strong enough to attach to an independent anchor point so that if the lift bag or rigging fails the bag will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally hold the bag in the upright position, so the tripping line may be subjected to considerable load and the bag may not invert. An inverter line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize the bag if it breaks free of the load, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> not stop a runaway lift, and a holdback line is used for this purpose.|$|E

Although stressing that the form {{was the only}} type of poetry Coleridge created, he admitted that [...] "the name is both convenient and misleading. A conversation is an exchange; and these poems, a dozen or fewer, stretching from 'The Eolian Harp' [...] to 'To William Wordsworth] [...] and perhaps further, are plainly monologues.

500|$|Lycoperdon pulcherrimum {{closely resembles}} L.echinatum, but its spines are stouter, do not turn brown in age, {{and the surface}} of the fruit body {{underneath}} the spines is smooth, not pitted. Alexander H. Smith noted that in youth, they are [...] "difficult if not impossible to distinguish from each other, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> cause no inconvenience to those collecting for the table, since both are edible." [...] In some areas the two species appear to intergrade, as specimens may be found whose spines turn brown but do not fall off. Young specimens of L.pedicellatum may also be difficult to distinguish from L.echinatum, but the former [...] has a smooth outer surface when mature, and has spores attached to a pedicel (a narrow extension of the basidium on which the sterigmata and spores are formed) that is [...] about 4–5 times as long as the spore. Lycoperdon compactum, found only in New Zealand, also resembles L.echinatum in appearance, but differs in having smaller spores, capillitia that are hyaline (translucent) and septate (with partitions that divide the capillitia into compartments).|$|E
500|$|The player's avatar is {{represented}} by a simple square shape that can move within and between rooms, each represented by a single screen. While Robinett originally intended for all rooms to be bidirectionally connected, a few such connections (including one inside the White Castle) were unidirectional, which he considered to be bugs. [...] Such problems were explained away as [...] "bad magic" [...] in the game's manual. The player's goal is to find objects to help defeat the dragons and recover the Chalice. These include various keys that open the castles, a magnet that pulls items towards the player, a magic bridge that the player can use to cross certain obstacles, and a sword {{which can be used}} to defeat the dragons. Only one object can be carried at a time. The player can be eaten by a dragon if it is caught in its [...] "bite" [...] cycle, at which point the avatar is stuck in the dragon's stomach. At this point, the player can opt to restore their avatar's life instead of completely restarting the game, reappearing at the Golden Castle while leaving all objects where they were last left, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> also regenerate any dragon previously killed as well. The ability to reset the player's avatar without resetting the entire game is considered the first known [...] "continue game" [...] option in video games.|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy's Lewis Corner {{gave the}} song a four (out of five)-star rating, and wrote that its {{production}} {{was of a}} [...] "summer anthem level". Corner said the track felt [...] "slightly lighter" [...] than Azalea's previous releases, adding: [...] "... but if it means she crosses over into superstardom territory, it's a job well done". While Robert Copsey of the same website believed that it [...] "felt like a somewhat needless moment of pop frivolity". Complex reviewers were also divided; Brian Josephs considered the track a [...] " [...] club banger", but David Drake criticized Azalea's [...] "nimble rapping and forced accent". According to Drake, [...] " [...] {{is the kind of}} thing that might work in the UK, where a digitally-animated frog once had a No. 1 hit with a cover of the theme to Beverly Hills Cop, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> probably be a long shot at getting stateside club play". John Robinson of The Guardian felt it was [...] "second-division" [...] and [...] "sheeeeeit". Karen Lawler of Blues & Soul opined that it recalled [...] "a lost track" [...] from Miley Cyrus' 2013 album, Bangerz, and dismissed its [...] "nod" [...] to 2 Unlimited as [...] "cringe worthy". While Clash called [...] "Bounce" [...] an inferior version of [...] "No Limit" [...] and [...] "criminal in every way", and opined that it lacked tune; [...] "No Auto-Tune, though, because you need a tune to Auto".|$|E
