60|$|After two days' {{walking across}} the plain, they {{felt that there was}} no longer any {{necessity}} for concealment, except that it would be as well to avoid an encounter with any troops.

25|$|The game {{consists}} of multiple chapters, each consisting of several verses. Depending {{on how well}} the player performs, they are given {{one of the following}} medals {{at the end of the}} verse; Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Pure Platinum, similar to the rating system of Viewtiful Joe. There are some medals that are earned off the <b>beaten</b> <b>path,</b> such as special areas with set challenges. At the end of the chapter, a final score and an award is given depending on the type of medals achieved, with the score being deducted for any items used and deaths occurred. In between chapters there is a minigame called Angel Attack, in which players use Arcade Bullets found in the main levels to shoot at angels and earn points. These points can be traded in for items, with any leftover points exchanged for halos.|$|E

The show was well reviewed by Vanity Fair, the Telegraph, and Asia Times Online, and is scheduled to tour in 2017.|$|E
60|$|Much of {{all this}} was due to Miss Stacy's tactful, careful, broadminded guidance. She led her class to think and explore and {{discover}} for themselves and encouraged straying from the old <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> to a degree that quite shocked Mrs. Lynde and the school trustees, who viewed all innovations on established methods rather dubiously.|$|R

"Nature {{made him}} a man {{senseless}} of danger, and that insensibility {{is the best thing}} I have derived from him," [...] said she; [...] "age has left him shrewdness enough to tread his old <b>beaten</b> <b>paths,</b> but not to seek new courses.

5000|$|The proem is a {{narrative}} sequence {{in which the}} narrator travels [...] "beyond the <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> of mortal men" [...] to receive a revelation from an unnamed goddess (generally thought to be Persephone or Dikē) {{on the nature of}} reality. Aletheia, an estimated 90% of which has survived, and doxa, most of which no longer exists, are then presented as the spoken revelation of the goddess without any accompanying narrative.|$|R

However, as his trip progressed, his mood improved, and he became comfortable on the road. Bashō met many friends and grew to enjoy the changing scenery and the seasons.

500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the <b>beaten</b> <b>path,</b> it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E

50|$|He {{lived at}} a time when {{theological}} discussion was rife, when men, weary of treading <b>beaten</b> <b>paths,</b> had set themselves to constructing systems of their own. His zeal, however, for the integrity of Thomistic teaching, and his bitter aversion from doctrinal novelty sometimes carried him beyond the teaching of his master, and led him to adopt opinions on certain questions of theology especially those dealing with predestination and reprobation which were rejected by many learned theologians of his own school.|$|R
60|$|In {{all this}} Phil was greatly {{assisted}} by his sister May, who, although {{not much more}} highly educated than himself, was quick of perception, of an inquiring mind, and a sympathetic soul. He was also somewhat assisted, and, at times, not a little retarded, by his ardent admirer Peter Pax, who joined him enthusiastically in his studies, but, being of a discursive and enterprising spirit, was prone to tempt him off the <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> of learning into the thickets of speculative philosophy.|$|R

60|$|Keogh {{explained}} his project. They were {{to return to}} Coralio, where White was to pose as a distinguished American portrait painter who was touring in the tropics as a relaxation from his arduous and remunerative professional labours. It was not an unreasonable hope, even {{to those who had}} trod in the <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> of business, that an artist with so much prestige might secure a commission to perpetuate upon canvas the lineaments of the president, and secure a share of the pesos that were raining upon the caterers to his weaknesses.|$|R

He was never content to follow the <b>beaten</b> <b>path</b> or to accept the usual interpretations of organic reactions.

2500|$|The {{goals of}} those who {{practice}} the sport vary, but throughout its history, many have seen surfing {{as more than a}} sport, as an opportunity to harness the waves and to relax and forget about their daily routines. Surfers have veered from even this <b>beaten</b> <b>path,</b> and foregone the traditional goals of first world culture in the hunt for a continual '', harmony with life, their surfing, and the ocean. These [...] "Soul Surfers" [...] are a vibrant and long-standing sub-group. Competitive surf culture, centered around surf contests and endorsement deals, and localism's disturbance of the peace, are often seen in opposition to this.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the many}} {{activities}} that can be enjoyed during the summer in Nancy Lake Recreational Area is fishing. Big and Little Noluck lakes are stocked with rainbow trout fry by the Department of Fish and Game. These lakes produce good catches of up to 14-inch fish. Many lakes and ponds in the Lynx Lake Loop have populations of northern pike. You can also fish in the smaller ponds and lakes not directly on the trails, and you can explore off the <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> and find some great fishing. Such as the Lynx Lake Loop canoe an attraction that the area is well known for, the trail travels through an eight-mile chain of lakes. Other activities involve hiking and camping. Winter activities include ice fishing, skiing and dog musshing.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a methodology {{to analyze the}} spatial behavior of tourists based on tracking data. This method was applied during a field study {{in the city of}} Görlitz at the east border of Germany. Based on Global Positioning System (GPS) logs the spatial distribution of visitors in various areas is visualized and analyzed. Using the bimodality of the distribution of walking speeds, areas of slowdown are identified and subsequently clustered into activity areas. Using the activity areas, the amount of time tourists allocate to various activity categories is computed. Furthermore, a subsequent analysis of the activity behavior is used to identify the current visiting pattern of tourists and a network analysis of the identified activity areas is used to locate hubs. The network analysis highlights sequences of sights used very often and therefore identifies the <b>beaten</b> <b>paths...</b>|$|R
2500|$|In February 1924, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} {{that the number of}} feature films produced from the original stories or adaptations of Mr. Sullivan totaled 311 in eight years. [...] The Times noted: [...] "This record undoubtedly is unrivaled among screen authors. [...] Mr. Sullivan's work is all the more remarkable because of the recognition which it has achieved for unvarying quality and variety." [...] At that time, Sullivan described the rule he applied in the selection of a story for the screen:"Is it human, is it true to life, is it sincere? If you can conscientiously satisfy yourself on these things, you won't have to worry as to whether the public will like the story or not. [...] If you are genuinely moved by it, you may be sure that the public will respond in like manner. ...

2500|$|Cousin {{wanted to}} lecture on {{philosophy}} and quickly obtained {{the position of}} master of conferences (maître de conférences) in the school. The second great philosophical impulse of his life was the teaching [...] of Pierre Paul Royer-Collard. This teacher, he tells us, [...] "by the severity of his logic, the gravity and weight of his words, turned me by degrees, and not without resistance, from the <b>beaten</b> <b>path</b> of Condillac into the way which has since become so easy, but which was then painful and unfrequented, that of the Scottish philosophy." [...] The [...] "Scottish Philosophy" [...] being the [...] "Common Sense" [...] Philosophy of Thomas Reid and others - which taught that both the external world and the human mind (introspection proving the existence of [...] "free will" [...] by the fact of consciousness) had an objective existence.

40|$|The {{society should}} {{have a reason to}} support science in the country and it is {{important}} for us to demonstrate by performance the effective role of science in improving the conditions and standards of living. In such planning, we must consider the various possible development alternatives and adopt such policies and programmes as would promote sustainable development. Instead of following <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> defined elsewhere, the Indian situation has to be a prime guiding force. Such a unique Indian approach to development is necessary to reduce unemployment and ensure social justice. Focused research and development, proper institutional mechanisms as well as planned extension and diffusion activities would be required to solve many of the pressing problems mentioned earlier.
