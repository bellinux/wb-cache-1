5|$|If a male is interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side to side, and rubbing his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.|$|E
5|$|The Sammamish River valley {{was settled}} in the late 19th century and served by the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad, built in 1889 from Bothell to North Bend, {{traveling}} through Redmond, Issaquah, Fall City, and Snoqualmie. By 1902, several wagon roads were built along the railroad, including a road between Fall City and North Bend, which was incorporated into the Sunset Highway when it was designated as a state highway in 1909. The road from Redmond to North Bend {{became part of the}} national Yellowstone Trail in the 1910s, including a section near Redmond that was paved with bricks in 1913. A portion of the Yellowstone Trail, along with unpaved roads from Redmond to Bothell, were designated as a state highway in 1925. The highway was paved in the late 1920s, and was incorporated into the Seattle–Fall City branch of the Sunset Highway (Primary State Highway 2) in 1937. After the opening of the North Bend bypass in 1941, the branch highway was extended to North <b>Bend</b> <b>over</b> the former Sunset Highway.|$|E

5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E

25|$|Innovation in milking {{focused on}} mechanizing the milking parlor (known in Australia and New Zealand as a milking shed) to {{maximize}} the number of cows per operator which streamlined the milking process to permit cows to be milked as if on an assembly line, and to reduce physical stresses on the farmer by putting the cows on a platform slightly above the person milking the cows to eliminate having to constantly <b>bend</b> <b>over.</b> Many older and smaller farms still have tie-stall or stanchion barns, but worldwide a majority of commercial farms have parlors.|$|E
25|$|The {{pivoting}} {{part that}} supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs. Using the method often portrayed in movies and television of flipping the cylinder open and closed {{with a flick of}} the wrist can in fact cause the crane to <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> time, throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition, as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel. This gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber, bullet damage, and the potential for an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck.|$|E
25|$|The oldest playing {{style is}} the {{stand-up}} style. In this style, goaltenders are {{to stop the}} puck from a standing position, not going down. The goalies may <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> to stop the puck with their upper body or may kick the puck. Such saves made by kicking are known as kick saves or skate saves. They may also simply use their stick to stop it, known as a stick save. This was the style seen in the early NHL and was most commonly used up until the early 60s. One of the more notable goalies who was last seen using stand up was Bill Ranford, {{but most of the}} goalies from earlier decades such as Jacques Plante were considered pure stand up goalies.|$|E

2500|$|Juries, the brokerages felt, {{could not}} {{understand}} the complexities of securities trading and law as well as arbitrators with experience in the industry. They saw arbitration as cheaper, faster yet still fair. [...] "he industry person is often likely to <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> backward {{in favor of the}} customer," [...] said Edward Morris, director of arbitration for the New York Stock Exchange. More than half the time, the industry said, arbitration panels ruled in the customer's favor.|$|E

2500|$|In 1952–1953, {{while living}} in a burial place called Ghati, Baba Hari Dass {{described}} experience of a legendary Kumoan yogi Hariakhan Baba while staying in a cave in a cold wintertime. While sitting {{by the side of}} the fire he fainted and his left arm fell into that fire: [...] "I saw Hariakhan Maharaj come into the room and <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> me…, I saw him clearly, removing my left arm from the fire pit... By some unknown power I was related to Hariakhan Maharaj." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another common legend, again {{dating back}} to the 1960s, was that a man who took LSD went insane and {{permanently}} thought that he was a glass of orange juice. Because of this, he could never <b>bend</b> <b>over,</b> slept upright and did not make any sudden movements. [...] Alternative versions sometimes have the man thinking he is a glass of milk or a whole orange. Another version of this myth states that the man believed he had become an orange, and was afraid he would be 'peeled' by his friends.|$|E
2500|$|At lower {{frequencies}} in the MF, LF, and VLF bands, due to diffraction {{radio waves}} can <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> obstacles like hills, and travel beyond the horizon as surface waves which follow the contour of the Earth. [...] These are called ground waves. [...] AM broadcasting stations use ground waves {{to cover their}} listening areas. [...] As the frequency gets lower the attenuation with distance decreases, so very low frequency (VLF) and extremely low frequency (ELF) ground waves {{can be used to}} communicate worldwide. [...] VLF and ELF waves can penetrate significant distances through water and earth, and these frequencies are used for mine communication and military communication with submerged submarines.|$|E

2500|$|The worshipper bows at {{four points}} in the Amidah: at the {{beginning}} and end of both the first blessing of Avot and the second to last blessing of Hoda'ah. At the opening words of Avot and at the conclusion of both these blessings, when the one says [...] "Blessed are You, O Lord," [...] one bends one's knees at [...] "Blessed," [...] then bows at [...] "are You," [...] and straightens while saying [...] "O Lord." [...] The reason for this procedure is that the Hebrew word for [...] "blessed" [...] (baruch) is related to [...] "knee" [...] (berech); while the verse in Psalms states, [...] "The Lord straightens the bent." [...] At the beginning of Hoda'ah, one bows while saying the opening words [...] "We are grateful to You" [...] without bending the knees. At each of these bows, one must <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> until the vertebrae protrude from one's back; one physically unable to do so suffices by nodding the head.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in The National Post, writer Christopher Hitchens said [...] "It's well-nigh {{incredible}} that Amnesty {{should give}} a platform {{to people who}} are shady on this question and absolutely disgraceful that it should suspend a renowned employee who gave voice to her deep and sincere misgivings," [...] writing in The Independent, journalist and human rights activist Joan Smith said [...] "Amnesty's mistake is simple and egregious", and writing in The Spectator journalist Martin Bright said: [...] "It is Gita Sahgal who should be the darling of the human rights establishment, not Moazzam Begg," [...] and columnist Melanie Phillips wrote [...] "her real crime has been to expose the extraordinary sympathy by white 'liberals', committed to 'human rights', for Islamic jihadists—who are committed to the extinction of human rights." [...] The Times (not connected to The Sunday Times) wrote: [...] "In an extraordinary inversion of its traditional role, Amnesty has stifled its own still small voice of conscience," [...] and journalist Nick Cohen wrote in The Observer [...] "Amnesty is living in the make-believe world ... where it thinks that liberals are free to form alliances with defenders of clerical fascists who want to do everything in their power to suppress liberals, most notably liberal-minded Muslims." [...] Antara Dev Sen wrote in Daily News and Analysis: [...] "It was a gutsy stand, given the dread of political correctness that cripples our thought and makes us <b>bend</b> <b>over</b> backwards till we almost topple over.... Suspending Sahgal was an illiberal knee-jerk response unbecoming of this cherished human rights organisation." [...] Farrukh Dhondy wrote in her support, in The Asian Age, as did The Herald (Scotland), columnist and author Mona Charen in Australia's The Daily Advertiser, commentator Jonathan Power in Dubai's Khaleej Times, journalist and author Terry Glavin in the National Post, columnist Rod Liddle in The Spectator, columnist Jay Nordlinger in National Review, and David Aaronovitch in a column in The Times entitled [...] "How Amnesty Chose the Wrong Poster-boy". [...] Feminist historian Urvashi Butalia also spoke up in her support. [...] Douglas Murray wrote in The Telegraph that [...] "Amnesty is longer an organisation worth listening to, let alone supporting", and The Wall Street Journal wrote: [...] "it's a pity that a group that was born to give voice to the victims of oppression should now devote itself to sanitizing the oppressors".|$|E
