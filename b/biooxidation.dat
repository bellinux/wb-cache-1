30|$|The {{direct and}} {{indirect}} <b>biooxidation</b> are the two mechanism of bioleaching of ore. Usually, indirect <b>biooxidation</b> mechanism has been accepted by most researchers (Liu et al. 2017). The indirect <b>biooxidation</b> mechanism includes contact and non-contact <b>biooxidation</b> mechanisms (Jadhav and Hocheng 2013). In contact mechanism, bacteria would adhere to ore and form a biofilm between bacteria and ore. Inside this biofilm, Fe 2 + is oxidized by bacteria to Fe 3 + and the ore is dissolved by Fe 3 + (Liu et al. 2017). It has been proved that the formation of biofilm is important in bioleaching of ore (More et al. 2014). The concentration of ferric iron and H+ in biofilm {{is much higher than}} that in solution, which could greatly increase the dissolution rate of ores (Coram and Rawlings 2002). In non-contact mechanism, the bacteria are no need to adhere to the ore. In addition, the Fe 3 + which is produced by bacteria plays key role in the dissolution of ore.|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 119 - 129. Refractory gold-bearing metal-sulfide ores and {{concentrates}} can {{be successfully}} and economically treated by <b>biooxidation</b> prior to cyanidation. However, {{one of the}} major drawbacks of the <b>biooxidation</b> process is the excessive consumption of cyanide during the gold dissolution process. The largest proportion of cyanide wastage is attributed to thiocyanate formation. Thiocyanate can be formed by spontaneous chemical reactions between reactive sulfur species and cyanide. The enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate: cyanide sulfurtransferase EC 2. 8. 1. 1) is also able to catalyze the formation of thiocyanate using thiosulfate and cyanide as substrates. Therefore, the most relevant members of the microbial consortium responsible for <b>biooxidation</b> of gold-bearing ores or concentrates were investigated to determine whether they were able to contribute to thiocyanate formation by means of a enzyme reaction mechanism indicative of rhodanese. Together with a Thiobacillus caldus strain (T. caldus MNG), isolated from a <b>biooxidation</b> pilot plant, the sulfur-oxidizers Thiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 33020 (also able to oxidize iron) and Thiobacillus thiooxidans ATCC 19377 demonstrated rhodanese activity. However, the obligate iron-oxidizer Leptospirillum ferrooxidans DSM 2705 had no detectable rhodanese activity. High levels of rhodanese activity were detected from the mixed microbial population of a <b>biooxidation</b> pilot plant, which appeared to be dominated by T. caldus MNG. This T. caldus strain was initially identified in the <b>biooxidation</b> pilot plant using the PCR based 16 S rDNA profiling technique of Rawlings (1995), and the identification confirmed by 16 S rDNA sequencing. Therefore, T. caldus MNG is considered the major contributor to the rhodanese activity of the <b>biooxidation</b> pilot plant mixed culture. Within the range of sulfur substrates tested, the rhodanese enzyme of T. caldus MNG behaved exclusively as a thiosulfate: cyanide sulfurtransferase, and the rhodanese activity of T. caldus MNG appeared to be dependent on the physiological state of the cell during batch growth. An attempt to isolate a rhodanese gene from T. caldus MNG by Southern hybridization, using the Azotobacter vinelandii rhdA gene as a probe, was unsuccessful. On balance of the information available from this study, and reported elsewhere, rhodanese activity probably does not contribute as much to thiocyanate formation in the cyanidation plant as does the spontaneous chemical formation of thiocyanate...|$|E

Ten different by-products were used with reference to slaked lime. Batch bioleaching of a pyrite concentrate were conducted in 1 -L reactor using mesophilic microorganisms at 35 º C. The by-products used were different types of steel slags, ashes, dust and mesalime. The neutralising capacities of the by-products were determined {{by the amount of}} by-products needed for neutralisation during <b>biooxidation.</b> The amount of steel slags, EAF dust, Mesalime and Bioash needed for neutralisation ranged from 16 - 37 g, Waste ash and Coal & Tyres ash needed 81 g and 57 g, respectively, while the slaked lime reference needed 22 g. The experiment with Waste ash gave the lowest pyrite oxidation of 59 %, while the other by-products had similar or better pyrite oxidation compared to slaked lime, ranging from 69 - 80 %. Fluoride, chromium and vanadium were potentially toxic elements present in some of the by-products, but had no negative impact on the bacterial activity. A chloride concentration of 11 %, eventually together with other potentially toxic elements, in the Waste ash caused a negative effect, observed by low redox potential and pyrite oxidation. Stainless steel slags should be avoided for environmental reasons due to the presence of chromium. High content of zinc in EAF dust would enrich the zinc tenor, if used as neutralising agent in bioleaching of zinc sulphides, but chloride should be removed before its use.

This has hindered attempts to understand the mechanism by which the bacteria assist in the leaching process. The methods reported in the literature to enumerate both the free and attached bacteria in a <b>biooxidation</b> system can be divided into 2 categories: direct methods and indirect methods.

It is difficult to enumerate attached bacteria by direct observation but attempts have been made to desorb or dislodge these bacteria. Such experiments have had limited success in achieving dislodgement of all the attached bacteria. However, the results have shown that desorption of the bacteria from the mineral surface is possible. Indirect methods involve the monitoring of a cell component such as protein, nitrogen and carbon.

Results: The inhibitory effect caused {{by the presence of}} H 2 S on the DMS is observed, which is evidenced by the decrease of the DMS removal efficiency from 80 to 27 %, due to the preference that T. thioparus has by simple metabolism.

40|$|Extreme thermoacidophiles (Topt > 65 °C, pHopt < 3. 5) inhabit unique environments {{fraught with}} challenges, {{including}} extremely high temperatures, low pH, {{as well as}} high levels of soluble metal species. In fact, certain {{members of this group}} thrive by metabolizing heavy metals, creating a dynamic equilibrium between <b>biooxidation</b> to meet bioenergetic needs and mechanisms for tolerating and resisting the toxic effects of solubilized metals. Extremely thermoacidophilic archaea dominate bioleaching operations at elevated temperatures and have been considered for processing certain mineral types (e. g., chalcopyrite), some of which are recalcitrant to their mesophilic counterparts. A key issue to consider, in addition to temperature and pH, {{is the extent to which}} solid phase heavy metals are solubilized and the concomitant impact of these mobilized metals on the microorganism’s growth physiology. Here, extreme thermoacidophiles are examined from the perspectives of biodiversity, heavy metal <b>biooxidation,</b> metal resistance mechanisms, microbe-solid interactions, and application of these archaea in biomining operations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Biooxidation</b> is an {{attractive}} process for unlocking of gold from refractory ores, but could be further improved by reducing the rather high cyanide consumption during the cyanidation of the <b>biooxidation</b> residues. The high cyanide demand is typically ascribed {{to the presence of}} metastable intermediate sulfur species formed during the oxidation of the sulfide, but it is also conceivable that jarosite formation during the acidic <b>biooxidation</b> process and subsequent leaching during the alkaline cyanidation could also account for significant cyanide consumption. The present work was done to establish if jarosite would readily form under typical <b>biooxidation</b> conditions and, if so, if it would then leach during cyanidation. Methods to stabilise or remove the jarosite were also investigated. To this end crystalline potassium jarosite was synthesized simulating conditions for the mesophile BIOX? process and its decomposition in alkaline media at pH 10. 5 to 11 at 25 ?C investigated. It was found that it transformed into another amorphous iron compound as indicated by a change in colour from yellow to reddish, the presence of potassium and sulfate ions in solution, as well as the disappearance of the characteristic XRD pattern of jarosite. The jarosite also leached in aqueous alkaline cyanide as indicated by the presence of iron in solution, with increased leaching at higher cyanide concentrations. The jarosite could not be totally passified by aging, but removing it by leaching with an iron-complexing agent like oxalic acid was found to be possible. The consumption of cyanide by jarosite during gold leaching could thus be significant, but would obviously depend on how much jarosite is formed during the bioleaching process. Jarosite was observed to be present in the mesophile and thermophile BIOX? products from Fairview Mine with more jarosite present in the products of the thermophile process. The process jarosite was significantly more stable than that produced in the laboratory during alkaline cyanidation with 17 mass percent of the jarosite converted to ferric hydroxide for the process jarosite compared to complete conversion for the laboratory jarosite for a 24 hours leaching period. However, it still accounted for a significant amount of the cyanide consumed.
