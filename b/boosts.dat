5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite <b>boosts</b> the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite <b>boosts</b> plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|There are, in addition, {{matrices}} {{that effect}} Lorentz <b>boosts.</b> These {{can be thought}} of, in the passive view, as (instantly!) giving the coordinate system (and with it the observer) a velocity in a chosen direction.|$|E
5|$|Under Lorentz <b>boosts</b> {{they behave}} differently, {{showing that the}} two vectors aren't {{separate}} physical objects. The electric and magnetic components mix. See the illustration on the right. The electromagnetic field tensor displays the manifestly covariant mathematical structure of the electromagnetic field. It has six independent components at an event.|$|E
50|$|Scattered {{across the}} tracks are {{blue and red}} <b>boost</b> icons. When touched these icons allow the player who touched them to <b>boost.</b> Red <b>boost</b> icons are more scarce than blue <b>boost</b> icons {{due to the fact}} red <b>boost</b> icons give more <b>boost</b> fuel. When a player has <b>boost</b> fuel they may use the <b>boost</b> button to <b>boost,</b> which allows a player's boat to reach speeds much higher than what would {{normally}} be possible. Also by <b>boosting</b> a player can knock other boats into the air, a feature described by the game as the Mighty Hull. Another aspect of <b>boosting</b> is the Hydro Jump which is performed by braking and using the <b>boost</b> button. When combined with the many ramps on the tracks, players can reach short cuts and <b>boost</b> icons that would normally not be accessible otherwise.|$|R
40|$|<b>Boosting</b> {{has been}} shown to improve the {{performance}} of classifiers in many situations, including when data is im-balanced. There are, however, two possible implementa-tions of <b>boosting,</b> and it is unclear which should be used. <b>Boosting</b> by reweighting is typically used, but can only be applied to base learners which are designed to handle ex-ample weights. On the other hand, <b>boosting</b> by resampling can be applied to any base learner. In this work, we empir-ically evaluate the differences between these two <b>boosting</b> implementations using imbalanced training data. Using 10 <b>boosting</b> algorithms, 4 learners and 15 datasets, we find that <b>boosting</b> by resampling performs as well as, or signif-icantly better than, <b>boosting</b> by reweighting (which is of-ten the default <b>boosting</b> implementation). We therefore con-clude that in general, <b>boosting</b> by resampling is preferred over <b>boosting</b> by weighting. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Boosting</b> {{combines}} {{a set of}} moderately accurate weak classifiers to form a highly accurate predictor. Compared with binary <b>boosting</b> classification, multi-class <b>boosting</b> received less attention. We propose a novel multi-class <b>boosting</b> formulation here. Unlike most previous multi-class <b>boosting</b> algorithms which decompose a multi-boost problem into multiple independent binary <b>boosting</b> problems, we formulate a direct optimization method for training multi-class <b>boosting.</b> Moreover, by explicitly deriving the Lagrange dual of the formulated primal optimization problem, we design totally-corrective <b>boosting</b> using the column generation technique in convex optimization. At each iteration, all weak classifiers’ weights are updated. Our experiments on various data sets demonstrate that our direct multi-class <b>boosting</b> achieves competitive test accuracy compared with state-of-the-art multi-class <b>boosting</b> in the literature.

5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, {{is merely}} a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics. In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and <b>boosts.)</b> The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite <b>boosts</b> the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite <b>boosts</b> plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E
5|$|During combat, Aya gains {{experience}} {{points and}} gains experience levels when a certain quantity is achieved.

In addition to leveling up, Aya's stats can be customized using Over Energy (OE) clips found during missions or acquired during Overdive attacks.

5000|$|Also to {{be noted}} {{is the way}} in which <b>boost</b> control is achieved, {{depending}} on the type of wastegate used. Typically manual [...] "bleed type" [...] <b>boost</b> controllers are only used on swing type (single port) wastegate actuators. To increase <b>boost,</b> pressure is taken away from the actuator control line, therefore increasing <b>boost.</b> Dual port swing type wastegate actuators and external wastegates generally require electronic <b>boost</b> control although adjustable <b>boost</b> control can also be achieved on both of these with an air pressure regulator, this is not the same as a bleed type <b>boost</b> controller.

5|$|As {{damage is}} dealt by units within the CO zone, the CO's power meter fills slightly, {{at a rate}} of one bar per five hit points worth of damage inflicted. As the CO power meter is filled, the CO zone grows larger. When the meter is full, the CO can {{activate}} his power which has an effect on the whole battlefield, such as repairing allied units, damaging enemy units, or temporarily altering weather conditions. In addition, the offensive and defensive <b>boosts</b> that normally apply only in the CO zone, also applies to all allied units on the whole battlefield for the turn that the CO power is active. If the CO unit is destroyed, the CO meter empties and the CO returns to the HQ, able to be redeployed with another unit.|$|E
5000|$|A ball & {{spring type}} <b>boost</b> {{controller}} uses {{the force of}} a spring acting against the <b>boost</b> pressure to control <b>boost.</b> This is installed with one <b>boost</b> signal line coming from the intake somewhere after the turbocharger, and one <b>boost</b> signal line going to the wastegate. A knob changes the force on the spring which in turn dictates how much pressure is on the ball. The tighter the spring, the more <b>boost</b> that is needed to unseat the ball, and allow the <b>boost</b> pressure to reach the wastegate actuator. There is a bleed hole on the <b>boost</b> controller after the ball, to allow the pressurized air that would be trapped between the wastegate actuator and the ball after it is seated again.

5|$|In {{order for}} Cole {{to use his}} powers, he must have stored {{electrical}} power, represented by an energy meter on the player's heads-up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources, recharging also restores Cole's health, though Cole's health can regenerate over time without recharging. Many powers are acquired {{over the course of}} the game. The player can use experience points to increase powers' effectiveness or unlock new powers. Experience points are awarded for actions including defeating enemies, healing citizens and completing missions. The player can use such powers to destroy environmental scenery such as towers and stone columns. Depending on the player's choices, the player can gain ice or fire powers from the game's female protagonists, Kuo and Nix. Additionally, passive abilities based on Karma level called Karmic <b>Boosts</b> can be unlocked.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) <b>boosts</b> the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate <b>boosts</b> in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions taken}} in earlier {{parts of a}} map can affect later parts of that mission, {{triggering}} scripted changes in objectives and enemy behavior: for instance, when a castle is raided, the neighboring castle will have troops ready to swarm attackers. After each action, a player character gains experience points, along with raising their health and magic meters, and giving random <b>boosts</b> to their statistics such as strength and agility. They may also learn new skills, including skills which are unique to specific characters. If they are defeated in battle, all characters are subject to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of}} the game. If the army's leader is killed, the map must be restarted. Victory is achieved when the map's objective has been completed, which can vary from defeating an enemy force to capturing specific points on a map.|$|E
5|$|Units have {{a primary}} job which determines the stat <b>boosts</b> they receive when they level {{up and the}} {{attributes}} associated with that class. A unit may also have a secondary job set of abilities, where it can use any abilities of the selected job, but with the stat profile of the primary job. For example, an Assassin with a Sniper secondary job could use abilities from both jobs, but has the stat profile and appearance of an Assassin, its primary job. This may deny the use of some abilities depending on their equipped weapon. In the previous example, any abilities that require the possession of a great bow, {{will not be allowed}} for use if the character has a Katana equipped.|$|E
5|$|When players deal enough {{damage to}} an enemy, they can {{activate}} an execution sequence. Once the execution sequence has been initiated, enemies {{involved in the}} execution are highlighted automatically with colors by the game, and players can perform a series of quick time events by pressing the appropriate buttons. These execution sequences serve to grant additional resources to players, depending on how well the execution is performed. At any time prior to initiating an execution, the player can select one of four categories of executions to perform upon weakened enemies; the selected type of execution determines the type of resource that will be granted when an enemy is executed. Upon completing a successful execution sequence, players are granted the type of execution that was selected. There are four perks available for players. One <b>boosts</b> the player's damage {{for a short period}} after the execution; one refills the player's Focus bar; one allows players to regain lost health, and the last significantly <b>boosts</b> the amount of experience points received from the kill. These experience points can be used to purchase upgrades for various attributes, such as health, damage, or Focus bar capacity, and to unlock additional execution moves. The game still automatically completes and finishes these execution sequences when players fail to press the highlighted buttons, but provides a much smaller reward. Lining up two or more weakened enemies in close proximity allows the player to perform a double execution sequence, which greatly increases the reward granted.|$|E
