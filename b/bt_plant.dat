40|$|To delay {{resistance}} {{development to}} Bacillus thuringiensis (<b>Bt)</b> <b>plants</b> expressing their own insecticide, {{the application of}} the Insect Resistance Management strategy called "High Dose/Refuge Strategy" (HD/R) is recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). This strategy was developed for <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> expressing one toxin. Presently, however, new <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> that simultaneously express two toxins are on the market. We used a mathematical model to evaluate the efficiency of the HD/R strategy for both these Bt toxins. As the current two-toxin <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> do not express two new Cry toxins but reuse one toxin already in use with a one-toxin plant, we estimated the spread of resistance when the resistance alleles are not rare. This study assesses: (i) whether the two toxins have to be present in high concentration, and (ii) the impact of the relative size of the refuge zone on the evolution of resistance and population density. We concluded that for <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> expressing one toxin, a high concentration is an essential condition for resistance management. For the pyramided <b>Bt</b> <b>plants,</b> one toxin could be expressed at a low titer if the two toxins are used for the first time, and a small refuge zone is acceptable.

40|$|Refuges of non-Bt cotton {{are used}} to delay Bt {{resistance}} in the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella, Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), a pest that eats cotton seeds. Contamination of refuges by transgenic Bt cotton could threaten the efficacy of such refuges by increasing the relative survival of larvae that carry alleles for Bt resistance. Here I compared contamination levels in refuges of varying configuration and distance from Bt. I found two types of contamination at low rates in refuges: outcrossing by Bt pollen and adventitious <b>Bt</b> <b>plants.</b> Unexpectedly, outcrossing did not differ between refuge configurations, and did not decrease as distance from Bt fields increased, perhaps because <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> in refuges acted as the main Bt pollen source. Bioassays, conducted to evaluate the impacts of contamination on pink bollworm resistance, indicated that <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> in refuges may increase the frequency of resistance alleles {{at a higher rate}} than outcrossing by <b>Bt</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Transgenic plants expressing insecticidal {{proteins}} {{from the}} bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) were grown on over 13 million ha in the United States and 22. 4 million ha worldwide in 2004. Preventing or slowing {{the evolution of}} resistance by insects (“resistance management”) is critical for the sustainable use of <b>Bt</b> crops. <b>Plants</b> containing two dissimilar Bt toxin genes in the same plant (“pyramided”) {{have the potential to}} delay insect resistance. However, the advantage of pyramided <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> for resistance management may be compromised if they share similar toxins with single-gene plants that are deployed simultaneously. We tested this hypothesis using a unique model system composed of broccoli plants transformed to express different Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 C, or both) and a synthetic population of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) carrying genes for resistance to Cry 1 Ac and Cry 1 C at frequencies of ≈ 0. 10 and 0. 34, respectively. After 24 – 26 generations of selection in the greenhouse, the concurrent use of one- and two-gene plants resulted in control failure of both types of <b>Bt</b> <b>plants.</b> When only two-gene plants were used in the selection, no or few insects survived on one- or two-gene <b>Bt</b> <b>plants,</b> indicating that concurrent use of transgenic plants expressing a single and two Bt genes will select for resistance to two-gene plants more rapidly than the use of two-gene plants alone. The results of this experiment agree with the predictions of a Mendelian deterministic simulation model and have important implications for the regulation and deployment of pyramided <b>Bt</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{safety of}} transgenic insecticidal plants expressing crystal proteins (Cry toxins) from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{continues to be}} debated. Much of the debate has focused on nontarget organisms, especially predators and parasitoids that help control populations of pest insects in many crops. Although many {{studies have been conducted}} on predators, few reports have examined parasitoids but some of them have reported negative impacts. None of the previous reports were able to clearly characterize the cause of the negative impact. In order to provide a critical assessment, we used a novel paradigm consisting of a strain of the insect pest, Plutella xylostella (herbivore), resistant to Cry 1 C and allowed it to feed on Bt plants and then become parasitized by Diadegma insulare, an important endoparasitoid of P. xylostella. Our results indicated that the parasitoid was exposed to a biologically active form of the Cy 1 C protein while in the host but was not harmed by such exposure. Parallel studies conducted with several commonly used insecticides indicated they significantly reduced parasitism rates on strains of P. xylostella resistant to these insecticides. These results provide the first clear evidence of the lack of hazard to a parasitoid by a <b>Bt</b> <b>plant,</b> compared to traditional insecticides, and describe a test to rigorously evaluate the risks Bt plants pose to predators and parasitoids...|$|E
30|$|Meanwhile, Dhillon and Sharma [19] {{reported}} that 'direct exposure of Cheilomenes sexmaculatus larvae to Bt toxins resulted in reduced larval survival and adult emergence {{as compared to}} the controls.' They did not observe such effects when raising the ladybird larvae on aphid prey that had fed on Bt toxin-containing artificial diet (indirect exposure)]. This study has also been dismissed by Alvarez-Alfageme et al. [8] as being 'inconclusive' because toxic effects were reported in some bioassays but not in others and because 'no convincing explanation was provided for the observed differences.' Dhillon and Sharma [19] clearly stated that one likely reason for these differences is that one experiment was a direct exposure trial and the other an indirect exposure trial adding a layer of complexity through potential interactions of the aphids with the toxin either regarding bioactivity or concentration. Moser et al. [20] observed significantly prolonged development times for coccinellid larvae (Coleomegilla maculata) that fed on Bt maize compared to those that fed on isogenic non-Bt maize. Although this could have been due to the Bt toxin, no conclusions about potentially lethal effects could be drawn because mortality was not studied. Furthermore, in 2009, Waltz [21] reported in an article for the journal Nature Biotechnology that researchers in the United States also observed strong lethal effects when feeding <b>Bt</b> <b>plant</b> material containing toxins of the coleopteran-active Cry 3 class (likely pollen) to ladybird larvae. Because this data did not receive permission for publication from the corporate developer of that Bt-maize event [21], we cannot compare it to our data.|$|E
40|$|Background: Larval {{movement}} of target pest populations among Bt and non-Bt plants {{is a major}} concern in the use of a seed mixture refuge strategy for Bt resistance management. In this study, occurrence and larval {{movement of}} the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), were evaluated in four planting patterns of non-Bt and Bt plants containing Genuity® SmartStax™ traits in 2009 – 2011. The four planting patterns were: (1) a pure stand of 27 Bt plants; (2) one non-Bt plant in the center, surrounded by 26 Bt plants; (3) a pure stand of 27 non-Bt plants; (4) one <b>Bt</b> <b>plant</b> in the center, surrounded by 26 non-Bt plants.

The major objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether refuge plants in a seed mixture strategy could provide a comparable refuge population of D. saccharalis to a “structured refuge” planting. Results: Larvae of D. saccharalis showed the ability to move from infested plants to at least four plants away, as well as to adjacent rows, but the majority remained within the infested row. However, the number of larvae found on the non-Bt plants in the mixture plantings was not significantly reduced compared with the pure stand of non-Bt corn. Conclusion: The results of this study show that refuge plants in a seed mixture may be able to provide a comparable refuge population of D. saccharalis to a structured refuge planting...|$|E

This study aimed to analyse the effects of Bt broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenk) on six soil-dwelling invertebrates. No significant differences were detected in nematode (Panagrellus redivivus L.) populations living in compost in which Bt and non- 5 / broccoli had grown. The other species were introduced to combinations of Bt and non- 5 / leaves, and compost in which Bt and non- 5 / plants had grown. No differences were detected in Collembola (Folsomia candida Willem) populations, but significantly more young woodlice (Porcellio scaber Latrielle) survived, and weighed more, in the Bt than the non- 5 / treatments. Slugs (Deroceras reticulatum Muller) weighed more {{in the presence of}} Bt proteins. A higher percentage of earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris L.) cocoons hatched in Bt than non- 5 / treatments. In contrast, at a third trophic level, fewer predatory beetles (Nebria brevicollis Fabricius) survived when feeding on slugs that had fed on Bt leaves than on those fed on non- 5 / leaves.

Additionally, we investigated whether insecticide-sprayed refuges of non-Bt crops would delay or accelerate resistance to the Bt crop. We used a system of Bt broccoli expressing Cry 1 Ac, a population of the pest Plutella xylostella with a low frequency of individuals resistant to Cry 1 Ac and the insecticide spinosad, and a natural enemy, Coleomegilla maculata, to conduct experiments over multiple generations. The results demonstrated that after 6 generations P. xylostella populations were very low in the treatment containing C. maculata and unsprayed non-Bt refuge plants. Furthermore, resistance to <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> evolved significantly slower in this treatment. In contrast, <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> with no refuge were completely defoliated in treatments without C. maculata after 4 - 5 generations. In the treatment containing sprayed non-Bt refuge plants and C. maculata, the P. xylostella population was low, although the speed of resistance selection to Cry 1 Ac was significantly increased.

40|$|MSc (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{evolution}} of pest resistance to Cry proteins threatens the long-term use of Bt crops. Busseola fusca developed resistance to Bt maize in South Africa but {{the mechanism of}} resistance is not well understood. According to the gut microbiota theory, extensive cell lysis caused by Cry proteins provide gut microbes access to the more favourable environment of the hemocoel where they germinate and reproduce, causing septicemia and death of the host. This theory brought on questions {{about the role of}} gut microbes in the efficacy of Bt maize against target lepidopteran pests. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether microbes present in the mid-gut of B. fusca influence the efficacy of Cry 1 Ab proteins. Larvae were collected from 30 different geographical locations, dissected to excise the midgut and mid-gut content which was separated according to morphological types. The morphological types were used to test the antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria and proved that ciprofloxacin, ampicillin and doxycycline were the most effective bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics. These three antibiotics were exposed to the morphological types at different concentrations to visualise the possible deleterious effects of the antibiotics on the bacteria. This visualisation was performed by observing the growth curve of the bacteria in the presence of the combination of antibiotics. The antibiotics concentration of 500 μg/ml showed the highest efficacy compared to the other concentrations tested. An antibiotic concentration of 500 μg/ml of ciprofloxacin, ampicillin and doxycycline was incorporated into an artificial diet for the larvae to feed on for 7 days. This method was used to rid the larvae of gut microbes before allowing them to feed on Bt maize (MON 810) plant material expressing Cry proteins. The results suggests that by placing antibiotic reared larvae on a <b>Bt</b> <b>plant,</b> the absence of the mid-gut microbes contributed to larvae survival on Bt maize.

40|$|Outcrossing of non-Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum (L.)) in refuges by {{transgenic}} Bt cultivars {{could reduce}} the efficacy of refuges for delaying resistance in seed-feeding pests. Based on reports that outcrossing decreased as distance from Bt cotton increased in small-scale studies, we hypothesized that increasing refuge width or distance from Bt fields would reduce outcrossing. In a large-scale study in Arizona, we quantified Bt seed in refuges of experimental and commercial fields, comparing outcrossing between in-field (narrow) and external (wide) refuges and among rows of refuges at various distances from Bt fields. Some refuges, including those in tightly controlled experimental plots, contained up to 8 % adventitious <b>Bt</b> <b>plants.</b> Some, but not all, <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> likely resulted from Bt seed in the non-Bt seed bags.

40|$|ABSTRACT The entomopathogenic {{bacterium}} Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and its toxins are extensively {{used for}} pest control purposes in agriculture, forestry {{and public health}} programmes since the 1930. In addition to spray formulations, transgenic <b>plants</b> containing <b>Bt</b> genes {{for the expression of}} the toxins (<b>Bt</b> <b>plants)</b> are commercially available since the mid 1990 s and are grown on an increasing percentage of the global agricultural area. A main reason for the importance of Bt as a pesticide is the assumed environmental safety concluded from the high specificity of its endotoxins (Cry proteins) towards a limited number of target organisms, mostly distinct groups of pest insects. While the mode of action of the Cry toxins in these susceptible target insects is well studied, Bt experts claim that several details are still not understood well enough. Although there is considerable experience with the application and the environmental safety of Bt sprays, a number of research papers were published in the past that did report adverse effects on non-target organisms.

40|$|Mason,Charles E. The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner), {{is a major}} {{lepidopteran}} pest {{of maize}} in the United States and Canada. One {{of the most effective}} control methods for ECB is the use of transgenic crops that encode for insecticidal crystalline (Cry) proteins that are derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The continued effective use of Bt corn relies on compliance with insect resistance management practices; where planting a small percentage of non-Bt refuge corn adjacent to or as seed blends within Bt corn fields provides a population of susceptible insects that can mate with rare resistant individuals. Little is known about how these non-Bt plant blends affect movement behaviors of ECB in the third instar, an intermediary stage where the larva begins to bore into corn stalks. The objective of my study was to assess and characterize the amount of movement off of infested plants in the field using a variety of five plant arrays containing lepidopteran Bt corn plants and non-lepidopteran protein marked refuge corn plants. Additional studies sought to determine the presence and persistence of three different Bt Cry proteins in third instars using monoclonal ELISA test strips. Based on two years of field movement studies I found that the range of third instars moving off of an infested plant when it was a Cry 1 Ab corn plant is approximately 30 % to 65 %. The range for third instars moving off of an infested plant when it was a Cry 1 F corn plant was approximately 20 % to 60 %, and that the range for third instars moving off of an infested plant when it was a non-lepidopteran protein marked refuge corn plant was about 6 % to 18 %. The range of movement off of the infested plant for the protein marked refuge plants was consistent with that for near isoline control plants. The lepidopteran targeted Bt Cry proteins were found to be consistently detected for seven sampling points over a 24 hour feeding period. However, the non-lepidopteran Bt Cry proteins could not be consistently detected over the same 24 hour period. Additionally, the persistence of <b>Bt</b> <b>plant</b> material in third instars varied depending on the Cry protein.

40|$|Parasitoids are {{important}} natural enemies of many pest species {{and are used}} extensively in biological and integrated control programmes. Crop plants transformed to express toxin genes derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) provide high levels of resistance to certain pest species, {{which is likely to}} have consequent effects on parasitoids specialising on such pests. A better understanding of the interaction between transgenic plants, pests and parasitoids is important to limit disruption of biological control and to provide background knowledge essential for implementing measures for the conservation of parasitoid populations. It is also essential for investigations into the potential role of parasitoids in delaying the build-up of Bt-resistant pest populations. The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), a major pest of brassica crops, is normally highly susceptible to a range of Bt toxins. However, extensive use of microbial Bt sprays has led to the selection of resistance to Bt toxins in P. xylostella. Cotesia plutellae is an important endoparasitoid of P. xylostella larvae. Although unable to survive in Bt-susceptible P. xylostella larvae on highly resistant <b>Bt</b> oilseed rape <b>plants</b> due to premature host mortality, C. plutellae is able to complete its larval development in Bt-resistant P. xylostella larvae.

Here, we develop a deterministic model to estimate the impact of toxin concentration, emergence asynchrony and refuge zone size on the effectiveness of the HD/R strategy. We conclude that emergence asynchrony only affects resistance when toxin concentration is high and resistance is recessive.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} research {{examined the}} effect of the cultivation of insect-resistant Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize on the soil environment with a goal of understanding how to obtain a balance between technological advancement and maintenance of a healthy soil ecosystem. Although <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> may help to reduce pesticide use, conferring benefits to farm workers and the environment, there are still unresolved questions about how the cultivation of <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> affects soil organisms. For this dissertation project, I used 14 different genotypes of Bt maize and non-Bt maize (Zea mays) to investigate the effects of transgenic <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> on the colonization ability, abundance, and diversity of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the soil ecosystem over time. My greenhouse studies demonstrated that <b>Bt</b> maize <b>plants</b> exhibited reduced AMF colonization across multiple Bt genotypes and that effects were most pronounced when fertilizer levels were limited and spore density was high. In addition, I found that although differences in AMF colonization between Bt and non-Bt maize were difficult to detect in the field, spore density was reduced in Bt field plots after just one growing season. When I tested {{the effect of}} plot history on AMF and plant growth, I found that Bt and non-Bt maize plants had higher leaf chlorophyll content when grown in plots previously cultivated with the same maize line as the previous year, indicative of a positive feedback effect. I also examined potential mechanisms contributing to the reduced AMF colonization observed in Bt maize in greenhouse studies and determined that follow-up experiments should continue to investigate differences in root apoplastic invertase activity and root permeability in Bt and non-Bt maize. Future investigations would also benefit from examining potential differences in root exudate profiles and volatile organic compounds between Bt and non-Bt cultivars. Taken together, my dissertation results suggest that, while difficult to detect in the field, reductions in AMF colonization in Bt maize roots may be ecologically significant as they could lead to a decrease in the abundance of AMF propagules in the soil over time, potentially impacting soil structure and function in areas where Bt crop cultivation is high...|$|R

40|$|Background: Characterizing {{the spatial}} {{patterns}} of gene flow from transgenic crops is challenging, {{making it difficult}} to design containment strategies for markets that regulate the adventitious presence of transgenes. Insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis (<b>Bt)</b> cotton is <b>planted</b> on millions of hectares annually and is a potential source of transgene flow. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we monitored 15 non-Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum, L.) seed production fields (some transgenic for herbicide resistance, some not) for gene flow of the Bt cotton cry 1 Ac transgene. We investigated seedmediated gene flow, which yields adventitious <b>Bt</b> cotton <b>plants,</b> and pollen-mediated gene flow, which generates outcrossed seeds. A spatially-explicit statistical analysis was used to quantify the effects of nearby Bt and non-Bt cotton fields at various spatial scales, along with the effects of pollinator abundance and adventitious <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> in fields, on pollenmediated gene flow. Adventitious <b>Bt</b> cotton <b>plants,</b> resulting from seed bags and planting error, comprised over 15 % of plants sampled from the edges of three seed production fields. In contrast, pollen-mediated gene flow affected less than 1 % of the seed sampled from field edges. Variation in outcrossing was better explained by the area of Bt cotton fields within 750 m of the seed production fields than by the area of Bt cotton within larger or smaller spatial scales. Variation in outcrossing was also positively associated with the abundance of honey bees. Conclusions/Significance: A comparison of statistical methods showed that our spatially-explicit analysis was mor...|$|R

30|$|Two miRNAs {{families}} had several miRNAs being altered, zma-miRNA 167 in <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> and zma-miRNA 399 mostly in stacked plants. zma-miR 167 {{is known to}} target auxin response factor (ARF) genes [54]. The phytohormone auxin influences many aspects of plant development and the identity of several miRNA targets suggests roles for miRNAs in auxin signalling [55]. ARFs are a plant-specific family of DNA binding proteins that bind to auxin-responsive promoter elements (AuxREs), which are found in early auxin response genes, including Auxin/Indole- 3 -Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA), small auxin-up RNA (SAUR), and auxin-inducible GH 3 genes, and can either enhance or repress transcription [56]. The role of auxin dys-regulation in <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> is yet unknown but {{might be related to}} the CRY protein pathway as part of the plant defence system against pathogens [57]. zma-MIR 399 was less abundant in stacked plants and showed a target transcript that contains a plant calmodulin-binding domain. Calmodulin-binding proteins are thought to be involved in diverse pathways that are dependent on Ca 2 + signalling, such as plant development and adaptation to environmental stimuli [58]. In addition, also less abundant, zma-MIR 827 targets another class of transcription factors, such as the bZIP transcription factor superfamily, the Ocs element-binding factor 1 and the Rossmann-fold superfamily protein. In plants, basic region/leucine zipper motif (bZIP) transcription factors regulate several processes including pathogen defence and stress signalling [59].|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of crop plants and trees have been {{transformed}} with genes derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) to express insecticidal proteins (insect-resistant <b>Bt</b> <b>plants).</b> Whereas the adoption of <b>Bt</b> <b>plants</b> constitutes {{one of the most}} common uses of transgenic plants in agriculture, the environmental benefits and risks remain an issue. To preserve the natural reserve and their fauna UE proposed that in future the Member State specify a minimum separation distance of metres between fields of GM plants and nature reserves or to forbid cultivation of GM plant in particular area based on scientific data. Natural reserve in Sicily have many endemism and rare species so next steps also in Italy should consider this before adaptation of GM crops. One first step is to obtain a listing of lepidopteran species that feed on these crops and their wild relatives, and to determine the host range of the larvae. Second to assess Bt toxin susceptibility for these lepidopterans. Only few species of Lepidoptera have been tested for susceptibility; and the literature suggests that generalizations about susceptibility among taxa are difficult due to the variability within families. However a similar approach could be interesting also for Bt as commercial product. We report the data on the susceptibility to Cry IAb and to Bt as spray for some not target lepidopteran species...|$|R
40|$|The host {{acceptance}} of neonate Alabama argillacea (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae to <b>Bt</b> cotton <b>plants</b> exerts {{a strong influence}} on the potential risk that this pest will develop resistance to Bt cotton. This will also determine the efficiency of management strategies to prevent its resistance such as the "refuge-in-the-bag" strategy. In this study, we assessed the {{acceptance of}} neonate A. argillacea larvae to Bt and non-Bt cotton plants at different temperatures during the first 24 h after hatching. Two cotton cultivars {{were used in the}} study, one a Bt DP 404 BG (Bollgard) cultivar, and the other, an untransformed isoline, DP 4049 cultivar. There was a greater acceptance by live neonate A. argillacea larvae for the non-Bt cotton plants compared with the <b>Bt</b> cotton <b>plants,</b> especially in the time interval between 18 and 24 h. The percentages of neonate A. argillacea larvae found on <b>Bt</b> or non-Bt <b>plants</b> were lower when exposed to temperatures of 31 and 34 °C. The low acceptance of A. argillacea larvae for <b>Bt</b> cotton <b>plants</b> at high temperatures stimulated the dispersion of A. argillacea larvae. Our results support the hypothesis that the dispersion and/or feeding behavior of neonate A. argillacea larvae is different between Bt and non-Bt cotton. The presence of the Cry 1 Ac toxin in <b>Bt</b> cotton <b>plants,</b> and its probable detection by the A. argillacea larvae tasting or eating it, increases the probability of dispersion from the plant where the larvae began. These findings may help to understand how the A. argillacea larvae detect the Cry 1 Ac toxin in Bt cotton and how the toxin affects the dispersion behavior of the larvae over time. Therefore, our results are extremely important for the management of resistance in populations of A. argillacea on Bt cotton...|$|R
