In this idealized model {{it is assumed that}} the parapet load is evenly distributed across all of the bridge bearing pads. However, this assumption is incorrect. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate that the parapet load distribution is more complicated than an evenly distributed load. Instead, this study shows that a majority of the parapet load is applied to the exterior <b>bearing</b> <b>pad.</b> This means that the real world exterior <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> reactions will be much larger than the reactions found using the idealized, evenly distributed model. 	This study utilizes the finite element program, NISA, to model and analyze a simple span bridge. The bridge used in this study was developed using a prestressed concrete girder design example from the Texas Department of Transportation. The design example specified the span length, clear roadway width, prestressed girder type, and girder spacing of the bridge. The bridge is modeled under two different loading conditions to ensure a comprehensive array of results is obtained. The two loading conditions were carefully designed to compare the idealized model, utilized by the Federal Highway Administration, to the real world parapet load distribution. 	The focus of this study is to determine how the parapet load distribution will affect the <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> reactions in a simple span bridge. The results of this study are provided in several tables depicting the <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> reactions obtained from the finite element models.

In this study, the drills {{are found to}} degrade rapidly on the cutting edges, <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> and side margins, {{largely due to the}} extreme heat resistivity of the high temperature superalloys. Severe adhesive wear developed on the rake and flank faces deteriorates cutting efficiencies of the cutting edges while diffusive wear on the <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> and side margins deteriorates self-piloting efficacies of the drill. Coupled with highly irregular wear rates on the inner and outer cutting edges, the drills are forced against the hole at high rotational speeds â€“ leading to escalations in frictional contact, heating and thermal damage on the <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> and side margins. As a consequence, the drills are deflected from the designated drilling course and resulted in straightness deviation on the part of hole drilled.

The simple span bridge model analyzed is developed very similarly to the design example of the PCI Bridge Design Manual. The main difference is a shorter span length and smaller AASHTO-PCI bulb tee sections. 	Three main finite element models are created to estimate the live load deflections under the recommended live load conditions as per AASHTO LRFD specifications. The first model is simulated with simple support conditions. The {{purpose of this}} model is two-fold: compare the deflections to the distribution factor method and to the deflections of the second model that is simulated with elastomeric steel reinforced <b>bearing</b> <b>pads.</b> Thus, the stiffnesses of the elastomeric <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> of the second model are varied within the AASHTO LRFD specifications acceptable limits and under low temperature conditions the stiffness is increased accordingly for two cases. The purpose is to investigate if the stiffness have any significant affect on the deflections of the girders.

Another {{important point is that}} many users mistakenly believe that tilting pad bearings eliminate all cross-coupling forces that cause subsynchronous instability. While this is true of the cross-coupling coefficients of the bearings themselves, a substantial cross-coupling coefficients of the bearings themselves, a substantial cross, coupling force from labyrinth seals can overcome the beneficial characteristics of tilting pad bearings. This paper describes the installation of an integrally geared compressor that initially had problems with high <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> temperatures. The manufacturer attempted to modify the bearings to reduce the pad temperatures but this was unsuccessful due to unacceptable high vibration amplitudes caused by rotordynamic instability. The rotordynamic instability was caused by a strong subsynchronous excitation of a cantilevered rotor natural frequency located at 47 percent of running speed. The subsynchronous excitation was due to labyrinth seal cross coupling effects. Based on the recommendation of the authors, the manufacturer installed swirl brakes to decrease the subsynchronous vibration excitation, which eliminated the rotordynamic instability and allowed the bearings to be modified in order to reduce <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> temperatures...|$|E

The vertical compression was accommodated by polymeric <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> placed at the horizontal joints between panels during construction. This paper demonstrates how gap compression and magnitude of vertical load transmitted between horizontal joints are influenced by joint location along the height of the wall, joint compressibility, and backfill and foundation soil stiffness. The summary plots in this study can be used to estimate the number and type (stiffness) of the <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> to ensure a target minimum gap thickness at the end of construction, to demonstrate the relative influence of wall height and different material component properties on vertical load levels and gap compression, or as a benchmark to test numerical models used for project-specific design. The paper also demonstrates that although the load factor (ratio of vertical load at a horizontal joint to weight of panels above the joint) and joint compression are relatively insensitive to foundation stiffness, the total settlement {{at the top of the}} wall facing is very sensitive to foundation stiffness. This paper examines the quantitative consequences of using a simple linear compressive stressâ€“strain model for the <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> versus amultilinear model that is better able to capture the response of <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> taken to greater compression.
