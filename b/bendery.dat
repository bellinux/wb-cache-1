25|$|On January 27, 1990, the {{citizens}} in Tiraspol passed a referendum declaring {{the city as}} an independent territory. The nearby city of <b>Bendery</b> also declared its independence from Moldova. As the Russian-speaking independence movement gained momentum, some local governments banded together to resist pressure from the Moldovan government for nationalization.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1990, OSTK-controlled soviets in Transnistria battled {{with republican}} {{authorities}} in Chişinău, {{many of the}} latter also elected in 1990 and that {{on a platform of}} national awakening. On 27 April 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Moldova took the symbolic step of adopting a new republican flag based on the yellow, red and blue Romanian flag. This highly visible sign of defiance against the Soviet government served as the pretext for the first big showdown between the republican government in Chişinău and the OSTK-controlled soviets in Transnistria. Within three days, the Tiraspol city soviet announced that it did not accept the new flag. In the territory under its jurisdiction, the flag of the Soviet Union was to be used until that time when the city soviet deputies could decide on permanent symbols. Although the Moldovan Supreme Soviet annulled this decision on May 4, the city soviets of <b>Bendery</b> and Rybnitsa soon followed suit on the 5th and 8th respectively. The continued defiance prompted the Moldovan government to pass a law on May 10 making the acceptance of the new flag legally binding. However, although the police and the court system were largely still loyal to the government in Chişinău, Supreme Soviet deputies were not willing to provoke the sort of outcry that would certainly have arisen if Moldovan officials had gone as far as arresting leading Transnistrian politicians. In the event, the Supreme Soviet continued to fume as events continued to progress in Transnistria. However, it was at a loss as to how to stop them. In mid May, the <b>Bendery</b> city soviet declared its intention to hold a referendum on the creation of the Dniester Republic. The Supreme Soviet again annulled this decision and forbade the holding of such a referendum. The republican government was, however, increasingly seeing the limits of its power to control lawmakers in Transnistria. Over the objections of the authorities in Chişinău, the <b>Bendery</b> city soviet held the election in July and then used the results as a further justification for separatist action. This pattern continued throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|Once the PMSSR {{had been}} created, the {{incipient}} government in Tiraspol fought an increasingly violent struggle for sovereignty with the Moldovan government in Chişinău. Throughout late 1991 and into early 1992, workers’ battalions, increasingly {{the beneficiaries of}} weaponry from sympathetic Red Army officers and defections from among the local military personnel, grew better prepared than the loyalist Moldovan police in Transnistria. Police stations were captured, policemen were evicted, and in extreme cases workers’ battalions and police traded fire. Skirmishes in November 1990, and September and December 1991 witnessed continued Moldovan inability to reassert sovereignty in the region. Throughout {{the first half of}} 1992 the violence continued to escalate and culminated in a short, but bloody, war in late June 1992. The war left the separatists in Tiraspol with de facto control over most of Transnistria and the west-bank city of <b>Bendery.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The OSTK {{did receive}} some support from local {{politicians}} in the larger eastern cities (Tiraspol, <b>Bendery,</b> and Rȋbniţa). The city governments of all three cities appealed to the Moldovan Supreme Soviet to postpone making a decision on the language question. The leaders of the communist organization in these cities, however, claimed that they did this just to defuse the explosive situation. [...] For example, Evgenii Berdnikov of Rȋbniţa said [...] "We could not stop this process," [...] at a meeting with Moldovan First Secretary, Semion Grossu. [...] "We were only trying to direct {{it out of the}} hands of incompetent people that play on people's emotions." [...] The concession made, he explained, could be quietly dropped at a later time.|$|E
2500|$|Social {{mobilization}} came late to {{the eastern}} cities that became the centers of pro-Pridnestrovian activity (mid-1989) and it followed a different model than in did in western (Bessarabian) Moldova. Social mobilization in Tiraspol and <b>Bendery</b> was mostly achieved through workplace networks called Work Collective Councils Work Collective Soviets (sovety trudovykh kollektivov, STKs). The mobilization in Transnistria was {{a reaction to the}} national revivalist mobilization in Bessarabian Moldova. Russian-speaking workers in the eastern factories and Moldovans with a strong identification with the Soviet state used work collective councils to organize opposition to national revivalists in the Moldovan capital. The councils were created throughout the Soviet Union in 1987 with the [...] "Law on State Enterprises" [...] as part of the perestroika reforms. They were intended to foster democratization and increase efficiency in Soviet industry. However, they were also ready-made forums for debate and provided a structure which activists used to take control of Moldovan industry in late 1989. The national revivalist movements were created essentially from scratch and led by cultural figures. The [...] "internationalist" [...] (pro-Soviet) movement in Transnistria took advantage of workplace institutions to build a countermovement and looked to engineers and factory managers for leadership.|$|E
2500|$|In Transnistria the OSTK was {{extremely}} successful. The organization was particularly {{popular in the}} conservative city of Tiraspol. [...] Looking at the electoral ads run in the Tiraspol Dnestrovskaia Pravda reveals that of the 40 people who ran ads in that newspaper between January and March 1990, 22 (55 percent) mentioned membership of the OSTK, 21 (95 percent) of which won their seats. Of the 18 that {{did not mention the}} OSTK in their ads, only 3 (16 percent) won their seats. Moreover, in this election Igor Smirnov, the first president of the Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic, first successfully ran for public office. To illustrate the point that the election signalled the change in city leadership from that of the Communist Party to that of the OSTK, {{it is important to note}} that Smirnov ran for the position of chairman of the city Soviet (head of local government) against the secretary of the city Communist Party committee; in the March 23rd session that decided the issue Smirnov took the chairmanship with 86 of the 134 votes, defeating Leonid Turcan with 64% of the vote. Events in <b>Bendery</b> and Rȋbniţa were similar, with OSTK leaders taking control of local government. The OSTK had only a tenuous hold, however, on the city government of Dubasari and was a minority in some of the more rural districts.|$|E
2500|$|In October the {{communist}} party began attempting to reassert its power in the eastern cities. During the strike, the city committees and city soviets of the eastern cities had allowed the OSTK to deeply insinuate itself into city government structures; after the strike, city communist leaders tried {{to take the initiative}} back into their own hands. For example, cooperation with the OSTK in the city soviets led deputies in Tiraspol, <b>Bendery,</b> and Rȋbniţa to suspend the introduction of the language laws and deputies in Tiraspol and Rȋbniţa to agree to a referendum on the creation of a Transnistrian autonomous republic. Once the strike was over, however, communist leaders attempted rollback these concessions. The republican communist party leaders in Chişinău were especially keen to see this happen and put pressure on local communists to repeal [...] "illegal" [...] decisions taken during the strike. In a meeting in October, Associate Chair of the Presidium of the Moldovan Supreme Soviet, Victor Puşcaş, in the presence of Communist Party First Secretary, Semion Grossu, berated local communists for losing control of the situation in Transnistria. It would look better for the city soviets to repeal all illegal decisions by themselves, he concluded. [...] "However," [...] he warned, [...] "if you cannot get them to repeal these resolutions, we will do it for them." [...] Back home, the first secretaries of the eastern cities convened plenums of the city committees and sessions of the city soviets. Some OSTK members were allowed to attend and participate, but Semion Grossu attended in order {{to keep an eye on}} the proceedings and make sure the sessions went as planned. The local communist party meetings called on the city soviets to bring local law into accordance with republican law and decisions adopted by the local soviets supported acceptance of the language laws in Transnistria. Communist-run state media also criticized the OSTK and local communists attempted to shut down OSTK newspapers, a measure that prevented the organization from putting out its publication for much of late 1989.|$|E

However, the full-scale conflict re-erupted after regular Moldovan forces {{entered the}} city of <b>Bendery</b> {{in an attempt to}} reestablish the authority of Moldova there. It has been reported that this action was a response to the stand-off at the police station in <b>Bendery</b> on 19 June 1992. On the afternoon of that day, the Moldovan police in <b>Bendery</b> arrested the 14th Army's Major Yermakov on suspicion of planned subversion. After his arrest, PMR guards opened fire on the police station. The Moldovan government ordered its troops to enter the city the following morning. Urban warfare ensued between the two sides in the densely populated city, causing civilian casualties. The Moldovan radio said three Russian T-64 tanks from the 14th Army, some bearing Russian flags, were destroyed when closing in on central <b>Bendery,</b> two of them by T-12 antitank guns, and a third by a rocket propelled grenade that set its engine on fire. A fourth tank was disabled when its tracks were struck by a rocket propelled grenade. Russian Army spokesmen said the tanks had been seized from depots by separatists.
