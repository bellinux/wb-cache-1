5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to <b>bidders</b> who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash <b>bidders</b> being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, young oilmen Lamar Hunt and Bud Adams {{sought a}} National Football League franchise. They found that NFL {{expansion}} required a unanimous vote of existing team owners, {{so there was}} little likelihood of convincing the NFL to expand. The two men attempted to acquire the Chicago Cardinals, intending to move the franchise to Dallas, {{where there was no}} NFL team. Cardinals co-owner Walter Wolfner, who owned the team with his wife, Violet Bidwill Wolfner, was unwilling to sell majority control. During the discussions, Walter Wolfner mentioned the names of other wealthy <b>bidders</b> seeking to acquire the Cardinals. On the flight home, Hunt and Adams decided to recruit the other <b>bidders</b> as owners of teams in a new professional football league.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 2015, it was {{announced}} that two <b>bidders</b> had applied for the licence to run the second national ensemble. Listen2Digital, run primarily by Orion Media and Babcock International Group amongst others and Sound Digital, run by Arqiva, Bauer and UTV amongst others. On 27 March, Sound Digital {{was announced}} as the winning bidder.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} a lower <b>bidder</b> and a higher <b>bidder,</b> the {{rational}} strategy for the lower <b>bidder</b> is to bid zero knowing that it will lose. The higher <b>bidder</b> will bid a value slightly higher and approaches zero {{in order to maximize}} its payoff, in which case the lower <b>bidder</b> has the incentive to outbid the higher <b>bidder</b> to win.|$|R
50|$|First, {{the outcome}} of the auction is {{determined}} by maximizing bids: the apples go to <b>bidder</b> A and <b>bidder</b> B, since their combined bid of $5 + $2 = $7 is greater than the bid for two apples by <b>bidder</b> C who is willing to pay only $6. Thus, after the auction, the value achieved by <b>bidder</b> A is $5, by <b>bidder</b> B is $2, and by <b>bidder</b> C is $0 (since <b>bidder</b> C gets nothing). Note that the determination of winners is essentially a knapsack problem.|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This paper {{examines}} investors' anticipation of <b>bidder</b> and target merger candidacy and if investor anticipations about candidacy affect {{the distribution of}} value between <b>bidder</b> and target firm shareholders. We find that <b>bidder</b> firms can be predicted more accurately than target firms. To investigate how merger announcement period returns are distributed among <b>bidder</b> and target shareholders, we control for different degrees of predictability in <b>bidder</b> and target selection and find {{that the difference between}} <b>bidder</b> and target firm three-day cumulative abnormal returns around a merger announcement decreases significantly. Thus, the evidence supports the hypothesis that the asymmetry in investor anticipations about merger candidacy causes disparity in <b>bidder</b> and target firm announcement period abnormal returns...|$|R
5|$|Reinsdorf {{was one of}} two <b>bidders</b> for the Phoenix Coyotes {{that would}} commit to not {{relocating}} the team. On July 29, 2009 Reinsdorf and his group were approved for ownership of the Coyotes for $148 million. In August 2009, it was reported that Jerry Reinsdorf & Ice Edge LLC had dropped its bid for the Coyotes, leaving only Balsillie and the NHL as <b>bidders</b> for the team. The NHL bid ultimately prevailed, however the league stated it wished to re-sell the franchise as soon as possible. On March 24, 2010, it was reported that Reinsdorf was once again a possible buyer for the Phoenix Coyotes. Reinsdorf had been working out an arrangement to make the deal more feasible with the municipality of Glendale, Arizona. As late as August 2011, negotiations between Reinsdorf and the City of Glendale were still in process for the purchase of the Coyotes. However, in 2013, the Coyotes were sold to IceArizona, a group of investors that did not include Reinsdorf.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{estimate}} was passed within {{seconds of the}} auction opening. Six <b>bidders</b> pushed the price towards a million pounds and Tullie House was forced to drop out at £1.7 million. Two remaining <b>bidders</b> took the bid past £2 million; the winning bidder, an anonymous UK resident and fine art collector bidding by phone, paid a total of £2,330,468.75 including the buyer's premium and VAT. The outcome aroused controversy and prompted calls for the Treasure Act to be revised, though British Archaeology noted that {{the circumstances of the}} helmet's discovery may have resulted in it being outside the scope of even a revised act. It is still possible that the helmet could come into public ownership; if the winning bidder wishes to export it, an export licence would have to be applied for and if a temporary export bar was placed on it an opportunity could arise for funds to be raised by a public institution to purchase the helmet.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, after {{spending}} sixteen years cataloging Newton's papers, Cambridge University kept {{a small number}} and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby's. The collection was broken up and sold {{for a total of}} about £9,000. John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen <b>bidders</b> who obtained part of the collection at auction. Keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of Newton's collection of papers on alchemy before donating his collection to Cambridge University in 1946.|$|E

5|$|In August 2013, Vice-Admiral Shekhar Sinha, {{chief of}} the Western Naval Command, said the Ministry of Defence would scrap the ship as she had become very {{difficult}} to maintain and no private <b>bidders</b> had offered to fund the museum's operations. On 3 December 2013, the Indian government decided to auction the ship. The Bombay High Court dismissed a public-interest lawsuit filed by Kiran Paigankar to stop the auction, stating the vessel's dilapidated condition did not warrant her preservation, nor were the necessary funds or government support available.|$|E

The revolver attributed to Wyatt Earp was sold to an unnamed phone bidder from New Mexico for $225,000.

Kawasaki won the contract; its bid—aided by favourable financing from Mitsui and positive economic conditions in Japan—was 12% lower than those of other <b>bidders.</b> The award was the largest single contract awarded in the initial construction of the system. Kawasaki also promised to supply $20.9m worth of complimentary spare parts after delivery.
