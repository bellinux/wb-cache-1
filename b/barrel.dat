5|$|James {{won more}} World <b>Barrel</b> Racing Championships {{than any other}} <b>barrel</b> racer. She and Scamper earned {{national}} recognition after winning the WPRA World <b>Barrel</b> Racing Championship consecutively from 1984 to 1993. The duo also won the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) <b>Barrel</b> Racing Average title seven times. They are also known for a particular moment in history when Scamper's bridle fell off, yet they still won the round. James retired Scamper in 1993. James retired from competition in 2003 after winning an 11th WPRA World <b>Barrel</b> Racing Championship.|$|E
5|$|The bore {{evacuator}} and the gun's thermal sleeve, {{designed to}} regulate {{the temperature of the}} <b>barrel,</b> are made of glass-reinforced plastic, while the <b>barrel</b> has a chrome lining to increase <b>barrel</b> life. Originally the gun had an EFC <b>barrel</b> life of ~1,500 rounds, but with recent advances in propellant technology the average life has increased even further. The gun's recoil mechanism is composed of two hydraulic retarders and a hydropneumatic assembly.|$|E
5|$|As James and Scamper {{entered the}} arena that night, Scamper caught his bridle {{on the side}} of the gate, dislodging the Chicago screws. With no screws, the headstall broke loose from the bridle after she made the turn around the first <b>barrel.</b> When she strove for the second <b>barrel,</b> the bridle was hanging from the horse's mouth to down under his foot. Meanwhile, she is trying to hold that bit in his mouth. But coming to the third <b>barrel,</b> she has to turn his head loose.|$|E

5|$|At {{the third}} <b>barrel,</b> Scamper spit the {{bit out of}} his mouth, causing the bridle to drop to his chest, but he kept running full speed ahead. While running down the home stretch after the third <b>barrel,</b> James had nothing but a single rein around Scamper's neck with which to control him. Despite these occurrences, the pair crossed the finish line {{with a time of}} 14.4 seconds to win both the round and the 1985 World <b>Barrel</b> Racing Championship.|$|E

5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the <b>barrel</b> and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic <b>barrel</b> with a thumbwheel that adjusts the <b>barrel</b> length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the <b>barrel</b> is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E

5|$|The P90 {{requires}} minimal maintenance, {{and it can}} be disassembled {{quickly and}} easily. It is a modular firearm, consisting of four main component groups: the <b>barrel</b> and optical sight group, the moving parts group, the frame and trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90's <b>barrel</b> is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263mm (10.4in). The <b>barrel</b> has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231mm (1:9.1in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil compensator. The stated service life of the <b>barrel</b> is 20,000 rounds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>barrel</b> was of {{one-piece}} forged construction, with uniform rifling (12 grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 25 calibers). The breech {{end of the}} <b>barrel</b> was screwed into a breech ring. The breech mechanism was {{of vertical}} sliding-block type. The <b>barrel</b> was fitted with a hydrospring recoil system.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} <b>barrel.</b> Before it could be loaded the bore of the <b>barrel</b> was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the <b>barrel).</b>|$|E

5|$|Throughout her career, James {{won more}} World <b>Barrel</b> Racing Championships {{than any other}} {{competitor}} {{in the history of}} the sport. She is <b>barrel</b> racing’s all-time leading money earner, and the first person to surpass a million dollars in prize winnings. James earned national recognition after winning the WPRA World <b>Barrel</b> Racing Championship consecutively from 1984 to 1993 riding Gils Bay Boy, a 1977 American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) gelding known by his nickname, Scamper, and again in 2002 on a horse named Cruiser. James and Scamper also won the NFR <b>Barrel</b> Racing Average Titles in 1984, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1993, and 2002. James qualified for the NFR 19 times with five different horses prior to her retirement in 2003, and was also a gold medalist at the 1988 Calgary Olympics Rodeo. James has a hall of fame career but could not be inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame except into the Notables category until 2017. Starting with the 38th class of inductees in 2017, the ProRodeo Hall of Fame entered into a partnership with the WPRA to include <b>barrel</b> racers, and James was one of two <b>barrel</b> racers inducted.|$|E
5|$|Variants of {{the flame}} fougasse {{included}} the demigasse, a <b>barrel</b> on its side and left in the open with explosive buried underneath; and the hedge hopper: a <b>barrel</b> on end with explosive buried underneath a few inches deep and slightly off centre. On firing, the hedge hopper <b>barrel</b> was projected ten feet (3m) {{into the air and}} over a hedge or wall behind which it had been hidden. 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were installed at 7,000 sites mostly in southern England and at a further 2,000 sites in Scotland.|$|E

40|$|New <b>barrels</b> for {{electroplating}} {{have been}} developed and manufacturers {{of some of these}} newer designs have claimed significant improvements in drag-out losses by their new <b>barrels.</b> Since water consumption and waste generation are directly tied to dragout rate from processing solutions, it is clear {{that there is a need}} to produce a method of evaluating such <b>barrels,</b> so that the user minimizes pollution. This study, funded by The Illinois Waste Management Research Center (WMRC) produced a benchmark test to compare drag-out rates of plating <b>barrels.</b> The study used this test to compare two size ranges of plating <b>barrels,</b> small and large. For small <b>barrels</b> (6 ??? x 12 ???), testing showed that a reduction in dragout rate, as high as 48 %, may be achieved. For large <b>barrels</b> (16 ??? x 36 ???), testing showed that a reduction as high as 44 % may be obtained. A survey was conducted to determine the relative durability of the <b>barrels</b> under study. The survey indicated that some of the <b>barrels</b> that produce lower levels of dragout (those using fine mesh) may unfortunately provide less service life, but other low dragout rate <b>barrels</b> offered service life that is similar to traditional <b>barrels.</b> published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained aerial campaign against North Vietnam that had begun on 5 March 1965, the <b>Barrel</b> Roll area of operations was divided on 3 April. <b>Barrel</b> Roll was {{to continue in the}} northeast while the southern portion of the area, where interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh trail were paramount, was redesignated Tiger Hound. Command and control of that area was handed over to the American commander in Saigon, General William C. Westmoreland.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the <b>barrel</b> itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer <b>barrel.</b> A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the <b>barrel,</b> allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
