5|$|As General <b>Building</b> <b>Inspector,</b> Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for Resettlement. From 1939 onward, the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress. At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists, as does the Chronicle of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the station}} was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad {{announced}} that the new stations along the Erie's former high speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over freight and passenger service. Trains to Harriman would stop at a new park-and-ride built to the south. The former 1911 station depot, however, remained standing until 2006, when the Harriman village <b>building</b> <b>inspector</b> forced the new owners of the right-of-way for the old main line, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station depot. The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, a excavator tore down the 1911 depot, with the remains taken to a dump in nearby Hillburn.|$|E
5|$|The station depot {{remained}} on its concrete platform when the tracks were torn {{up on the}} old main line. In 1996, workers removed the plaque attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, the plaque was stolen shortly afterward {{and has not been}} recovered. The station depot itself was left in decrepit condition, and in 2006, the village of Harriman's <b>building</b> <b>inspector</b> ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern followed through with a demolition permit and in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front loader. The station remains were taken to a dump in Hillburn, New York.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of airstrips in Kuching, Oya, Mukah, Bintulu, and Miri. Construction of the Bintulu airstrip was started in 1934 {{under the direction of}} C.W. Bailey, a Works and <b>Building</b> <b>Inspector</b> for the British Royal Air Force (RAF). All the airstrips were completed except for the Bintulu airstrip, where construction was discontinued in October 1938 due to financial reasons. Japanese forces landed in Miri on 16 December 1941. Sarawak fell into Japanese hands when they conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941. When the Japanese invaded Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke already left for Sydney (Australia) before the attack while his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese used the airstrip for military purposes. However, the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces. The British began reconstruction of the airstrip after the war; during the project many unexploded bombs were unearthed.|$|E
25|$|St Paul's Anglican {{church was}} built in 1906 by Ernest Morris of Morris and Emmett. <b>Building</b> <b>Inspector</b> said {{it had to be}} demolished, because rain water had caused {{extensive}} rot and it had begun to fall sideways and nobody should enter while there was any wind movement. A last service was held on Sunday 13 April 1980. Demolition was on 14 January 1981 and a memorial plaque laid in 1982 and dedicated on 20 March 1983.|$|E
25|$|The Aladdin was {{scheduled}} to reopen on August 17, 2000, at 6:00p.m., with fireworks at 10:00p.m. The opening was delayed while the Clark County <b>building</b> <b>inspector</b> completed its fire safety testing. Another delay was caused by last-minute repairs to the casino surveillance system. This left thousands of Aladdin visitors leaving in disappointment, as well as opening night hotel guests wondering where they'd spend the night. Many high-rollers waited out on the sidewalks {{in front of the}} Aladdin for hours. Most were unable to even get to their luggage, since the hotel had been locked down for testing. Aladdin employees tried to arrange alternate accommodations for the guests with Paris and Bellagio.|$|E

25|$|Shasta Hall, {{many people}} say, is haunted. Students have talked {{for years about}} a ghost in the building's theatre who {{disrupts}} play openings. Some think is a state <b>building</b> <b>inspector</b> who fell to his death in the building before it was completed. Now a popular coffee spot, the Roundhouse was controversial when {{it was built in}} 1969. Its design put off many people, and President Robert Johns apparently arranged for its construction without the approval of the CSU Board of Trustees. Sequoia Hall was originally constructed to have an attractive white cement finish, but the funding ran short. Today the building stands with plain concrete.|$|E
25|$|The Village of Black Creek {{is governed}} by a board of six elected {{representative}} trustees and a president.

The elected board is responsible for establishing the tax rate, approving the budget, setting village policies, and establishing the strategic direction of the village. The president is responsible for making appointments to boards and commissions and for chairing the village board meetings. Committees consist of Finance, Courts and Public Safety, Buildings and Grounds, Insurance and Personnel, Planning Commission, Board of Review, Street, Utility, Ordinance, Board of Health, and a Zoning Board of Appeals Committee. The board meets once a month.|$|E
25|$|That summer, he and Bronsky became {{involved}} in a local zoning controversy involving their gym. On August 17, local <b>building</b> <b>inspector</b> Peter Kropf sent a certified letter to Keith Boyer and the four people leasing the building that the building had numerous violations and that Boyers had 45 days to bring it into compliance with state and local codes or face daily fines of up to $1,000. Kropf also claimed that Boyer never secured a necessary permit when he opened a gym in the former silk mill in 1983. The three-story brick building housed a furniture-stripping business {{as well as the}} gym. Town officials raised concerns that the building may be unsafe, such as the absence of proper fire exits, to accommodate the hundreds of people that the gym was bringing in on the weekends. Yasinsky was the first to sign and acknowledge the town's letter.|$|E

25|$|Schwedler {{was the son}} of a cabinetmaker {{who died}} when he was still in school; his brother, already a {{construction}} supervisor, made it possible for him to finish his education at the City Trade School in 1842. After a further required examination in Latin to complete the equivalent of a lower-level Gymnasium education, he spent the next ten years training as a surveyor, studying for examinations in that and in road construction, studying for a year at the Berlin Academy of Construction, and completing the examinations to be a certified <b>building</b> <b>inspector</b> and construction supervisor. One of his practical examinations was waived after he won the international competition to design a road and rail bridge across the Rhine between Cologne and Deutz. He was then required to leave on his Wanderjahre as a journeyman; he did so with his new wife, the daughter of a teacher and organist in Buckow, whom he had met through their shared love of music and become engaged to six years before.|$|E
25|$|Fritz Beblo {{began as}} a city <b>building</b> <b>inspector</b> in Strasbourg, which had belonged {{to the state of}} Elsass-Lothringen (Alsace-Lorraine) in the German Empire since 1871. At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Strasbourg was also {{in the midst of a}} lot of building activity (the Neustadt). In 1910, Fritz Beblo was named head of the building department and building control office (Baurat, building officer). He received support for his plans from Rudolf Schwander, the mayor. Beblo's name is especially connected with the Musau-Schule (1904–1906), the Thomasschule (1905–1907), the Neufeldschule (1907–1909, today the Collège Louise Weiss), the Haushaltsschule beside the Magdalenenkirche (1909–1910), the Magdalenenkirche, the Grande Percée (Neue Straße) and the swimming pool and thermal baths Bains Municipaux (1905–1910). This art nouveau style bath is considered one of his finest works and is protected as a historical monument. The last work of Beblo in Strasbourg that is worth mentioning is the grounds of the Nordfriedhof (Northern Cemetery). He was not able to complete this work, having to leave the city of Strasbourg after the end of the First World War, since he was a German official and the city had become French again.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} on the San Joaquin River Delta. The set, imitating a {{southern}} prison farm, was built in Stockton, California. The filmmakers sent a crew to Tavares Road Prison in Tavares, Florida to take photographs and measurements, where Pearce had served his time. The structures that were built in Stockton included [...] barracks, a mess hall, the warden's quarters, a guard shack and dog kennels. The trees on the set were decorated with spanish moss that the producers took to the area. The construction soon attracted the attention of a county <b>building</b> <b>inspector</b> who confused it with migrant worker housing and ordered it [...] "condemned for code violations." [...] The opening scene where Newman cuts the parking meters [...] was filmed in Lodi, California. Meanwhile, the scene in which Luke is chased by bloodhounds and other exteriors were shot in Jacksonville, Florida, at Callahan Road Prison. Luke was played by a stunt actor, using dogs from the Florida Department of Corrections.|$|E

500|$|In 1933, Wolters {{returned}} to Berlin, where he briefly {{worked as an}} assistant in Speer's office {{before returning to the}} Reichsbahn, this time getting paid for his work. [...] Speer had forged a close relationship with Hitler, and in late 1936, Speer informed Wolters that the dictator would soon appoint Speer as [...] (GBI) or General <b>Building</b> <b>Inspector</b> for the Reich Capital, and suggested that Wolters resign his post with the railway and come work for him again. [...] Wolters did so, beginning work at the GBI office in January 1937 as a Head of Department in the Planning Bureau. [...] Wolters was {{one of a number of}} young, well-paid assistants of Speer at the GBI, who were collectively nicknamed [...] "Speer's Kindergarten". [...] Most of the Kindergarteners were not Nazi Party members, since Speer found that Party duties interfered with working time, and the Kindergarten was expected to work long hours. [...] Speer had Hitler's permission to hire non-Nazis, so the GBI became something of a political sanctuary.|$|E

40|$|By {{adopting}} a condition-depended approach to maintenance, facility managers can exercise {{control over the}} desired maintenance performance levels and costs. The practise of condition assessment by <b>building</b> <b>inspectors</b> yielded variable results due to subjective perceptions of <b>inspectors.</b> Nowadays well-trained <b>building</b> <b>inspectors</b> are able to manage condition surveys and provide property managers with objective, reliable information about performance loss and defects of building components. The implementation of various performance levels in planned maintenance requires not only the standardisation of the condition assessment method, but also the related planning methodology. This paper describes findings from research that examined the methodology of condition assessment of building components using a six-point condition scale in the Netherlands. We distinguish different categories of performance loss in maintenance and link that to different kinds of maintenance activities...|$|R
50|$|By 2005, the W. W.

Kobach, his wife, and their children live on their farm near LeCompton, north of Lawrence, Kansas. Their residence is in a building, the permits for which Kobach originally received lower taxation and permitting fees due to claimed intent for agricultural exemptions, rather than residential use. He stated he intends to build a residential home on the property. When building it, Kobach [...] "closed in" [...] the plumbing and electric work {{so it was not}} possible for the <b>building</b> <b>inspector</b> to examine it without tearing up the floor and removing walls that covered wiring.
