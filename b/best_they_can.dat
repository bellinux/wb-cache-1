In 1995, Judge Sheindlin published {{her first}} book, “Don’t Pee On My Leg and Tell Me It’s Raining,” {{in which she}} offers her insight into {{how and why the}} family court fails in its mission to impact shattered families. “Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever,” her second book, was published in January 1999. A New York Times best seller, the book challenges women to be the <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be.|$|E
5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E

It is becoming widely understood that professional fire fighting, police, and medical {{services will be}} overwhelmed by a major event and that neighbors will have to assist each other as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> Appropriate area response organizations would likely {{be similar to the}} 1950s civil defense structure, but such civilian participation has yet to be organized.|$|E
25|$|Shwaas {{has been}} applauded for scenes which depict the {{difficulty}} {{faced by the}} doctors to explain to grandfather and Parshya that nothing can be done {{and the truth is}} but inevitable. It shows the medical fraternity in a very positive light, with the doctors and nurses being extremely supportive and doing the <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> and helping the village with the best facilities. The last shot where Parshya returns home wearing dark glasses, waving to his family and friends from the boat was widely appreciated by film critics.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the {{narratives}} are not oriented on {{one group of}} protagonists with a strong lead character, but instead are carried by an ensemble cast—though most books or short stories do have several strong characters who carry the action and plot forward. Flint had intended from the outset that the whole town would be the collective protagonist; a reflection of his philosophy that historic forces are not centered in the main on the actions {{of one or two}} key individuals, but on the many small independent actions of the many going about their daily lives and coping as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b>|$|E

Lee highlighted {{the successes of}} the PAP government since the last election, especially in creating jobs, reducing unemployment, retraining workers, and investing in young people. He argued that the strategies were working and economy was striving, and that PAP had united the people under the threat of terrorism. He reminded viewers that Singapore would have great opportunities as well as major challenges ahead as Asia was rising, and the PAP would make Singapore a land of opportunity for all people, and each person could find {{his or her own}} niche and excel. He said that the government would educate each Singaporean to be the <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic counselors {{advocate}} his {{same process}} {{can be used in}} counseling to envision the bodily experiences of others in reality. For example, a client may present with tears while verbalizing feelings of pain and humiliation in response to a break up with a significant other. A therapist, using his memory of past embodied experiences of relationship heartache, can empathically envision in his imagination very closely to what the client is experiencing, therefore sharing that experience with the client and in turn enabling him to authentically relate to the client. Furthermore, this is precisely what enables the therapist and the client to work together to imagine new therapeutic possibilities. Mensch states that this capacity of human beings necessitates their responsibility to relate to and understand others as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> Humans may not always be able to, or entirely be able to, but their co-existence as embodied beings demands that they make the attempt.|$|E

Tony Lloyd, chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party, called the rebellion a [...] "bit of a sideshow", and Emily Thornberry MP called Brown the [...] "best qualified" [...] to lead Britain through the economic crisis of 2008. The Labour Party said that it had received letters from a small number of MPs asking why no nomination papers had been released.

500|$|Strang {{refused to}} appoint a successor, telling his apostles {{to take care of}} their {{families}} as best they could, and await divine instruction. [...] While his supporters endeavored to keep his church alive, Strang's unique dogma requiring his successor to be ordained by angels handicapped his church in its search for a new prophet. [...] Lorenzo Dow Hickey, the last of Strang's apostles, emerged as an ad-hoc leader until his death in 1897, followed by Wingfield W. Watson, a High Priest in Strang's organization (until he died in 1922). [...] Neither of these men ever claimed Strang's office or authority, however. [...] Left without a prophet to guide them, most of Strang's members (including all of his wives) departed his church in the years after his murder. [...] Most later joined the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which was established in 1860. [...] A few, however, continue to carry on Strang's mission as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> while awaiting a new successor to their fallen founder.|$|E
500|$|When {{the book}} was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them. [...] The {{first part of the}} novel {{concerns}} the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. [...] Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. [...] One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism. [...] This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. [...] This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of [...] "fine folks" [...] being people with good sense who do the <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> with what they have. [...] The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.|$|E

2500|$|No judicially crafted rule should {{insulate}} from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation {{alleged to}} have occurred in this case.
