50|$|The {{characteristics}} of natural dye colouring {{are derived from}} the aul tree or madder dye (Morinda citrifolia) extracted from {{the root of the}} Indian madder tree. Since it is prepared out of natural resources which are non-toxic, the dye is not harmful to the skin. Even though it is only a limited colour range, it is eco-friendly and shades developed are very suiting and pleasant. The colours ranging from deep maroon to dark brown depend on the age of the root bark and the proportion of the dye used and is obtained with the addition of harikari or iron sulphate. These colours mixed with the natural unbleached off-white color of the cotton yarn produce dramatic results. The motifs used on the fabric are conch, boat, axes, crab, bow, temple, fish, and fan, which reflect the culture of the area. These motifs are developed by the extra wefts. By use of multi-shuttle by interlocking method, a solid <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> of the fabric is brought up by the pig by pig insertion of thread.|$|E

After controlling these other factors, we are able to pin down the <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> that is due to local protectionism: administrative <b>border</b> <b>effect.</b> We find that the inter-provincial administrative <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> first rose and then gradually declined in the period between 1991 and 2007. Further, its increase coincided with the introduction of the Tax Sharing System reform, which started in 1994.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate the influence that the pattern of affiliate linkages- establishments associated with companies as affiliates, subsidiaries and divisions- between U.

The gravity model is used to estimate the <b>border</b> <b>effect.</b> Two hypotheses are tested – that the <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> is greater in the presence of affiliate linkages and that the strength of the <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> varies between industrial sectors. The results support the first hypothesis indicating that when all sectors combined, the presence of affiliates has a positive impact and it significantly strengthens the Canada-U. S. <b>border</b> <b>effect.</b> However, for the second hypothesis, nine sectors analyzed in this study present mixed results. For six sectors of agricultural, mineral, chemical, plastic, machinery and motor vehicle the <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> is not significantly different in the presence and absence of affiliates, while for the other three sectors of wood, textile, and base metals, the impact of affiliates has been significant. However, for wood and base metals sectors <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> has become stronger and for textile it has become weaker in the presence of affiliates. This research shows how the complicated relationship between trade and foreign direct investment determines firms operating in various sectors make decisions between export and establishing affiliates.

40|$|Using a monopolistic {{model of}} trade to infer <b>border</b> <b>effects</b> in OECD {{manufactured}} goods industries on the period 1997 – 2000, we test empirically different econometric specifications {{employed in the}} literature to explain bilateral trade. We show that at the aggregated level and {{for a majority of}} sectors there is a correlation between some explicative variables and the specific characteristics, which are intractable in explaining bilateral flows. To derive estimates for time – invariant variables in the same time we control for the correlation between some explicative variables and the unobservable characteristics, we turn to an unbiased and efficient estimator by implementing the Hausman & Taylor (1981) ’s procedure, displaying the interesting advantage to use instruments inside the model. The <b>border</b> <b>effects</b> derived from the HT specification are thus better specified.

We analyze total trade as well as trade in agricultural and industrial products. The <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> estimates show that crossing a national border within these North African countries induces a trade-reduction effect. The highest effect is for Algeria, with total trade being reduced {{by a factor of}} 5 in 2011 - 2012, while the lowest effect is for Tunisia, with the total trade being reduced by a factor of 2 in 2011 - 2012. Our results also show that the <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> is stable over time. The mean value masks differences that are quite substantial in market integration when considering agricultural products or industrial products, the borders effects being lower for the latter. For industrial products in 2011 - 2012, the highest <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> is in Tunisia, with a factor of 3. 3, and the lowest <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> is for Morocco with a factor of 1. 9. For agricultural products in the same period, the highest <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> is in Algeria, with a factor of 5. 9, and the lowest <b>border</b> <b>effect</b> is in Egypt, with a factor of 2. 9. Finally, the equivalent tariffs implied by the estimated border effects are not implausible compared to the actual range of direct protection measures.

Drawing on the NBER Patent Citations Database, we construct a data set to examine patent citations data at the metropolitan level within the U.

First, we find strong subnational localization effects at the Metropolitan Statistical Area and state levels: more than 90 % of intranational <b>border</b> <b>effects</b> stem from the metropolitan level rather than state. This is consistent with the artifact of geographic aggregation at the state level for trade flows as in Hillberry and Hummels (2008). Second, <b>border</b> and distance <b>effects</b> decrease with the age of cited patent, which implies that new knowledge faces the largest barriers to diffusion. However, over time, the measured <b>effects</b> of <b>border</b> and distance increased due to two potential reasons: the increased proportion of new knowledge flows and the increased proportion of self-citations over time. Finally, we find that (assignee) self-citations and aggregation bias are two sources of overestimated aggregate <b>border</b> <b>effects</b> of knowledge spillovers. While self-citations are only 11 % of total citations, they account for approximately 50 % of MSA and national <b>border</b> <b>effects.</b> Decomposing the data along geographic, age or industrial dimensions contributes to the reduction of <b>border</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
