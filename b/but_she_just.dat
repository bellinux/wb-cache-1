[...] "I had surgery on 1 July 2009... it cost a fortune and Amy paid for the whole thing. I tried to thank her <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> hugged me and told me not to say anything. Her generosity gave me my life back." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1943, {{a flight}} of three Spitfires was being {{delivered}} by ATA pilots, including one woman, Ann Wood, from their factory in Castle Bromwich to Whitchurch, Bristol. As it was low tide, the lead pilot Johnnie Jordan flew under the bridge. Some time later, Ann Wood repeated this under-flying – without realising that {{this time it was}} high tide and there was [...] less headroom <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> squeezed through. These were not the only instances of pilots buzzing the bridge, and on one occasion a Vickers Wellington, a much larger aircraft, was seen to fly under it. The practice became so common that RAF police were called in and tasked with the recording of serial numbers of offending aircraft. After a few courts-martial, the incidents ceased.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, {{alongside}} Mark Wahlberg in {{the action}} film Max Payne, based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role. Max Payne was relatively successful at the box office, grossing $85 million worldwide but was panned by critics, with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast. Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was [...] "horribly miscast {{as some sort of}} undersized, warble-voiced crime boss". Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, [...] "Mila just bowled us over..... She wasn't an obvious choice, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park." [...] She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film.|$|E

500|$|Director Jennifer Lee {{strongly}} {{believed that}} there couldn't be any other Anna but Kristen Bell, saying, [...] "It was definitely a wonderful surprise hearing her voice , not knowing {{that she had been}} classically trained. Also, she had such a warm, sweet voice. She was everything that we could've hoped for Anna." [...] Co-director Chris Buck shared Lee's ideas, commenting, [...] "Kristen Bell for Anna was the very first person that we saw. We did a lot of casting to find Anna, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> hit it out of the park. From the beginning we loved her, and she just kind of became Anna and Anna became her. I don't know which one is which." [...] Idina Menzel was also surprised by her co-star's singing ability, stating that, [...] "I didn't know how great a singer she was. I quickly found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down." [...] Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for [...] "the rest of [...] life" [...] if she could. Anna's animator Becky Bresee commented that Bell's voice [...] "lends itself well, so you are taking bits and pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|With Lisa {{now facing}} a long jail sentence, Marge decides {{to help her}} out. She starts reading Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and becomes {{addicted}} to it. When the trial resumes, Marge tells Lisa that she now knows a way that she can help her. While Ned is being cross-examined by Clarice, Marge gives Homer a cold beer. Homer, ecstatic at getting a beer, tries to open it unsuccessfully. The more he tries, the more primitive he gets, hooting and banging the bottle on the bench, disrupting the trial. Finally, Ned loses his cool and refers to Homer as a [...] "big monkey-faced gorilla." [...] Clarice then asks Ned to compare {{the picture of the}} [...] "missing link" [...] and Homer shaking the beer over his head, and asks if he truthfully believes Homer cannot be related to apes. Ned cannot and concedes victory to Lisa. Lisa kindly tells Ned that she fully respects religious beliefs, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> does not think it is proper for the church to dominate the school, the same way that Mr. Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy do not want scientists taking over the church. Ned agrees and offers to take Lisa and his kids out for ice cream.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2002, it was {{announced}} that Bradley Bell had decided to kill off Taylor, and Tylo would depart the role after twelve years. In a statement on her website, she wrote: [...] "It is with great sadness I {{have to tell you that}} Brad has decided to kill off the character Taylor. He feels the character is too good and has too much integrity to take her down other pathsin a word, played out." [...] The actress confessed that she was unhappy with her character's direction at the time of her exit, saying: [...] "I really felt like Taylor had lost the wind from her sails and was going nowhere." [...] Tylo said that [...] "It just seemed like everything had to do with whether or not there was a woman after her husband" [...] and that she was [...] "done with it", revealing that her unhappiness with the writing began when the character of Morgan appeared on the show. Furthermore, both Tylo and Bell agreed that Taylor was at a [...] "brick wall", but Bell was [...] "afraid to go beyond that" [...] and have the character go [...] "off the deep end", in fear of destroying her integrity. However, Tylo believed that [...] "in reality that's what she needed – to be more human. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> got boring instead". Taylor is gunned down by Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) and appears to die in hospital a few days later due to her injuries. Tylo eventually returned to the soap, with Taylor revealed to be alive in 2005.|$|E

5000|$|Anna Paquin {{was cast}} in the HBO {{television}} adaptation True Blood, with her casting being announced on 26 February 2007. In September 2011, Harris said that although some characters in the series were portrayed in the television adaptation as she intended, Sookie is not, saying: [...] "Anna Paquin {{has never been the}} way I think of as Sookie.
