5|$|The <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutan</b> {{population}} {{declined by}} 60% {{in the past}} 60 years and is projected to decline by 82% over 75 years. Its range has become patchy throughout Borneo, being largely extirpated from {{various parts of the}} island, including the southeast. The largest remaining population is found in the forest around the Sabangau River, but this environment is at risk.|$|E
5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on {{the insides of}} their elbows. This is spread across their bodies and those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up and drop from the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutan</b> have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E
5|$|The orangutans (also spelled orang-utan, orangutang, or orang-utang) {{are three}} extant species of great apes native to Indonesia and Malaysia. Orangutans are {{currently}} only {{found in the}} rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they {{were divided into two}} species: the <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutan</b> (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). In November 2017 it was reported that a third species had been identified, the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis).|$|E

5|$|The populations {{on the two}} islands were {{classified}} as separate species when P. abelii was described by Lesson in 1827. Later P. abelii was placed under P. pygmaeus, first as a synonym, then in 1985 as a subspecies. In 1996, P. abelii was elevated back to full species status, and the three distinct populations on Borneo were elevated to subspecies. The population currently listed as P.p.wurmbii may {{be closer to the}} Sumatran orangutan than the other <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutan</b> subspecies. If confirmed, abelii would be a subspecies of P.wurmbii (Tiedeman, 1808).|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} {{points to}} genetic bottlenecks in other animals {{in the wake of}} the Toba eruption. The populations of the Eastern African chimpanzee, <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutan,</b> central Indian macaque, the cheetah, the tiger, and the separation of the nuclear gene pools of eastern and western lowland gorillas, all recovered from very low numbers around 70,000–55,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|In January 1987 the new {{orangutan}} exhibit opened (currently {{part of the}} zoo's Orangutan Trail), {{which now}} holds one of the zoo's two present <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutan</b> groups, and zoo visitors began to rise again.

25|$|Biologists {{classify}} humans, {{along with}} only a few other species, as great apes (species in the family Hominidae). The living Hominidae include two distinct species of chimpanzee (the bonobo, Pan paniscus, and the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes), two species of gorilla (the western gorilla, Gorilla gorilla, and the eastern gorilla, Gorilla graueri), and two species of orangutan (the <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutan,</b> Pongo pygmaeus, and the Sumatran orangutan, Pongo abelii). The great apes with the family Hylobatidae of gibbons form the superfamily Hominoidea of apes.|$|E

40|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{control region}} {{sequences}} of orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) from six different populations {{on the island}} of Borneo were determined and analyzed for evidence of regional diversity and were compared separately with orangutans from the island of Sumatra. Within the Bornean population, four distinct subpopulations were identified. Furthermore, {{the results of this study}} revealed marked divergence, supportive evidence of speciation between Sumatran and <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutans.</b> This study demonstrates that, as an entire population, <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutans</b> have not experienced a serious genetic bottleneck, which has been suggested as the cause of low diversity in humans and east African chimpanzees. Based on these new data, it is estimated that <b>Bornean</b> and Sumatran <b>orangutans</b> diverged approximately 1. 1 MYA and that the four distinct Bornean populations diverged 860, 000 years ago. These findings have important implications for management, breeding, and reintroduction practices in orangutan conservation efforts...|$|R
40|$|Among known mammals, orangutans {{have the}} longest period of {{dependence}} and exclusive association {{between mother and}} offspring before a younger sibling is born. Comparison of available data on wild Sumatran and <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutans</b> reveals a similar development of essential survival skills up to c. 5 years of age, but among <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutans</b> earlier complete weaning and start of independent ranging through cessation of the association between mother and offspring, despite reported higher food availability in Sumatra. It is suggested that this difference {{is related to the}} assumed difference in main cause of mortality: starvation during irregular periods of widespread drought in Borneo vs predation in Sumatra. The benefits of association to both mother and offspring are likely to be different under these different selection pressures. To understand fully the differences between and variation among <b>Bornean</b> and Sumatran <b>orangutans</b> more high quality long-term demographic data on several populations are needed...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutans</b> are {{endangered}} {{according to}} the IUCN Red List of mammals, and is listed on Appendix I of CITES.The total number of <b>Bornean</b> <b>orangutans</b> {{is estimated to be}} less than 14 percent of what it was in the recent past (from around 10,000 years ago until the middle of the twentieth century) and this sharp decline has occurred mostly {{over the past few decades}} due to human activities and development. Their habitat is so much reduced that they are now only to be found in pockets of remaining rainforest. The largest remaining population is found in the forest around the Sabangau River, but this environment too is at risk. According to the IUCN, it is expected that in 10 to 30 years orangutans will be extinct if there is no serious effort to overcome the threats that they are facing.|$|R
