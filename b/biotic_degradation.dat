Thus, it is of great importance to develop new applications for use of beech wood. One of the possible solutions is use of beech in outdoor applications. However, if beech is used outdoor it has to be somehow protected. In the recent period, non-biocidal methods of wood protection such as thermal modification and use of wax emulsions are gaining more and more importance, hence we applied these two methods to beech wood in present research as well. During the research, water exclusion efficacy of wood was determined. Wood was subjected to various abiotic and <b>biotic</b> <b>degradation</b> protocols.

Some studies suggest that tin is an essential trace element for humans. However, organotin compounds have been proven to be of toxicological relevance. Triorganotin compounds are particularly toxic explaining their wide use as biocides (e. g., in antifouling paints or pesticides). Persistence of organotin compounds is governed by moderate to fast aerobic <b>biotic</b> <b>degradation</b> processes, slow anaerobic <b>biotic</b> <b>degradation,</b> slow abiotic degradation by photolysis, and fast, but reversible, adsorption/desorption processes.

Relatively, less attention was paid on biotic factors involved in the fate of quinalphos in natural resources [23]. A definite participation of factors, in particular biotic factors, in the degradation of quinalphos in natural resources such as soil and water can only be demonstrated with the isolation of <b>biotic</b> agents with <b>degradation</b> traits from natural resources.

Bacteria that grew on pyrene were isolated from burned soils at two sites in Utah in order to analyze the <b>biotic</b> microbial <b>degradation</b> of the hydrophobic soil sub-layer. The two sites were Wood Camp (Logan, UT) and Milford Flats (Central UT). Identifications of the genera of nine isolated bacteria were made through l 6 S rRNA sequencing and included: Pseudomonas, Microbacterium, Streptomyces, Stenotrophomonas, Achromobacter, and Variovorax. The presence of such microbes could be involved in modifying the PAH-component of the burned soils to decrease hydrophobicity. Exposure to sunlight decreases the hydrophobicity of the burned soils and increases the solubility of the phenolics. Chemical differences between the control non-burned and burned soils were seen in FTIR spectra. Peak modifications were intensified by removing the contributions to the spectra from the soil mineral components. A modified bacterial population enriched in pseudomonads and streptomycetes survived the heat, drying and UV-irradiation caused by exposure to sunlight. Dry heat at 121 °C alone did not eliminate the hydrophobicity of the burned soils, but wetting to saturation removed most hydrophobicity. Hydrophobicity was not restored after drying.

We measured total mercury (THg) and monomethyl mercury (MMHg) concentrations and mercury (Hg) isotopic compositions in sediment and aquatic organisms from the Yuba River (California, USA) to identify Hg sources and biogeochemical transformations downstream of a historical gold mining region. Sediment THg concentrations and δ 202 Hg decreased from the upper Yuba Fan to the lower Yuba Fan and the Feather River. These {{results are consistent with}} the release of Hg during gold mining followed by downstream mixing and dilution. The Hg isotopic composition of Yuba Fan sediment (δ 202 Hg = − 0. 38 ± 0. 17 ‰ and Δ 199 Hg = 0. 04 ± 0. 03 ‰; mean ± 1 SD, n = 7) provides a fingerprint of inorganic Hg (IHg) that could be methylated locally or after transport downstream. The isotopic composition of MMHg in the Yuba River food web was estimated using biota with a range of %MMHg (the percent of THg present as MMHg) and compared to IHg in sediment, algae, and the food web. The estimated δ 202 Hg of MMHg prior to photodegradation (− 1. 29 to − 1. 07 ‰) was lower than that of IHg and we suggest this is due to mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) of up to − 0. 9 ‰ between IHg and MMHg. This result is in contrast to net positive MDF (+ 0. 4 to + 0. 8 ‰) previously observed in lakes, estuaries, coastal oceans, and forests. We hypothesize that this unique relationship could be due to differences in the extent or pathway of <b>biotic</b> MMHg <b>degradation</b> in stream environments. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{accelerating}} the <b>biotic</b> and abiotic <b>degradation</b> of polylactide by combining {{it with a}} newly developed experimental additive. Said additive {{is based on a}} highly carboxylic-functionalized poly(lactic acid) copolymer that possesses a comb-like architecture. Samples were prepared by melt blending, and analysis was carried out prior to degradation on changes in molecular weight and mechanical and rheological properties. Degradation studies were performed in compost and pH 7 water buffer environments. Such degradation was gauged by monitoring alteration in molecular weight, {{as well as in the}} content of carbon dissolved and CO 2 evolved during composting. Furthermore, experimental data were treated by applying appropriate kinetic models. Results showed that the newly developed hydrolysis additive efficiently promoted biodegradation - even at a low dosage of 5 % w/w, primarily due to reduction in the lag phase at the commencement of the process. © 201717 - 16928 Y, GACR, Grantová Agentura České Republiky; LO 1504, MŠMT, Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a TělovýchovyCzech Science Foundation [17 - 16928 Y]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the NPU I programme [LO 1504...|$|R
40|$|The EU-funded {{research}} project WISER (“Water bodies in Europe: Integrative Systems to assess Ecological status and Recovery”) developed new assessment methods {{required by the}} EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) for lakes, coastal and transitional waters. WISER also addressed the recovery of <b>biotic</b> assemblages from <b>degradation.</b> The results are summarised in five key messages, supported by papers in this special issue and by WISER results published elsewhere: (1) Response to stress differs between organism groups, water types and stressors; a conceptual model is proposed summarising how the individual organism groups respond to different types of degradation in rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters. (2) The sources of uncertainty differ between BQEs and water types, leading to methodological {{suggestions on how to}} design WFD sampling programmes. (3) Results from about 300 current assessment methods indicate geographical variations in metrics but assessments are comparable at an aggregated level (“ecological status”). (4) Scale and time matter; restoration requires action at (sub) -basin levels and recovery may require decades. (5) Long-term trends require consideration; the effects of both degradation and restoration at the water body or river basin scales is increasingly superimposed by multiple stressors acting at large scales, in particular by climate change...|$|R
