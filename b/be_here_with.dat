500|$|Jackson has had {{multiple}} injuries. In 2008, after the Olympics, she had surgery to fix her ankle. In 2009, {{she had two}} stress fractures in her back. In December 2010, she had an Achilles injury. [...] She sustained the injury playing in Australia. Between January 2011 and February 2012, she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries. She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail, Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic. [...] She said of the surgery: [...] "This is a really, really tough decision, but after talking with my doctors and my family, we felt that immediate surgery is {{the best course of}} action. With something painful like this hip injury, I want to be especially proactive. I plan to stay in Seattle to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> my team and try my best to be back on the court as soon as possible. My goal is to be at full strength {{by the end of the}} season." [...] She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery. Afterwards, Jackson injured her right knee, requiring surgery in 2012. Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years, including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected. All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson's retirement in March. Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction, as [...] "I don't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Sweet Sacrifice", {{the first}} song of the album, {{contains}} [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section according to IGNs Ed Thompson. The main theme of the song is recovery from an abusive relationship, which also inspired all of the songs on Fallen. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian and Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said the song was written for Evanescence's former guitarist Ben Moody. [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] is a rock song that starts as a piano ballad before quickly becoming an alternative metal song that uses elements of nu metal, symphonic rock and pop music. Lee said she wrote the song for her ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan of South African alternative metal band Seether. Described as a [...] "chick anthem", the song's protagonist explains the reasons {{the relationship between the}} pair will not work through the lyrics [...] "Don't cry to me…If you loved me, you would <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> me /...How could I have burned paradise? How could I…you were never mine". [...] "Weight of the World" [...] is a mixture of pop and metal, according to Stornoway Gazette. Inspired by the pressures of fame, it contains [...] "Eastern motifs" [...] and [...] "distorted vocals" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Feels like {{the weight of the world}} / Like God in heaven gave me a turn / Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you" [...] and in the chorus, [...] "If you love me, then let go of me / I won't be held down by who I used to be".|$|E

2500|$|Richards' {{keynote address}} to the 1988 Democratic National Convention {{put her in the}} {{national}} spotlight. The speech was highly critical of the Reagan Administration and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush. Her address was notable for including several humorous remarks displaying her down-home Texas charm such as: [...] "I'm delighted to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like", [...] "Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth", [...] "…two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels." [...] and [...] "When we pay billions for planes that won't fly, billions for tanks that won't fire, and billions for systems that won't work, that old dog won't hunt. And you don't have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesn't make America strong, that it's a bum deal." [...] Richards' convention address has been cited by rhetorical experts as a historically significant speech.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] is {{a literal}} song which depicts the {{difficult}} situation {{of a female}} protagonist dealing with a lover who suffers from an addiction; she eventually decides {{to move away from}} this dysfunctional relationship and leave him. According to Lee, writing a song with literal meaning was an unusual practice for her. A writer for The Daily Princetonian concluded that [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] and [...] "Lithium" [...] from The Open Door were both dedicated to Lee's ex-boyfriend, with the latter song exploring his perspective of the story started by Lee in the former one. Andree Farias from Christianity Today felt that the song was [...] "self-explanatory". A Stornoway Gazette [...] writer called it a [...] "tough-love" [...] song which finds the protagonist [...] "hoping that he'll crash and burn and finally learn a lesson". In the song, Lee accuses her lover numerous times, as illustrated in the chorus lines [...] "Don't cry to me/ If you loved me/ You would <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> me" [...] and the bridge lines [...] "You never call me when you're sober/ You only want it cause it's over". The lines [...] "make up your mind" [...] repeated during the song's chorus are replaced with [...] "I've made up your mind" [...] at the end, indicating that the protagonist has moved on, eventually realizing her worth. The song closes off with Lee giggling, which was described as [...] "the proverbial last laugh".|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Jones {{released}} his last proper studio album on Epic, You Oughta <b>Be</b> <b>Here</b> <b>With</b> Me. [...] Although the album featured several stirring performances, including the lead single [...] "Hell Stays Open All Night Long" [...] and the Roger Miller-penned title song, the single did poorly and Jones made {{the switch to}} MCA, ending his relationship with Sherrill and what was now Sony Music after 19 years. [...] His first album with MCA, And Along Came Jones, was released in 1991 and, backed by MCA's powerful promotion team and producer Kyle Lehning (who had produced a string of hit albums for Randy Travis), the album sold better than his previous one had. [...] However, two singles, [...] "You Couldn't Get The Picture" [...] and [...] "She Loved A Lot In Her Time" [...] (a tribute to Jones' mother Clara), did not crack the top 30 on the charts as Jones lost favor with country radio as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s. [...] His last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992's Walls Can Fall, which featured the novelty song [...] "Finally Friday" [...] and [...] "I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair," [...] a testament to his continued vivaciousness in old age. [...] Despite the lack of radio airplay, Jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and {{was inducted into the}} Country Music Hall of Fame by Randy Travis in 1992. [...] In 1996, Jones {{released his}} autobiography I Lived To Tell It All with Tom Carter and the irony of his long career was not lost on him, with the singer writing in its preface, [...] "I also {{know that a lot of}} my show-business peers are going to be angry after reading this book. [...] So many have worked so hard to maintain their careers. [...] I never took my career seriously, and yet it's flourishing." [...] He also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken, devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that saw him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of pop-influenced country stars. (Jones had long been a critic of country pop, and along with Wynette and Jean Shepard, he was one of the major backers of the Association of Country Entertainers, a guild promoting traditional country sounds that was founded in 1974; Jones's divorce from Wynette was a factor in the Association's collapse.) Despite his absence from the country charts during this time, latter-day country superstars such as Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, and many others often paid tribute to Jones while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success. [...] On February 17, 1998, The Nashville Network premiered a group of television specials called The George Jones Show, with Jones as host. [...] The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country's biggest stars old and new and, of course, music. [...] Guests included Loretta Lynn, Trace Adkins, Johnny Paycheck, Lorrie Morgan, Merle Haggard, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Charley Pride, Bobby Bare, Patty Loveless and Waylon Jennings, among others.|$|E
