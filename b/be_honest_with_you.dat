500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem." ...|$|E

John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation. Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with [...] "If you call it a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is. It's not a reimagining; the same beats , maybe the scares are a little bit more scary." [...] He later said, [...] "I call it his [...] version. I don't call it his remake or his re-imagining of it." [...] The decision to make a new film adaptation has been criticized by Tomas Alfredson. He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film. [...] "If one should remake a film, it's because the original is bad. And I don't think mine is," [...] he said. Producer Donna Gigliotti said, [...] "We're incredibly admiring of the original, but to <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> that picture grossed $2 million. It's not like we're remaking Lawrence of Arabia." [...] Producer Simon Oakes {{made it clear that the}} plot of Let Me In would closely resemble that of the original film, except that it will be made [...] "very accessible to a wider audience." ...|$|E

Our {{children}} have married theirs, and when we've looked together over the side, we've seen the same things. We've made use of Germans, Denis, but I tell you frankly I hate them. There are two things every Irishman loves--justice and courage--and England went into this war in the great manner. She has done big things, and I tell you, in a sneaking sort of way we're proud.

2500|$|In a {{presentation}} to the American Physical Society, William (Bill) Collins of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and lead author of the modeling Chapter 9 of the IPCC AR5 said [...] "Now, I am hedging a bet because, to <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> if the hiatus {{is still going on}} as of the sixth IPCC report, that report {{is going to have a}} large burden on its shoulders walking in the door, because recent literature has shown that the chances of having a hiatus of 20 years are vanishingly small." ...|$|E
2500|$|Navratilova {{said that}} the remarks {{referred}} to what she perceived as a trend of centralization of government power {{and a loss of}} personal freedom.

2500|$|In March 2008, it was {{reported}} the American network NBC had bought the rights to produce an American remake from Baby Cow Productions.

At the time, both Corden and Jones were reportedly acting as executive producers of the ABC version, while interviewing other people {{for the job of}} writing the adaptation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did she?" [...] he answered. [...] "I {{sometimes}} wonder.

Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band.

We came in at a similar time, and now it looks like we'll leave at a similar time, too. Mel and Steve had some kind of aura, a chemistry, that was unique. I was really proud of it." [...] She added, [...] "I'll always be indebted to EastEnders for providing me with a wonderful start to my career on television and the opportunity to play a character like Mel has been fabulous. I felt {{it was time to move}} on and try on a new coat – new characters, new challenges." [...] EastEnders executive producer John Yorke said of Outhwaite's departure, [...] "Tamzin has created one of the most-loved characters and (with Martin Kemp) one half of the most-admired on-screen couple in EastEnders since the show started.
