5|$|Some {{authorities}} {{split the}} green <b>bee-eater</b> into three species, the Asian green <b>bee-eater,</b> Merops orientalis, the Arabian green <b>bee-eater,</b> M. cyanophrys, and the African green <b>bee-eater,</b> M. viridissimus.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is {{generally}} very bright and in most species is mostly or at least partly green, although the two carmine bee-eaters are mostly rose-coloured. Most of the Merops bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the green <b>bee-eater</b> to barely any green in the white-throated <b>bee-eater.</b> Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the black <b>bee-eater,</b> the blue-headed <b>bee-eater</b> and the rosy <b>bee-eater.</b> Many species have elongated central tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bee-eater</b> nests may be raided by {{rats and}} snakes, and the adults are hunted by {{birds of prey}} such as the Levant sparrowhawk. The little <b>bee-eater</b> and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide sounds like two <b>bee-eater</b> chicks, {{ensuring}} a good supply of food from the adult bee-eaters.|$|E
50|$|A pair of European <b>bee-eaters</b> made a nesting attempt here in 2005 (see <b>Bee-eaters</b> in Britain).|$|R
5|$|<b>Bee-eaters</b> may be infested {{by several}} blood-feeding flies {{of the genus}} Carnus, and the biting fly Ornithophila metallica. Other parasites include chewing lice of the genera Meromenopon, Brueeliaa and Meropoecus, {{some of which are}} {{specialist}} parasites of <b>bee-eaters,</b> and the stickfast flea Echidnophaga gallinacea. The hole-nesting lifestyle of <b>bee-eaters</b> means that they tend to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. <b>Bee-eaters</b> may also be infected by protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus including H. meropis.|$|R
5000|$|Like other <b>bee-eaters,</b> Nyctyornis {{species are}} {{colourful}} birds with long tails, long downturned bills and pointed wings. They are large <b>bee-eaters</b> (blue-bearded {{is the largest}} of all <b>bee-eaters),</b> predominantly green, with a face colour {{as indicated by the}} species' name. This colour extends on to the slightly hanging throat feathers to form the [...] "beard".|$|R
5|$|The Ancient Egyptians {{believed}} that bee-eaters had medical properties, prescribing {{the application of}} <b>bee-eater</b> fat to deter biting flies, and treating the eyes with the smoke from charred <b>bee-eater</b> legs to cure an unspecified female complaint.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bee-eater</b> family {{contains}} the following species.|$|E
5|$|Species that {{breed in}} {{subtropical}} or temperate areas of Europe, Asia and Australia are all migratory. The European bee-eaters that breed in southern Europe and Asia migrate to West and southern Africa. Another {{population of the}} same species breeds in South Africa and Namibia; these birds move northwards after breeding. In Australia the rainbow <b>bee-eater</b> is migratory in the southern areas of its range, migrating to Indonesia and New Guinea, but occurs year-round in northern Australia. Several species of <b>bee-eater,</b> are intra-African migrants; the white-throated <b>bee-eater,</b> for example, breeds on the southern edge of the Sahara and winters further south in equatorial rainforest. The most unusual migration is that of the southern carmine <b>bee-eater,</b> which has a three-stage migration; after breeding in a band between Angola and Mozambique it moves south to Botswana, Namibia and South Africa before moving north to its main wintering grounds in northern Angola, Congo and Tanzania.|$|E
50|$|Like all <b>bee-eaters,</b> rainbow <b>bee-eaters</b> {{are very}} social birds. When {{they are not}} {{breeding}} they roost together in large groups in dense undergrowth or large trees.|$|R
50|$|White-fronted <b>bee-eaters</b> nest in colonies {{averaging}} 200 individuals, digging roosting and nesting {{holes in}} cliffs or banks of earth. A population of <b>bee-eaters</b> may range across many square kilometres of savannah, but {{will come to}} the same colony to roost, socialize, and to breed. White-fronted <b>bee-eaters</b> have one of the most complex family-based social systems found in birds.|$|R
5|$|Fly larvae of {{the genus}} Fannia live in the nests of at least European <b>bee-eaters,</b> and feed on faeces and food remains. Their {{presence}} and cleaning activities appear to benefit the developing <b>bee-eaters.</b>|$|R
5|$|The bee-eaters have an Old World distribution, {{occurring}} from Europe to Australia. The {{centre of}} {{diversity of the}} family is Africa, although a number of species also occur in Asia. Single species occur in each of Europe, (the European <b>bee-eater),</b> Australia (the rainbow <b>bee-eater)</b> and Madagascar (the olive <b>bee-eater,</b> also found on mainland Africa). Of the three genera, Merops, which has {{the majority of the}} species, occurs across the entirety of the family's distribution. Nyctyornis is restricted to Asia, ranging from India and southern China to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The genus Meropogon has a single species restricted to Sulawesi in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 {{nuclear and}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA study produced a possible phylogenetic tree, although {{the position of}} the purple-bearded <b>bee-eater</b> appears anomalous, in that it appears amongst Merops species.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the {{southern}} carmine <b>bee-eater</b> in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost though poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning for gold. Colonies are becoming concentrated into the national parks and the Zambezi Valley. The well-studied European <b>bee-eater</b> is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a global population of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even losses on that scale make little overall impact.|$|E
5000|$|All <b>bee-eaters</b> are in {{the genus}} Merops and {{subfamily}} Meropinae except for three Asiatic bearded <b>bee-eaters</b> in the subfamily Nyctyornithinae (in genera Nyctyornis and Meropogon). The genus name Merops is Ancient Greek for [...] "bee-eater".|$|R
6000|$|In {{the next}} family, the <b>Bee-eaters,</b> is another equally {{isolated}} bird, Meropogon forsteni, which combines {{the characters of}} African and Indian <b>Bee-eaters,</b> and whose only near ally, Meropogon breweri, was discovered by M. Du Chaillu in West Africa! ...|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>bee-eaters,</b> {{they are}} {{colourful}} birds with long tails, long decurved beaks and pointed wings. They are large <b>bee-eaters,</b> predominantly green, {{with a red}} colouration to face that extends on to the slightly hanging throat feathers to form the “beard”.|$|R
5|$|It {{is one of}} four popular birdwatching {{sites on}} {{mainland}} Singapore along with Pasir Ris Park, Fort Canning Park and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. Birds found in the park include: white-crested laughing thrush, collared kingfisher, white-bellied sea eagle, banded woodpecker, pink-necked pigeon, blue-tailed <b>bee-eater,</b> white-breasted waterhen, and spotted dove.|$|E
5|$|The bee-eaters {{are almost}} {{exclusively}} aerial hunters of insect prey. Prey is caught either in continuous flight or more commonly from an exposed perch {{from which the}} <b>bee-eater</b> watches for prey. Smaller, rounder-winged bee-eaters typically hunt from branches and twigs closer to the ground, whereas the larger species hunt from tree tops or telegraph wires. One unusual technique often used by carmine bee-eaters is to ride {{on the backs of}} bustards.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} visible {{difference}} between the sexes {{in most of the}} family, although in several species the iris is red in the males and brown-red in the females, and in species with tail-streamers these may be slightly longer in males. Both the European and red-bearded bee-eaters have sex-based differences in their plumage colour, and the female rainbow <b>bee-eater</b> has shorter tail streamers than the male, which terminate in a club-shape that he lacks. There may be instances where bee-eaters are sexually dichromatic at the ultraviolet part of the colour spectrum, which humans cannot see. A study of blue-tailed <b>bee-eater</b> found that males were more colourful than females in UV light. Their overall colour was also affected by body condition, suggesting that there was a signalling component to plumage colour. Juveniles are generally similar to adults, except for the two Nyctyornis species, in which the young have mainly green plumage.|$|E
50|$|White-throated <b>bee-eaters</b> also {{feed and}} roost communally. As the name suggests, <b>bee-eaters</b> {{predominantly}} eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, which {{are caught in}} the air by sorties from an open perch. However, this species probably takes mainly flying ants and beetles.|$|R
40|$|All <b>bee-eaters</b> (Family Meropidae) are cavity nesters, {{excavating}} terrestrial burrows in sites {{ranging from}} flat ground, to small mounds of soil, steep earthen banks seen in road clearings, eroded cliff faces, and river gorges. However, {{very little is}} known concerning the environmental factors that influence nest site selection in <b>bee-eaters.</b> We addressed abiotic and biotic issues associated with colony site choice in blue-tailed <b>bee-eaters</b> (Merops philippinus) nesting on Kinmen island, off mainland China, from 2000 to 2002. About 89 % of the colonies were located on slopes with soils of sandy loam and the other 11 % on sandy clay loam. No colony was found on clay loam, which covered 20 % of the island. The sandy loam and sandy clay loam had lower soil pressure, density and moisture, which, presumably, were easier for <b>bee-eaters</b> to excavate and provided better drainage and ventilation for nest cavities. <b>Bee-eaters</b> avoided placing nest cavities in areas with dense vegetation and abandoned colony sites when they became overgrown. Vegetation would impede excavation and decrease the detectability of predators. <b>Bee-eaters</b> may prefer colony sites near water bodies showing water chemistries indicative of more biological productivity, especially {{in relation to the}} diversity and abundance of their major prey, dragonflies...|$|R

5|$|Bee-eaters may nest {{as single}} pairs, loose colonies or dense colonies. Smaller species tend to nest solitarily, while {{medium-sized}} bee-eaters have small colonies, and larger and migratory species nest in large colonies that can {{number in the}} thousands. In some instances, colonies may contain more than one species of <b>bee-eater.</b> In species that nest gregariously, breeding pairs may be assisted by up to five helpers, These birds may alternate between breeding themselves and helping in successive years.|$|E
5|$|Depictions in {{classical}} art are rare for such striking birds. The only known Ancient Egyptian {{example is a}} relief, probably of a little green <b>bee-eater,</b> on a wall of Queen Hatshepsut's mortuary temple, and an early Roman mural depicting blue-cheeked bee-eaters {{was found in the}} villa of Agrippina. Bee-eaters have been depicted on the postage stamps of at least 38 countries, the European and Carmine bee-eaters being the most common subjects, with 18 and 11 countries respectively.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other species}} and {{subspecies}} {{have been removed}} over the years: Cetti's warbler (in 1976); long-tailed skua (in 1979); common crane and ring-billed gull (in 1987); surf scoter, little egret, European <b>bee-eater,</b> Pallas's warbler and woodchat shrike (in 1990); green-winged teal (in 1992); ring-necked duck, greater short-toed lark and little bunting (in 1993); white-tailed eagle and Kumlien's gull (in 1998); American wigeon, black-crowned night heron and rose-coloured starling (in 2001); and black brant (in 2005).|$|E
50|$|This is {{a species}} which prefers {{somewhat}} more wooded country than most <b>bee-eaters.</b> This attractive bird is readily approached. Just {{as the name}} suggests, <b>bee-eaters</b> predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, which {{are caught in the}} air by sorties from an open perch. Swallowtail has a preference for honeybees.|$|R

5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed <b>bee-eater,</b> is found inside closed rainforest where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
5|$|Open country species, which {{comprise}} {{the majority of}} bee-eaters, have mostly expanded in range as more land is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or limed, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed <b>bee-eater</b> in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to oil palm plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the <b>bee-eater,</b> kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E
