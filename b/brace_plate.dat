30|$|Fractures of {{the distal}} {{third of the}} humerus are {{challenging}} injuries due to their peri-articular location, small size of the distal bone fragments, and the osteopenic quality of the bone in older adults. Methods of management of distal humerus fractures include conservative management using plaster cast immobilization or functional <b>bracing,</b> <b>plate</b> osteosynthesis and intra-medullary nailing [1 – 4]. Stewart et al. proposed that fractures of the distal-third humerus shaft should not be treated by hanging cast because angulation is difficult to control [1]. Sarmiento et al. treated 85 extra-articular comminuted distal-third humeral fractures with a functional brace. The nonunion rate in their series was 4  % and the malunion rate was 16  % (varus angulation in the majority). A decrease {{in the range of}} motion at the elbow and shoulder was another significant problem in their series [2]. Jawa et al. compared the use of functional <b>bracing</b> and <b>plate</b> fixation for extra-articular distal-third diaphyseal fractures of the humerus. They concluded that for extra-articular distal-third diaphyseal humeral fractures, surgical treatment achieves more predictable alignment and potentially quicker return of function but risks iatrogenic nerve injury and infection and the need for reoperation [3].|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} diploma thesis is a {{geostatic}} {{analysis for the}} protection of a deep construction pit for the facility Zeleni park in Koper. This demanding construction pit was dug in sea sediments. Demanding geotechnical conditions required the use of “top-down” method to protect the construction pit with progressive opening of a reinforced concrete diaphragm wall using basement facility plates. Such construction requires a geotechnical calculation of the construction pit considering excavation phases. The main goal of diploma paper is to evaluate the geotechnical research and to make geostatic analyses for construction pit protection observing different material models for soil in undrained, partially drained and drained conditions, followed by a comparison of results. Diploma paper begins with information about the location and soil structure. Geotechnical researches are resumed and implementation technology in relation to construction pit protection is explained. In continuation, comparative calculations of construction pit protection with the diaphragm wall are presented using two material models for soil with isotropic hardening: the Hardening Soil Model (HS) and the Hardening Soil Model with Small-Strain Stiffness (HSS) which also observes small-strain stiffness of the ground. A calculation of maximum axial forces in <b>bracing</b> <b>plates</b> is made for each model with maximum values of transverse forces, bending moments in diaphragm wall and diaphragm wall shifts. Diaphragm wall was dimensioned for all analyses. Results of geotechnical analyses confirmed the reasonable use of the HSS model which observes small-strain stiffness of the ground. Calculation shifts of protection construction and the background are more realistic when the ground is considered for small strain, with less force impact on the diaphragm wall and on <b>bracing</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R

BRBFs with braces in eccentric configurations (called BRBF-Es) may accommodate architectural features similar to eccentrically braced frames, and limit damage to the connection regions through 1) the use of beam splices and 2) separation of the column-to-gusset connection which prevents pinching of the <b>brace</b> gusset <b>plate.</b> In this study, the system-level and component-level dynamic performances of conventional BRBF systems are {{compared with those of}} BRBF-E systems.

40|$|European seismic {{design codes}} {{do not take}} into account the {{strength}} and stiffness of the secondary frame action provided by <b>bracing</b> gusset <b>plates</b> of concentrically <b>braced</b> frames (CBFs). This is an attractive assumption for practicing engineers, as it provides simplifications during the analysis and design phases. However, when efficiency and economy are concerned, especially in low-to-moderate seismic regions, this normally neglected frame resource may be interesting to consider in design. Gusset plates can provide a certain degree of stiffness and strength following the bracing failure, and may even prevent global collapse. In particular, when the shear deformation demand of the braced cell remains limited, as in the case of low-to-moderate seismic actions, it may become reasonable to take this extra stiffness and strength into account. Ongoing research project RFSR-CT- 2013 - 00022 MEAKADO investigated this phenomenon by means of experimental and numerical studies with the perspective of setting new inputs for the design rules of the future generation of Eurocodes. This paper presents the results of full scale tests performed inside this research project, which characterized resistance, stiffness, and ductility resources of CBF systems designed for moderate seismicity.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Concentrically braced frames (CBFs) are lateral-load {{resisting}} {{systems that}} consist of diagonal braces which are framed concentrically with {{the intersection of}} either beam-to-column connections or opposing braces. Since the early 1990 s, seismic design of special concentrically braced frames (SCBFs) has placed stringent design and detailing requirements on the <b>braces,</b> gusset <b>plates</b> and related connections. By contrast, CBFs designed before the early 1990 's were designed to much less restrictive specifications than SCBFs. There are few tests of these older CBFs, resulting in uncertainty about their performance and about viable retrofit options. Older CBFs are common in current infrastructure, so the uncertainty in their performance poses a substantial risk. This research project seeks to address this uncertainty. A series of tests have been undertaken to investigate the response of both existing and retrofitted older CBFs. The experimental data from these tests is used to validate evaluation approaches for older CBFs {{and can be used}} for future development of numerical models. The retrofitted systems demonstrate practical methods to increase system ductility and improve seismic performance by mitigating damage. Finally, tools to aid in the seismic evaluation and retrofit of CBFs per ASCE 41 are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} achieve the post {{buckling}} strength of BRB member, AISC seismic design provisions require that gusset plate axial capacity exceed ultimate compressive load of the BRB. The AISC code also requires that the gusset plate instability be considered because recent full scale tests demonstrated that out of plane buckling of a gusset plate occurs prior to BRB ultimate load. In this paper an analytical investigation is used to investigate inelastic compressive behavior and strength of gusset plates in BRBFs by finite element software considering plates of different dimensions. In order to verify analytical results one full scale tests was carried out on a simplified gusset plate connection. Also to increase gusset plate buckling strength and improve its energy absorption behavior, effects of adding free edge stiffeners at different sizes have been investigated {{and the results are}} presented.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Concentrically braced frames (CBFs) are broadly used as lateral-load {{resisting}} {{systems in}} buildings throughout the US. In high seismic regions, special concentrically braced frames (SCBFs) where ductility under seismic loading is necessary. Their large elastic stiffness and strength efficiently sustains the seismic demands during smaller, more frequent earthquakes. During large, infrequent earthquakes, SCBFs exhibit highly nonlinear behavior due to brace buckling and yielding and the inelastic behavior induced by secondary deformation of the framing system. These response modes reduce the system demands relative to {{an elastic system}} without supplemental damping. In design the re reduced demands are estimated using a response modification coefficient, commonly termed the R factor. The R factor values {{are important to the}} seismic performance of a building. Procedures put forth in FEMAP 695 developed to R factors through a formalized procedure with the objective of consistent level of collapse potential for all building types. The primary objective of the research was to evaluate the seismic performance of SCBFs.

Tests conducted on more than 50 specimens confirm that the proposed BRBs employing double steel cores encased in twin steel tubes and infill concrete can stably sustain severe inelastic cyclic axial strain reversals. The double-cored BRBs can be conveniently connected to the gusset plate as in the traditional double-tee <b>brace</b> to gusset <b>plate</b> connections. Experiments include cyclic tests of BRB components and large scale single bay V-shaped buckling restrained braced frames (BRBFs). Test {{results indicate that the}} 2 mm thick silicon rubber sheets are effective in minimizing the difference between the cyclic peak compressive and tensile forces of the BRBs. The three V-shaped BRBF tests confirm that the steel brace core strain demands can be satisfactorily predicted from the story drift demand by geometry and incorporating the inelastic core length ratio. Test results also reveal that at a large story drift, the tensile strain in the tension brace was always greater than the compressive strain in the compression brace.

Fülöp and Dubina (2004) tested three X-braced screw-connected wall specimens (3.6  m long ×  2.44  m high) under in-plane lateral loading. Of the three wall specimens, one was tested monotonically and two cyclically. The walls were constructed of a cold-formed steel frame. The screw connection configuration was selected to facilitate yielding {{along the length of the}} brace, i.e., to avoid net section fracture of the strap through the screw holes. Chord members were constructed of double stud members, such that inelastic deformations and ultimate failure of the walls would be limited to the braces. U profiles were placed in the tracks at corner locations to increase the hold-down capacity and rigidity. Local buckling of the lower track was observed during loading with damage being concentrated in corner areas. Plastic elongation of the strap did take place; however because of the unexpected failure of the corners, the results of the experiments may not necessarily reflect the true ductility of a braced wall if yielding (and failure) had been limited to the straps. Fülöp and Dubina suggested that the ideal configuration of the corners would be such that the uplift force is directly transmitted from the brace or corner stud to the anchoring bolt, without inducing bending in the bottom track. Failure to strengthen the corners can have a significant effect on the initial rigidity of the system and can be the cause of larger than expected in-plane shear deformations of the wall and premature failure of the braced frame.|$|R

40|$|Cast modular {{components}} {{have been}} under development for earthquake resistant steel structures. These concepts {{take advantage of the}} versatility in geometry afforded with the casting process to create components specifically configured for ductile behavior. Two systems were developed as part of this dissertation research: (1) the Cast Modular Ductile Bracing system (CMDB); (2) the Floating Brace system (FB). The CMDB system makes use of cast components introduced at the ends and the center of the brace to produce a special bracing detail with reliable strength, stiffness and deformation capacity. The system takes advantage of the versatility in geometry offered by the casting process to create configurations that eliminate non-ductile failure modes in favor of stable inelastic deformation capacity. This thesis presents analytical research performed to determine the buckling strength and buckling direction of the bracing element based on the geometries of the cast components. Limiting geometries are determined for the cast components to control the buckling direction. Design formulas for buckling strength are proposed. The Floating Brace system is a new lateral bracing concept developed for steel special concentric braced frames. The concept uses a set of special plate details {{at the end of the}} brace to create a stiff, strong and ductile lateral <b>bracing</b> system. The <b>plates</b> are arranged such that some provide direct axial support for high initial stiffness and elimination of fatigue issues for daily service wind loads. The remaining plates are oriented transverse to the brace and thus provide ductile bending response for the rare earthquake event, in which the axial plates become sacrificial. The main bracing member and cast pieces remain elastic or nearly elastic. Thus, following the seismic event, the plates can be replaced. In this thesis, analytical studies using nonlinear finite element analysis are performed to determine the optimum: (a) relative strength of the end connection to the brace; and (b) ratio of strength between axial and transverse plates. Design equations are provided. Prototypes for each concept were developed. Castings were created. Large scale laboratory physical testing was performed as experimental verification (proof of concept) for the two systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} seismic response of concentrically braced steel frames (CBFs). Twelve shake table tests were performed on full-scale single storey frames, each containing a pair of identical brace members. The experimental programme examined the behaviour of brace members with four different square and rectangular hollow cross-sections {{and a range of}} gusset plate connection details. The aim of the experimental {{study was to determine the}} influence of <b>brace</b> and gusset <b>plate</b> properties on CBF response from serviceability to ultimate limit states, including collapse. Consequently, all test frames were subjected to three levels of seismic excitation: (i) low-level excitation to examine elastic frame response, (ii) medium-level excitation to examine brace buckling and yielding effects, and (iii) high-level excitation to induce brace fracture. A detailed set of data on the seismic response of CBFs with realistic brace members and connections were obtained from the tests. The experiments were conducted under representative dynamic response conditions as opposed to the conventional idealised quasi-static loading procedures employed in previous experimental investigations of CBF behaviour. The results faithfully capture the behaviour of brace-gusset plate test specimens with different non-dimensional brace slenderness, brace cross-section slenderness, connection types and gusset plate detailing. The response variables measured in each test included the shaking table and frame accelerations and displacements, brace elongation and axial force, and brace member and gusset plate strains. The experimental observations include elastic frame vibration properties, acceleration and drift demands, ultimate failure modes and ductility capacity. The brace-gusset plate test specimens remained elastic at low-level excitations, brace buckling and yielding occurred in all medium-level excitation tests, while specimens exhibited brace fracture under high-level excitation. Fracture did not occur in the gusset plate connections irrespective of whether these were designed using a conventional design method with a Standard Linear Clearance (SLC), or a balanced design with an Elliptical Clearance (EC). However, the balanced design approach showed more uniform distribution of plastic strains and led to higher brace ductility capacities when compared to the conventional design method. Based on the test results, available methods for predicting the ductility of bracing members are compared and assessed, and a number of considerations for design are highlighted and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} moment resisting frames (RC-MRFs) {{have been}} widely used as the main structural resisting systems for over 30 years based on their capacity in resisting both gravity loads and lateral forces like winds or earthquakes and on low cost of construction. However, there have been still many existing RC-MRFs not designed according to any modern seismic code. This may lead to some undesired failures under a rather low intensity earthquake. There are several existing retrofitting systems available for seismically retrofitting RC-MRFs, such as steel <b>braces,</b> steel <b>plate</b> or RC shear walls, base isolators…In those, some are able to increase the stiffness, strength, deformation and energy absorbing capacity of the structures and some are able to reduce the influence of the seismic actions on the structure. Despite having advantage in increasing the stiffness and strength for the buildings, the use of bulky systems like RC shear walls to retrofit buildings under seismic actions becomes more limited due to its complication in erection and high costs for foundation. The use of lighter retrofitting systems such as steel braces or shear walls made from steel or aluminium… has been becoming more favourable. Made from sheet steel or various alloys by cutting and simultaneous stretching cold, expanded metal is considered as a macro-foam material. An expanded metal panel (EMP) with rectangular dimensions of 1. 25 m x 2. 5 m having many rhomb shape stitches with different geometrical sizes is the popular product. Currently it is employed primarily in the areas of protection (fencing, gates) and architecture.

The work plan includes two main parts. This first part will set the EMP over existing techniques and see if its use is justified in the context of earthquake resistance. In addition, a more detailed description of the EMP is considered. In this way, the different data required for modelling the new resistance system are known and analyzes, tests and comparisons can be made in order to validate the use of EMP in the context of earthquake resistance. A complete study on pure shear behaviour of EMP under monotonic and quasi-static cyclic loading has been developed including experimental, theoretical and numerical investigations. To apply EMP in seismically retrofitting RC-MRFs, thirty two RC-MRFs have been designed according to two codes EC 2 and EC 8. The seismic performance of the studied frames has been evaluated using Pushover and NLTH analyses. For the frames designed according to EC 2 or EC 8 with low ductility, some prominent deficiencies are found, such as incomplete load path or the soft-story failure. Based on the knowledge of deficiencies of the existing frames, many attempts to exploit EMP to seismically retrofit the existing frames have been made. All frames designed according to EC 2 and EC 8 with Low Ductility Class need to retrofit because they cannot reach the target displacements due to premature failure of beam-column joints. To seismically retrofit them by using EMP, a design procedure based on Direct Displacement Based Design (DDBD) has been proposed. The design is an iterative procedure, starting with the selection of the target displacements at the top based on the results from Pushover analysis. They are usually less than the limit displacements at which RC frames collapse due to crushing of the concrete at beam-column joints. These displacements are also the target ones for the retrofitted frames. The results from design procedure proposed are significantly affected by some typical factors such as selected target displacements and capacity of the existing frames contributing to overall resistance of the retrofitted frames, equivalent viscous damping of the EMP and MRFs as well as geometrical dimensions of the existing frames. The retrofitted design results, assessed by Pushover and NLTH analyses, have indicated that DDDB is a useful tool to design EMP to seismically retrofit the existing frames. With EMP, all retrofitted frames can reach target displacements under design earthquakes without any brittle failure, not like the original frames. However, EMP cannot improve the behaviour of the beam-column joints. Under the earthquakes greater than design ones, failure of the nodes is still observed in all retrofitted frames. The comparison of the seismic performance of the frames before and after being retrofitted has shown that EMP is able to reduce the influence of the earthquake on the original frames by increasing their strength and stiffness and by absorbing the seismic energy. Proposed design procedure of connection between EMP and the frame elements is applicable. This was verified in the experiments when connecting EMP with the steel testing frames. The design approach for the connection is based on Capacity Design, all starting with the maximum resistance of the bars in a rhomb-shape stitch of the EMP and the tension field action developed in the EMP during shear loading. However, it is necessary to perform tests on the connections between EMP and the RC beams and columns. Also, improved practical details can be developed...|$|R
