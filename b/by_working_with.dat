5|$|In 1895 and 1896 {{the ruins}} at Abydos, Tukh, Hierakonpolis and Gebelein were excavated. In 1892 Jacques de Morgan, Director of Antiquities in Egypt, proved that pottery found at Abydos and Nakadah pre-dated the dynastic period, {{stimulating}} interest by many European Archaeologists. As each excavation was completed, local Egyptian residents {{would continue to}} search the sites for remains. In 1895 E. A. Wallis Budge, {{on behalf of the}} British Museum, procured inscribed coffins and funerary furniture from the 12th Dynasty tombs at Al-Barshah <b>by</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> the Egyptian Service of Antiquities. Budge started purchasing predynastic finds from the locals including bowls, spear and arrow heads, carved flint and bone figures and partial human remains (described as chiefly bones without skin or flesh remaining).|$|E

5|$|In 1905, a {{gold medal}} {{competition}} {{was sponsored by the}} Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to make his own glassware, creating test tubes with the required elliptical cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and <b>by</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|United States Army Special Forces (SF) aka Green Berets perform several doctrinal missions: {{unconventional}} warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, {{direct action}} and counter-terrorism. These missions make Special Forces {{unique in the}} U.S. military, because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war. Foreign internal defense operations, SF's main peacetime mission, {{are designed to help}} friendly developing nations <b>by</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> their military and police forces to improve their technical skills, understanding of human rights issues, and to help with humanitarian and civic action projects. Special Forces unconventional warfare capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces. Special Forces are the U.S. military's premier unconventional warfare force. Foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare missions are the bread and butter of Special Forces soldiers. For this reason SF candidates are trained extensively in weapons, engineering, communications and medicine. SF soldiers are taught to be warriors first and teachers second because they must be able to train their team and be able to train their allies during a FID or UW mission. Often SF units are required to perform additional, or collateral, activities outside their primary missions. These collateral activities are coalition warfare/support, combat search and rescue, security assistance, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian de-mining and counter-drug operations.|$|E
