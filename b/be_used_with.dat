(plug adaptors and block adaptors) Plug adaptors are rated for 232/240 bar, and can only <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> valves which are designed to accept them. Block adaptors are generally rated for 200 bar, and can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> almost any 200 bar DIN valve.|$|E
5|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} {{with normal}} water {{cannot be used}} for 1H NMR measurements but heavy water, D2O, must be used instead. 13C NMR data, however, can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> normal water and 1H NMR spectra can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> non-aqueous media. The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts, as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, {{such as those of}} 31P can be measured.|$|E

The older style piano continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed the Suitcase Piano, with 88 note models also becoming available.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the development of}} word order in German children's spontaneous production of complement clauses. From soon idler their second birthday. young German children use both verb-final complements with complementizers and verb-second complements without complementizers. By their third birthday they use both kinds of complement clauses {{with a variety of}} complement-taking verbs. Early in development, however, verb-final complements and verb-second complements <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> separate sets of complement-taking verbs, and they <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> separate sets of item-specific main-clause phrases. For example, initially phrases such as 'I want to see' <b>were</b> <b>used</b> exclusively <b>with</b> verb-final complements, whereas phrases such as 'do you see' and 'you have to say' <b>were</b> <b>used</b> exclusively <b>with</b> verb-second complements. Only later in development when specific complement-taking verbs <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> both verb-second and verb-final complements, with a greater variety of main-clause phrases, and when specific main-clause phrases <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> both verb-second and verb-final complements was there evidence for structural links between these various, item-based, complement-clause constructions. ...|$|R
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{have two}} sets of affixes that are attached to a verb to indicate the person of its arguments.

It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, {{similar to that}} of other object-oriented languages such as C++, and a standard exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> the foreach language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.|$|E

5|$|Radiotherapy {{is often}} given {{together}} with chemotherapy, and may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> curative intent {{in people with}} NSCLC who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.|$|E
