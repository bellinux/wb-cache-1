40|$|The São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, {{is one of}} {{the most}} densely {{populated}} urban regions in the world and pollutants originated in the exhaust of vehicles heavily affect it. The addition of ethanol to gasoline (> 20 %), the use of cars running on pure alcohol, the restrictions in the circulation of vehicles and the utilization of electronic fuel injection and catalyst, have made the problem of pollution to get better levels. But this is not enough, and these measurements cannot be applied to the 25, 000 buses running on diesel. Also, it is estimated that about 400, 000 trucks, also running on diesel, circulate in the region. This points to the SPMR as an ideal place for the introduction and testing of new technologies for vehicular pollution reduction. In order to launch a fuel cell bus project using hydrogen produced by electrolysis, Brazil formed a team integrated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy, Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de São Paulo S. A. – EMTU (metropolitan bus authority) and University of São Paulo- USP. The project is being financed by the Global Environment Facility, under United Nations Development Program implementation. The main objectives of the Brazilian Project are: i) to demonstrate the feasibility of the introduction of fuel cell buses in the existing urban transportation infrastructure, ii) to decrease the present cost of the fuel cell bus by promoting their mass production and generalized use, and iii) to set the basis for the introduction of this type of clean bus. The different phases of the Brazilian project are: Phase 1 : Pre-feasibility study and proposed strategy Phase 2 : Running a fleet of 8 fuel cell <b>buses</b> <b>Phase</b> 3 : Scale up a facility for 200 buses operating from a single garage Phase 4 : Commercial and industrial roll out...|$|R

40|$|International audience—The aim of {{this paper}} is to apply {{probabilistic}} load flow methods on a three phases, unbalanced low voltage distribution network. We use a point estimate method and a Monte Carlo simulation based method to estimate the electrical characteristics (<b>buses</b> voltage, <b>phases</b> and neutral conductors currents) of a distribution grid in presence of a large number of small size photovoltaic generators. Probabilistic load flow allows us to take into account the uncertainty of photovoltaic production and load consumption in load flow computation. The literature shows that PEM method gives good accuracy results while requiring less time simulation than Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper, we aim to check if this assumption is still right with different kinds of probability density function and for a large size electrical network. Usually, random parameters are modeled as a normal distribution. In this work, a generalized extreme value is used to model load consumption behaviour instead of a normal one. The uncertainty of photovoltaic production is supposed to be directly linked to the sky clear index which is modeled as a beta distribution...|$|R

In its conclusion, the UCLA researchers found that the safest design was a 28-inch high padded seatback spaced a maximum of 24 inches apart, using the concept of compartmentalization as a passive restraint. [...] While the UCLA researchers found the compartmentalized seats to be the safest design, they found active restraints (such as seatbelts) to be next in terms of importance of passenger safety.|$|R

40|$|This study assesses {{a number}} of policy options that could help reduce ground level ozone {{pollution}} in Beijing. Ground level ozone pollution {{is one of the}} most significant air pollution problems in big cities in China. Because of the complex way in which ozone is formed, it is difficult for policy makers to identify optimal control options on a cost-effective basis. The study assesses a range of options to address this problem. It compares the effectiveness and economic costs of these options, and then recommends the most effective sequence in which the options should be adopted to realize pollution control at the lowest cost. The study finds that the installation of oil gas recovery systems at Beijing's 1446 gasoline stations would be the most cost-effective option. Overall, it is found that options to reduce ozone pollution by cutting vehicular emissions are much more cost-effective than options to "clean-ip" coal-fired plants. A series of options for controlling vehicular emissions have been introduced, including substituting gasoline buses with clean fuel <b>buses</b> and <b>phasing</b> out high emission vehicles (those with low emission standards) in Beijing. The study also highlights that cost-effective pollution control can be achieved by, for example, better practices when refueling vehicles. The results of this research are expected to help decision makers to bate ozone pollution in a cost-effective way. pollution, China...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the optimal control of load-shedding problem in smart grids where {{a number of}} transmission lines are {{to be taken out}} of service. The objective is to achieve the minimum interruption of power generation and load at the transmission level, subject to the AC power flow dynamics, the load and generation capacity of the <b>buses,</b> and the <b>phase</b> angle limit across the transmission lines. For this optimal control problem with binary constraints, we show that all decision variables are separable except for the nonlinear power flow equations. We develop an iterative decomposition algorithm, which converts the load shedding problem into a sequence of smaller subproblems. We show that the subproblems are either convex problems that can be solved efficiently or nonconvex problems that have closed-form solutions. Consequently, our algorithm is scalable for large networks. Furthermore, we prove global convergence of our algorithm to a critical point and the objective value is guaranteed to decrease throughout the iterations.

5000|$|Delhi {{has one of}} India's largest bus {{transport}} systems. Buses are {{the most}} popular means of transport catering to about 60% of Delhi's total demand. Buses are operated by the state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), which owns largest fleet of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)-fueled buses in the world, private Blueline bus operators and several chartered bus operators. It is mandatory for all private bus operators to acquire a permit from the State Transport Authority. The buses traverse various well-defined intra-city routes. Other than regular routes, buses also travel on Railway Special routes; Metro Feeder routes. Mudrika (Ring) and Bahri Mudrika (Outer Ring) routes along Ring and Outer-Ring road respectively are amongst the longest intra-city bus routes in the world.With the introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and the development of dedicated corridors for the service, bus service is set to improve. The DTC has started introducing air-conditioned buses and brand new low-floor buses (with floor height of 400 mm and even higher on one third area as against 230 mm available internationally.) on city streets to replace the conventional buses. A revamp plan is underway to improve bus-shelters in the city and to integrate GPS systems in DTC buses and bus stops so as to provide reliable information about bus arrivals.In 2007, after public uproar concerning the large number of accidents caused by privately owned Blueline buses, the Delhi government, under pressure from the Delhi High Court decided that all Blueline <b>Buses</b> shall be <b>phased</b> out and be eventually replaced by low floor buses of the state-owned DTC.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy and was awarded by Brunel University on 6 / 4 / 2011. The research addresses the emergent {{nature of culture}} in global Information Systems / Information Technology (IS/IT) outsourcing relationships. Considering the broadly recognized role of culture in Global Outsourcing (GLOS), it builds on existing literature and it identifies three research issues that support the need to address culture in a global IS/IT relationship as emergent. These issues involve: a. A literature “gap” and low research granularity of existing research, b. The tendency to examine culture in IS/IT as either national or organizational, with no adequate research examining the dynamic nature of culture in GLOS collaboration, and c. The unique nature of GLOS culture, which is not stable but emergent. In order to address emergence, the thesis applies a cultural systems perspective, {{which is used to}} describe the emergent GLOS culture as related to a GLOS cultural system. An initial model is thus developed, according to which GLOS culture emerges from a GLOS cultural system, and the GLOS cultural system results from the combination of cultural characteristics of separate organizations within the GLOS context. This GLOS cultural system is related to Attitudes and Behaviors (A&B), the Environment, Interactivity, and Control. Using the philosophical perspective of interpretivism and a qualitative methodology, two pilot studies and a series of case studies were conducted. Due to its increasing reliance on outsourcing strategies, the automotive industry was used as the industry-based setting of the research and, more specifically, the phases related to the production of Electronic System (ES) of coaches and <b>buses.</b> Each <b>phase</b> involves the relationship between the client (AC) and one of its three suppliers (AS 1, AS 2, AS 3), all residing in different countries (three across Europe and one in Asia). The analysis of the two pilot cases (GC, DS) helped finalize the interview agenda, which was then used in the four in-depth case studies that describe the relationship between AC and each individual supplier (AC-AS 1, AC-AS 2, AC-AS 3). A thematic analysis was applied to the interview data, leading to an extended version of the initial model. According to the new extended model, the GLOS cultural system, through Mechanisms and Processes, expresses an emergent GLOS culture, which is related to extended versions of the concepts discussed in the initial model. More specifically, in the extended model, emergent GLOS culture is related to Attitudes, Behaviors, and Cognition (ABC), Context, Interactivity, and Regulation. The extended model also extends the concept of the initial model, further reflecting the emergent nature of emergence of the GLOS culture. Therefore, it associates Attitudes, Behaviors, and Cognition (ABC) with the dimensions of we-they and abstract-expressed, Context with the dimensions of environment and definition, Interactivity with the dimensions of relationship and exchange, and Regulation with the dimensions of control and feedback. The contribution of the extended model is demonstrated through validation by professionals and original participants in the study. The model also expresses the uniqueness of each GLOS collaboration and analyzes emergent GLOS culture in terms of specific cultural attributes, as they emerge within the GLOS relationship. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth description of the nature of emergent culture in global collaboration, and its contribution is discussed from a theoretical, practical, and methodological perspective. The thesis also addresses lessons learned, research limitations, and proposals for further research. Overall, the thesis offers an in-depth approach to understanding culture in GLOS relationships. Building on the concept of emergence, as addressed in existing literature, the study extends the discussion of culture beyond the national – organizational level and it offers a list of cultural attributes (themes) related to emergence. Using empirical industry-based evidence from countries selected across various economic and sociopolitical level, and an industry (automotive) that demonstrates a growing interest in outsourcing strategies, it discusses an emergent approach to culture, focusing exclusively on IS/IT GLOS. The emergent GLOS culture extends beyond mere summation of cultural characteristics of collaborating organizations. It allows for dynamism and adjustability, and, at the same time, it offers a new way of capturing, addressing, and explaining the uniqueness of the culture of every GLOS relationship...|$|R
