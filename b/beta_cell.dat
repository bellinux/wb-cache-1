25|$|Around 200 {{mutations}} of {{the human}} glucokinase gene GCK have been discovered, that can change the efficiency of glucose binding and phosphorylation, increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of <b>beta</b> <b>cell</b> insulin secretion in response to glucose, and producing clinically significant hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.|$|E

They {{are based on}} studies in rodents reporting nicotinamide protection against beta-cell injury in vitro and in vivo. This study examines whether nicotinamide can protect human <b>beta</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro. At concentrations (2 and 5 mmol/l) to protect rat <b>beta</b> <b>cells</b> against necrosis by streptozotocin or hydrogen peroxide, nicotinamide prevents hydrogen peroxide-induced necrosis of human <b>beta</b> <b>cells.</b> As with rat <b>beta</b> <b>cells,</b> nicotinamide fails to protect human <b>beta</b> <b>cells</b> against apoptosis induced {{by a combination of}} the cytokines interleukin- 1 beta, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. In rat <b>beta</b> <b>cells,</b> nicotinamide (2 to 20 mmol/l) was also found to induce apoptosis, in particular during the days following its protection against necrosis; this cytotoxic effect was not observed with human <b>beta</b> <b>cells.</b> These data demonstrate that nicotinamide can protect human <b>beta</b> <b>cells</b> against radical-induced necrosis, but not against cytokine-induced apoptosis.

25|$|Beta {{cells in}} the islets of Langerhans release insulin in two phases. The first-phase release is rapidly {{triggered}} in response to increased blood glucose levels, and lasts about 10 minutes. The second phase is a sustained, slow release of newly formed vesicles triggered independently of sugar, peaking in 2 to 3 hours. Reduced first-phase insulin release may be the earliest detectable <b>beta</b> <b>cell</b> defect predicting onset of type2 diabetes. First-phase release and insulin sensitivity are independent predictors of diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cases of}} {{diabetes}} {{are caused by}} the body's tissue receptors not responding to insulin (even when insulin levels are normal, which is what separates it from type2 diabetes); this form is very uncommon. Genetic mutations (autosomal or mitochondrial) can lead to defects in <b>beta</b> <b>cell</b> function. Abnormal insulin action {{may also have been}} genetically determined in some cases. Any disease that causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes (for example, chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis). Diseases associated with excessive secretion of insulin-antagonistic hormones can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins damage pancreatic beta cells. The ICD-10 (1992) diagnostic entity, malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus (MRDM or MMDM, ICD-10 code E12), was deprecated by the World Health Organization when the current taxonomy was introduced in 1999.|$|E

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of ATP-sensitive K+(KATP) channels in pancreatic <b>beta</b> <b>cells</b> {{is a key}} step of insulin secretion induced by glucose. Glucose-induced insulin secretion from the <b>beta</b> <b>cells</b> is selectively impaired in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and in animal models of it. In order to clarify the site of this abnormal glucose response, we studied the effects of insulin secretagogues and sulfhydryl oxidizing agent, 2, 2 '-dithio-bis (5 -nitropyridine) (DTBNP), on KATP channels in single <b>beta</b> <b>cells</b> of neonatally streptozotocin-induced NIDDM rats. We used the patch-clamp technique in cell-attached mode (Vpipette = 0 mV). The inhibitory response to glucose of KATP channels was lacking in NIDDM rats, indicating reduced sensitivity to glucose of the channels. Glyceraldehyde (2 - 5 mM) in the diabetic <b>beta</b> <b>cells</b> elicited the same KATP channel inhibition as that obtained in controls. In contrast, dihydroxyacetone (DHA, 2 - 10 mM) sensitivity of KATP channels was significantly reduced in the <b>beta</b> <b>cells</b> of NIDDM rats.

2500|$|Alloxan is a toxic glucose analogue, which {{selectively}} destroys insulin-producing {{cells in}} the pancreas (that is beta cells) when administered to rodents and many other animal species. This causes an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (called [...] "alloxan diabetes") in these animals, with characteristics similar to type 1 diabetes in humans. Alloxan is selectively toxic to insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells because it preferentially accumulates in beta cells through uptake via the GLUT2 glucose transporter. Alloxan, {{in the presence of}} intracellular thiols, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a cyclic reaction with its reduction product, dialuric acid. The <b>beta</b> <b>cell</b> toxic action of alloxan is initiated by free radicals formed in this redox reaction. Studies suggests that alloxan does not cause diabetes in humans.
