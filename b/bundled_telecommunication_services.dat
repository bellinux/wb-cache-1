40|$|Bundling {{becomes a}} {{dominant}} sales strategy in telecommunications. Dual and triple-play packages are increasingly popular among subscribers. From operators 2 ̆ 019 perspective, a core issue in bundling design is the knowledge about how consumers value packages. In this paper {{we focus on}} elicitation of subscribers willingness to pay for <b>bundles</b> of fixed <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> composed of telephony, Internet and paid TV. We conduct a stated preference discrete choice experiment on a sample of subscribers in Poland, to model subscription choices over packages of fixed services. We obtain estimates of mean willingness to pay as well as entire distributions of reservation prices for single services and possible combinations of bundles. We find that mean WTP for fixed telephony as a stand-alone service or an add-on to bundle is zero. This result suggest that fixed telephony has already become an obsolete service. Out of the three fixed services, Internet generates the biggest value for customers, driving up valuations of bundles. WTP for Internet {{is much higher than}} actually paid prices, leaving space for increase of profits. In contrast fixed telephony and pay TV seem to be overpaid which may create a pressure on operators 2 ̆ 019 revenue...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} technological {{changes in the}} telecommunication industry {{during the last two}} decades.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the critical influence of advertising on consumer choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria. The advertisement {{played a key}} role in providing the consumers with product information. The study investigates the effect of marketing medium of telecommunication as a proxy for advertisement on preference of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> as a proxy for consumer choice in Nigeria. The Binary Logit Model (BLM) and descriptive analytical frameworks are used to evaluate the statistical importance of advertisement, quality of services, income of the consumer, product’s self and related service charges for a consumer choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> through Wald test. The findings show that product’s self service charge and service quality are statistically significant for a consumer choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria at 1 percent significance level. And, related product’s service is statistically significant for a consumer choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria at 5 percent significance level. While advertisement and income of the consumer are statistically significant for a consumer choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria at 10 percent. The study concludes that advertisement is important for the choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria but having less impact. And, product’s self service charge and service quality are hugely significant for the choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria. Therefore, the sector of telecommunications needs more investment in advertisement so as to have telecommunications’ products information spread in order to stimulate the increase in demand for <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sets out}} to examine the {{competitive}} relationships that exist within the telecommunications market using the niche theory on the personal gratifications and system gratifications dimensions. The findings from the analysis of 363 survey responses indicate that traditional and contemporary <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> offer different specializations to satisfy their consumers. Overall, mobile <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> partially replace wired services, on personal gratifications dimensions in particular. The system gratifications dimensions of the wired <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> facilitate the existence of wired <b>services.</b> New <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> (3 G and VoIP) partially replace old <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> (home landline and 2 G) in providing greater satisfaction in entertainment. The results also demonstrate that VoIP does not impose competitive displacement effects on home landline, 2 G, and 3 G services. Limitation and suggestions are discussed.

A methodology applying MDA (Model Driven Architecture) to new generation <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> creation within web service based Service-oriented Architecture (SoA) environment is proposed. According to <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> characteristics, MdTSMF extends the CIM (Computation Independent Model) of MDA. In PIM (Platform Independent Model) phase, UML Profile {{is used to}} abstract service related meta-model, including <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> meta-model, SLA based QoS meta-model and service supporting function meta-model. A method for transformation rules from PIM to Web Service PSM (Platform Specific Model) is discussed. At last, MdTSMF presents two possible approaches to validate UML based service models...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the development of}} the Brazilian <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> sector in the neo-Schumpeterian Evolutionary Theory perspective. We sought to determine whether the Brazilian technological regime characteristics fits into the international scene; to map the innovation environment in which <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> operate; and to consider whether the state post-privatization of the sector encouraged the construction of a technological regime and innovation environment capable of promoting the development of Brazil. The research was developed based on documental analysis and on the Technological Innovation Research (PINTEC) data for 2005 and 2008. The technological regime was established according to Marsili’s (2001) taxonomy. The paper concludes that the technological regime of Brazilian <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> has similarities with the U. S. standard and tends to be a supplier dominated sector. The innovation environment showed that the legal-organizational structure specific to the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> sector does not accompany the innovative dynamism of the sector.
