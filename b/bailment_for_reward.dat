2500|$|This {{principle}} of Isaac v Clark (see immediately supra) was extended in Manders v. Williams [...] where {{the court found}} that a bailee had a <b>bailment</b> <b>for</b> a period of time, and not merely at the will of the bailor. In other words, there had to be an agreement, similar to a contractual arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|American {{hospitality}} statutes also govern bailments. A bailment is the “delivery of {{an item of}} property, {{for some}} purpose, with the expressed or implied understanding that the person receiving it shall return {{it in the same}} or similar condition in which it was received, when the purpose has been completed.” [...] Coat checks, safety deposit boxes, and luggage storage are common examples of <b>bailments</b> <b>for</b> the hospitality industry.|$|R
5000|$|Herdshare advocates {{maintain}} that the dairy farmer operating a herdshare is merely an [...] "agister" [...] who holds the cows in <b>bailment</b> <b>for</b> the cow's owners, the shareholders. However, some courts in the United States reject this interpretation of the herdshare agreement refusing {{to find that the}} shareholder has a legitimate claim to ownership in the herd; rather, those courts have found that the shareholder merely has a claim to the milk produced by the herd and that as such the agreement constitutes an unlawful exchange of consideration for raw milk.|$|R

"Wherefore I decide that, as Henry {{intended}} to let Rollo have the dipper {{for the whole}} expedition, and as he took Rollo's basket, and Rollo agreed to let him have some drink, as conditions, therefore, he ought not to have reclaimed the dipper. Since he did reclaim it, Rollo did perfectly right to give it up, fish and all; and as he did so, it was a <b>bailment</b> <b>for</b> {{the benefit of the}} bailee, that is, Henry. And of course it was at his risk, and, in strict justice, Rollo has a right to claim compensation for the loss of his fish. But then I should hope he won't insist upon it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fixed term vs. {{indefinite}} term. A bailor {{who leaves}} property for a fixed term may be deemed to have abandoned the property {{if it is}} not removed {{at the end of the}} term, or it may convert to an involuntary <b>bailment</b> <b>for</b> a reasonable time (e.g., abandoned property in a bank safe, eventually escheats to the state, and the treasurer may hold it for some period, awaiting the owner). However, if there is no clear term of bailment agreed upon, the goods cannot be considered abandoned unless the bailee is given notice that the bailor wishes to give up possession of the goods. Frequently, in the case of storage of goods, the bailee also acquires a contractual or statutory right to dispose of the goods to satisfy overdue rent; a lawful conversion of bailed goods.|$|R
50|$|The 1843 Illinois case of Johnson v. Weedman {{was argued}} {{by a young}} Abraham Lincoln. The case was {{somewhat}} similar {{to the case of}} Fouldes v Willoughby , which had been decided two years earlier. It may have been taken as precedent in this present case. (see supra). A horse had been left in <b>bailment</b> <b>for</b> proper care. The bailee who was in possession of the horse rode it for 15 miles. There was no demonstrable damage to the horse. Lincoln convinced the court that there could be no action for damages. There was not enough evidence for the bailee to be held liable for a conversion, or for an action in trover. There had been no significant invasion of the owner's rights. The Illinois court agreed, and Lincoln won the day.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to measure the effects of task difficulty and reward opportunity on motivation. The participants, 20 undergraduate students, were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four experimental conditions: reward opportunity-hard proofreading task, reward opportunity-easy proofreading task, no reward opportunity-hard proofreading task, or no reward opportunity-easy proofreading task. It was hypothesized that the participants offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> would perform better than those not offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> by indicating and correcting more spelling and grammatical errors. Also, it was hypothesized that participants offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> would return the completed proofreading task quicker than participants not offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward.</b> Two, 2 x 2 ANOVAs were carried out with the results showing no main effects of task difficulty or opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> on number of errors corrected or time of return (in days), indicating no change in motivation. As the original hypothesis was not supported, issues with the study and areas for further research were discussed...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Statistics {{on private}} road freight {{transportation}} services (not <b>for</b> <b>reward)</b> (defined as: “a business’s own vehicles {{that are used}} to transport its own products to its own customers”) are very limited in South Africa. Statistics South Africa’s (SSA) research focuses on road freight carriers <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> and excludes the data on private (not <b>for</b> <b>reward)</b> carriers. The CSIR in 2004 published a report entitled Second Annual State of Logistics Survey for South Africa. The focus of this study was on land freight transport, i. e. road and rail. Maritime, air and pipeline volumes were not included in this study’s scope. Therefore, the number of studies investigating the private (not <b>for</b> <b>reward)</b> road freight market and even the total freight market in South Africa is limited to the above-mentioned two sources and the Rand Afrikaans University’s (RAU) 1991 -study (published in 1993), entitled Freight Transport Survey.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{evolution}} and the co-evolution of both characteristics of reciprocity- {{the willingness to}} reward friendly behavior and the willingness to punish hostile behavior. Firstly, both preferences <b>for</b> <b>rewarding</b> and preferences <b>for</b> punishing can survive in evolution provided individuals interact within separate groups. This holds even with randomly formed groups and even when individual preferences are unobservable. Secondly, preferences <b>for</b> <b>rewarding</b> survive only in coexistence with self-interested preferences, but preferences for punishing tend either to vanish or to dominate the population entirely. Finally, the evolution of preferences <b>for</b> <b>rewarding</b> {{and the evolution of}} preferences for punishing influence each other decisively. The existence of rewarders enhances the evolutionary success of punishers, but punishers crowd out rewarders...|$|R
