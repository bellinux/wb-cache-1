40|$|Comunicación oral presentada en la European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2016 Vienna | Austria | 17 – 22 April 2016 Lava tubes, {{like other}} caves, contain {{a variety of}} speleothems formed in the initial stage of a lava tube {{formation}} or due to leaching and subsequent precipitation of secondary minerals. Primary and secondary mineral formations in lava caves {{are mainly composed of}} silicate minerals, although secondary minerals common in limestone caves have been also reported in this type of caves. In addition, unusual colored deposits have been found on the walls and ceilings of lava tubes, some of them of unknown origin and composition. A brown to black-colored mud-like deposits was observed in “Llano de los Caños” Cave, La Palma Island, Canary Islands, Spain. These <b>black</b> <b>deposits</b> coat the wall and ceiling of the lava tube where sub-horizontal fractures occur. FESEM-EDS, X-ray micro-computed tomography and mineralogical analyses were conducted for morphological, 3 D microstructural and compositional characterization of these unusual speleothem samples. These techniques revealed that they are mainly composed of amorphous materials, suggesting an organic carbon composition. Hence, analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS), solid-state 13 C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and stable isotope analysis were applied to assess the nature and origin of the <b>black</b> <b>deposits.</b> The combination of these analytical tools permits the identification of specific biomarkers (di- and triterpenoids) for tracing the potential sources of the organic compounds in the speleothems. For comparison purposes, samples from the topsoil and overlaying vegetation were also analyzed. Chromatograms resulting from the Py-GC/MS showed an abundance of polysaccharides, lipids and terpenoids typically derived from the vegetation of the area (Erica arborea). In addition, levoglucosan, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and N-containing heterocyclic compounds were detected. They probably derived from the leaching of charred vegetation resulting from a wildfire occurred in the area in 2012. The lack of the typical pattern of odd-over-even in the series of n-alkanes observed for the topsoil and <b>black</b> <b>deposits</b> has been recognized as an indication of fire. The 13 C NMR spectrum of the <b>black</b> <b>deposits</b> showed a mixture of alkyl and O-alkyl compounds, carboxylic compounds and polysaccharides. Stable isotope analysis of δ 13 C performed on the cave <b>black</b> <b>deposits,</b> topsoil and vegetation confirmed that the source of the organic fraction of the sample is a combination of partially charred vegetation (mainly Erica) and organic compounds from the andic soil over the cave. Therefore, these <b>black</b> <b>deposits</b> are the result of an input of plant organic matter and charred vegetation into the cave from rock fractures, which may constitute an important source of energy for cave organisms. the support from the Marie Curie Fellowships within the 7 th European Community Framework Programme (Grants PIEF-GA- 2012 - 328689 -DECAVE and PCIG 12 -GA- 2012 - 333784 -Biocharisma respectively).

40|$|Purpose: To compare {{effectiveness}} of cleaning {{with and without}} rubbing of soft contact lenses. Methods: Three-hundred new biweekly disposable hydrogel lenses (Ocufilcon D, FDA Group IV; 55 % water content) were artificially deposited with serum albumin, hand cream (semi-transparent deposits) and mascara (<b>black</b> <b>deposits).</b> The treated lenses were randomly divided into three groups, each group cleaned by one of three methods of cleaning - Rubbing (R), No-Rub following the manufacturer's instruction on duration of rinsing (NR 1) and No-Rub with a shorter duration of rinsing (NR 2). Four commercially-available multipurpose solutions (MPS) and a saline were used. The cleaning effectiveness {{was determined by the}} amount of deposits remaining on the contact lenses after cleaning, assessed {{with the aid of a}} slit-lamp. The level of deposits remaining (in terms of coverage of lens surface) were determined using a five-point scale [0 (no observable deposits) - 4 (> 80 % deposits remained) ] for semi-transparent deposits (protein and hand cream) and <b>black</b> <b>deposits</b> (mascara). The investigators were masked as to the solutions used (except for one MPS which has a different rinsing time than the other MPS), and the investigator who assessed the deposits left on the lenses did not know which solution or cleaning method was used to clean each lens. Results: Lenses cleaned by the R method were significantly cleaner than those cleaned by methods NR 1 and NR 2. No significant difference was found between lenses cleaned by NR 1 and NR 2 methods. The median grade of deposits for lenses cleaned by R method was 0. 5 for both semi-transparent and <b>black</b> <b>deposits.</b> For lenses cleaned by NR 1 and NR 2 methods, the median grade of deposits left on lens surfaces was 4. 0 for both types of deposits. Different solutions used did not affect the level of deposits left on lens surfaces for all three cleaning methods. Conclusions: Not rubbing the soft lens when cleaning is ineffective in removing loosely-bound deposits. A longer rinse, as recommended by the manufacturers, does not remove significantly more deposits than a shorter rinse with the MPS. This work supports the view that contact lens wearers should be encouraged to rub their lenses when cleaning. School of Optometr...|$|E

40|$|Why {{should the}} mesangial cells be irritated? We {{recently}} observed in some diabetics <b>black</b> <b>deposits</b> beneath and {{on both sides}} of the basement membrane. These appear quite similar to deposits seen in and around the basement membrane in glomerulonephritis and in lupus nephritis. I do not know for sure what they are, but theory says that in glomerulonephritis they probably represent antigen-antibody complexes. There is some evidence to support this. One would assume that in diabetes they might be the same thing. Or they might be some other atypical plasma protein which results from the abnormal pattern of diabetic metabolism. I do not know. I believe this substance may be trapped by the basement membrane. It may be an abnormal substance that is trapped, or it may be an abnormal basement membrane that traps it. As this material is trapped, it is irritating to the mesangial cells and causes them to proliferate and secrete more of the basement membrane-like material. This material gradually fills up the glomeruli, and causes them to become non-functional, ultimately leading to uremia and death. It is of great interest also that these same processes are observed in experimentally-produced diabetes in the dog, a non-hereditary form of diabetes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{suddenly}} appearing large-surface <b>black</b> <b>deposits</b> in living spaces (phenomenon of "Black Magic Dust") {{which has been}} increasingly observed {{in recent years has}} been examined systematically in an extensive program of measurements. Eight housings concerned were selected. In addition to chemical analysis already applied in the past, particular emphasis was laid on the recording and characterization of airborne dust and on thermographic measurements. For investigations, it is important to know if the phenomenon is still "active" at the time of measurement or if it is already "inactive". As claimed in the past, the visible black surfaces are essentially caused by (fine) dust particles. The presence of semivolatile organic compounds (SVOC) on wall surface supports particle absorption. In this context, a distinction must be made between an "adhesive film effect" and an "airborne effect" (fogging). However, no final answer to the question if these effects are alwaiys required "as a first step" for creating these phenomena could be obtained. Time resolved thermography provided proof for colder wall areas, thermal bridges and especially the type for air flow being the decisive factors starting this phenomenon. Besides, the intensity of black precipitations also depends on individual living behaviour. No relation between the phenomenon and outside air influences and VOC emissions could be discerned, the same applies to the simultaneous occurrence with microbial indoor contaminations...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Feather {{discoloration}} in psittacines {{has been}} attributed to aging of feathers, delayed moult, malnutrition, hypothyroidism, and often to liver disease. 1 Feather discoloration due to soiling and subsequent saprophytic fungal growth has been described in flamingoes at Slimbridge England. 2 Feather Fungus in Flamingoes This phenomenon was also observed at Parrot Jungle and Gardens in Miami after a dietary change, which increased the fat content of the diet. The flock of 57 Caribbean flamingoes was housed in a large open-air exhibit approximately 1 acre, with a large fresh water lake. The birds remained almost exclusively in the open sunny center of the exhibit adjoining the lake. The exhibit was surrounded by a well maintained but dense garden. Addition of a high quality dog food to the diet was intended to improve reproductive performance in the stable flock of flamingoes. The dietary change was followed by onset of the rainy season. Flamingoes engaged in nest building activities also tend to soil their plumage with mud used to construct mounds. The plumage, primarily of the back and wings, developed a dark discoloration appearing streaked with black.
