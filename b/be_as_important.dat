5|$|The Sruti and Smriti {{texts of}} Hinduism are an {{important}} historical framework of the Shaktism tradition. In addition, it reveres the texts Devi Mahatmya, the Devi-Bhagavata Purana, and Shakta Upanishads such as the Devi Upanishad. The Devi Mahatmya in particular, is considered in Shaktism to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E

5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as the music, and the chorus and soloists can {{participate}} equally with the {{instruments in the}} exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case}} of Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, {{as in the case of}} Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Upanishad in its {{explanation}} of the theology of Shaktism, mentions and praises Shiva such as in its verse 19. Shiva, along with Vishnu, is a revered god in the Devi Mahatmya, a text of Shaktism considered by the tradition to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as the Bhagavad Gita. The Ardhanarisvara concept co-mingles god Shiva and goddess Shakti by presenting an icon that is half man and half woman, a representation and theme of union found in many Hindu texts and temples.|$|E
5|$|Luther {{sent the}} Theses {{enclosed}} {{with a letter}} to Albert of Brandenburg, the Archbishop of Mainz, on 31 October 1517, a date now considered {{the start of the}} Reformation and commemorated annually as Reformation Day. Luther may have also posted the Theses on the door of All Saints' Church and other churches in Wittenberg in accordance with University custom on 31 October or in mid-November. The Theses were quickly reprinted, translated, and distributed throughout Germany and Europe. They initiated a pamphlet war with indulgence preacher Johann Tetzel, which spread Luther's fame even further. Luther's ecclesiastical superiors had him tried for heresy, which culminated in his excommunication in 1521. Though the Theses were the start of the Reformation, Luther did not consider indulgences to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as other theological matters which would divide the church, such as justification by faith alone and the bondage of the will. His breakthrough on these issues would come later, and he did not see the writing of the Theses as the point at which his beliefs diverged from those of Rome.|$|E

5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} has {{a number}} of characteristics that distinguish the Swedish style from heraldry in other European countries. Common features of Swedish heraldry {{are similar to those of}} other Nordic countries and Germany, placing it in the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, distinguished from Gallo-British heraldry and other heraldic traditions by several key elements of heraldic style. One of these is the use of multiple helmets and crests, which cannot be displayed separately from the main shield. These helmets and crests are considered to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as the shield, each denoting a fief over which the bearer holds a right. In Scandinavia (as distinct from the German custom), when an even number of helmets is displayed, they are usually turned, with their crests, to face outward; when an odd number, the center helmet is turned affronté and the rest turned outward (whereas in Germany the helmets are turned inward to face the center of the escutcheon). Additionally, the crests are often repetitive of charges used on the main shield, and marks of cadency typically occur in the crest, rather than on the shield as in Gallo-British heraldry. Also, the use of heraldic furs on the shield, while common in Gallo-British heraldry, is rare in German-Nordic heraldry. Furs in Scandinavia are generally limited to ermine and vair, which sometimes appear in mantling, supporters, or the trimmings of crowns, but rarely on the shield.|$|E

Gritty competitors at the Scripps National Spelling Bee outranked other competitors who scored lower in grit, at least partially due to accumulated practice.|$|E
25|$|The Devi Mahatmyam {{describes}} a storied battle {{between good and}} evil, where the Devi manifesting as goddess Durga leads the forces of good against the demon Mahishasura—the goddess is very angry and ruthless, and the forces of good win. In peaceful prosperous times, states the text, the Devi manifests as Lakshmi, empowering wealth creation and happiness. The verses of this story also outline a philosophical foundation wherein the ultimate reality (Brahman in Hinduism) is female. The text {{is one of the}} earliest extant complete manuscripts from the Hindu traditions which describes reverence and worship of the feminine aspect of God. The Devi Mahatmya is often ranked in some Hindu traditions to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

25|$|Deep {{water in}} lakes {{and the ocean}} can provide {{pressure}} without requiring high-pressure vessels or drilling into salt caverns or aquifers. The air goes into inexpensive, flexible containers such as plastic bags below in deep lakes or off sea coasts with steep drop-offs. Obstacles include {{the limited number of}} suitable locations and the need for high-pressure pipelines between the surface and the containers. Since the containers would be very inexpensive, the need for great pressure (and great depth) may not <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>important.</b> A key benefit of systems built on this concept is that charge and discharge pressures are a constant function of depth. Carnot inefficiencies can thereby be reduced in the power plant. Carnot efficiency can be increased by using multiple charge and discharge stages and using inexpensive heat sources and sinks such as cold water from rivers or hot water from solar ponds. Ideally, the system must be very clever—for example, by cooling air before pumping on summer days. It must be engineered to avoid inefficiency, such as wasteful pressure changes caused by inadequate piping diameter.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scientists}} have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged {{with the basic}} vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from sensors and receptors, both internal and surface, signaling that {{the well-being of the}} creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the thalamic, hippocampal, orbitofrontal, insula, and midbrain sites are the key to consciousness of thirst. These scientists also point out that the cortex might not <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> to primary consciousness as some neuro{{scientists have}} believed. Evidence of this {{lies in the fact that}} studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness. Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|This {{is an area}} {{within the}} visual cortex that {{has been found to}} play an {{important}} role in the target selection of saccades. In other words, this area is important for determining which objects our eyes shift to when they move. Studies have shown that there is a large amount of activation within the visual area V4 before the saccade even takes place. This occurs in the form of shrinking receptive fields. The receptive fields of these brain cells tend to shift towards the object that the eye is about to move towards, generally more so if the object is close to the original fixation point. This dynamic change in receptive fields is thought to enhance the perception and recognition of objects in a visual scene. Because the receptive fields become smaller around the targeted objects, attention within the visual scene is very focused on these objects. Increased attention to target objects within a visual scene help direct eye movements from one object to another. Understanding of the visual scene becomes more efficient because these attention shifts guide the eyes towards relevant objects as opposed to objects that may not <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
