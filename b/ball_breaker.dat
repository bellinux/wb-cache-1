5|$|When the {{producers}} knew Macfadyen would leave, {{the producers}} decided to introduce new cast members, {{one of which}} was Rupert Penry-Jones as Adam Carter, the new protagonist. Early on in the creation of Adam, the producers had an interest in casting Penry-Jones for the role; however, it took the actor three auditions until the producers finally decided to cast him. Unlike Tom, Adam would have a different character dynamic; he has an MI6 background, and is married. A change from the girlfriend/boyfriend storyline for Tom and Ellie Simm in the first series, the producers noted it is common for secret service officers to be in a relationship with others in the same field of work. This led to the introduction of Fiona Carter, portrayed by Olga Sosnovska. Sosnovska was previously approached to appear in the second series, but was unavailable. She later auditioned for Fiona, and was later told she won the part when she was in New York City. The actress was only given a brief on her character—a <b>ball</b> <b>breaker,</b> ultimate professional, cold and calculated—which did not give her much to work with. Sosnovska initially found Fiona irritating in the fourth episode, but later opened up to the character after her return in the seventh.|$|E

50|$|Robinson's {{first attempt}} at screenwriting was the Jutra and Genie Award-winning {{animated}} documentary Lipsett Diaries (2010) directed by Theodore Ushev for the National Film Board of Canada. Robinson and Ushev (along with help from Robinson's son, Jarvis Neall) recently made an iPad film for the National Film Board of Canada called <b>Ball</b> <b>Breaker</b> (2012). Inspired by Buster Keaton and Robinson's testicular cancer experience, this macabre, slapstick short features Robinson as a stage announcer whose attempts to speak are continually interrupted by an assortment of balls. In the end, the balls overtake Robinson. All that remains is his porkpie hat. <b>Ball</b> <b>Breaker</b> was made to promote the NFB's pixstop application. The film debuted at the 2012 Ottawa International Animation Festival and is now viewable on YouTube.|$|E
50|$|In February 1994, {{watchdog}} group Morality in Media {{claimed that the}} death of eight-month-old Natalia Rivera, struck by a bowling ball thrown from an overpass onto a Jersey City, New Jersey highway near the Holland Tunnel by 18-year-old Calvin J. Settle, was partially inspired by Beavis and Butt-Head. The group said that Settle was influenced by <b>Ball</b> <b>Breakers,</b> in which Beavis and Butt-Head loaded a bowling ball with explosives and dropped it from a rooftop. While Morality in Media claimed that the show inspired Settle's actions, the case's prosecutors did not. Later it was revealed by both prosecutors and the defendant that Settle did not have cable TV and did not watch the show.|$|R

5000|$|Laurie Foell {{believed}} Justine {{was a hard}} worker, stating, [...] "Most of what Justine does {{is about}} proving something to herself. Business is business, but she isn't a <b>ball</b> <b>breaker.</b> Justine has worked long and hard to get where she is {{and she wants to}} make something new for herself, separate from the traditional male environment." [...] She didn't believe she was similar to the character however, [...] "She has a dry sense of humour and she’s really previse. I’m not prices at all. I’m very vague and have to concert are like hell not to be late. Her sense of humour is very deadpan and I like to think mines more skew whiff." [...] The characters backstory saw her decline her fiercely ambitious father's decision and pursue a career in medicine rather than law, something which saw her develop a strong sense of feminist pride. Part of this development was behind Foell's decision to accept the role, [...] "There aren’t many female surgeons. They work in full time male environment and I thought it’d {{be interesting to see how}} an intelligent woman dealt with it." [...] Upon Justine's return in 2009, she struggled with how her family had advanced without her, Lucy Wigmore explained, [...] "Justine is incredibly concerned for her family. She's pretty accustomed to living in hiding and can handle herself pretty well, but her family are a different story." ...|$|E
40|$|The soccer {{robot system}} and the {{effective}} multi agents cooperation strategy which {{has been applied to}} the <b>BALL</b> <b>BREAKER</b> team is presented. The main part of the presented strategy is composed of three role task handlers, an avoidance task handler and an arbiter. The role of each robot is defined as offense, defence and goal keeping. Each role task handler determines the target position where the robot corresponded to each role must move to. The role of each robot is determined every sampling time by the arbiter considering the information which comes from the vision system. Thus, the role of each robot is changed dynamically. The avoidance task handler checks the possibility of the unexpected collision between robots, and changes the target position to the collision free space. The trajectory to the target position where the role task handler determines is expressed by using the 4 -th oder bezier curve and PID controller is used to track the determined trajectory. The presented strategy i [...] ...|$|E
