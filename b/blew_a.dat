5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} tiebreaker with long {{histories}} {{of frustration and}} disappointment. California had won the AL West division title on 3 occasions (1979, 1982, and 1986), but failed {{to advance to the}} World Series each time. In particular, the Angels <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 series lead in the best-of-five 1982 ALCS to the Milwaukee Brewers, and were one strike away from defeating the Boston Red Sox in Game 5 of the 1986 ALCS but ended up losing that game and the next two to lose the best-of-seven series that they had led 3–1. They had not returned to the postseason since the 1986 loss.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{was bombed}} and sunk in a German air raid on Liverpool {{during the night}} of 7/8 May 1941.

The ship's structure was badly damaged enough that her stern began to sag downwards and Hurricane was moved to Bidston Dock lest she sink and block traffic in the harbour. No one was killed in the attack, although a few crewmen received minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, Mota was {{the winning}} pitcher when he pitched a {{scoreless}} inning in an 8–7 victory over Houston. He got another win by pitching a scoreless inning on September 12 in a 6–4 victory over Florida. With the Mets, {{he had a}} 3–0 record with a 1.00 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 18 games to finish the season 4–3 with a 4.53 ERA in 52 games. He made {{the playoffs for the}} first time in his career as the Mets won the NL East. In the first game of the 2006 National League Division Series against the Dodgers, Mota was the winning pitcher when he pitched two innings, although he <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> 4–1 lead by giving up three runs and allowing the Dodgers to tie the game. Mota pitched two scoreless innings in the Mets' series-winning 9–5 victory over the Dodgers in Game 3. In the 2006 National League Championship Series, Mota appeared in five of the seven games in the series. He <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> lead in an eventual Game 2 loss, but he did not give up a run in the other four games as the Mets lost to St. Louis in seven games. On October 30, he filed for free agency.|$|E

Harwood pushed a man who <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> vuvuzela at him, then appeared to push a BBC cameraman who was filming the arrest of another man. The footage showed Harwood push a third man out of the way, and shortly after this (the passageway now almost empty) the officers reached Tomlinson.|$|E
5|$|A large {{subdivision}} near Route30 sustained minor {{roof and}} tree damage, which was rated as EF0intensity. However, as the tornado was intensifying through the neighborhood, three homes to the subdivision's east suffered more considerable roof and siding damage and was assigned an EF1damage intensity rating. The tornado then crossed Missouri Route 141, where it <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> Honda CR-V into a highway barrier; {{the driver of}} the vehicle suffered critical injuries and died eleven days later from those injuries. After crossing the highway, a number of buildings were damaged including a church, elementary school, and parsonage. Damage in this area was rated as EF2 due to the partial debarking of a nearby tree. Minor tree damage occurred as the tornado moved through Fenton Park and tracked over the Meramec River.|$|E
5|$|In {{the capital}} city of Tokyo, heavy {{rainfall}} increased levels along several rivers, which inundated several houses. Strong winds damaged ¥28.8million (US$259,000) in crop damage in Gifu Prefecture, and ¥27.1million (US$244,000) in crop damage in Osaka. In Yamaguchi Prefecture on western Honshu, Nabi damaged a portion of the historical Kintai Bridge, originally built in 1674. In Yamagata Prefecture, the winds damaged a window in a school, injuring several boys from the debris. One person was seriously injured in Kitakata, Fukushima after strong winds <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> worker from scaffolding of a building under construction. Effects from Nabi spread as far north as Hokkaido, where heavy rainfall damaged roads and caused hundreds of schools to close. In Ashoro, an overflown river flooded a hotel, and a minor power outage occurred in Teshikaga.|$|E

5|$|Latos started 2011 on the {{disabled}} list due to a spring training shoulder injury. He lost his first four starts of the season, extending his losing streak to nine consecutive starts dating back to 2010. The streak tied the longest streak in Padres history, held by Andy Benes and Dennis Rasmussen. Latos had a no-decision in his next start after the bullpen <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> save opportunity, preventing him from earning a win. He lost another decision for a 10-game losing streak that was one less than the club record held by Gary Ross. Latos won on May 15 against the Colorado Rockies to end his losing streak. He ended the 2011 season with a 9–14 record and a 3.47 ERA.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, a storm system caused damage {{throughout}} the Great Plains.

In Eaton County, a woman was killed by winds which <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> large trailer on to her. Over 300,000people in Michigan were left without power due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{joined a}} Manchester City side which {{had just been}} relegated to the Second Division, and were thus playing {{at the same level}} as Swansea. Paul made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 1950–51 season, a 4–2 victory against a Preston North End side {{featuring}} Tom Finney. Manchester City went ten matches unbeaten {{at the start of the}} season, until a 4–3 defeat at Doncaster Rovers, where City <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> 3–0 half-time lead. Paul played in all but one match that season, becoming club captain and helping his club win promotion, as runners-up behind champions Preston. Writer HD Davies, under his pen name Old International, attributed much of City's cohesive play over the season to the addition of Paul to the side.|$|E

5|$|Scotland Yard, the {{headquarters}} of London's Metropolitan Police Service, was originally located in Great Scotland Yard off the north-eastern end of Whitehall. The buildings had been lodgings for the Kings of Scotland, on {{part of the old}} Palace of Whitehall's grounds; by the 19th century, Little and Middle Scotland Yard had been merged into Whitehall Place, leaving only Great Scotland Yard. No.4 Whitehall Place had become vacant by the 1820s, which allowed Sir Robert Peel to use it as the main headquarters when forming the police in 1829. It was formally named the Metropolitan Police Office, but became quickly known as Great Scotland Yard, and eventually Scotland Yard. The buildings were damaged in a series of bombings by Irish Nationalists in 1883, and an explosion from a Fenian terrorist attack on 30 May 1884 <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> hole in Scotland Yard's outer wall and destroyed the neighbouring Rising Sun pub. The headquarters was moved away from Whitehall in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{strained}} {{an oblique}} muscle in 2011 spring training {{and opened the}} season on the DL. He was activated from the DL on April 6. After posting a 3.75 ERA {{in his first two}} games, Wilson posted a 1.26 ERA in his next 35 outings. During a game against the Detroit Tigers on July 1, Wilson <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> save for a second straight game and was taken out of the game by Bruce Bochy. Upon entering the dugout, Wilson took out his frustrations by throwing a Gatorade cooler and smashing it with a bat. The Giants still won the game 4–3 as Jeremy Affeldt got the save. Wilson was elected to his third All-Star Game; he earned the save in a 5–1 victory over the AL.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, George Maloof, a businessperson from Albuquerque, New Mexico, {{bought the}} Rockets for $9million. He died the {{following}} year, {{and while the}} Maloof family expressed interest in selling the team, George's 24-year-old son Gavin took over the Rockets. A buyer was eventually found in 1982 as businessman Charlie Thomas and Sidney Shlenker purchased the franchise for $11 million. The Maloof period of ownership marked the first dominant period of the Rockets, highlighted by the team's first NBA Finals appearance in 1981. Prior to the 1980–81 season, {{the arrival of the}} Dallas Mavericks led to an NBA realignment that sent the Rockets back to the Western Conference. Houston qualified for the playoffs only in the final game of the season with a 40–42 record. The post-season had the Rockets beat the Lakers, in-state rivals San Antonio Spurs, and the equally underdog Kansas City Kings to become only the second team in NBA history (after the 1959 Minneapolis Lakers) to have advanced to the Finals after achieving a losing record in the regular season. In the final round facing Larry Bird's Boston Celtics in the finals round, the Rockets <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> late lead in Game 1 and won Game 2 at the Boston Garden. However, afterwards the team failed to capitalize on the early success against the favored Celtics, and eventually lost in six games.|$|E

5|$|In the {{off-season}} Breslin again re-signed with the Wolves. Chicago also brought in John Anderson {{to be the}} team's new head coach. Under Anderson, Breslin had posted a career high in assists with 26 and games played with 81. Chicago won the West division and finished with the second-best record in the league. In the postseason the Wolves stormed through the first three rounds, losing only four games, {{to advance to the}} 1998 Turner Cup Finals. In game 1 of the finals against the Detroit Vipers, Chicago <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> two-goal lead early in the third period. They regained the lead with just over eight minutes to play. In the final minutes of the game, Breslin added an insurance empty net goal giving the Wolves a 4–2 victory. It was Breslin's only goal of the playoffs. The series eventually went to a seventh and deciding game that the Wolves won 3–0 to capture the franchise's first Turner Cup. For the 1998–99 season Breslin's production dipped to 7 goals and 21 points. The Wolves advanced to the third round the playoffs, but Breslin played in only 4 of the team's 10 games. On the first day of training camp the following year, Breslin announced his retirement from professional hockey.|$|E
5|$|Mota began spring {{training}} with the Expos in 2002, but {{was traded to}} the Los Angeles Dodgers with outfielder Wilkin Ruan for pitcher Matt Herges and infielder Jorge Nunez on March 23. He failed to make the Dodgers' major league club in {{spring training}} and was assigned to the Las Vegas 51s of the triple-A Pacific Coast League to begin the season. He was called up on April 20 when Kevin Brown was placed on the disabled list. After appearing in two games, he was returned to Las Vegas on April 30 when Brown came off the disabled list. On May 17, he was called up a second time. In 22 games through July 14, he had a 2.43 ERA. On June 3, he pitched a scoreless inning and earned the win in an 11–5 victory over the Colorado Rockies. However, he was returned to Las Vegas on July 28 after he had a loss and a 13.50 ERA over his next seven games. He did not return to the Dodgers until August 26, when Kevin Beirne was demoted to the minors. That same day, he was the losing pitcher when he gave up three runs (two earned) in his third inning of work in a 12-inning 6–3 loss to Arizona. He was the losing pitcher again on September 13 when he gave up three runs in the seventh inning and <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> 4–2 lead over Colorado. He posted a 3.92 ERA over his final 14 games of the year to finish with a 1–3 record and a 4.15 ERA in 43 games. With the 51s, he had a 1–3 record with a 2.95 ERA in 20 games.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February 1942 Finucane flew a two-Spitfire sortie to Dunkirk, France. The {{last few}} days had been {{monotonous}} and Finucane was eager to fly and asked Dick Lewis—a 29-year old Australian who had put his age down so he was accepted for pilot training—to fly as his wingman. At 10:55 GMT Finucane took off and headed over Manston toward France. Off the coast, they strafed a small ship and turned north to return home. Finucane spotted two aircraft taking off from Mardyck but lost sight of them. Both Spitfires dropped to sea level. Minutes later two enemy fighters came towards them. They were identified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. The Fw 190 had a higher performance than the Spitfire V in all departments other than turning circle and was more heavily armed. Finucane scored hits on the first Fw 190's wing but the enemy quickly gained the advantage and Finucane's Spitfire was hit with six machine gun rounds which <b>blew</b> <b>a</b> piece of fuselage into the cockpit and into his leg. Blood loss induced dizziness and Lewis protected his leader from six more astern attacks. In the last attack the two Fw 190s came from opposite directions. Lewis was able to claim one shot down and the other gave up over the mid-Channel. They taxied to 452's dispersal where Finucane passed out after shutting down the engine. On 2 March Finucane went on leave after spending over a week in hospital. No claim or loss was recorded by JG 26, the resident German fighter unit.|$|E
