40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs), major innate immune effectors, are induced {{to protect}} hosts against invading microorganisms. AMPs are also induced under non-infectious stress; however, the signaling pathways of non-infectious stress-induced AMP expression are yet unclear. We demonstrated that growth-blocking peptide (GBP) {{is a potent}} cytokine that regulates stressor-induced AMP expression in insects. GBP overexpression in Drosophila elevated expression of AMPs. GBP-induced AMP expression did not require Toll and immune deficiency (<b>Imd)</b> pathway-related genes, <b>but</b> <b>imd</b> and basket were essential, indicating that GBP signaling in Drosophila {{did not use the}} orthodox Toll or <b>Imd</b> pathway <b>but</b> used the JNK pathway after association with the adaptor protein Imd. The enhancement of AMP expression by non-infectious physical or environmental stressors was apparent in controls but not in GBP-knockdown larvae. These results indicate that the Drosophila GBP signaling pathway mediates acute innate immune reactions under various stresses, regardless of whether they are infectious or non-infectious...|$|R

5000|$|On the 39th episode, the {{characters}} Oh Geum-sung and Oh Soo-sung (older brothers {{of the female}} protagonist) suddenly left for the United States to visit their wives. This meant that they were essentially written off the show. The actors playing them, Son Chang-min and Oh Dae-gyu, complained to the network that they weren't informed in advance of this development, and neither were their agencies; everyone, including the drama crew, only found out when they received the script before the scenes were to be filmed. This was reportedly writer Im Sung-han's decision; the actors had previously expressed their concerns to her about the storytelling's direction. The Korean press used the term [...] "cast kill" [...] {{to refer to the}} tendency of Im's past dramas (such as Dear Heaven, Assorted Gems, New Tales of Gisaeng) to abruptly kill off characters. In terms of production logistics, the fired actors still received the agreed-upon fixed salary {{for the duration of the}} series, regardless of screen time. <b>But</b> <b>Im's</b> move had possible legal ramifications, and she was criticized for unprofessionalism, since the actors signed on to the drama (and turned down other offers) with the expectation that their roles would be prominent.|$|R

40|$|Mucorales-specific T {{cells have}} been {{investigated}} in 28 hematologic patients {{during the course of}} their treatment. Three developed proven invasive mucormycosis (IM), 17 infections of known etiologies <b>but</b> other than <b>IM,</b> and 8 never showed fever upon the period of observation. The Mucorales-specific T cells may be detected only in patients with IM, at diagnosis and along the entire course of the <b>IM,</b> <b>but</b> neither before nor long time after the resolution of the infection. Such T cells produced predominantly interleukin- 4, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin- 10, {{and to a lesser extent}} also interleukin- 17, and belonged to either CD 4 + or CD 8 + subsets. The specific T cells producing IFN-γ were able to directly induce damage of Mucorales hyphae. None of the 25 patients without IM showed Mucorales-specific T cells. Specific T cells contribute to human immune responses against fungi of the order Mucorales and could be evaluated as a surrogate diagnostic marker of IM...|$|R
40|$|The {{symptoms}} of infectious mononucleosis (IM) {{are thought to}} be caused by T cell activation and cytokine production. Surface lymphocyte activation marker (SLAM) -associated protein (SAP) regulates lymphocyte activation via signals from cell-surface CD 244 (2 B 4) and SLAM (CD 150). We followed T cell activation via this SAP/SLAM/CD 244 pathway in IM and analyzed whether the results were associated with clinical severity. At diagnosis, SAP, SLAM, and CD 244 were significantly up-regulated on CD 4 and CD 8 T cells; expression decreased during <b>IM,</b> <b>but</b> CD 244 and SLAM levels remained higher on CD 8 cells 40 days later. There were significantly more lymphocytes expressing CD 8 and CD 244 /CD 8 in patients with severe sore throat. The expression of CD 8 alone and CD 244 on CD 8 cells correlated with increased virus load. We suggest that T cells expressing CD 244 and SLAM are responsible for the clinical features of <b>IM</b> <b>but</b> that the control of activation is maintained by parallel increased expression of SAP...|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that collectivists {{are more likely}} to engage in deception and socially desirable responding to maintain good relationships with others. In contrast, individualists are portrayed as candid and sincere because individualism encourages people to “be yourself. ” The authors propose that people with both types of cultural orientations or backgrounds engage in desirable responding, albeit in distinct ways. In Study 1, respondents from the United States compared with those from Singapore, and European Americans compared with Asian Americans, scored higher on self-deceptive enhancement (SDE) —the tendency to see oneself in a positive light and to give inflated assessment of one’s skills and abilities— but lower on impression management (IM) by misrepresenting their self-reported actions to appear more normatively appropriate. In Studies 2 to 4, horizontal individualism as a cultural orientation correlated with SDE <b>but</b> not with <b>IM,</b> whereas horizontal collectivism correlated with <b>IM</b> <b>but</b> not with SDE. Further analyses examining (a) individual differences in the tendency to answer deceptively and (b) responses to behavioral scenarios shed additional light on the culturally relevant goals served by these distinct types of socially desirable responding...|$|R
