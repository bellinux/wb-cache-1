40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of High Strength Steel (HSS) on different structural components {{is becoming more}} attractive. They have a fine grain structure, low carbon content for improved weldability, and controlled internal purity. These steel grades are frequently used for structural applications. There {{are a lot of}} steel components of the considered applications that are subjected to bending and fatigue loading conditions, respectively. It is well known that under critical loading conditions, cyclic stress, which exceeds the material yield stress, can occur at some critical locations such as the inner side of <b>bent</b> <b>components.</b> Combining these two aspects, i. e. the bending process followed by fatigue loading, causes multiple micro-crack initiation inside the inner surface of the bending area, which is followed by propagation of the cracks up to final rupture of material. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of pre-bending process of HSS subjected to low cycle fatigue loading conditions, since so far only very limited amount of research has been focused in this direction. For this purpose, in the first step, a new test set-up was designed {{to take into account the}} effect of pre-bending process when the fatigue load has been applied. Lock-in thermography technique was used to monitor the incremental temperature variation during fatigue cycling at the bending root. Using the temperature evolution, the crack initiation and propagation lifetimes were separated from total lifetime. Fractography and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed to study the fracture surface of specimens after bending and fatigue testing. Furthermore, numerical technique approach was used to model the bending and spring back processes along with the fatigue loading in order to understand the effect of bending process on fatigue behaviour of tested material.

40|$|International audienceIn recent {{theoretical}} {{studies on}} the H 2 /Cu system [1] {{it has been shown}} that the chemisorption of H 2 can be satisfactorily reproduced using an embedding approach of a cluster model consisting of 22 Cu atoms. This suggests that maybe such treatment can also be applied to the more delicate problem of the description of the physisorption domain. Since a good test of the accuracy of the potential energy function is provided by the comparison of experimental and calculated spectroscopic data, we have calculated the ro-vibrational energy levels of a H 2 molecule physisorbed on a metallic surface, Ag or Cu(100), using a 5 D or 2 D potential energy function determined at different levels of approximation and compared them with EELS experiments data[2]. Highly correlated electronic calculations on the 22 Cu cluster model have been performed with the 2012. 1 version of the MOLPRO code [3] using the coupled cluster CCSD(T) method. In a second step, periodic calculations have been performed with the VASP code [4] and various functionals and finally the embedding method has been applied within the ONIOM approach. At each step, the comparison is made with experimental data, and we show [5] that only the embedded corrected potential can provide accurate spectroscopic data for the ro-vibrational transitions. To describe the reactivity of the CN- anion in its 1 + electronic ground state with neutral atoms that can be present in the interstellar media (H, F, Cl, and O, S), we have used highly correlated ab initio wave functions within the UCCSD(T) -F 12 approach, to map the potential energy surfaces (PESs). With H atom, the reaction [CN-(1 +) + H(2 S) ] proceeds along the 2 + electronic ground state of HCN- (or HNC-) until the crossing with the X 1 + electronic ground state of the neutral form HCN (or HNC), where electron detachment occurs. The process is rather similar with the two halogen atoms F and Cl, with some differences due to the larger electronic affinity of the halogens, making possible the existence of negative FCN- and ClCN- in bent geometries. The reaction of CN- with O and S atoms proceeds via a different process since the lowest electronic state at long distance, the 3  state, does not correlate with the stable ground state of the XCN- anion (X=O or S).

40|$|This memo {{provides}} {{recommendations for}} the design of bridges on straight alignments with support skews between 0 and 60 degrees and for concrete bridges on curved alignments with support skews between 0 and 45 degrees. For the purpose of this memo, a bridge on a curved alignment can be considered to be on a straight alignment as long as its curvature effects can be ignored according to AASHTO-LRFD 4. 6. 1. 2. For bridges on straight alignments with support skews exceeding 60 degrees and for curved concrete bridges with support skews exceeding 45 degrees, the designer should use a full three-dimensional (3 D) model, such as a grillage or shell model, to more accurately capture true load distribution. When determining the effect of skewed supports on bridges with curved alignments, the effect of both curvature and skew shall be included. Refer to AASHTO-LRFD 4. 6. 1. 2 for consideration of curved alignment effects. Background Historically, bridges were typically designed using two-dimensional (2 D) frame analysis and design software. A 2 D frame model was created to analyze the bridge in the longitudinal direction, that is, the direction along the centerline of the bridge. Using reactions from the longitudinal 2 D model, a 2 D frame model for each bent was generated to analyze the bents in the transverse direction, that is, the direction parallel to the centerline of the <b>bent.</b> Bridge <b>components</b> were designed using results from the longitudinal model, the transverse model, or a combination of the two. For the superstructure, it was assumed that support skew does not affect the distribution of loading response across the section with the exception of shear. In a skewed bridge, loads tend to distribute to the supports in a direction normal to the supports. This causes a greater proportion of the load to concentrate at the obtuse corners of the span and less at the acute corners.
