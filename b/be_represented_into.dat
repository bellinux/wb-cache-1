40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a generic unsupervised learning based solution to unexpected event detection from a static uncalibrated camera. The system can <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> <b>into</b> a probabilistic {{framework in which}} the detection is achieved by a likelihood based decision. We propose an original method to approximate the likelihood function using a sparse vector machine based model. This model is then used to detect efficiently unexpected events online. Moreover, features used are based on optical flow orientation within image blocks. The resulting application is able to learn automatically expected optical flow orientations from training video sequences and to detect unexpected orientations (corresponding to unexpected event) in a near real-time frame rate. Experiments show that the algorithm {{can be used in}} various applications like crowd or traffic event detection. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Speaker’s {{intentions}} can <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> <b>into</b> domain actions (domainindependent speech {{acts and}} domain-dependent concept sequences). Therefore, domain action classification is very useful to a dialogue system that should catch user’s intention {{in order to}} generate correct reaction. In this paper, we propose a neural network model to determine speech acts and concept sequences at the same time. To avoid biased learning problems, the proposed model uses low-level linguistic features and filters out uninformative features using 2 χ statistic. In the experiment, the proposed model showed better per-formances than the previous work in speech act classification. Moreover, the proposed model showed meaningful results when the size of training corpus was small. Based on the experimental results, {{we believe that the}} proposed model will be more helpful to dialogue systems because it manages speech act classification and concept sequence classification at the same time. We also believe that the proposed model can alleviate sparse data problems in speech act classification. ...|$|E

Moreover, if coefficient matrix is definite, then the interval solution is unique. The networks with interval travel time can be represented as a matrix over interval min-plus algebra.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of roundness {{can be analyzed}} by investigating the parameter and constant after defining the fractal roundness model. The conventional method can give the precise modeling comparatively but it cannot include the dynamic properties with less initial data in roundness modeling. In roundness presentation, it needs sometimes the dynamic properties in roundness. So, more desirable method must be used for higher dynamic properties in roundness model. For this purpose, the fractal interpolation methods with less data information were used in this study. Also, using the fractal constant in fractal interpolation the characteristic of the roundness in the workpiece is studied. Recently, many researches have been conducted using the fractal analysis. But their application is generally restricted to analyze their objects only using the parameter of fractal dimension. In this study, A fractal analysis {{was applied to the}} roundness modeling at first. And the characteristic of fractal roundness model was analyzed and its result was introduced in this study.

40|$|Human–robot {{interfaces}} {{may play}} a key role in helping people with motor impairments, especially children, to achieve mobility, manipulation, and functional communication. Therefore, the implementation of an accurate, smooth, and flexible control interface can positively impact the quality of life of people with movement disorders. Electromyographic activity (EMG) has often been used as a control interface for robotic devices (myocontrol). However, it has proven difficult even for healthy adults to learn to use EMG to control multiple degrees of freedom. One common hypothesis in the field of motor control is that movements are produced through muscle synergies, coordinated activations of groups of muscles with speciﬁc balances of muscle activations. Whether muscle synergies are indeed a simplifying control strategy actually implemented by the CNS is still a debated issue. Nevertheless, many recent studies indicate that muscle activations can <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> <b>into</b> a low-dimensional space as a linear combination of muscle synergies. The aim of this work is to achieve real-time multi-muscle control of a robotic device by extraction of controllable synergies. We have developed and tested, in healthy subjects, a real-time controller of an external actuator, based on synergies extracted from 8 muscles of the upper limb. An ad-hoc algorithm was designed to process and analyze EMG and to perform torque-based control of one degree of freedom of a desktop robot at 1000 Hz (Phantom Omni, SensAble TM). To tailor the interface to the specific motor patterns of each subject, synergies are identified using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for each subject individually. For each time frame, the driving signal is based on the similarity between the vector of EMG and the vector of each direction-related synergy. We expect muscle synergies to capture regularities in the noisy sensorimotor mapping, thus allowing an easier and smoother real- time control even in subjects affected by movement disorders. The next step is to test this control interface on children with movement disorders, and to compare synergy-based with single-muscle control...|$|E
