Originally established as an alternative model to corporatizations, it implies considerable challenges for both agency management and inter-organizational relationships within the political-administrative system – thereby also demonstrating {{the relevance of the}} traditional public administration culture in Austria with its strong Rechtsstaat tradition. We use a variety of data sources and focus on a comprehensive case study of the three pioneering agencies for an assessment of the longitudinal effects of this reform initiative.

In order for EFSI to contribute to the greater goal of cohesion and development, it further recommends the creation of a Development Window with a special guarantee for riskier regions and a push on EFSI corollary policies, including the establishment of country offices for the Advisory Hub and the development of a strategy for investment in human capital...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the clearest}} facts {{regarding}} the actual economic crisis is {{the increase in}} social inequalities and its resulting risk for families in social exclusion. In this type of situations, the need for accessing to social protection systems deepens. In Navarre, the principal exclusion coverage system is the Renta de Inclusión Social (RIS). The RIS is a benefit of subjective right and key element for the containment of socioeconomic deterioration processes. Due to the multiple situations of long term unemployment and precarious job contracts, people without coverage present a real social need which is attended in Navarre through the RIS. The main objective of this work is to accurately predict the number of RIS Applications entering the Social Rights Department of the Government of Navarre, given its main determinant, which is Uncovered Unemployed.

It designated Mr Brian Hayes (MEP) to follow the study. ] - The recent European crisis has put the issue of government efficiency high on national policy agendas. Policy measures that result in a reduction of bureaucratic slack or red tape can alleviate the trade-off between consolidation and public service provision. Since 2007 {{the role of the}} EU budget in support of administrative reforms has been strengthening, at least in formal terms. However, {{the extent to which the}} various EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>instruments</b> have encouraged public administration reforms is unclear. Against the background of the overall European approach towards public administration reforms, this study reviews the current <b>budgetary</b> <b>instruments</b> that directly or indirectly support such reforms, and analyses the coherence, EU added value and complementarities within them. Case studies on four Member States and an analysis of current networks and award initiatives to disseminate best practices complete the study. Based on extensive desk research and a set of semi-structured interviews, the analysis finds a positive but modest impact of the EU budget and existing networks on reform activity. Some of the key recommendations are to improve the consistency of Country Specific Recommendations related to administrative reforms, increase the effectiveness of the Structural Reform Support Programme, and to ensure coherence and complementarity between all EU-funded interventions as well as their monitoring and evaluation processes. As to the role of learning and policy-diffusion, the study recommends to promote focused peer-to-peer exchange among public sector managers, and to develop a more credible evaluation of public sector awards...|$|R
40|$|Cover pagesTextÂ AnnexesThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse {{budgetary}} policies carried out during and after severe recessions. Since the agreement on the "Stability and Growth Pact" by the European Council in Dublin in December 1996, interest in this issue has increased significantly. The Stability and Growth Pact, which sets the rules for budgetary behaviour in stage three of EMU, singles out severe recessions as specifically problematical periods during which a certain budgetary flexibility could be allowed. The rules laid out in the Stability and Growth Pact are used in this paper as a benchmark to evaluate past budgetary behaviour during recessions in the fifteen European Union Member States. More specifically, the paper provides elements to examine the following issues: what type of budgetary policies have been adopted during severe recessions in the past? Were the automatic stabilisers allowed to operate fully and did governments adopt an expansionary budgetary policy stance? Which factors influenced the policies undertaken and what was the composition of the measures adopted? Can the accumulation of debt, which took place in the past two decades in Europe, be explained by "tax smoothing" during periods of economic hardship?II/ 195 / 97 -ENConcluding remarks The application of the provisions of the Excessive Deficit Procedure and the Stability and Growth Pact to the past is obviously a highly speculative exercise. Its results do not address the following questions: to what extent is past budgetary behaviour a reliable guide to assess the likely behaviour of national budgetary policies in EMU during recessions? More specifically, would Member States need larger or smaller changes in their budgetary positions to provide the degree of stabilisation which occurred in the past?A number of factors will play an important role:New policy regime under EMUDuring the third phase of EMU, the conduct of monetary policy will be centralised at the European level and will therefore no longer be available as a policy tool at the national level. Budgetary policy will thus be the main macroeconomic policy instrument still available for individual Member States to combat recessions, especially when shocks are asymmetric. The impossibility of lowering interest rates and resorting to currency devaluations might require larger deficit changes. On the other hand, according to the Mundell-Fleming framework, budgetary policy will in principle become more effective in dampening the amplitude of cyclical fluctuations in the new policy environment of EMU with centralised monetary policy and irrevocably fixed exchange rates between Member States. If, however, EMU enhances the process of economic integration, trade leakages of budgetary policies will gradually increase, thereby reducing the "domestic" effectiveness of budgetary policies. Unless national policies are co-ordinated, this factor raises the changes in the budget deficit required in order to attain the same degree of stabilisation achieved in the past. "Pre-recession" deficit levelActual deficit changes observed during past recessions were applied in our retrospective exercise to "pre-recession" deficit levels chosen specifically for the exercise (0 % and 2 % of GDP). However, the actual deficit changes which took place during past severe recessions usually started from markedly higher pre-recession deficit levels. The impact on the economy of budgetary policy changes during recessions also varies depending on the deficit and debt levels. For instance, the markets' perception of an increase in the deficit from 0 % to 2 % of GDP during a severe recession will be different from that of a rise in the deficit from, say, 8 % to 10 % of GDP, the latter more likely being interpreted as shifting the deficit to an unsustainable path. This may lead to an increase in the risk premium on interest rates which reduces the effectiveness of the fiscal expansion. High budgetary imbalances may inhibit policy makers from using the <b>budgetary</b> <b>instrument</b> for stabilisation purposes. Indeed, the higher risk premiums which would raise the interest burden may represent a powerful disincentive to expanding fiscal policy in spite of the recession. As was pointed out in Section 4, budgetary reactions to economic downturns differ depending on the initial public finance conditions before the recession: countries with high deficit and debt levels tend to conduct tighter fiscal policies during recessions than those with lower deficit and debt levels. In the future, when medium-term targets have been achieved, Member States would have more room for manoeuvre to undertake accommodating policies. These factors point in different directions. As a consequence, the net effect on the requirement for budgetary stabilisation is ambiguous. If it proved necessary to reinforce the working of the automatic stabilisers during recessions in EMU, larger swings in budget deficits compared to the past would have to be allowed for. Under the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, this would imply, however, that during the third phase of EMU, Member States, and especially those with large automatic stabilisers, would have to run budgetary surpluses when in medium-term equilibrium. The present paper far from exhausts the issue of what can be learnt from the past budgetary behaviour for the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and, more generally, how budgetary authorities actually behaved in different economic circumstances. The following areas were not or were only partially covered, and therefore, provide scope for further research:Budgetary policies over the full cycle: this paper has focused essentially on recession episodes. The exercise could therefore be extended to other cyclical phases besides the recession. Indeed, as already indicated in this paper, the problem in the past has not been so much that Member States let budget deficits get out of hand too much during recessions but that they did not seize the opportunity presented by post-recession economic recovery to immediately correct their budgetary position. Composition of budgetary policies: the paper addressed the issue of the composition of budgetary policy reactions to recessions via a preliminary analysis of the overall revenue and expenditure components. Two extensions can be envisaged: first, an analysis of the composition of retrenchment policies over the years following the recession to assess, for instance, whether the length of the adjustment depends on the composition of budgetary consolidation; second, a further disaggregation of the overall components into more detailed government revenue and expenditure categories is necessary. This detailed analysis would allow conclusions to be drawn on the mechanisms causing budgetary policies to become unsustainable, as well as on the possible effectiveness and durability of budgetary consolidation efforts. recessions, modelling, fiscal policy, public finances...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{interaction}} between fiscal consolidations and private sector deleveraging in an economy inside a monetary union. Pre-existing long-term collateralized private debt - a core ingredient of the deleveraging process - plays {{a critical role in}} shaping fiscal multipliers. By buffering the short-run fall in debtors´ spending capacity, long-run private debt reduces the shortrun multipliers of aggressive (large and/or fast) consolidations. However, absent credibility concerns, aggressive consolidations raise the intensity and length of private deleveraging, causing higher output losses over the medium-run. In terms of discounted output losses and welfare, this latter effect dominates, so that larger and faster consolidations are relatively costlier than smaller and more gradual ones. Also, in this environment, alternative <b>budgetary</b> <b>instruments</b> generate sizable differences in terms of their incidence on private deleveraging dynamics and, hence, on their overall output costs of fiscal consolidations.

40|$|In many {{developing}} and middle-income countries, decentralization reforms are promoting changes in governance structures that are reshaping {{the relationship between}} local governments and citizens. The success of these decentralization reforms depends {{on the existence of}} sound public financial systems both at the central and local levels. This paper focuses on the role of budgeting as a critical tool in reform efforts, highlighting problems that might impede successful local government budget development and implementation. The attainment of effective local government accountability and transparency is not an end itself, but rather it represents the means to support better decision-making on national and local budgeting. Community based schemes for enhancing local government accountability need to combine legal, political, and administrative mechanisms with proactive community involvement. Of particular importance are the legal and <b>budgetary</b> <b>instruments</b> that require input from local community members on certain local government decisions and instruments that increase accessibility for the press or the general public at large to information on government activities.

These have now been replaced by a single budget, the general budget of the European Union. — Progress towards financial autonomy.

Paper is focused on financial ceiling policy of the EU budget expenditures. Financial ceiling is used for the total expenditure size (with relative indicators) and for the individual expenditure headings (with absolute indicators). We designed EU budget models using the methods of financial ceiling, which reflect different total expenditures size (total expenditure ceiling within the range of 2 % EU GNI, 5 % EU GNI, 20 % EU GNI, 1 % EU GNI, and 1, 24 % EU GNI), and new heading structure for total expenditure ceiling of 1, 24 % EU GNI. We tried to design the new budgetary structure to reflect the Lisbon Strategy better than actual EU budget. We strengthened following expenditure headings: 1 a Competitiveness for growth and employment, 3 Citizenship, freedom, security and justice, and 4 EU as a global player. The growth of these headings is compensated by an expenditure decre- ase of the following headings: 2 Preservation and management of natural resources, especially the section of the market-related expenditure and direct payment, and 1 b Cohesion for growth and employment. We made comparative analysis, which compare differences between received expenditures into agriculture and structural operations at individual member states in the case of present and new (our) structure of the EU budgetary expenditures.

40|$|With the {{globally}} {{increasing interest}} in accountability in central {{government and the}} search for innovative and fruitful forms of its building blocks, such as the state budget, international comparisons are getting much attention. These can have the form of country-to-country studies, as well as global benchmarks such as the OECD’s Best Practices for Budget Transparency, and the IMF’s Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency. While these frameworks provide a good starting point in order to come to a basic definition of what good accountability and transparency on the governmental level could look like, no benchmark produces a measure of budget transparency that allows for a comparison across countries. In 2007 the International Budget Partnership (IBP) created the Open Budget Index (OBI) in order to fill this gap. This is a biannual measurement that assesses public sector budget accountability at the governmental level for countries worldwide. In 2015 a total of 102 countries participated in the most recently published OBI, with a wide global distribution. In spite of this large pool of participants, the Netherlands has not been part of the assessment until now. For the present paper, we did an assessment of the Dutch central government, in order to analyse how the Netherlands would perform in comparison to top-rated countries according to the OBI. Besides, we wanted to assess the strength of the OBI as a statistical and comparative tool for research. Our findings provide a multi-faceted image of the performances: on the one hand the government performs very well internationally (e. g. when it comes to timely approval of the Executive Budget Proposal by the legislature), but on other terrains it performs significantly less (e. g. in relation to the representation of earmarked revenue estimates and auxiliary <b>budgetary</b> <b>instruments).</b> We conclude with possible policy implications for the Dutch governmental context and suggestions for further research...|$|R

The Keynesian approach, on the other hand, pleads in favour of important changes in the current governance of the eurozone. First, since the European Central Bank can not repress distributive inflationary pressures without having non-temporary depressive effects on aggregate demand and employment, authorities should recognize {{that the best way}} for controlling this type of inflation rests on a consensual distribution of income. Second, authorities should abandon any "optimal rule" designed in order to stabilize the economy near to an imaginary "natural " trend.
