500|$|From {{an early}} age Hutson was {{interested}} in business. [...] "At the university , I was the only athlete in the business school," [...] he said. [...] "The only reason I wanted to play pro sports was to get a stake." [...] While both were students at Alabama, he partnered with Bear Bryant to operate a laundromat in Tuscaloosa called Captain Kidd Cleaners. However, neither were educated in laundering, and they sold the business after two years. While in Green Bay, Hutson opened the Packer Playdium bowling alley, which proved so successful that he twice considered retirement from football to fully dedicate his time to its operation. He then started the Hutson Motor Car Co. dealership and in 1951 purchased Chevrolet and Cadillac agencies in Racine, Wisconsin. [...] "I never aimed for automobiles," [...] said Hutson. [...] "That just happened to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> I got into. I just wanted to run a business, any business.|$|E
500|$|The game's fifth episode, [...] "Rise {{from the}} Ashes", was not {{included}} in the original version of the game; it was created four years later, as part of the Nintendo DS version of the game. The fifth episode was produced by Minae Matsukawa, under supervision of Inaba and Mikami. New music pieces for [...] "Rise from the Ashes" [...] were composed by Naoto Tanaka. When writing the episode, Takumi wanted it to link up with Edgeworth's disappearance in the second game, , so he thought about what would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that would be the most damaging to Edgeworth's psyche. He decided on corruption and betrayal from within the prosecutor's office, despite the seriousness of the topic. The character Jake Marshall was created as a parallel to Godot, in an analogy between the Skye sisters and the Fey sisters. The idea to include the use of the Nintendo DS system's microphone came from American Capcom staff members; the Japanese staff did not like the idea of adding unnecessary features, but Takumi thought it was important to make the American audience happy, so it was included as an optional feature.|$|E

500|$|The Corporation was {{determined}} {{to learn from the}} mistakes made in the earlier new towns and revisit the Garden City ideals. They set in place the characteristic grid roads that run between districts, the Redway system of independent cycle/pedestrian paths, and the intensive planting, lakes and parkland that are so appreciated today. Central Milton Keynes was not intended to be a traditional town centre but a business and shopping district that supplemented the Local Centres in most of the Grid Squares. This non-hierarchical devolved city plan was a departure from the English New Towns tradition and envisaged a wide range of industry and diversity of housing styles and tenures across the city. The radical grid plan was inspired by the work of Californian urban theorist Melvin M Webber (1921–2006), described by the founding architect of Milton Keynes, Derek Walker, as the city's [...] "father". Webber thought that telecommunications meant that the old idea of a city as a concentric cluster was out of date and that cities that enabled people to travel around them readily would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> of the future, achieving [...] "community without propinquity" [...] for residents.|$|E

2500|$|On 23 August 2012, it was {{announced}} that the BBC had commissioned the six-part comedy Heading Out, which was created and written by Perkins. The BBC's Executive editor of Comedy Commissioning, Kristian Smith, called the show [...] "a warm, intelligent and brilliantly funny sitcom." [...] While Perkins stated that Heading Out [...] "might well <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that I'm most proud of. It's been a joy to work on, and I hope that joy proves to be infectious." [...] Perkins revealed that she had had the idea for Heading Out for ten years, before she developed the confidence to write it. She knew that she wanted to write about someone who was stuck and whose friends decided to take drastic action to [...] "save her from her own inertia." [...] The idea slowly began to take shape and developed into the narrative of a woman who struggled to tell her parents that she was gay, until her friends drove her to parent's house on her birthday, so she could come out to them. The comedian revealed that she is a fan of thrillers and wanted to have a ticking clock element to the show, so she thought Sara's coming out {{would be a good thing}} to do.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{element of}} Rylands {{is that the}} thing be {{something}} [...] "likely to do mischief if it escapes". Before Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council this {{did not have to}} be a dangerous item (see below); the risk was instead in its behaviour if it escapes. In Rylands the [...] "thing" [...] was water. Other examples are fire, as in Jones v Festiniog Railway, gas, as in Batchellor v Tunbridge Wells Gas Co, fumes, as in West v Bristol Tramways Co, and electricity, as in Hillier v Air Ministry. The extent of the [...] "thing"'s accumulation can also be considered, as in Mason v Levy, where it was not just the type of thing kept but the sheer amount which created the danger. It is essential for a Rylands claim that there be an escape of a dangerous thing [...] "from a place where the defendant has occupation of or control over land to a place which is outside his occupation or control". In Read v J Lyons & Co Ltd, an explosion in a munitions factory killed an inspector on the property. Rylands was held not to apply, because there was no escape. The dangerous thing that escapes does not always have to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> which was accumulated, but there must be a causal link. In Miles v Forest Rock Granite Co (Leicestershire) Ltd, explosives stored on the defendant's land led to the escape of rocks in a blast, and the defendant was found liable.|$|E
