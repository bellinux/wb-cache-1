40|$|In theory, the {{presence}} of foreign <b>banks</b> has spillover and competition effects on domestic <b>banks</b> leading to higher efficiency. Next to foreign <b>banks</b> from industrialized countries (north-south <b>banks),</b> foreign <b>banks</b> from developing countries (south-south <b>banks)</b> are important investors in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). South-south <b>banks</b> are either regional investors or are hosted in developing countries beyond SSA. This paper studies the competitive advantages and strategies of north-south as well as regional and non-regional south-south <b>banks</b> from a theoretical perspective. Moreover, the study examines theoretically whether these foreign <b>banks</b> induce different effects on domestic <b>banks.</b> To explore these issues empirically, 80 domestic <b>banks</b> in 17 countries of SSA between 1999 and 2006 are considered. The results show that {{the presence}} of north-south and south-south <b>banks</b> positively affects the costs of domestic <b>banks.</b> This suggests that domestic <b>banks</b> invest in the modern practices of foreign <b>banks.</b> Domestic <b>banks</b> margins are positively related to {{the presence of}} north-south and nonregional south-south <b>banks</b> indicating a lack of competitive pressure. In contrast, regional south-south <b>banks</b> {{have a negative impact on}} the margins of domestic <b>banks.</b> [...] south-south banks,spillover and competition effects,efficiency...|$|R

While emerging-market <b>banks</b> and global <b>banks</b> consistently outperform domestic <b>banks,</b> the difference is not significant for regional African <b>banks.</b> The higher performance of global <b>banks</b> and emerging-market <b>banks</b> is related to higher operational efficiency and lower cost of funding, while there is no strong evidence of segmentation by business segment in the loans market.
