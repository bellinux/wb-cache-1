It predicts and prevents drilling troubles such as tight holes, cutting bed accumulations, differential sticking, etc.   This paper presents a new wellbore friction model for drilling horizontal and extended reach wells. This model can be easily applied for all wellbore shapes such as straight, curved and also combination of different curved sections. The model has the capability of torque and drag calculations for different drilling modes such as rotating, tripping and also combination of modes such as reaming and <b>back</b> <b>reaming</b> operations.   For improving the model, different effects such as contact surface and hydrodynamic viscous force {{were included in the}} model, and their impacts on the results were investigated. To show the application of model, a field case study was used and deviations of modeling results from field data were analyzed precisely. </p...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Coporo- 1 is an 18, 000 -ft dry hole located in the tectonically active foothills of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia. A mechanical stability analysis allowed explaining most of the drilling stability-related problems and elaborating an optimal mud-density window for Coporo- 1 and future wells in the area. Repeated sections of the Carbonera formation, high in-situ stresses, abnormal pore pressure in some intervals, high temperature, and micro-fractured formations make drilling in this region both technically and economically challenging. Shear failures in shales caused frequent pack-off, stuck pipe, reaming, and <b>back</b> <b>reaming.</b> Tensile failures in sands generated lost-circulation incidents. Log-derived mechanical properties, leak-off test and lost-circulation data, borehole geometry, estimated pore pressure based on the Eaton's method, and borehole images from Coporo- 1 and partial information from the Cumaral- 1 AX well were available for this research to develop a geomechanical model for Coporo- 1. Further calculations based on the Mohr-Coulomb criterion were applied to elaborate a mud-density window designing mud-densities that allow controlled breakouts in the formations for its lower limit and mud-densities equivalent to the magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress in its upper limit. The Carbonera formation C 7 unit at 13, 620 ft {{is one of the most}} difficult formations to drill in the area. There appears to be no optimal mud-density window to simultaneously avoid serious borehole deterioration and lost circulation risks in this formation. Additional research is required to analyze the Carbonera formation C 5 unit that caused casing to collapse in several intervals in the Coporo- 1 well. The C 5 unit is likely to be a potential problem during the drilling and production operations of future wells in the area. Conclusions and recommendations are provided for future wells in the area...|$|E
5000|$|Many years later, all {{the people}} in the kingdom are upset because their clothes have {{dissolved}} to rags due to the absence of spindles and sewing needles. The King and Queen travel to the far reaches and bring <b>back</b> <b>reams</b> of fabrics. During their absence, the Red Fairy, disguised as an old woman, lures Princess Rosebud ( [...] Tahnee Welch) into a secluded old tower room and tricks her into pricking her finger. The evil curse is complete, and Rosebud falls into a deep sleep. The White Fairy uses her magic to put everyone in the castle to sleep and cover the castle in thick vines. One hundred years pass, and a handsome Prince comes to the castle and wakes Rosebud with a kiss, breaking the enchantment. The entire kingdom celebrates their awakening, and Princess Rosebud and her Prince are married and live happily ever after.|$|R

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track I: Power GenerationThere {{are many}} heavy oil {{fields in the}} world where the oil does not easily flow to the well and conventional production is thereby limited, or currently not economically viable. Missouri alone has billions of barrels of oil along its western edge, that lie just too deep for conventional surface mining (similar to that of the tar sands of Alberta) and yet have an oil that is too heavy to be easily recovered by normal oil well production. Where this oil can be extracted it will add significantly to the reserves of the country. Missouri S&T pioneered the use of high-pressure waterjets as a means of drilling long horizontal holes underground - a technology validated in field tests with Sandia National Laboratories. The technique allows the turning of a drill from an existing vertical well in a radius of less than 9 inches, whereas conventional tools require 20 ft. Once the turn has been made, the drill can then penetrate out horizontally. Once the horizontal wells have been established then one of two different approaches can be taken. The wells may be hydrofraced, as is conventionally done, for example in shale gas recovery, or the sand might be mined. Once the well has been drilled {{to the edge of a}} defined area, the drilling head can be reconfigured into a reaming mode in which the jets cut into and mine the oil bearing rock (which in Missouri is up to 30 ft thick). By disintegrating the rock and pumping it to the surface, (in the same way as in Alberta) using a hot water solution, the oil can be removed from the sand, which can then be mixed with a small amount of a binder and re-pumped <b>back</b> into the <b>reamed</b> cavity to provide support for adjacent mining of the material so that all the rock can be mined, and all the oil is recovered. In this way the oil can be recovered without the environmental impacts of the open pit tar sand operations...|$|R
