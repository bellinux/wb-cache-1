5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere would <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, {{as described in the}} book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that the Viet Cong still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it may not <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished.

5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes.

Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E

5|$|Over time, as Rome's empire grew, the two annual consuls {{ceased to}} <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> command its many armies {{in the field}} or {{administer}} its many provinces. To solve this problem, it became normal to prorogue the authority of current consuls and praetors beyond their normal terms so they could continue to command in the field. Over time, however, with increasing need for competent generals and administrators, prorogation of magistrates became the norm; and the device was used, increasingly by the assemblies, to grant imperium to popular politicians.|$|E

They will not be eligible to collect from a $1billion fund—the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund—established by Congress in 2015 to pay victims of state-sponsored terrorism. That fund pays 30% of judgments until all applicants have received that amount; remaining funds will not be distributed until all claimants have received 30% of their judgment.|$|E

It is not known to be responsible for any fatalities, but may have been involved in several unexplained, fatal diving accidents. This species fares poorly in captivity, as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into an aquarium. Since 2000, the Aquarium of the Bay and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have had some success keeping Pacific electric rays by offering them moving food.|$|E

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues {{identified}} lesions in skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency consistent across genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), {{which is consistent with}} use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate {{at the top of the}} dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness to use it can <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> settle disputes in some animals.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E

5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required a liver transplant. Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E
5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 11.5 GW of onshore wind potential exists, enough to provide 45 TWh of energy. More than double this amount exists on offshore sites where mean wind speeds are greater than on land. The total offshore potential {{is estimated}} at 25 GW, which although more expensive to install, could <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> provide almost half the total energy used in Scotland. Plans to harness up to 4.8 GW of the potential in the inner Moray Firth and Firth of Forth were announced in January 2010. Moray Offshore Renewables and SeaGreen Wind Energy were awarded development contracts by the Crown Estate {{as part of a}} UK-wide initiative. Also in 2010, discussions were held between the Scottish Government and Statoil of Norway with a view to developing a 5-turbine floating windfarm, possibly to be located off Fraserburgh. In July 2016, RSPB challenged development in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay.|$|E
