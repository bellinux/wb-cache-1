5|$|After {{taking a}} <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game, Adams joined Nottingham Forest as {{assistant}} manager under Dave Bassett.

5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor marks a <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> detached {{images of}} the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut {{is that of a}} soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This rugged soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted by most of the following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support of the troops to rule the empire.|$|E
5|$|Following the injury, McLeod {{stated that}} she was {{relieved}} because the injury gave her a much needed <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> national team. After the 2007 World Cup, she experienced a drop in confidence due to both her own negative thoughts about her performances as well as derogatory comments about her sexuality made by fellow national team players. It took her years to finally {{get back to the}} national team.|$|E

5|$|A <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> studies came in {{the second}} half of 1892. After his father's death, he could not afford to attend {{university}} that semester. He worked briefly as a private tutor in the Skien district, and was paid to write in the newspaper Varden. On returning to his studies he worked as a Kristiania correspondent for the newspaper; eventually he also worked for Päivälehti. In 1901 he took over from Erik Vullum as obituarist and anniversary writer in Verdens Gang. In the next years he would contribute extensively to publications such as Den 17de Mai, Nationalbladet, Nordmanns-Forbundets tidsskrift, Syn og Segn, Samtiden, Unglyden, Dagbladet, Verdens Gang and Tidens Tegn; these were mostly Liberal or Norwegian nationalist publications.|$|E

5|$|After the American Civil War, Stanton's {{commitment}} to female suffrage caused a schism in the women's rights movement when she, together with Susan B. Anthony, declined to support {{passage of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to African American men while women, black and white, were denied those same rights. Her position on this issue, together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women's issues beyond voting rights, {{led to the formation}} of two separate women's rights organizations that were finally rejoined, with Stanton as president of the joint organization, about twenty years after her <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original women's suffrage movement.|$|E
5|$|After {{the coup}} on 1 November 1963, in which Diệm and Nhu were killed the {{following}} day, Thơ was appointed Prime Minister by Minh's military junta five days later, on 6 November 1963. He {{was the leading}} civilian in the provisional government overseen by the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). Minh had earlier promised U.S. officials that the civilians would be above the generals in the hierarchy. In addition, he was minister for finance and the economy. Thơ's appointment was not universally popular, with some leading figures privately lobbying for a clean <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Diệm era.|$|E
5|$|Alliance members {{gathered}} that December in Ocala, Florida, and formulated a platform, {{later called}} the Ocala Demands, {{that called for}} looser money, government control of the railroads, a graduated income tax, and the direct election of senators. Weaver endorsed the message in the Tribune and corresponded with the group's leader, LeonidasL. Polk. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for a <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two major parties, and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E

5|$|Although The Raft of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death {{at the age of}} 32. The painting's influence {{can be seen in the}} works of Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode of}} Sense8 {{was written by}} the Wachowskis and Straczynski in the first season; in the second season, Lilly Wachowski took a <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> show, and the scripts were written by just Lana Wachowski and Straczynski. Most of the episodes of the two seasons were {{directed}} by the Wachowskis (or just Lana, in the second season), with the remainder being divided between their frequent collaborators James McTeigue, Tom Tykwer and Dan Glass. Lilly's break during the second season {{marked the first time}} in the sisters' career that they did not work together as a writing and directing unit. Sense8 was filmed almost entirely on location in a multitude of cities around the world.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{table tennis}} players were {{selected}} for the GB Paralympic squad. Included in the squad was 50-year-old Dzaier Neil who had previously taken part in the 1984 Los Angeles Games before taking a ten-year <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sport. In the individual events only Neil Robertson progressed {{as far as the}} round of 16 whilst the four teams entered won a total of just two matches between them. The squad therefore failed to win any of the four medals that were targeted by UK Sport.|$|E

5|$|Henry VIII {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of an artillery blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 as part of a major scheme to fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pope and the Catholic Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E
5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} during a <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. It {{presents}} {{a vision of}} a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed {{to such an extent that}} even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E
5|$|In 1713, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI {{established}} {{a line of}} succession that gave precedence to his own daughters over the daughters of his deceased older brother, Emperor Joseph I. To protect the Habsburg inheritance, he coerced, cajoled, and persuaded the crowned heads of Europe to accept the Pragmatic Sanction. In this agreement, they acknowledged any of his legitimate daughters as the rightful Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and Archduchess of Austria – a <b>break</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tradition of agnatic primogeniture.|$|E
