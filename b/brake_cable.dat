25|$|Drum brakes provide {{consistent}} braking in wet or dirty conditions {{since the}} mechanism is fully enclosed. They are usually heavier, more complicated, and often weaker than rim brakes, but they require less maintenance. Drum brakes do not adapt well to quick release axle fastening, and removing a drum brake wheel requires the operator to disconnect the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> {{as well as}} the axle. They also require a torque arm which must be anchored to the frame or fork of the bicycle, and not all bicycles are constructed to accommodate such fastenings or tolerate their applied forces.|$|E
500|$|Klein held {{a patent}} (...) for an {{improved}} {{method of routing}} cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame. The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>cables</b> {{operated}} by Hispano Suiza type servo mechanism driven from the gearbox main shaft (removed after the Grand Prix), running over pulleys, adjustable by ratchets below the riding mechanic.|$|R
50|$|The tikit was {{introduced}} in 2007. Early versions of the tikit employed a pair of <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> in the hyperfold mechanism. This mechanism permitted excessive flex in the handlebar stem when ridden.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] recent {{variation}} is the electric parking brake. First {{installed in the}} 2001 BMW 7 Series (E65), [...] electric park brakes have since appeared {{in a number of}} vehicles. Two variations are available: In the more-traditional [...] "cable-pulling" [...] type, an electric motor simply pulls the emergency <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on the push or pull of a button rather than a mechanical pedal or handle in the cabin. A more complex unit [...] (first seen on the 2003 Audi A8) uses a computer-controlled motor attached to each of the two rear brake calipers referred to as the Motor on Caliper(MoC) system.|$|E
50|$|A detangler {{is usually}} only {{used for the}} rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable.</b> The front <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> can be routed through the stem, via a hollow stem bolt known as a Pott's mod bolt, and fork steer tube to avoid the {{tangling}} problem.|$|E
50|$|Jawa {{motorcycles}} orientated for sidecar use, {{as opposed}} to solo motorcycle use, feature smaller 15 or 16 tooth gearbox sprockets (18 teeth on solo bikes), an attachment on the rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> pivot arm for the sidecar's own <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> to attach, a left footrest with an attachment for the sidecar <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> to fit into and modified wiring loom {{at the rear of}} the bike with electrical power coupling for the sidecar's lighting and accessories.|$|E
50|$|The detangler, Gyro or rotor is an {{invention}} for the freestyle BMX bicycle, allowing the handlebars {{to turn a}} complete 360Â° rotation without the <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> getting tangled up. SST oryg is another common manufacturer of detangler systems.|$|R

50|$|Defending pole {{position}} and race winner Billy Arnold {{was having trouble}} finding speed {{over the past couple}} of days, but scrambled to make an attempt late in the day on Saturday. He wheeled to the line at 7:08 p.m., past the deadline for the track to close. Officials decided to allow the run, and his four-lap average of 113.848 mph tentatively took the {{pole position}}. After the run, some drivers protested, and during a post-qualifying inspection, it was found that Arnold's <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> were not connected. During the rush to get the car on the track, the crew had neglected to connect the <b>brake</b> <b>cables,</b> and technical committee chairman Louis H. Schwitzer disallowed the run.|$|R
5000|$|The Mondia [...] "Super" [...] racing {{frame was}} {{somewhat}} tighter and stiffer, {{and with a}} straighter front fork. Mondia Super frames used the less elaborate Prugnat chrome lugs with distinctive center cut-outs. Brazed-on guides for <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> on this model were centered {{along the top of}} the top tube.|$|R
50|$|In a {{development}} program costing $400 million, engineers initially used an Erector Set {{to visualize the}} complex interaction of the design and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking <b>brake</b> <b>cables,</b> rear climate control lines, and rear suspension but precluded all-wheel drive (AWD).|$|R
5000|$|In {{cars with}} rear drum brakes, the parking <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> usually actuates these drums {{mechanically}} with much less force than {{is available through}} the hydraulic system.|$|E
50|$|Some stems have a {{hole through}} the {{horizontal}} part to support the front <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on bikes with cantilever brakes such as cyclo-cross bicycles and older mountain bikes.|$|E
5000|$|... "Servo Wave" [...] - This is {{a system}} Shimano {{introduced}} to brake levers which allowed them to pull more <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> {{at the start of}} the lever stroke than at the end, giving improved separation between the brake blocks and the rim to allow for mud and lack of trueness in the wheels while still delivering the same braking power as systems which have a constant ratio between lever movement and cable pull and therefore less pad clearance. This was introduced during the mid-1990s. This was implemented initially by mounting the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on a roller that moves towards the lever pivot in a slot in the lever blade as the lever is pulled. A second design pulled the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> downwards towards a cam near to the brake lever pivot instead. Servo wave has appeared for the first time on a hydraulic disk brake lever on the 2008 Shimano XT groupset.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2008, Pino Maniaci's car, {{parked outside}} his home, was [...] "doused with gasoline" [...] and set on fire. This episode {{is part of}} what Maniaci claims is a {{constant}} process of threats, which manifests itself in [...] "countless attacks", such as slashed tyres or severed <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> in the cars he uses and even windscreens shattered by gunshots.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 a {{new version}} of the tikit {{replaced}} the pair of <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> with a single, and much thicker, cable, plus other improvements to the handlebar stem and to the rear seat pin assembly. The resulting bike is much stiffer. Bike Friday provides an upgrade path for 2007 tikits which provides some of the 2008 features, notably the new cable assembly.|$|R

50|$|The valiha {{generally}} has 21-24 strings. Historically these were formed of strips of the bamboo body, prised up and raised by small bridges, {{but in the}} modern day the strings are often made of unwound bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>cable,</b> though serious players may use standard guitar or piano strings.|$|E
50|$|SLR ("Shimano Linear Response") - Integration of {{a return}} spring into the brake lever, pushing the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> back when the lever is released.

50|$|Although the {{flatland}} bicycle {{is similar}} to most other BMX bicycles, flatland is often performed with specially designed frames with geometry (head tube angle, top tube length, etc.) suited {{to the needs of}} flatlanders. Front and rear bolt-on pegs, a hollow compression bolt on the forks for the front <b>brake</b> <b>cable,</b> and a rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> detangler or Gyro to allow the bars to rotate endlessly without tangling the brake cables. Also invented specifically for flatland riding is the rear hub mechanism known as a freecoaster, which allows the rear wheel to roll backwards without engaging the hub and making the cranks rotate backwards as they would on a normal freewheel or cassette style hub. Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include zero offset forks, narrow handlebars, very high pressure tires (100psi and higher), and a very small front sprocket (18-28 teeth).|$|E
50|$|Gordon Huntley (1930 - 7 March 1988) was a {{musician}} and steel guitar player. His early playing career {{was with the}} Hawaiian Serenaders in 1959, for whom he played a triple neck Fender lap steel guitar. He converted this to a pedal steel by adding an accelerator pedal from a tractor connected with bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
