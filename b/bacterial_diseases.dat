5|$|Apple {{trees are}} {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} fungal and <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. A trend in orchard management is the use of organic methods. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.|$|E

5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and {{domestic}} reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest number}} {{exist in the}} gut flora, {{and a large number}} on the skin. The vast {{majority}} of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, though many are beneficial particularly in the gut flora. However several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague. The most common fatal <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of WHO's "Guidelines for care at the first-referral level in developing countries" {{in an area of}} intense malaria transmission and identify bacterial infections in children with and without malaria. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: District hospital in Muheza, northeast Tanzania. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 2 months to 13 years admitted to hospital for febrile illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity of WHO guidelines in diagnosing invasive bacterial disease; susceptibility of isolated organisms to recommended antimicrobials. RESULTS: Over one year, 3639 children were enrolled and 184 (5. 1 %) died; 2195 (60. 3 %) were blood slide positive for Plasmodium falciparum, 341 (9. 4 %) had invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease,</b> and 142 (3. 9 %) were seropositive for HIV. The prevalence of invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> was lower in slide positive children (100 / 2195, 4. 6 %) than in slide negative children (241 / 1444, 16. 7 %). Non-typhi Salmonella was the most frequently isolated organism (52 / 100 (52 %) of organisms in slide positive children and 108 / 241 (45 %) in slide negative children). Mortality among children with invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> was significantly higher (58 / 341, 17 %) than in children without invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> (126 / 3298, 3. 8 %) (P< 0. 001), and this was true regardless of the presence of P falciparum parasitaemia. The sensitivity and specificity of WHO criteria in identifying invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> in slide positive children were 60. 0 % (95 % confidence interval 58. 0 % to 62. 1 %) and 53. 5 % (51. 4 % to 55. 6 %), compared with 70. 5 % (68. 2 % to 72. 9 %) and 48. 1 % (45. 6 % to 50. 7 %) in slide negative children. In children with WHO criteria for invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease,</b> only 99 / 211 (47 %) of isolated organisms were susceptible to the first recommended antimicrobial agent. CONCLUSIONS: In an area exposed to high transmission of malaria, current WHO guidelines failed to identify almost a third of children with invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease,</b> {{and more than half of}} the organisms isolated were not susceptible to currently recommended antimicrobials. Improved diagnosis and treatment of invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> are needed to reduce childhood mortality...|$|R
5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E

25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} physicians have duties to serve as role models {{for the general public}} in matters of health, for example by not smoking cigarettes. Indeed, in most western nations relatively few physicians smoke, and their professional knowledge does appear to have a beneficial effect on their health and lifestyle. According to a study of male physicians, life expectancy is slightly higher for physicians (73.0 years for white and 68.7 for black) than lawyers or many other highly educated professionals. Causes of death less likely in physicians than the general population include respiratory disease (including pneumonia, pneumoconioses, COPD, but excluding emphysema and other chronic airway obstruction), alcohol-related deaths, rectosigmoidal and anal cancers, and <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThe Sahel {{region of}} West Africa {{has the highest}} {{bacterial}} meningitis attack and case fatality rate in the world. The effect of climatic factors on patterns of invasive respiratory <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> is not well documented. ObjectiveWe aimed to assess the link between climatic factors and occurrence of invasive respiratory <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> in a Sahel region of Niger. MethodsWe conducted daily disease surveillance and climatic monitoring over an 8 -year period between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2010, in Niamey, Niger, to determine risk factors for bacterial meningitis and invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease.</b> We investigated the mechanistic effects of these factors on Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice. ResultsHigh temperatures and low visibility (resulting from high concentrations of airborne dust) were identified as significant risk factors for bacterial meningitis. Dust inhalation or exposure to high temperatures promoted progression of stable asymptomatic pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage to pneumonia and invasive disease. Dust exposure significantly reduced phagocyte-mediated bacterial killing, and exposure to high temperatures increased release of the key pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin through increased bacterial autolysis. ConclusionOur findings show that climatic factors can have a substantial influence on infectious disease patterns, altering density of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage, reducing phagocytic killing, and resulting in increased inflammation and tissue damage and consequent invasiveness. Climatic surveillance {{should be used to}} forecast invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> epidemics, and simple control measures to reduce particulate inhalation might reduce the incidence of invasive <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> in regions of the world exposed to high temperatures and increased airborne dust...|$|R

500|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is seen in}} action {{in the development of}} antibiotic resistance in microorganisms. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, antibiotics have been used to fight <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases.</b> The widespread misuse of antibiotics has selected for microbial resistance to antibiotics in clinical use, {{to the point that the}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been described as a [...] "superbug" [...] because of the threat it poses to health and its relative invulnerability to existing drugs. Response strategies typically include the use of different, stronger antibiotics; however, new strains of MRSA have recently emerged that are resistant even to these drugs. This is an evolutionary arms race, in which bacteria develop strains less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers attempt to develop new antibiotics that can kill them. A similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects. Arms races are not necessarily induced by man; a well-documented example involves the spread of a gene in the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina suppressing male-killing activity by Wolbachia bacteria parasites on the island of Samoa, where the spread of the gene is known to have occurred over a period of just five years ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> in {{dogs are}} usually not {{contagious}} from dog to dog; instead they are usually the result of wound colonization, opportunistic infections secondary to decreased resistance (often the result of viral infections), or secondary to other conditions (pyoderma secondary to skin allergies or pyometra secondary to cystic endometrial hyperplasia). [...] These examples are not considered infectious diseases {{because they do not}} satisfy Koch's postulates - for example Staphylococcus intermedius, a commonly isolated bacteria from skin infections in dogs, would not cause pyoderma when introduced to a healthy dog. [...] In all likelihood that type of bacteria is already present on the skin of a healthy dog.|$|E
2500|$|In general, in {{needing to}} run {{simulations}} rather than compute likelihoods, {{it may be}} difficult to make fine-scale inferences on epidemiological parameters, and instead, this work usually focuses on broader questions, testing whether overall genealogical patterns are consistent with one epidemiological model or another. [...] Additionally, simulation-based methods are often used to validate inference results, providing test data where the correct answer is known ahead of time. Because computing likelihoods for genealogical data under complex simulation models has proven difficult, an alternative statistical approach called Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is becoming popular in fitting these simulation models to patterns of genetic variation, following successful application of this approach to <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases.</b> This is because ABC makes use of easily computable summary statistics to approximate likelihoods, rather than the likelihoods themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Viral and <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> {{that kill}} victims before the {{illnesses}} spread to others tend to flare {{up and then}} die out. A more resilient disease would establish an equilibrium; if its victims lived beyond infection, the disease would spread further. The evolutionary process selects against quick lethality, with the most immediately fatal diseases being the most short-lived. [...] A similar evolutionary pressure acts upon victim populations, as those lacking genetic resistance to common diseases die and do not leave descendants, whereas those who are resistant procreate and pass resistant genes to their offspring. For example, in the first fifty years of the sixteenth century, an unusually strong strain of syphilis killed {{a high proportion of}} infected Europeans within a few months; over time, however, the disease has become much less virulent.|$|E
