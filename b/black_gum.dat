5|$|The {{forests in}} and around Ricketts Glen State Park {{are some of the}} most {{extensive}} in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like <b>black</b> <b>gum,</b> yellow birch, cinnamon fern, sphagnum and various sedges. The old-growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and oaks, and the park is home to 85species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.|$|E

Farlow Gap and the Daniel Ridge Trail pass through forests with diverse tree species, including yellow poplar, red oak, <b>black</b> <b>gum,</b> and red maple. Rhododendron also grows abundantly (sometimes called laurel), and remains green all year, its leaves curling in the winter.|$|E

25|$|Vegetation, in some regions, emits {{environmentally}} {{significant amounts}} of Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on warmer days. These VOCs react with primary anthropogenic pollutants—specifically, NOx, SO2, and anthropogenic organic carbon compounds — to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants. <b>Black</b> <b>gum,</b> poplar, oak and willow are some examples of vegetation that can produce abundant VOCs. The VOC production from these species result in ozone levels up to eight {{times higher than the}} low-impact tree species.|$|E

[...] This tree typically does not grow further north than central Kentucky, and has been designated as a state threatened species in Indiana. [...] Other trees found in the park include at least four types of oak (black, chestnut, red, and white) and three types of hickory (bitternut, pignut, and shagbark). [...] The park also contains at least two types of maple trees: [...] black and sugar. Patches of paw paw trees can be found throughout the park, and these trees produce an edible fruit.

50|$|The swift parrot (Lathamus discolor) {{is another}} key species {{protected}} by the park; a migratory bird which travels between southeast mainland Australia and Tasmania.

The bird nests primarily in blue gums (Eucalyptus globulus) relying on the trees flowers for its breeding success, with <b>black</b> <b>gums</b> (Eucalytus ovate) also noted as an important food source. Swift parrots nest in tree hollows, usually on upper slopes and ridges in dry eucalypt forest within 10 km of the coast, with the total population being estimated at approximately 1,000 pairs.|$|R
5000|$|In the ocean, {{pink salmon}} are bright silver fish. After {{returning}} to their spawning streams, their coloring changes to pale grey on the back with yellowish-white belly (although some turn an overall dull green color). As with all salmon, {{in addition to the}} dorsal fin, they also have an adipose fin. The fish is characterized by a white mouth with <b>black</b> <b>gums,</b> no teeth on the tongue, large oval-shaped black spots on the back, a v-shaped tail, and an anal fin with 13-17 soft rays. During their spawning migration, males develop a pronounced humped back, hence their nickname [...] "humpies". Pink salmon average 4.8 pounds (2.2 kg) in weight.

The name [...] "tupelo" [...] is used primarily in the American South; northward and in Appalachia, the tree is more commonly called the <b>black</b> <b>gum</b> or the sour gum, although no part of the plant is particularly gummy. Both of these names contrast it with a different tree species with a broadly overlapping range, the sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), which does produce an aromatic resin.

6000|$|So Imbozwi {{was sent}} for, Jerry taking the message. Presently he arrived. He was a villainous-looking person of {{uncertain}} age, humpbacked like {{the picture of}} Punch, wizened and squint-eyed. His costume was of the ordinary witch-doctor type being set off with snake skins, fish bladders, baboon's teeth and little bags of medicine. To add to his charms a broad strip of pigment, red ochre probably, ran down his forehead and the nose beneath, across the lips and chin, ending in a red mark {{the size of a}} penny where the throat joins the chest. His woolly hair also, in which was twisted a small ring of <b>black</b> <b>gum,</b> was soaked with grease and powdered blue. It was arranged in a kind of horn, coming to a sharp point about five inches above the top of the skull. Altogether he looked extremely like the devil.

6000|$|The village {{contains}} some 400 souls, {{and throughout the}} country the maximum would be about 500 spears, or 4,000 of both sexes, whilst the minimum {{is a couple of}} dozen. It is pleasantly situated on the left bank of the Mbokwe River, a streamlet here some 50 feet broad, whose water rises 6 feet 10 inches under the tidal influence. The single street, about half a mile long, is formed by two parallel rows of huts, looking upon a cleared line of yellow clay, and provided with three larger sheds--the palaver houses. The Fán houses resemble those of the Mpongwe; in fact, the tribes, beginning at the Camarones River, build in much the same style, but all are by no means so neat and clean as those of the seaboard. A thatch, whose projecting eaves form deep shady verandahs, surmounts walls of split bamboo, supported by raised platforms of tamped earth, windows being absent and chimneys unknown; the ceiling is painted like coal tar by oily soot, and two opposite doors make the home a passage through which no one hesitates to pass. The walls are garnished with weapons and nets, both skilfully made, and the furniture consists of cooking utensils and water-pots, mats for bedding, logs of wood for seats and pillows, and lumps of timber or dwarf stools, neatly cut out of a single block. Their only night-light--that grand test of civilization--is the Mpongwe torch, a yard of hard, <b>black</b> <b>gum,</b> mixed with and tightly bound up in dried banana leaves. According to some it is acacia; others declare it to be the [...] "blood" [...] of the bombax, which is also used for caulking. They gather it in the forest, especially during the dries, collect it in hollow bamboos, and prepare it by heating in the neptune, or brass pan. The odour is pleasant, but fragments of falling fire endanger the hut, and trimming must be repeated every ten minutes. The sexes are not separated; as throughout intertropical Africa, the men are fond of idling at their clubs; and the women, who must fetch water and cook, clean the hut, and nurse the baby, are seldom allowed to waste time. They are naturally a more prolific race than those inhabiting the damp, unhealthy lowlands, and the number of the children contrasts pleasantly with the [...] "bleak house" [...] of the debauched Mpongwe, who puts no question when his wife presents him with issue.|$|E

Brown or <b>black</b> <b>gums</b> are often become the complaint that interfere with appearance, especially in patients who have a habit of smoking. Pigmentation caused by melanin hyperpigmentation and usually does not present a medical problems, so patients are not aware of it. Surgical method with the scalpel scraping technique and gingivo abrasion technique using high speed carbide bur has been widely used as a method of gingival depigmentation. This method is easily done, simple and can be done in a relatively short time. In this case report presented regarding the management of patients with gingival hyperpigmentation of the maxilla and mandible were treated with surgical method using a scalpel scraping technique combined with gingivo abrasion technique using high speed carbide bur. The result, after 4 weeks follow up, color of the patient's gingival was pink and there is none recurrence of the pigmentation...|$|R
