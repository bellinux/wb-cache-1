5|$|Although {{the venom}} {{of a few}} spider and {{scorpion}} species can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> to humans, medical researchers are investigating {{the use of these}} venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction. The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a test for the presence of contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins in}} their {{hometown}} of Pallet Town. After venturing alone into the tall grass, the player is stopped by Professor Oak, a famous Pokémon researcher. Professor Oak explains to the player that wild Pokémon may be living there, and encountering them alone can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous.</b> He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, a rival aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and the rival are both instructed {{to select a}} starter Pokémon for their travels out of Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. Oak's Grandson will always choose the Pokémon which is stronger against the player's starting Pokémon. He will then challenge the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon {{and will continue to}} battle the player at certain points throughout the games.|$|E
5|$|The silent {{protagonist of}} FireRed and LeafGreen {{is a child}} {{who lives in a}} small town named Pallet Town. After players start a journey and venture alone into tall grass, a voice warns them to stop. Professor Oak, a famous Pokémon researcher, {{explains}} to the player that such grass is often the habitat of wild Pokémon, and encountering them alone can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous.</b> He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, another aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and their rival are both instructed to select a starter Pokémon for their travels. The rival then challenges the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon and continues to battle the player at certain points throughout the games.|$|E

25|$|The Lookout Mountain Incline Railway, often {{referred}} to as the Incline Railway by locals, serves as a tourist attraction. It is also occasionally used for commuting by Lookout Mountain residents, particularly during wintry weather when traveling up and down the mountain could <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous.</b> Tramadol can cause a higher incidence of nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite compared with opioids, which could deter recreational use. Compared to hydrocodone, fewer persons choose to use tramadol recreationally.|$|E
25|$|The sport can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> for wagon {{drivers and}} outriders. There have been five human deaths {{related to the}} Rangeland Derby at the Calgary Stampede. Three {{occurred}} between 1948 and 1971, {{one of which was}} a spectator struck by an outrider's horse, and two occurred in the 1990s; an outrider in 1996 and a driver in 1999.|$|E

25|$|The program {{started with}} a {{disabled}} employee who couldn't drive a sports car because of his physical issue. He developed a new clutch system {{that would allow him}} to drive, but needed to test it virtually beforehand, as road testing of such a vital modification would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous.</b> He was granted free access to CATIA to design his idea, which allowed him to eventually drive a sports car.|$|E
25|$|Cleaning is an {{important}} part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing on the horse. Sweat and dirt also tend to cause cracking in leather, which may result in breaking. This not only decreases the value of the saddle, but can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> if critical equipment, such as a stirrup leather, breaks mid-ride. Proper care and conditioning of the saddle will not only increase its useful life, but will also help to retain its value.|$|E
25|$|Non-medical use of {{fentanyl}} {{by individuals}} without opiate tolerance can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> and {{has resulted in}} numerous deaths. Even those with opiate tolerances {{are at high risk}} for overdoses. Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course {{because of the nature of}} absorption. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{important}} that the stirrup be the correct width for the boot. A stirrup that is too narrow will increase the chance that the boot will get caught in it (which would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> should the rider fall), and a too-wide stirrup makes it harder for a rider to keep it under the foot, and presents some risk that the foot might slip all the way through. It is generally suggested that the stirrup be no more than 1inch larger than the widest part of the sole of the rider's boots.|$|E
25|$|Potential {{differences}} between pool water and railings, or shower facilities and grounded drain pipes {{are not uncommon}} {{as a result of}} neutral to earth voltages (NEV), and can be a major nuisance, but are usually not life-threatening. However, contact voltage resulting from damaged insulation on a current carrying conductor can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous,</b> and can lead to shock or electrocution. Such a condition can arise spontaneously from mechanical, thermal, or chemical stress on insulation materials, or from unintentional damage from digging activity, freeze-frost seizing, corrosion and collapse of conduit, or even workmanship issues.|$|E
25|$|Chemical rockets are {{the most}} common type of high power rocket, {{typically}} creating a high speed exhaust by the combustion of fuel with an oxidizer. The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single liquid fuel that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst (monopropellants), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact (hypergolic propellants), two liquids that must be ignited to react, a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer (solid fuel), or solid fuel with liquid oxidizer (hybrid propellant system). Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous.</b> However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.|$|E

25|$|Mice have a rapid {{reproduction}} rate; the {{gestation period}} is approximately 19 to 23 days. The typical litter size is 4 to 12 young. In some instances, up to thirty young have been born. Males can mate {{with the female}} {{as soon as the}} litter is born, which means that a female could become pregnant with another litter within 3 days of giving birth. Female mice should not be bred before 12 weeks or after 8 months; doing so can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous,</b> and some mice can die while giving birth. Females come into heat around every three to five days, so the pair can be kept together for up to ten days.|$|E
25|$|While Commodore Jones and Captain Landais were {{fighting}} their unexpectedly separate battles, Captains Cottineau of the Pallas and Ricot of Vengeance were left {{wondering what to}} do. In a well-organised formation, {{they might have been}} able to make a contribution, but to intervene in a ship-to-ship duel would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous.</b> In theory, they could have taken advantage of the confusion to sail off after the stragglers of the convoy, but night had now fallen, and until the moon rose, they would not be able to see their prey. Also, it quickly became clear that Bonhomme Richard would need help. Therefore, they waited until they could be useful. About this time, the little schooner caught up with them, but there was no way to transfer the potentially very useful boarding team to Bonhomme Richard or Alliance.|$|E
25|$|The Viperidae differ much among {{themselves}} in the toxicity of their venom. Some, such as the Indian Russell's viper (Daboia russelli) and saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus); the American rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), bushmasters (Lachesis spp.) and lanceheads (Bothrops spp.); and the African adders (Bitis spp.), night adders (Causus spp.), and horned vipers (Cerastes spp.), cause fatal results unless a remedy is speedily applied. The bite of the larger European vipers may <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous,</b> and followed by fatal results, especially in children, {{at least in the}} hotter parts of the Continent; whilst the small meadow viper (Vipera ursinii), which hardly ever bites unless roughly handled, {{does not seem to be}} possessed of a very virulent venom, and, although very common in some parts of Austria and Hungary, is not known to have ever caused a serious accident.|$|E

25|$|Another {{advance in}} dinghy sailing was {{introduced}} in the 1930s, when the technique of trapezing was introduced. This involves using the crew to provide more leverage (than possible by hiking out) to keep the sails vertical and the boat balanced, doing this can prevent the boat from capsizing, by hanging outside the boat on a harness and rope attached to the 'hounds' or upper mast. As a result, the boat is easier to keep upright, and the sails can deliver maximum power most of the time. While trapezing can be helpful and increase speed, it can also <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> if the crew is not wearing a quick release harness or is inexperienced. The quick release harness allows the crew to unstrap themselves quickly so as to not get forced under the boat if it were to capsize.|$|E
