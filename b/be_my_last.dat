500|$|The first choral {{movement}} 5,"" [...] (If {{it is my}} God's will), {{is marked}} aria by Franck. Bach set it for four parts, using song-like homophony. Wolff compares the style to Thuringian motets of around 1700. The first part is not repeated da capo, {{in keeping with the}} last words [...] "" [...] (May this <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> word). While a textual da capo is impossible, Bach composed a musical da capo, giving the movement a structure of ABB'A'. Dürr notes that [...] "Arnold Schering has drawn attention to the increasing rapture".|$|E
500|$|Pugh re-joined Hereford on a {{permanent}} basis following their relegation into League Two, signing a one-year contract on 30 June 2009. Upon this move, he realised that he [...] "needed to knuckle down and get on the football ladder now, because this could <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> opportunity". He scored twice on his second debut for Hereford, the first from a long-range shot in the 39th minute and the second a 90th-minute equaliser, as they drew 2–2 away to Morecambe on 8 August 2009. Pugh finished 2009–10 as Hereford's top scorer with 13 goals in 46 appearances. His goals were credited with helping stabilise Hereford, as they finished in 16th place in League Two. He left Hereford {{at the end of}} the season after rejecting a new two-year contract.|$|E

500|$|Themes of {{corruption}} and salvation are brought to the fore as Valérie and Crevel lie dying from the mysterious poison. When his daughter urges him {{to meet with a}} priest, Crevel angrily refuses, mocking the church and indicating that his social stature will be his salvation: [...] "la mort regarde à deux fois avant de frapper un maire de Paris!" [...] ("Death thinks twice of it before carrying off a Mayor of Paris.") Valérie, meanwhile, makes a deathbed conversion and urges Bette to abandon her quest for revenge. Ever the courtesan, Valérie describes her new Christianity in terms of seduction: [...] "je ne puis maintenant plaire qu'à Dieu! je vais tâcher de me réconcilier avec lui, ce sera ma dernière coquetterie!" [...] ("I can please no one now but God. I will try to be reconciled to Him, and that will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> flirtation...!") ...|$|E
500|$|During his procrastinations with Koussevitzky, Sibelius {{continued}} {{to work on the}} symphony. In 1931 he again spent time in Berlin, writing to Aino in May 1931 that [...] "the symphony is advancing with rapid strides". Progress was interrupted by illness, but {{towards the end of the}} year Sibelius was confidently asserting that [...] "I am writing my eighth symphony and I am full of youth. How can this be explained?" [...] In May 1933, as he {{continued to}} deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: [...] "It is as if I had come home... I'm taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy within me. Romantic." [...] Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: [...] "It will be the reckoning of my whole existence – sixty-eight years. It will probably <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>last.</b> Eight symphonies and a hundred songs. It has to be enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{particular}} {{note was}} Marseille's 158th claim. After {{landing in the}} afternoon of the 26 September 1942, he was physically exhausted. Several accounts allude to his Squadron members being visibly shocked at Marseille's physical state. Marseille, according to his own post-battle accounts, had been engaged by a Spitfire pilot in an intense dogfight that began at high altitude and descended to low-level. Marseille recounted how both he and his opponent strove to get onto the tail of the other. Both succeeded and fired but each time the pursued managed to turn the table on his attacker. Finally, with only 15 minutes of fuel remaining, he climbed into the sun. The RAF fighter followed and was caught in the glare. Marseille executed a tight turn and roll, fired from 100 metres range. The Spitfire caught fire and shed a wing. It crashed into the ground with the pilot still inside. Marseille wrote, [...] "That was the toughest adversary I have ever had. His turns were fabulous... I thought it would <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> fight". Unfortunately the pilot and his unit remain unidentified.|$|E

500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going to}} <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{death toll}} {{could have been}} worse {{had it not been for}} the {{self-sacrifice}} of an Intercolonial Railway dispatcher, Patrick Vincent (Vince) Coleman, operating at the railyard about [...] from Pier 6, where the explosion occurred. He and his co-worker, William Lovett, learned of the dangerous cargo aboard the burning Mont-Blanc from a sailor and began to flee. Coleman remembered, however, that an incoming passenger train from Saint John, New Brunswick, was due to arrive at the railyard within minutes. He returned to his post alone and continued to send out urgent telegraph messages to stop the train. Several variations of the message have been reported, among them this from the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic: [...] "Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbor making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> message. Good-bye boys." [...] Coleman's message was responsible for bringing all incoming trains around Halifax to a halt. It was heard by other stations all along the Intercolonial Railway, helping railway officials to respond immediately. Passenger Train No. 10, the overnight train from Saint John, is believed to have heeded the warning and stopped a safe distance from the blast at Rockingham, saving the lives of about 300 railway passengers. Coleman was killed at his post as the explosion ripped through the city. He was honoured with a Heritage Minute in the 1990s and inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2004.|$|E
500|$|In April 1967, the Australian {{government}} committed No.2 Squadron and its Canberra bombers {{to action}} in the Vietnam War. Operating from Phan Rang Air Base outside Saigon, {{under the direction of}} the US 35th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW), the Canberras were initially engaged in medium-altitude missions against Viet Cong forces, guided by Sky Spot ground radar, usually at night. Promoted to wing commander, Evans assumed control of the squadron in December 1967. Having never heard a shot fired in anger in his 24 years of service, he was anxious for a combat assignment. The Japanese surrender in August 1945 had prevented him from seeing action in World WarII, and the Korean War had ended just as he was on the verge of a posting for active duty with No.77 Squadron. [...] "Vietnam", he reasoned, [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> chance". By the time he took command, the Canberras were flying a greater proportion of their missions at lower levels in daylight, using visual bomb-aiming methods honed during their earlier service in Malaysia; this gave the bombers an average circular error probability (CEP) of 50metres. Evans introduced intensive post-mission analysis to refine their technique, and permitted his pilots to bomb at the lowest level possible at which the bombsight would operate. The CEP was eventually reduced to 20metres, making the Canberras the most accurate bombing force in the region. In January 1968, the unit participated in the air campaigns to defend Huế and Khe Sanh during the Tet Offensive. Phan Rang itself was often subjected to harassing attacks and mortar fire from the Viet Cong, requiring Evans to undertake improvements to the airfield's ground defences. He completed his posting to Vietnam in November 1968 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his performance as commanding officer of No.2 Squadron. The decoration was gazetted on 2May 1969 and backdated to 13March.|$|E

With only one test remaining in the tour, Patel called it [...] "a moment that could <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> one". Patel's recall also coincided with Williamson's omission from the playing side due to being stricken with fever.

2500|$|The {{last major}} Cascade Mountain to be conquered by Rusk {{that he wrote}} about was Mount Shasta. He and four members from the Cascadians made an attempt to climb the peak in 1922. The four from the Cascadians were Wayne and Fern Richardson, Clarence Truitt, and Rolfe Whitnall. They nearly {{made it to the}} summit, but were balked by sheets of ice in the last hundred feet or so. The next year Rusk made a solo ascent and this time he was successful.

[...] Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space's weird geometry by constructing special plinths at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so. In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an Alexander Calder mobile whose wire inevitably hung at a true plumb vertical, [...] "suggesting hallucination" [...] in the disorienting context of the tilted floor.|$|E

Tyson and Spinks have both been inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.|$|E
