Hamiguitan, Philippines and identify {{the underlying causes of}} observed phenotypic variability. PCA reduced the 44 characters into 12 principal components which cumulatively explained 79. 9 % of total variance and clustered the ferns into groups according to discriminant traits (length of lateral pinnae, width of <b>blade,</b> <b>receptacle</b> position and true indusium). Cluster analysis using UPGMA and UPGMC revealed similar groupings and trends. Both trees showed the divergence of the 3 fern species (Sticherus hirtus Copel, Dipteris conjugata and Cyathea sp) and the morphological homogeneity of the rest. Moreover, UPGMA outperformed UPGMC in terms of classifying the fern species into functional groups on the basis of dissimilarity. This study, predating molecular diversity analysis, has demonstrated the effectiveness of this low-level taxonomic tool when used with powerful statistical techniques...|$|E

In natural seawater (pH 8. 1, ca. 2. 2 mM Ci), irradiance-saturated net photosynthetic rate (NPR) was greater by 25. 3 % in <b>blade</b> than <b>receptacle,</b> whereas dark respiratory rate (DR) was 2 -fold higher in <b>receptacle</b> than <b>blade.</b> NPR at pH 8. 1 was nearly saturated with the 2. 2 mM Ci for both <b>blade</b> and <b>receptacle.</b> However, {{the values of the}} half-saturation constant for Ci were sharply increased at pH 9. 0. NPR was significantly affected, but DR was remained unchanged, with the variation of the pH values in seawater. The data from the final pH value derived from the pH-drift experiments and the comparison between the measured and theoretically estimated photosynthetic rates suggested that both <b>blade</b> and <b>receptacle</b> were capable of acquiring HCO(3) (-) in seawater. The inhibitors experiments showed that a HCO(3) (-) dehydration mechanism mediated by external carbonic anhydrase activity occurred in both the <b>blade</b> and <b>receptacle</b> tissues of S. henslowianum. The proton buffer TRIS had no inhibitory effect on NPR at normal pH value in natural seawater (pH 8. 1), but it significantly depressed NPR at pH 9. 0. This suggested that proton transport occurred at the outside of the plasma membrane facilitated the operation of the carbon acquisition at pH 9. 0. It was proposed that the strategy of photosynthetic carbon acquisition at higher pH would prevent the alga from the damage of over-excitation and photoinhibition in case of sunshine and calm water. We concluded that the <b>blade</b> and <b>receptacle</b> tissues of S. henslowianum have similar mechanism of acquisition of exogenous Ci from seawater to drive photosynthesis; yet they are differentiated more or less with the photosynthetic properties...|$|R

40|$|In this article, the {{morphology}} of a brown alga is revisited {{and compared}} to the phyllotaxis of land plants. The alga, Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt has a highly organized thallus with a stipe, the stem-like main axis, and hierarchically organized lateral branches of successive orders. Around each of these axes, the lateral organs: <b>blades,</b> side-branches, and <b>receptacles</b> grow in a spiral disposition. As in land plants, this organization is related to an apical mode of growth. Measurements performed along the mature differentiated axes {{as well as in}} their meristematic regions confirm the similarity of the large-scale organization of this brown alga with that of the land plants. In particular, the divergence angle between successive elements has similar values and it results from the existence around the meristem of parastichies having the same Fibonacci ordering. This is remarkable {{in view of the fact}} that brown algae (Phaeophyceae) and land plants (Embryophyta) are two clades that diverged approximately 1800 million years ago when they were both unicellular organisms. We argue that the observed similarity results from a morphogenetic convergence. This is in strong support of the genericity and robustness of self-organization models in which similar structures, here Fibonacci related spirals, can be obtained in various situations in which the genetic and physiological implementation of development can be of a different nature...|$|R
40|$|The {{different}} {{period of}} growth and reproduction in {{the life cycle of}} organisms implied that the limited resources within their bodies have to be allocated between different processes as a 'trade-off'. Therefore, it would be important to understand how they adapt to the environment by understanding their life history, how they allocate their resources in different life stages and the strategies they adopt when there are changes in their living condition. Sargassum siliquastrum is a dominant alga in Hong Kong. How it allocates its resources to growth and reproduction was examined in this thesis research. Its phenology in Lung Lok Shiu of Tung Ping Chau Marine Park, Hong Kong was studied by general monthly quadrat survey from September 2004 to May 2006. The four typical developmental stages of regeneration (slow growth), active growth, reproductive and senescence (die back) stage were observed. Maxima in length (90. 28 士 45. 13 cm in January 2005; 70. 18 土 18. 65 cm in February 2006), number of main axes (2. 21 士 0. 81 main axes in January 2005; 2. 29 士 0. 47 main axes in December 2005), number of size class 1 (l- 3 cm) new shoots (6. 71 士 3. 05 new shoots in February 2005; 5. 18 士 1. 39 new shoots in January 2006), number of size class 2 (> 3 - 5 cm) new shoots (2. 53 士 1. 23 new shoots in February 2005), fertility (70. 59 士 33. 08 % in January 2005; 77. 74 士 17. 94 % in February 2006) and reproductive effort (21. 13 土 7. 59 % in December 2004; 10. 80 士 7. 24 % in February 2006) of the population were recorded in winter, and their minima were obtained in summer. In contrast, density of the population was highest during the slow growth stage in summer (90. 50 士 62. 78 individuals / m 2 in July 2005), and lowest during its reproductive months (35 士 41. 33 individuals / m 2 in January 2005; 23. 50 士 11. 00 individuals / m 2 in December 2005). Among the physical parameters evaluated, cooler temperature and decreasing day-length from summer to winter was found to favor the growth in length of the population whereas production of receptacles was favored by low water temperature and short day-length. The seasonal and individual variations (between holdfast, basal, middle, top <b>blade</b> regions and <b>receptacles)</b> of the reserve sugar alcohol, mannitol, in Sargassum siliquastrum collected monthly from December 2003 to May 2006 were investigated using the HPLC technique. Seasonal variation of its mannitol content ranged from about 1 % to 17 % of its dry weight. Mannitol content increased as growth proceeded and peaked during the active growing stage (10. 81 士 4. 87 g mannitol/ lOOg dry seaweed in September 2004; 13. 17 士 5. 60 g mannitol/ lOOg dry seaweed in October 2005). A drop in mannitol content was recorded only {{at the start of the}} reproductive period in December and remained stable thereafter. Dramatic decrease in mannitol concentration occurred after the reproductive period and a small increase in mannitol content was identified in the middle of the slow growth stage in April (5. 69 士 2. 11 g mannitol/ lOOg dry seaweed in 2004; 5. 91 士 3. 71 g mannitol/ lOOg dry seaweed in 2005; 17. 87 ± 7. 46 g mannitol/ lOOg dry seaweed in 2006), suggesting that the surplus produced during the slow growth period may be used to maintain the perennial holdfast or to develop new shoots for the next season. On an individual level, more mature basal part of the plant (i. e. holdfast and basal blade region) contained higher levels of mannitol when compared with the younger middle and top <b>blade</b> regions. <b>Receptacles</b> of S. siliquastrum displayed the lowest mannitol content, which appeared to match its low photosynthetic activity. The disproportionally high level of mannitol in the photosynthetically less active holdfast suggested that mannitol may be diffused from the basal blades down to the holdfast. The positive correlation between the two months antecedent mannitol content in the basal parts of S. siliquastrum plant with its various population growth parameters (e. g. plant mean length, number of main axes and new shoots) implied that storage compounds in the holdfast and basal blade regions were utilized for the development and elongation ofnew shoots. Manipulative experiments were performed to test the hypotheses that reduced resources would lead to reduced growth and reproduction in Sargassum siliquastrum and that holdfast plays an important role for nutrient storage. Both hypotheses were supported by experimental data in this study. Vegetative shoots of tagged individuals were either trimmed to 15 cm in length or removed down to the holdfast before the active growing period (in August 2004 and 2005) and the reproductive period (in November 2004 and 2005). Various growth, reproductive parameters and mannitol content of the control and treatment plants were monitored thereafter. Individuals trimmed to 15 cm before the active growing period in August showed reduced growth (maximum mean lengths = 72. 76 士 44. 11 cm for 2004 treatment; 51. 65 士 20. 46 cm for 2005 treatment) and delayed reproduction when compared with tagged controls (maximum mean lengths = 178. 00 士 48. 26 cm for 2004 treatment; 95. 57 土 21. 01 cm for 2005 treatment). Only about 70 % of the plants trimmed in August 2004 and 60 % of those trimmed in August 2005 became reproductive in February 2005 and 2006 respectively, compared with 100 % of the tagged controls that became reproductive in December 2004 and January 2006. Plants trimmed to 15 cm before the reproductive period in November 2004 and 2005 remained at around 25 cm in length throughout the reproductive period. However, around 45 % (2004 treatment) and 50 % (2005 treatment) of them still became reproductive in February 2005 and 2006 respectivelyalthough their sizes were smaller than the minimum reproductive size of 40 cm recorded earlier. Treatment plants displayed lower mannitol content in various parts and they also produced fewer receptacles when compared with the control plants. For plants trimmed down to holdfast, more new shoots emerged from those trimmed in November 2004 and 2005 than from those trimmed in August, suggesting that more reserved resources were available in the holdfast in November, after the plants had gone through rapid growth in autumn. None of these plants however, ever became reproductive. These responses suggested that in the existence of a trade-off between growth and reproduction, differential allocation of resources was adopted by Sargassum siliquastrum, with the ultimate effect of propagating itself through sexual reproduction or vegetative growth. The results of this study revealed the phenology of Sargassum siliquastrum, its seasonal variation of mannitol content and the strategy for growth and reproduction it adopted when resources were reduced. The ability and flexibility of algae to grow and reproduce under reduced resources or change in environmental conditions using different strategies, with S. siliquastrum as an example, suggested the reasons for their success in the marine environment. All these data and observation provide significant baseline information on how algae, the ecologically important primary producer in thecoastal area would be able to cope, especially in a rapidly changing marine environment like that of Hong Kong or elsewhere in other parts of the world where changes could be taking place at a global scale.

Ag.) 的物候 性。我們發現這個物種有四個典型的生長階段：新生期（緩慢生長期）、活躍生 長期、繁殖期及老化期（回枯期）。而這個族群最高的長度（ 2005 年 1 月的 90. 28 ± 45. 13 cm; 2006 年 2 月的 70. 18 士 18. 65 cm) 、主莖的數量（ 2005 年 1 月的 2. 21 士 0. 81 條； 2005 年 12 月的 2. 29 土 0. 47 條）、第一類(l- 3 cm) 新生枝條數量(2005 年 2 月的 6 / 71 ± 3. 05 條； 2006 年 1 月的 5. 18 士 1. 39 條）、第二類（> 3 - 5 cm) 新 生枝條數量（ 2005 年 2 月的 2. 53 ± 1. 23 條）、繁殖比率（ 2005 年的 70. 59 士 33. 08 % ； 2006 年的 77. 74 士 17. 94 %) 、及繁殖力(2004 年 12 月的 21. 13 士 7. 59 % ； 2006 年 2 月的 10. 80 ± 7. 24 %) 均出現在冬季，而這些相應參數的最低點則在夏 季出現。相反，對比這個族群在繁殖時期的密度（ 2005 年 1 月的 5 ± 41. 33 個體 /平方米； 2005 年 12 月的 23. 50 ± 11. 00 個體/平方米），最高的族群密度則紀錄在 生長較緩慢的夏季（ 2005 年 7 月的 90. 50 ± 62. 78 個體/平方米）。在被鑑定的物理 參數中，由夏季轉到冬季時的低溫及短日照均有助於族群內個體長度及其繁殖器 的生長。在 2003 年 12 月到 2006 年 5 月期間，我們利用了高效能液相色譜法（High Performance Liquid Chromatography) ，來硏究裂葉馬尾藻體內的儲備物質甘露醇(Mannitol) 的季節性及其在個體內不同部分（包括固著器、植物的底部、中部、 頂部以及繁殖器) 的差異。結果顯示，裂葉馬尾藻的甘露醇季節性的含量介乎於 它們乾水重量的 1 %到 17 %。當它們進入活躍生長期，甘露醇的含量便會提升， 而最高含量則紀錄在 2004 年 9 月的 10. 81 ± 4. 87 克甘露醇/ 100 克乾海藻及 2005 年 10 月的 13. 17 ± 5. 60 克甘露醇/ 100 克乾海藻。當它們在 12 月間進入繁殖期時， 體內的甘露醇含量便開始下降，在繁殖期間則維持不變。直到繁殖期完結後，此 物種體內的甘露醇含量便大幅度下降。在 4 月這個緩慢生長期間，我們紀錄到一 個小幅度的甘露醇增長(2004 年的 5. 69 ± 2. 11 克甘露醇/ 100 克乾海藻； 2005 年 的 5. 91 ± 3. 71 克甘露醇/ 100 克乾海藻； 2006 年的 17. 87 ± 7. 46 克甘露醇/ 100 克乾 海藻）。由此可以看出在緩慢生長期間生產的過剩資源均用在維持多年生的固著 器的生命，或用作發展下一個季節所需的新生枝條。從個體的層面來看，相對植 物上較年青的中部及頂部，較成熟的部分（即固著器及植物的底部）含有較多的 甘露醇。此物種繁殖器的甘露醇含量是最低的，這亦與其較低的光合作用效率吻 合。相反，裂葉馬尾藻的固著器內有很高的甘露醇含量，這與其低光合作用效率 不成比例，相信是因爲甘露醇從植物的底部滲到固著器內。另外，此物種底部所 含的甘露醇與其兩個月後的一些生長參數（例如長度、主莖及新生枝條的數量） 成顯著的正向關聯，這暗示裂葉馬尾藻體在固著器及植物底部內的儲備物質均用 在新生枝條的發展及延長。我們亦利用切除實驗來硏究不同程度的資源減少對裂葉馬尾藻的生長及繁殖的 影響。在此物種的活躍生長期前（ 2004 年及 2005 年 8 月）及繁殖期前（ 2004 年 及 2005 年 11 月），個別標記樣本上的無性枝條被切除至固著器上方 15 cm處或被 切除至留下固著器，而各組別內所有標記樣本的長度、生殖狀態及甘露醇含量則 被每月記錄。實驗結果顯示，在八月（活躍生長期前）的實驗中，與對照組別相 比（最高長度爲 2004 年 178. 00 士 48. 26 cm ； 2005 年的 95. 57 ± 21. 01 cm), 無性枝條被切除至固著器上方 15 cm處的個體顯示了較緩慢的生長（最高長度爲 2004 年的 72. 76 ± 44. 11 cm ； 2005 年的 51. 65 ± 20. 46 cm) 及延緩的繁殖期。在 2004 及 2005 年 8 月的實驗中，所有在對照組別內的個體均在 2004 年 12 月及 2006 年 1 月進入繁殖期，但無性枝條被切除至固著器上方 15 cm處的個體中，分別只有 70 % 和 60 %的個體在翌年的 2 月進入繁殖期。相比無性枝條在繁殖期前（|$|R
