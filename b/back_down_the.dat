5|$|Notts County's fate {{went in the}} {{opposite}} direction. They were relegated in bottom place the season after the 1996 play-off final defeat, only to win the 1997–98 Third Division title and gain instant promotion. However, they have spent every season since in the bottom two divisions. The two clubs did not meet again in league football until January 2008 after City's fall <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> league structure.|$|E
5|$|Adams and the {{correspondence}} committees promoted {{opposition to the}} Tea Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support.|$|E

5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, who {{thought that he was}} reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, C Company {{moved to}} capture Hill 543 {{near the village}} of Chipo-ri. The hill was {{protected}} by heavily entrenched Chinese infantry as well as mortars {{at the top of the}} hill. During their first attempt to advance up the hill, the company took heavy casualties, and the 3rd Platoon leader was mortally wounded. Charlton took command of the platoon and reorganized it for another attack. Heavy fire eventually forced the company <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill.|$|E
5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared {{to the size of the}} tube, so almost the entire wave is reflected <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E

The victory of the French forces at Foochow was decisive, with losses {{estimated}} either at six or 12 personnel with 27 missing. The Chinese losses were far greater, at 521 killed, 150 wounded {{and a large number}} missing after the battle. The bombardment of the arsenal lasted for two days before the French ships headed <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river, destroying any forts they encountered on the way.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce {{began his}} final race weekend, the 1977 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, by setting the fastest {{time in the}} Wednesday {{practice}} session, held in wet weather. Pryce posted a time of 1 minute 31.57 seconds with the next best, the eventual 1977 World Champion Niki Lauda, a full second slower. The weather dried up prior to the Thursday session, and he slipped <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> grid to fifteenth place, almost two seconds slower than James Hunt's pole position time.|$|E
5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) {{end of the}} tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters the tube and causes a {{compression}} wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E

5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the <b>back,</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> center of the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to {{the underside of the}} tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua {{to the floor of the}} mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, {{close enough}} to the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, command post west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 soldiers of the battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were driven off at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get up out of the rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had been driven off the hill. Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E

They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the tower, the LED lights at the top of the tower go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED lights on the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes <b>back</b> <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> lights at the top of the tower come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the LED lights at the top of the tower remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the tower visible at all times.|$|E
5|$|American air, artillery, mortar, and {{tank fire}} now {{concentrated}} on Battle Mountain, and I and L Companies prepared another counterattack to retake it. This attack launched soon after, but made slow progress and at midnight it halted {{to wait for}} daylight. Shortly after dawn on August 22, I and L Companies resumed the attack. L Company moved up the mountain, with I Company supplying a base of fire. Three North Korean grenades wounded six of the troops, causing the rest to retreat without orders from their frustrated commander. They were eventually returned to the hill with some coercion. A few hours later, when a small North Korean force worked around its right flank, the company again withdrew <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill to I Company's position without orders.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile {{announced}} he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average {{at the end of}} the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians and the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Cobb. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits in a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns. Browns' manager Jack O'Connor supposedly told his third baseman Red Corriden to play <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line all day, which allowed Lajoie easy bunt hits. Cobb complained about the move, though American League President Ban Johnson said that a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway and Chalmers ultimately awarded cars to both players.|$|E

5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill.|$|E

Finally, by 13:45 the order for the Commandos to withdraw was given. Withdrawing by troops <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road, they moved back to the landing craft and by 14:45 they had re-embarked, taking a number of German prisoners and Norwegian volunteers with them.|$|E
5|$|Phillips' and Arnold's {{pursuit of}} the {{retreating}} American militia continued to Manchester, just {{across the river from}} Richmond, which they reached on 29 April. However, they were unable to enter Richmond, as Lafayette had marched rapidly and occupied the city first. After destroying tobacco warehouses throughout Chesterfield County, the British sailed <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> James to Westover, while Lafayette advanced as far as Pocahontas. At Westover on 7 May, Phillips received orders to return to Petersburg and await Lord Cornwallis, who was moving north from Wilmington, North Carolina. Upon reaching Petersburg on 9 May, Phillips was greeted by a bombardment from Lafayette's artillery positioned north of the river in what is now Colonial Heights. General Phillips contracted typhoid fever and died on 13 May, leaving Arnold temporarily in command of the British force.|$|E
