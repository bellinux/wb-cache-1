Experimental evidence showing a correlation between the generation of DLHTs and nitrogen is first presented. This is followed by a discussion on the role nitrogen plays in influencing the generation of DLHT via first-principles simulation based on the density functional theory. We focus on the impact of a neighboring nitrogen atom on the structural and electronic properties of the oxygen-vacancy defect (VO), which is a major precursor for hole traps in the SiO 2. A neighboring twofold coordinated nitrogen atom (i. e. comprising an unpaired electron) is found to induce significant structural relaxation of VO following the capture of a hole. The charge transition level (CTL) associated with this defect cluster is located at 5. 32 eV from the SiO 2 valence band edge (i. e. near the Si conduction band edge), making it a very deep level hole trap. On the other hand, the CTL for VO in the absence of nitrogen or in the presence of a neighboring threefold coordinated nitrogen atom is found to be much lower, at ~ 2. 5 - 3 eV from the SiO 2 valence band edge (i. e. below the Si valence band edge). These defect clusters exhibit much smaller structural relaxation upon the capture of a hole and they correspond to shallow hole traps responsible for the fast charging/discharging transient-like behavior of negative-bias temperature instability...|$|E

In this paper, the effect of oxygen introduced by the process of conventional furnace annealing in FUSI metal gate is investigated. A 120 nm amorphous Si layer was sputtered on dielectric oxides of various thicknesses grown using a standard oxidation process. Raman spectra showed that the 120 nm thick pre-sputtered amorphous Si recrystallized after annealing in a conventional furnace at 900 °C. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) revealed that the annealed Si film contained traces of oxygen which were incorporated into the film during the furnace annealing process. It is suspected that the oxygen was originated from a few ppm of impurities present in the high-purity annealing gas (N 2). When a 100 nm of Ni was deposited using a DC sputterer on such sample and was rapid thermal annealed (RTA) at 400 °C to form a fully silicide film, the transmission electron micrograph showed the existence of unreacted oxygen-rich Si layer along the interface of the NiSi/SiO 2, leading to areal non-uniformity in the workfunction. It is suggested that the presence of oxygen can effectively retard the Ni diffusion into the Si film during the silicidation process such that the FUSI process is delayed, and the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) increased as shown by capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements.

This is because it is highly compatible with CMOS processing, and its work function can be selectively modified by ion implantation of the appropriate dopants. The gate-depletion effect, which increases the equivalent SiO 2 thickness (EOT) of the gate dielectric by several Angstroms and thereby degrades transistor performance, becomes a significant issue for poly-Si gate technology as the EOT is scaled to 1 nm and below in sub- 50 nm devices, however. Because of this, alternative gate-electrode materials which can either reduce or eliminate the gate depletion effect have been investigated by many researchers. While refractory metals and their metallic derivatives are attractive candidates, there are numerous process integration challenges that must be overcome before a viable metal-gate CMOS technology can be developed. This paper highlights some of these challenges and reviews three different process integration schemes. successful demonstrations of MOS capacitors and transistors with sub- 1 nm EOT using high-k gate dielectrics viz. oxides of Hf, Zr, Al and La [4 - 6]. Many of these materials are not thermally stable in contact with poly-Si above certain temperatures, and therefore cannot be used in a conventional dual poly-Si gate CMOS process, in which the highest annealing temperature can exceed 1000 °C. Therefore, alternative gate materials that are thermally stable with various advanced gate-dielectric materials will be needed.

TaN 박막은 4. 5 ~ 4. 6 eV정도의 일함수 값으로 보고되고 있으며, 이를 반도체 소자에서 요구하는 일함수 값으로 조절하기 위해서 박막 내 란탄계 원소 등을 함입시키거나 금속탄화 결합(TaC, graphite) 을 형성시키는 방법이 연구되고 있다. 이들 공정 중에서 TaN 박막 내 금속탄화 결합을 형성시키는 공정이 란탄계 원소를 함입시키는 공정보다 용이하기 때문에 본 연구에서는 TaCxNy 박막 내 조성에 따른 박막의 물성 및 박막증착공정에 대해서 평가하였다. 박막증착공정으로 높은 증착속도를 가지는 화학기상증착공정(CVD, Chemical vapor deposition) 을 수행하였다. Ta 전구체로 가장 많이 사용하고 있는 tert-butylimido tris-diethylamido tantalum(TBTDET) 전구체와 다양한 반응기체(Ar, H 2, NH 3, C 2 H 4) 를 이용하여 TaCxNy 박막을 증착하고, 증착온도에 따른 TaCxNy 박막의 조성, 화학결합, 비저항, 일함수 등의 변화를 확인하였으며, TBTDET 전구체의 열분해 거동 및 화학기상증착공정에서 일어나는 화학반응을 실시간 진단공정을 개발하여 평가하였다. 380 ˚C 이하에서 증착온도가 증가함에 따라 TaCxNy 박막의 증착속도는 약 10 Å/min까지 증가하였다. 이와 같이 증착속도가 증가하는 이유는 표면에서의 반응속도가 증가하기 때문이다. 표면에서 TBTDET 전구체가 분해되는 활성화에너지 (activation energy) 가 약 56. 8 kcal/mol로 나타났다. 380 ˚C 이상에서 TaCxNy 박막의 증착속도는 증착온도에 관계없이 거의 일정한 속도를 나타내었다. 이 같은 현상은 물질전달속도가 표면반응속도보다 느리기 때문에 나타난다. 즉, TBTDET 전구체의 물질전달속도에 따라 박막의 증착속도가 결정된다. TBTDET 전구체의 물질전달속도는 주입되는 전구체의 속도에 따라 결정되고, 주입되는 전구체의 속도는 버블러(bubbler) 의 온도에 의해 결정된다. 위 공정에서 얻은 증착속도는 유사한 조건의 원자층 기상증착공정(ALD, Atomic layer deposition) 에 비해서 10 여 배 이상 빠른 속도이다. 화학기상증착공정으로 증착한 TaCxNy 박막은 TaC, graphite, TaN, Ta 3 N 5, Ta 2 O 5 같은 여러 화학결합상으로 이루어져 있다. 이들 화학결합상의 비율은 증착온도에 영향을 받았다. 증착온도가 증가함에 따라 TaCxNy 박막 내 존재하는 TaN 상은 증가하였으나 Ta 3 N 5 상은 감소하였다. 이 같은 현상은 TaN 상이 Ta 3 N 5 상보다 고온에서 열역학적으로 선호되는 상이기 때문이다. 또한, TaC, graphite, Ta 2 O 5 상들은 증착온도가 증가할수록 감소하였다. 특히, Ta 2 O 5 상은 TaCxNy 박막이 증착된 후 공기 중에서 유입되는 산소에 의해서 형성되는 결합으로 보고되고 있으며, 증착온도가 증가할수록 TaCxNy 박막의 밀도가 증가하여 공기 중 산소 유입이 억제되기 때문에 감소하였다. 600 ˚C에서 증착한 TaCxNy 박막은 TaN 상의 비율이 매우 높게 나타났으며, 이로 인하여 TaCxNy 박막의 결정성이 TaN 상의 (111) 또는 (200) 방향으로 나타난다. 위의 결과들로부터 증착온도가 TaCxNy 박막의 물성 및 증착속도에 영향을 주는 것을 알 수 있다. 증착온도에 따라 TaCxNy 박막의 비저항 및 일함수도 영향을 받는다. 증착온도가 증가함에 따라 TaCxNy 박막의 비저항이 3. 6 × 103 μΩ&# 8226 cm까지 감소하였다. 이 같은 현상은 TaCxNy 박막 내 전도성 결합인 TaN 상이 증가하고, 절연성 결합인 Ta 3 N 5 상과 Ta 2 O 5 상이 감소하였기 때문이다. 또한, TaCxNy 박막의 일함수는 4. 25 ~ 4. 50 eV 사이로 변화하였다. 4. 5 ~ 4. 6 eV의 일함수를 가지는 TaN 상이 많은 TaCxNy 박막에 약 4. 3 eV의 일함수를 가지는 TaC 상이 유입될수록 TaCxNy 박막의 일함수를 감소하였다. 이와 같은 전기적 특성의 변화는 TaCxNy 박막 내 화학결합 비율이 영향을 줄 수 있음을 알 수 있었다. 즉, TaCxNy 박막의 비저항 및 일함수 값은 박막 내 존재하는 탄화물상과 질화물상에 따라 조절할 수 있었다. 앞에서 연구한 화학기상증착공정은 TBTDET 전구체의 열적 거동에 따라 나타나는 것이다. 이에 화학기상증착공정에서 일어나는 화학반응을 실시간 진단장비를 이용하여 평가하였다. FT-IR을 이용하여 기상과 표면에서 온도에 따라 일어나는 TBTDET 전구체의 화학반응을 관찰하였으며, 화학반응에 의해서 생성되는 부산물 등에 대해서 잔류기체분석으로 확인할 수 있었다. 350 ˚C부터 표면에 흡착된 TBTDET 전구체의 화학종의 분해가 진행되었다. 이 같은 현상은 350 ˚C 이상에서 주입되는 TBTDET 전구체가 표면에 흡착하여 안정하게 존재하는 것이 아니라 열분해 반응을 일으키면서 TaCxNy 박막을 증착되는 것을 의미한다. 열분해 반응시 발생하는 부산물을 잔류기체분석방법으로 확인하였다. 이 때 발생하는 기체들은 isobutylene, ethylene, methane 등의 기체로 TBTDET 전구체 내에 존재하는 리간드 그룹에서 수소제거(hydrogen elimination) 반응에 의해서 생성될 수 있다. 이로 인하여 증착온도에 따라 TaCxNy 박막 내 화학결합 비율이 변화함을 알 수 있었다. 여러 반응기체를 이용하여 TaC¬xNy 박막 내 화학결합 비율을 조절하고자 하였다. 수소기체를 이용하여 수소제거반응이 시작되는 온도를 50 ˚C정도 높힐 수 있었으며, TaCxNy 박막 내 존재하는 TaNx 상에는 큰 영향을 주지 않았으나 TaC 상의 형성을 억제하였다. 암모니아기체를 이용할 경우, TaCxNy 박막 내 TaC 상의 형성을 억제함과 동시에 Ta 3 N 5 상의 비율이 증가하여 비저항이 증가하였다. 에틸렌(C 2 H 4) 기체를 이용할 경우, TaCxNy 박막 내 TaNx 상에는 큰 영향을 주지 않았으나 TaC 상의 비율을 증가시켜 일함수를 감소시킬 수 있었다. 즉, 수소 및 암모니아 기체는 TaC 상의 형성을 억제하였으나, 에틸렌 기체는 TaC 상의 형성을 향상시켰다. 반면, TaNx 상에 영향을 주는 것은 암모니아 기체로 Ta 3 N 5 결합 비율을 증가시켜 TaCxNy 박막의 비저항 특성을 저하하는 결과를 나타내었다. 본 연구로부터 개발된 TaCxNy 박막의 화학기상증착공정은 비저항이 낮고, 일함수 조절이 용이하고, 증착속도가 빠르고, 공정이 단순하고, 기존 실리콘공정과의 적합성이 우수하여 차세대 게이트 전극 공정으로 활용할 수 있다. 또한, 전구체의 거동을 확인할 수 있는 진단방법을 개발함으로써 금속유기전구체 개발 연구에도 기여할 수 있을 것으로 기대한다. During {{the last}} few decades, poly silicon has been widely used as a gate {{electrode}} in the metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) applications. In the sub- 50 nm regime, the poly silicon electrode shows several problems such as gate depletion, high gate resistance, high gate tunneling leakage current, and <b>boron</b> <b>penetration</b> into the channel region. Tantalum nitride (TaN) film is the most promising candidate due to its low resistivity and excellent thermal stability. The carbon incorporation in the TaN film using plasma treatment {{can be used to}} modify the work function. The TaN films have been mostly deposited with atomic layer deposition (ALD) for Cu diffusion barrier. However, the growth rate of the TaN film deposited with ALD is much lower than 1 nm/cycle. In this thesis, we studied the tantalum carbo-nitride (TaCxNy) films deposited with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique using tert-butylimido tris-diethylamido tantalum (TBTDET) and various gases (Ar, H 2, NH 3, and C 2 H 4). TaCxNy film deposited with CVD was studied {{as a function of the}} deposition temperature, and the film properties (film composition, chemical bond, resistivity, and work function) were evaluated. The TaCxNy films were deposited with CVD using TBTDET and argon gas between 350 ˚C and 600 ˚C. Below 380 ˚C, when the deposition temperature was increased, the growth rate was increased up to 10 Å/min. The growth rate was increased because the surface reaction rate was increased and the activation energy was about 56. 8 kcal/mol. Above 380 ˚C, the growth rate of the film was almost independent of the deposition temperature. In this region, the growth rate was determined by the mass transfer rate of the TBTDET precursor. Also, the thickness of the TaCxNy film deposited with CVD during 1 hour was 65. 6 nm, whereas the thickness of TaCxNy film deposited with thermal ALD using TBTDET and H 2 during 400 cycle (5 hour) was about 24 nm. The growth rate in the CVD process is about 12. 5 ~ 13. 7 times higher than that in the ALD process. The TaCxNy film was composed of the various phases such as TaC, graphite, TaN, Ta 3 N 5, and Ta 2 O 5. The phase composition in the TaCxNy film was dependent on the deposition temperature. When the deposition temperature was increased, the TaC, graphite (C-C), and Ta 3 N 5 phases in the TaCxNy film were decreased whereas the TaN phase was increased. The TaN phase is thermodynamically more favorable in high temperature over the Ta 3 N 5 phase. The Ta 2 O 5 phase in the film from the air after deposition was decreased due to the increase in the film density. At 600 ˚C, the TaCxNy film was the TaN dominant film and showed the polycrystalline (111) /(200) TaN cubic structure. The TaCxNy film properties such as composition, phase composition, density, and crystallinity were dependent on the deposition temperature. With the increase in the deposition temperature, the conductivity and work function of the TaCxNy film were increased due to the change in the phase composition of the TaCxNy film. The resistivity of the TaCxNy film was decreased until 3. 6 × 103 μΩ&# 8226 cm due to the increase of the TaN phase and the suppression of the oxygen uptake in the TaCxNy film. The work function of the TaCxNy film was changed due to the carbon incorporation in the TaCxNy film. With the increase of the TaC phase in the TaCxNy film with n-channel MOS work function (~ 4. 3 eV), the work function of the TaCxNy film was decreased to 4. 25 ± 0. 05 eV. The phase composition in the TaCxNy film affected the electrical properties such as resistivity and work function. The decomposition behavior of the TBTDET precursor was observed to understand the chemical reaction in the TaCxNy CVD process using in-situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and in-situ quadrupole mass spectroscopy (QMS). Above 350 ˚C, in the surface FT-IR results, the chemisorbed species of TBTDET on the surface began to dissociate and the TaCxNy film was deposited with the CVD mode. QMS was used to monitor the chemical species formed in the CVD process. The mass signals of chemical species such as isobutylene, ethylene, methane, and hydrogen from the dissociation of the TBTDET precursor or the hydrogen elimination reaction were observed during the TBTDET dose step. The isobutylene, ethylene, and methane were the reaction products from the hydrogen elimination of the tbutylimido ligand and the diethylamido ligand in TBTDET. Also, above 500 ˚C, the dissociation of the TBTDET precursor in the gas phase was observed and the FT-IR peaks associated with ethylene appeared around 3200 - 2800 cm- 1 and 990 - 930 cm- 1. TaC phase in the TaCxNy film was decreased due to the dissociation of TBTDET and the desorption of the hydrocarbon species on the surface. The various reactive gases such as H 2, NH 3, and C 2 H 4 were used to control the phase composition in the TaCxNy film deposited with CVD and the electrical properties (resistivity and work function) of the TaCxNy film were evaluated. Compared with Ar atmosphere, TaNx phase in the TaCxNy film deposited with H 2 and C 2 H 4 were not significantly changed, whereas TaNx phase was increased with NH 3. So, the resistivity of the TaCxNy film deposited with NH 3 was increased due to the increase of the Ta 3 N 5 phase. Also, TaC phase in the TaCxNy film was suppressed with H 2 and NH 3, whereas TaC phase was increased with C 2 H 4. So, the work function of the TaCxNy film deposited with C 2 H 4 was decreased to 4. 29 ± 0. 05 eV due to the increase of the TaC phase in the TaCxNy film. For the n-channel MOSFET gate electrode, the TaC phase in the TaCxNy film was controlled by the deposition condition such as deposition temperature and reactive gas...|$|E
