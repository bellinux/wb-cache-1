2500|$|The engines {{featured}} a large diameter lightweight flywheel at the rear, enclosed {{in a cast}} housing. Engine oil was picked {{up from the bottom}} of the crankcase and slung into a reservoir at the top. [...] From there it was gravity fed, via a gallery high on the right side of the engine block, to the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> and then to the connecting rod journals by centrifugal effect of the turning crankshaft. [...] The main bearings were ball bearings and were splash fed. [...] Engine oil from the gallery was also supplied to the 1 : 2 reduction gearbox at the front. This drove the four-bladed propeller at one half engine speed, and the single camshaft was splined into the rear of the short propeller shaft. [...] This arrangement meant that no mechanical oil pump was needed.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the only}} {{performance}} engine being the 351-4V CJ, performance was good {{but not at}} the [...] "super car" [...] levels of the 429 Cobra Jet Torinos. The 351-4V CJ was new for 1972 and offered a number of performance enhancing features not offered on the 1970–71 351C-4V. It included a special intake manifold, modified camshaft, special valve springs and dampers, a 750 CFM Motorcraft Carburetor, 4-bolt main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> and [...] dual exhaust. The 351 CJ was the only engine equipped with dual exhaust and it was the only engine that could be mated to the available four-speed transmission. The Ram Air induction system was available, and could be equipped on 351 CJ and 429 powered cars. Performance from the 1972 351 CJ was competitive with the 1970-71 Torinos with the high compression 351-4V. [...] Car and Driver tested a 351 CJ, 4-speed Gran Torino Sport SportsRoof with 3.50:1 gears to have a 0 - [...] time of 6.8 seconds. [...] Car and Driver did not publish its quarter mile times, but Cars magazine tested a Gran Torino Sport SportsRoof with a 351 CJ, C-6 automatic, and 3.50 gears to run though the quarter mile in 15.40 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The updated VQ35HR is more {{powerful}} ( [...] at 6,800 rpm and [...] at 4,800 rpm), more fuel efficient, and more responsive than the previous VQ35DE. The [...] "HR" [...] stands for [...] "High Revolution" [...] or [...] "High Response". A dual-path intake (two air cleaners, throttle bodies, etc.) lowers intake tract restriction by 18 percent and new equal-length exhaust manifolds lead into mufflers that are 25 percent freer flowing. The intake is said to benefit from a ram-air effect adding three horsepower at 60mph. Electrically actuated variable valve timing is new on the exhaust cams which broadens the torque curve. The new engine block maintains the same bore and stroke, but the connecting rods were lengthened and the block deck was raised by 8.4mm to reduce piston side-loads. 80% of the internal components have been strengthened or redesigned to handle the increased 7,500 rpm red line, along {{with the use of}} larger crank bearings with main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> reinforced by a rigid ladder-type main cap girdle. With an increase in compression ratio from 10.3:1 to 10.6:1 these changes add 26 more horsepower. Torque is down [...] from the old DE engine (268 vs. 270). The engine now sits 15mm lower in the chassis for a lower center of gravity.|$|E

50|$|On 9 October 2009, the CAA {{issued a}} press release {{requesting}} the public's assistance in finding a <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> {{from one of the}} engines. The cap, which possibly separated from the engine during takeoff, could not be found at the crash site or at the airport.|$|R
2500|$|For the 1966 Corvette, the {{big-block}} V-8 came in two forms: [...] on 10.25:1 compression, and 425bhp via 11:1 compression, larger intake valves, {{a bigger}} Holley four-barrel carburetor on an aluminum manifold, mechanical lifters, and four- instead of two-hole main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> Though {{it had no}} more horsepower than the previous high-compression 396, the , [...] V8 packed a lot more torque – [...] vs[...] Of course, engine outputs were sometimes deliberately understated and overstated in the Sixties. Here, [...] would {{be closer to the}} truth. Of course, all power ratings in the sixties were also done in SAE Gross Horsepower, which is measured based on an engine without accessories or air filter or restrictive stock exhaust manifold, invariably giving a significantly higher rating than the engine actually produces when installed in the automobile. SAE Net Horsepower is measured with all accessories, air filters and factory exhaust system in place; this is the standard that all US automobile engines have been rated at since 1972. With big-block V-8s being the order of the day, there was less demand for the 327, so small-block offerings were cut from five to two for 1966, and only the basic 300- and 350-bhp versions were retained. Both required premium fuel on compression ratios well over 10.0:1, and they didn't have the rocket-like thrust of the 427s, but their performance was impressive all the same. As before, both could be teamed with the Powerglide automatic, the standard three-speed manual, or either four-speed option.|$|E

50|$|Cross-bolting has two advantages: it couples the {{two sides}} of the {{crankcase}} together, making it stiffer overall and less prone to twisting. Secondly it helps to hold the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> down against the downward force from the piston. This second advantage is usually only possible with blind bolts, as the dowel effect of a through bolt is less effective.|$|R

50|$|A 4-bolt main {{refers to}} the number of bolts {{attaching}} the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> to the block of an internal combustion engine. Four bolt mains are considered much stronger for high performance use than a 2 bolt main. Using 4 bolts to secure the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> reduces the amount of flex within the crankshaft as compared to 2 bolts.|$|E
5000|$|Testing of the 406, {{with its}} higher power levels, led to cross-bolted mains [...] - [...] that is, main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> that were secured {{not only by}} bolts at each end coming up from beneath, but also by bolts {{coming in from the}} sides through the block. A custom fit spacer was used between the cap and the block face. This design {{prevented}} the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> from [...] "walking" [...] under extreme racing conditions, and can be found today in many of the most powerful and modern engines from many manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|The {{main bearing}} web area was thicker in the 390, 401 and SR blocks, thick enough that two {{additional}} <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> bolt holes could be {{drilled and tapped}} for an aftermarket four bolt main cap, providing a stronger bottom end. AMC never built a factory four bolt main block, they sold aftermarket four bolt main caps through their Group 19 performance parts program.|$|R
5000|$|Tensile {{forces are}} {{taken on the}} studs, not the {{cylinder}} block or crankcase. In particular, the force is a pure tension, rather than a twisting force owing to any offset between the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> and cylinder wall bolt. This permits the block and crankcase to be made lighter and less stiff, whilst still {{reducing the amount of}} deflection and twist exhibited in service.|$|R

5000|$|A {{crankcase}} {{often has}} {{an opening in}} the bottom to which an oil pan is attached with a gasketed bolted joint. Some crankcase designs fully surround the crank's main bearing journals, whereas many others form only one half, with a <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> forming the other. Some crankcase areas require no structural strength from the oil pan itself (in which case the oil pan is typically stamped from sheet steel), whereas other crankcase designs do (in which case the oil pan is a casting in its own right). Both the crankcase and any rigid cast oil pan often have reinforcing ribs cast into them, as well as bosses which are drilled and tapped to receive mounting screws/bolts for various other engine parts.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{its large}} factory bore size, short (compared to RB engines) deck height, and bottom end {{strength}} that {{is greater than}} any other production B or RB engine due to extra material added around the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> 400 B engine blocks have become a popular choice for high-performance engine build ups.|$|E
50|$|The first Chevrolet {{engine to}} use 4-bolt mains was the 1967 Chevrolet Camaro.

50|$|Mark IV engines saw {{extensive}} {{application in}} Chevrolet and GMC medium duty trucks, {{as well as}} in Blue Bird Corporation's All American and TC/2000 transit buses (the latter up until 1995, using a 427 with purpose-built carburetor). In addition to the 427, a 366-cubic-inch (6.0 L) version was produced for the commercial market. Both the 366 and 427 commercial versions were built with a raised-deck, four-bolt main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> cylinder to accommodate an extra oil control ring on the pistons. Unfortunately, the raised deck design complicated the use of the block in racing applications, as standard intake manifolds required spacers for proper fit. Distributors with adjustable collars that allowed adjustments to the length of the distributor shaft also had to be used with 366 and 427 truck blocks.|$|R
50|$|The balance shafts are {{relocated}} {{from the}} cylinder block to oil pan module. The two-piece steel-aluminum oil pan features in-pan integrated oil-pump assembly {{driven by the}} balance shaft with a shorter inverted-tooth chain. Other improvements include inverted-tooth chain driving the camshaft, forged steel crankshaft, cast aluminum bedplate with main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> inserts made of iron, high-pressure fuel rail with rubber-isolated assembly, acoustically shielded plastic cover for the intake manifold, and structurally enhanced aluminum camshaft cover and front cover. These improvements helped reduce noise intensity by 40% compared to the 2.4 L engine and change the noise signature into a higher frequency above 2,000 Hz. The engine also uses a variable-displacement oil pump and an actively controlled thermostat. Direct injection reduces emissions by 25%, while continuous cam phasing {{eliminates the need for}} an EGR system. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 RPM.|$|R
