Trevisanato hypothesizes that the Egyptians (at that time under the occupation of Hyksos), resorted to human sacrifice in an attempt to appease the gods, for they had viewed the ninth plague as a precursor to more.

Seven strings is generally thought to be the maximum number of strings that can be put on a bowed string instrument, because with more than seven strings, {{it would be impossible to}} play a particular inner string individually with the bow. Instruments with seven strings are very rare. The extra strings on such violins typically are lower in pitch than the G-string; these strings are usually tuned to C, F, and B. If the instrument's playing length, or string length from nut to bridge, is equal to that of an ordinary full-scale violin; i.e., a <b>bit</b> <b>less</b> than , then it may be properly termed a violin. Some such instruments are somewhat longer and should be regarded as violas. Violins with five strings or more are typically used in jazz or folk music.

In the end the battle of Tali-Ihantala was a defensive strategic victory for the Finnish army.

Soviet military losses peaked at 28 June when Leningrad Front reported to have lost during that single day over 5 000 soldiers including 1 800 killed in action, over 25% more than in 14 June when they reported to have lost almost 4 000 (including little <b>bit</b> <b>less</b> than 700 killed in action).
