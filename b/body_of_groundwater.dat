40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} of background levels is clearly stressed by the GWD {{for the reason}} that wherever elevated background levels of substances or ions or their indicators occur due to natural hydro-geological reasons, these background levels in the relevant <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> shall be taken into account when establishing groundwa-ter quality standards. However, to accurately determine background concentrations, free of anthropogenic influence, it is important to take into consideration original data quality for background analysis, us-ability of method(s), representation of the background – is it true or ambient background values of concern, any potential sources of con-tamination near the sampling points etc. Traditionally, geochemical background is often regarded as a fixed value (mean or median), that represents a hypothetical background concentration without taking into account natural variability.

30|$|The {{concept of}} “detrimental change” of a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> in the German Water Act [25] is {{substantiated}} {{for a single}} contaminant by the “significance threshold” (GFS). The GFS serve as criteria for the decision whether actions to protect the quality of groundwater or to remediate polluted groundwater are necessary [26]. A detrimental alteration of the water is defined as “changes of the properties of a body of water, which impair the public welfare, especially the public water supply” (§ 3). The purpose {{of the law is}} “to protect a body of water against detrimental changes of its properties… and to compensate (as much as possible) impairments, that are not insignificant (§ 6). All activities are to be carried out {{in such a way that}} “a detrimental change of the water quality should not be feared.” Examples are “groundwater pollution abatement” (§ 48) and the “handling of substances hazardous to water” (§ 62). Therefore, a groundwater contamination can be classified as insignificant [27] if it is not ecotoxic (criterion 1 : intact habitat) and fulfills the requirements (including the limit values) of the German Drinking Water Ordinance (criterion 2 : [28]) or values derived accordingly [criterion 3 : harmless to human health (§ 6, 1; [28]) and esthetically unobjectionable (§ 4, 1; [28]).|$|E

The goal {{of this research was}} to determine whether the mine drainage water has levels of lead, copper and silver exceeding the State of Utah Groundwater Standards, which are 0. 015 mg/L for lead, 0. 1 mg/L for silver and 1. 3 mg/L for copper. Water samples were collected from 15 locations, including the mine, a pipeline fed by the drainage water, and the losing stream fed by the drainage water. All sample bottles were rinsed with nitric acid to prevent contamination from the bottle. Sample bottles for lead analysis included an acid preservative agent to prevent adsorption of lead onto the bottle. All samples were analyzed using the Hach DR- 2700 Spectrophotometer.

40|$|The {{species has}} been {{examined}} from an ecological standpoint, by comparing it with Molinia caerulea (L.) Moench, an alternative dominant of Scottish "blanket bog". Of the two recorded subspecies, only ssp. germanicum and intermediates of uncertain status appear {{to survive in}} Britain. A floristic description is given of the transition from dominant Trichophorum to dominant Molinia in an area typical of the N-W Highland region. Following "muirburn", both species reproduce from seed. The successful establishment of a Trichophorum seedling eventually produces a single tussock. Edaphic factors appear to control {{the distribution of the}} two species. An account is given of a polarographic survey of soil oxygen, and a survey of groundwater movement based on applications of Darcy's law. The transition from Trichophorum to Molinia is accompanied by a striking increase in the rate of horizontal water movement. An hypothesis is advanced whereby the groundwater acts as a vehicle of mineral nutrition. Productivity studies show that the rate of uptake of nutrients by adults is similar in. the two species. A stagnant <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>groundwater,</b> supplying nutrients slowly, limits the early development of the relatively large Molinia seedlings, allowing successful establishment of the much smaller seedlings of Trichophorum. Moving groundwater, enhancing the mineral supply, permits luxuriant development of Molinia seedlings, whose shade limits the development of Trichophorum. Ion exchange sites in the peat may form an intermediate nutrient reservoir. Experiments to examine this hypothesis included one in which seedlings of Trichophorum were grown in competition with those of Molinia. The growth of Molinia was limited more by nutrient availability than by plant density. The growth of associated Trichophorum varied inversely with nutrient availability, due apparently to competition from Molinia. Other experiments and observations suggested light as the limiting factor for Trichophorum. The effects of soil aeration were not significant.

Six groundwater level time series and an associated river stage time series from the unconfined Chalk aquifer (a dual-porosity, fractured limestone aquifer) in the Pang–Lambourn catchment, UK, have been analysed. Surrogate data of time series with known scaling properties {{have been used to}} estimate the probability distribution of the spectral and geometric scaling exponents determined by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and power spectral density (PSD) respectively; robust regression techniques have been used to improve estimates of the scaling exponents; and robust non-parametric techniques have been used to correlate scaling exponents with features of the boreholes and catchments. Strong statistical support has been found for temporal scaling <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> levels over a wide range of time scales, however, bootstrap estimates of the scaling exponents indicate a much larger range of exponents than found by previous studies, suggesting that the uncertainty in existing estimates of scaling exponents may be too small. There is robust evidence that geometrical scaling properties at each borehole can be related to the depth of the observation boreholes and distance of those boreholes from the river in the catchment, but no such correlations were found for the spectral scaling exponents.

Leaders of the Philippine aquaculture sector are concerned that their cost of production is higher than that of their close competitors in Indonesia and Thailand.

Existing intensive facilities can be operated efficiently and profitably, but new intensive operations will most likely need to include water treatment capabilities for water entering and exiting grow-out ponds. Canals, reservoirs or ponds used for water quality improvement may be able to concurrently produce a profitable crop, such as milkfish-prawn rotation.

Because of the long travel times <b>of</b> pollutants through <b>groundwater</b> <b>bodies,</b> early detection <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> quality deterioration is necessary to efficiently protect <b>groundwater</b> <b>bodies.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this work was to develop and improve tools to detect trends in groundwater quality considering the reactive transport of pollutants from the ground surface to the monitoring screen. The study area of the research presented in this thesis was the province of Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands. Noord-Brabant {{is one of the}} areas in Europe which is most affected by agricultural pollution. Time-series from selected wells <b>of</b> the <b>groundwater</b> quality monitoring network were used in this thesis, in conjunction with groundwater ages determined with 3 H/ 3 He. Trend reversal <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> quality was demonstrated by relating concentrations <b>of</b> pollutants in <b>groundwater</b> to the time of recharge determined with 3 H/ 3 He. The quality <b>of</b> recharging <b>groundwater</b> deteriorated before 1980 but has been improving since 1990. Three types of solute specific trends were distinguished by a combination of reactive transport modeling and the analysis of concentrations related to groundwater age. These are the result of: (1) the anthropogenic trends in historical concentrations in recharging groundwater unaltered during conservative transport through the groundwater body (e. g. chloride), (2) anthropogenic trends in recharge concentrations altered by reactions during transport (e. g. retardation of potassium), and (3) geochemical reactions in the subsurface that are triggered by anthropogenic changes in the recharge concentrations of other solutes (e. g. release of sulfate, iron, and arsenic by nitrate-induced pyrite oxidation). Comparison of trend detection methods showed that there is no single optimal method to detect trends in groundwater quality across widely differing catchments. The selection of the method should firstly be {{made on the basis of}} the specific goals of the study, and secondly on the system under study, and the available resources. For trend detection in groundwater quality, the most important difference between groundwater bodies is whether the characteristics of the subsurface or the monitoring system causes mixing <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> with different travel times. Noble gas concentrations measured in groundwater samples, required for 3 H/ 3 He dating, showed that the production of nitrogen gas in groundwater by nitrate reduction and pyrite oxidation, leads to re-partitioning of noble gases between water and gas phase, thereby distorting groundwater dating with 3 H/ 3 He. Groundwater travel times can be estimated from degassed samples, if the total dissolved gas pressure (TDG) is used to estimate the depth and timing of degassing. The uncertainty of degassed 3 H/ 3 He ages, assessed by two-phase flow and transport simulations, had a standard deviation of 6 years with a bias of 2 years. As CFCs appear to be subject to significant degradation in anoxic groundwater and SF 6 is highly susceptible to degassing, 3 H/ 3 He appears to be the most reliable method to date degassed groundwater in the anoxic parts of an aquifer.

Finally, all the results above will be assembled in the technical manual <b>of</b> decision <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> usage to provide the authorized institutes as a reference in the decision <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> usage. 台灣地區用水量逐年增加，除地面水源之使用外，也開發地下水源，由於地下水之來源可靠且費用低廉，因此競相被大量抽取利用，造成水位急劇下降，繼而導致地層下陷，而在沿海地區，更因而引發海水倒灌，造成土壤及地下水鹽化等嚴重問題。因此如何管制地下水源的開發與利用，配合水權登記時核定裁量之行政作業程序加以執行，是值得探討之研究議題。 不論地面水源或地下水源開發之利用均需依規定辦理水權登記，水權登記業務之行政處理程序在水利法及其施行細則已有詳細規定足供各水權主管機關依循，但對於水權核定裁量之技術方法，雖其學理根據散見於相關典籍或於研究報告有所探討，卻無加以有系統的整理分析，也未與目前地下水水文觀測資料加以結合，以提供水權核辦實務上之應用。 針對地下水權在核定裁量技術層面之相關研究有所不足，本計畫擬蒐集台灣地區已有之地質條件及地下水文觀測資料，以縣市為分區單位，整理地下水供水之潛能模式及地下水安全出水量之管制方式。此外，本計畫亦將針對地下水基本理論、抽水機特性與馬力計算、抽水機馬力、水井管徑、揚程與出水量之關係及地下水水權技術層面核辦作業方法建置等主題加以探討研究。最終，將上述各項作業成果彙集成「地下水水權登記核辦技術手冊」，以提供地下水水權主管機關作為發水權之參考...|$|R
30|$|The {{chemical}} composition <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> {{is a measure}} of its suitability as a source of water for human consumption, irrigation and industrial purposes. The variation <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> depends upon the water–soil–rock interactions and source of various pollutants. And the excess withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> can also alter the natural groundwater quality. So, the protection management measures are required for improving the groundwater quality. Since the groundwater is so important for sustainable development of society, the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> quality in every part of the country is essential for its better management. Therefore, the focus of the present paper is (a) on assessment of controlling factors <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> quality and (b) on examination <b>of</b> the <b>groundwater</b> quality for drinking, irrigation and industrial purposes.|$|R
30|$|Nonetheless, a major {{constraint}} is {{the complex}} and erratic nature <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> occurrences in crystalline basement terrains with attendant high rate of well/borehole failure {{in the absence of}} proper and adequate pre-drilling hydrogeological investigations. The occurrence and movement <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> in a crystalline terrain depends on the degree of weathering and extent of fracturing of the bedrock rocks, while identification <b>of</b> potential <b>groundwater</b> zones could aid in proper development and utilization <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> resources for eliminating water scarcity (Rao 2006). However, indiscriminate exploitation can lead to decrease in groundwater potential in terms of lowering of water level (hence increase in cost <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> withdrawal) and sometimes deterioration in groundwater quality. Therefore, there is the need for adequate characterization of basement aquifers and delineation <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> potential zones.|$|R
40|$|The {{improved}} {{methodological approach}} <b>of</b> the <b>groundwater</b> quantitative status assessment in Slovenia {{and the results}} of the assessment period 2010 - 2013, taking into account the new reference thirty-year period 1981 - 2010, are presented. Within the assessment period quantitative status in all shallow alluvial aquifers <b>of</b> 21 <b>groundwater</b> <b>bodies</b> in Slovenia is assessed as good, with a medium to high level <b>of</b> confience. <b>Groundwater</b> quantitative status assessment methodology considers the processes of the whole hydrological cycle and the results <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> recharge modelling. The methodology incorporates the concept <b>of</b> sustainable <b>groundwater</b> use to preserve the quantities not causing environmental and other harm (unacceptable environmental and other consequences). Legislative baseline for assessing the impacts <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> abstraction on renewable and available quantities <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> introduces new methodology by abandoning obsolete mining concept <b>of</b> "calculation <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> reserves"...|$|R
5000|$|An {{additional}} {{strategy to}} water conservation is practicing sustainable methods <b>of</b> utilizing <b>groundwater</b> resources. [...] Groundwater flows {{due to gravity}} and eventually discharges into streams. Excess pumping <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> leads to a decrease in groundwater levels and if continued it can exhaust the resource. Ground and surface waters are connected and overuse <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> can reduce and, in extreme examples, diminish the water supply of lakes, rivers, and streams. In coastal regions, over pumping groundwater can increase saltwater intrusion which results in the contamination <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> water supply. Sustainable use <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> is essential in water conservation.|$|R

A model is developed to study socially optimal agricultural shallow groundwater extraction patterns. It becomes clear that the current price <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> is inefficient and provides fewer incentives for the adoption of modern irrigation technology than does a system that considers the cost <b>of</b> desiccation and <b>groundwater</b> contamination in the price <b>of</b> <b>groundwater.</b> The study shows that including the impact <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> extraction on groundwater quality into a resource management model is particularly significant if the recharge <b>of</b> <b>groundwater</b> is large compared with stock size...|$|R
