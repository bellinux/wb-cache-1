In the present test setup, molecular oxygen under several atmospheres of pressure is introduced into an evacuated supersonic expansion nozzle through a pulsed molecular <b>beam</b> <b>valve.</b> A 10 J CO 2 TEA laser is focused to intensities greater than 10 to the 9 th W/sq cm in the nozzle throat, generating a laser-induced breakdown with a resulting 20, 000 -K plasma.

40|$|A pulsed {{high flux}} source of nearly {{monoenergetic}} atomic oxygen was designed, built, and successfully demonstrated. Molecular oxygen at several atmospheres pressure is introduced into an evacuated supersonic expansion nozzle through a pulsed molecular <b>beam</b> <b>valve.</b> An 18 J pulsed CO 2 TEA laser is focused to intensities greater than 10 (9) W/sq cm in the nozzle throat {{to generate a}} laser-induced breakdown.

40|$|Abstract-A device {{capable of}} {{continuously}} sampling and mass analyzing aerosols in the l- 10 nm diameter size range (masses up to 1 MDa) at part per billion (ppb, 10 ” cmm 3) concentrations is described. Small aliquots of an aerosol flowing at atmospheric pressure are sampled into a time-offlight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) via a pulsed molecular <b>beam</b> <b>valve</b> at 10 - 50 Hz. The aerosol molecular beam is singly and nondestructively ionized with light from an ultraviolet excimer laser and accelerated across a 20 kV electrostatic field. Ionized particle packets are separated in mass during a free flight and re-accelerated across an additional 30 kV into {{a stainless steel}} conversion dynode plate. Signals from ejected electrons and negative ion fragments resulting from the particle-dynode collisions are amplified in a dual microchannel plate detector, digitized, and stored in a fast transient recorder. Sampling of He flow streams bearing benzene, fullerenes, as well as Na. Mg, and CsI particles (nanocrystals) is demonstrated. In addition, the gas-phase reaction between a pre-formed Na nanocrystal and alkane thiols is monitored in real-time. $T: 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} producing the ï¬rst cold source of halogen atoms, using Br atoms as the focus. Br atoms are produced by photodissociation of Br 2, and detected by (2 + 1) REMPI and time-of-ï¬ight measurements. Ground- and excited-state Br fragments are formed with a recoil velocity directed along the molecular beam axis. The excess energy from the dissociation laser provides the backscattered Br fragments with suï¬cient recoil velocity to match and cancel out the average velocity of the molecular beam. The Br fragments which undergo suï¬cient velocity cancellation remain in the laser detection volume for up to 5 ms. A magnetic trap, composed of two permanent bar magnets with their North poles facing each other, is placed around the detection volume and with an axis perpendicular to the molecular beam and laser axes. The centres of the trap and of the laser interaction volume are overlapped. The magnetic ï¬eld is linear near {{the centre of the}} trap and forms a 3 -dimensional well with a depth of 0. 22 T, equivalent to a trap depth of U 0 /k B = 255 mK, with the upper and lower standard error [215, 325] mK, for ground-state Br. With this conï¬guration, Br atoms have been detected up to delays of 99 ms, to the next laser pulse, suggesting the possibility of accumulating density over successive molecular beam cycles. The decay of Br atoms from the trap is measured, and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method is implemented to extract the intensity of the Br signal, which decreases to be on the order of the background noise at delays close to 99 ms. Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that the trap loss mechanisms are primarily due to collisions with the molecular beam and background gas, inhibiting the ability to accumulate trap density. These simulations also show that Majorana transitions to higher quantum states are minimal and can be ignored. Experimental measurements conï¬rm that near the peak of the molecular beam, when the strongest signal of Br is observed at long delays, around 60 % of initially trapped Br atoms are lost due to molecular beam collisions, and (34 ± 3) % due to collisions with the background gas. To minimise molecular beam collisions, a chopper construct is designed to reduce the beam pulse width and is placed between the molecular <b>beam</b> <b>valve</b> and detection volume. The chopper runs from 3, 000 rpm to 80, 000 rpm, during which the duration of the molecular beam at the detection volume is shortened from 130 μs (measured at the full width at half maximum) to between 80 μs and 13 μs, respectively. However, the chopper signiï¬cantly reduces the initial Br 2 density in the trapping region, and the inï¬uence of the chopper construct in reducing molecular beam collisions requires further experimental work. Further work is also necessary to improve the operational components, such as reducing the base pressure in the detection chamber to lower background gas collisions, or using a heavier carrier gas to increase density of initially trapped Br atoms. These improvements can lead us closer toward building density of cold Br atoms in the trap over successive molecular beam cycles, with which a source of cold, dense halogen atoms can be realised. </p...|$|E

40|$|InAs/GaSb short-period superlattices (SLs) with {{a broken}} gap type-II band {{alignment}} are investigated for the fabrication of photovoltaic pin-photodetectors on GaSb substrates. The structures were grown by molecular <b>beam</b> epitaxy using <b>valved</b> cracker cells for arsenic and antimony. Effective bandgap and strain in the SL were adjusted by varying {{the thickness of the}} InAs and GaSb layers in the SL and the controlled formation of InSb-like or GaAs-like bonds at the interfaces. MBE growth conditions were investigated and optimized in order to achieve good morphological, electrical and optical properties. IR-photodiodes with a cut-off wavelength of 5. 4 µm reveal quantum efficiencies around 30 % and detectivity values exceeding 10 (exp 13) Jones at 77 K. A focal plane array camera with 256 x 256 detector elements and 40 µm pitch based on InAs/GaSb short-period SLs was fabricated for the first time. The camera system reveals an excellent thermal resolution with a noise equivalent temperature difference below 12 mK for an integration time of 5 ms using f/ 2 optics. The detector performance, comparable with state of the art mercury-cadmium-telluride IR detectors, makes this material system very interesting for the fabrication of advanced thermal imaging systems...|$|R
40|$|An {{ion beam}} has quite {{different}} vacuum requirements in different sections of an accelerator. Behind a stripper gas or after interaction with a gas target the vacuum conditions are poor, whereas in an accelerator module or {{especially in a}} storage ring the residual gas pressure has to be orders of magnitude better. As a new device to allow an ion beam to enter sections of different pressure we propose to investigate {{a new kind of}} plasma valve [1]. The basic principle of the MHD valve uses the Lorentz force acting upon an ionised gas between an ultra high vacuum chamber and a gas reservoir up to a pressure of several mbar. When activated, the MHD valve is composed of a discharge plasma that fills a chamber with crossed electric and magnetic fields. Gas flowing from the gas tank into the UHV chamber is ionized by the discharge. The Lorentz force acts now upon the charged particles due to the crossed electromagnetic fields and repels them back into the gas chamber. By proper adjustment of the Lorentz force, the valve can allow any desired gas flow between the two chambers, or fully block any exchange of gas. The MHD valve can even act as an efficient vacuum pump to improve the vacuum conditions in the high vacuum section. High energy particles reaching the valve from the high vacuum side will penetrate the fields and the plasma. For heavy ion <b>beams</b> the MHD <b>valve</b> would therefore act like a window. The following Figure 1 shows the principle setup of the MHD valve. Fig. 1 : Schematic view on the MHD valve...|$|R
