5|$|A later La Brea pits study {{compared}} tooth <b>breakage</b> of dire {{wolves in}} two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP. The {{results showed that}} the 15,000YBP dire wolves had three times more tooth <b>breakage</b> than the 13,000YBP dire wolves, whose <b>breakage</b> matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth <b>breakage</b> in dire wolves had also declined.|$|E
5|$|Tooth <b>breakage</b> {{is related}} to a carnivore's behavior. A study of nine modern {{carnivores}} found that one in four adults had suffered tooth <b>breakage</b> and that half of these breakages were of the canine teeth. The most <b>breakage</b> occurred in the spotted hyena that consumes all of its prey including the bone; the least <b>breakage</b> occurred in the African wild dog, and the gray wolf ranked in between these two. The eating of bone {{increases the risk of}} accidental fracture due to the relatively high, unpredictable stresses that it creates. The most commonly broken teeth are the canines, followed by the premolars, carnassial molars, and incisors. Canines are the teeth most likely to break because of their shape and function, which subjects them to bending stresses that are unpredictable in both direction and magnitude. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when killing large prey.|$|E
5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth <b>breakage</b> among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth <b>breakage.</b> Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E

She shows how the company influences the working of government: [...] "if I attempt to fight them I shall be hounded out of public life". In Act II King Magnus threatens to abdicate in favour of his son Robert, in whose opinion [...] "the country ... is really governed by <b>Breakages,</b> Limited", and to enter politics himself and oppose <b>Breakages.</b> Shaw is suggesting that a powerful individual could resist <b>Breakages</b> more effectively than democratic politics can.|$|R

25|$|Piecing {{involved}} repairing sporadic yarn <b>breakages.</b> At the rollers, {{the broken}} yarn would be {{caught on the}} underclearer (or fluker rod on Bolton mules), while at the spindle it would knot itself into a whorl on the spindle tip. If the break happened on the winding stroke the spindle {{might have to be}} stopped while the thread was found. The number of yarn <b>breakages</b> was dependent {{on the quality of the}} roving, and quality cotton led to fewer <b>breakages.</b> Typical 1,200 spindle mules of the 1920s would experience 5 to 6 <b>breakages</b> a minute. The two piecers would thus need to repair the thread within 15 to 20 seconds while the mule was in motion but once they had the thread it took under three seconds. The repair actually involved a slight rolling of the forefinger against the thumb.|$|R
5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth <b>breakage</b> rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of <b>breakage.</b> A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth <b>breakage</b> among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth <b>breakage.</b> As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E

5|$|Unlike hardness, which denotes only {{resistance}} to scratching, diamond's toughness or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness {{relates to the}} ability to resist <b>breakage</b> from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it is vulnerable to <b>breakage.</b> A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its {{resistance to}} <b>breakage.</b> Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained by}} taking into account fibril <b>breakage.</b> A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril <b>breakage</b> has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E

5|$|DDT was {{a widely}} used {{pesticide}} in agriculture {{that was found}} to have significant adverse effects on wildlife, particularly egg thinning and subsequent <b>breakage</b> in birds of prey. A review of DDT's impact on Australian raptors between 1947 and 1993 found that the average egg-shell thickness had decreased by 6%. This average level of thinning was not thought likely to result in significantly more <b>breakage</b> overall, however individual clutches that had been even thinner might have broken. The white-bellied sea eagle was one of the more affected species, probably due to its feeding in areas heavily treated with pesticide such as swamps. DDT use peaked in 1973, but was no longer approved after 1987 and its use had effectively ceased by 1989.|$|E

This is most hazardous when the ash and/or {{the lines and}} structures are wet (e.g., by rainfall) {{and there has been}} ≥10 mm of ash fall. Fine-grained ash (e.g., <0.5 mm diameter) adheres to lines and structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines.

5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by her age. As a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, {{it has been}} suggested that this long lifetime may make the chromatin of eggs more vulnerable to division problems, <b>breakage,</b> and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age effect has also been observed.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the <b>breakage</b> and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome <b>breakage</b> occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{reports on the}} {{chromosomal}} expression and localization of aphidicolin-induced fragile sites in the standard karyotype of river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis, 2 n = 50) {{with the aim of}} establishing a 'fragile site map' of the species. Totally, 400 aphidicolin-induced <b>breakages</b> were analyzed from eight young and clinically healthy animals, four males and four females; these <b>breakages</b> were localized in 106 RBG-negative chromosome bands or at the band-interband regions. The number of <b>breakages</b> per chromosome did not vary statistically 'among' the animals investigated but the differences among individual chromosomes were highly significant thus indicating that the chromosomal distribution of the <b>breakages</b> is not random and appears only partially related to chromosome length. Fragile sites were statistically determined as those chromosomal bands showing three or more <b>breakages.</b> In the river buffalo karyotype, 51 fragile sites were detected and localized on the standardized ideogram of the species. The most fragile bands were as follows: 9 q 213 with 24 <b>breakages</b> out of 400; 19 q 21 with 16, 17 q 21 and inacXq 24 with 15, 15 q 23 with 13 and 13 q 23 with 12 breaks, respectively. Previous gene mapping analysis in this species has revealed that the closest loci to these fragile sites contain genes such as RASA 1 and CAST (9 q 214), NPR 3 and C 9 (19 q 19), PLP and BTK (Xq 24 -q 25), OarCP 09 (15 q 24), and EDNRB (13 q 22) whose mutations are responsible for severe phenotypic malformations and immunodeficiency in humans as well as in mice and meat quality in pigs. Further cytogenetic and molecular studies are needed to fully exploit the biological significance of the fragile sites in karyotype evolution of domestic animals and their relationships with productive and reproductive efficiency of livestock...|$|R
