40|$|The <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> is a pest {{of foreign}} origin, {{that has been}} in the United States for many years. It was {{introduced}} into this country, probably from Europe, sometime before 1872, and by 1894 it was rather general in its distribution thruout the United States and Canada. At the present time this mite is a serious pest of apples in many of the fruit-growing sections of Western America. The <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> was first reported in Utah by Hedrick as early as 1898. During the last few years it has been abnormally abundant in some parts of Utah...|$|E
40|$|The apple <b>blister</b> <b>mite,</b> Eriophyes mali Nalepa, 1926 (Acari: Prostigmata: Eriophyoidea), {{has been}} {{recently}} found in Serbia {{as a new}} pest of apple. The history of its research, {{the results of a}} morphological analysis and degree of infestation are presented. A comparison of the main morphological features of mites from different populations of remote geographical origin has shown that the apple <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> from Serbia is most similar to another European population (Bulgarian [or Austrian?]) while it differs from E. mali originating from the USA and New Zealand. The percentage of infestation varied from 1. 6...|$|E

Abstract: The pear leaf <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> can cause severe damage to pear leaves and young fruits in some regions. Due to hidden living inside leaf blisters, the mites are largely protected against the impact of plant protecting agents. Until now, treatments with mineral oil or rape oil in early spring, during the time when the mites leave their hibernation sites under the bud scales to invade the young leaves and blossoms, are the only possibility to control these mites in Swiss organic fruit growing. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of sulphur, mineral oil and Surround®WP applied after harvest during the time, when the mites leave their blisters and migrate to their hibernation sites. The different treatments were applied shortly after harvest to benefit from the mild temperatures in September. Counting the number of mites after dissection of the buds in laboratory in autumn and spring showed a good efficacy for all treatments. But the visual control in spring during bloom could not verify these results for all treatments. Only the sulphur-treated trees were virtually free of blisters in spring. With a corrected efficacy (Abbott’s formula) of 95...|$|E
40|$|The pear leaf <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> {{can cause}} severe damages to pear trees. By their hidden {{way of living}} inside the leaf blisters, the mites are {{protected}} from plant protection agents. Until now, oil treatments in early spring, when the mites leave their hibernation sites and invade the young leaves, are the only possibility to control these mites. Because of the low temperatures during this period (February/ March) the efficacy of pesticides is often not reliable. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effects of sulphur applied after harvest at the time, when mites are leaving the blisters and migrate to the hibernation sites. The treatments were applied shortly after harvest to benefit from the mild temperatures in September. Visual controls in following spring showed convincing results: With an efficacy of 95...|$|E
40|$|The pear leaf <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> Eriophyes pyri (Pagenstecher) causes {{severe damage}} to pear leaves and fruits. As mites are well {{sheltered}} {{from exposure to}} plant protection agents during summer and acaricide efﬁcacy is reduced when temperatures are low in early spring, autumn acaricide applications were evaluated to control mites as they migrate to their hibernation sites. Post-harvest sulphur and mineral oil treatments were applied in September 2003 and mites were monitored in the following spring. Only the sulphur treated trees were virtually free of blisters. Sulphur treatments showed an efﬁcacy of 95. 3 % (one application) to 99. 6 % (three applications), whereas, mineral oil treatments only had an efﬁcacy of 12. 8 % (one application) to 69. 6 % (three applications). That post harvest sulphur applications could decontaminate heavily infested orchards was possible was conﬁrmed by a large-plot trial in two orchards in 2004 / 2005...|$|E
