50|$|Decomposition {{of plant}} matter occurs in many stages. It begins with {{leaching}} by water; the most easily lost and soluble carbon compounds are liberated in this process. Another early process is physical breakup or {{fragmentation of the}} plant material into smaller bits which have greater surface area for microbial colonization and attack. In smaller dead plants, this process is largely {{carried out by the}} soil invertebrate fauna, whereas in the larger plants, primarily parasitic life-forms such as insects and fungi play a major breakdown role and are not assisted by numerous detritivore species.Following this, the plant detritus (consisting of cellulose, hemicellulose, microbial products, and lignin) undergoes chemical alteration by microbes. Different types of compounds decompose at different rates. This is dependent on their chemical structure. For instance, lignin is a component of wood, which is relatively resistant to decomposition and can in fact only be decomposed by certain fungi, such as the <b>black-rot</b> fungi. Wood decomposition is a complex process involving fungi which transport nutrients to the nutritionally scarce wood from outside environment. Because of this nutritional enrichment the fauna of saproxylic insects may develop and in turn affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor. Lignin is one such remaining product of decomposing plants with a very complex chemical structure causing the rate of microbial breakdown to slow. Warmth determines the speed of plant decay, with the rate of decay increasing as heat increases, i.e. a plant in a warm environment will decay over a shorter period of time.In most grassland ecosystems, natural damage from fire, insects that feed on decaying matter, termites, grazing mammals, and the physical movement of animals through the grass are the primary agents of breakdown and nutrient cycling, while bacteria and fungi play the main roles in further decomposition.|$|E

Two {{species of the}} enzyme (isozymes I and II) were separated by DE- 52 cellulose column chromatography from healthy, cut, and <b>black-rot</b> diseased tissues. Isozymes I and II were purified from healthy and diseased tissues, respectively. Reduction of pyruvate by NADH with either isozyme I or II was inhibited by pyruvate at high concentrations, by NAD + and by several mononucleotides. Isozyme I was inhibited by a lower concentration of adenine nucleotide than isozyme n, and Km for pyruvate was increased markedly at acidic pH {{in the case of}} isozyme I, but only slightly in the case of isozyme n. The molecular weights of both isozymes were determined to be 150, 000 and they were found to be charge isomers by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme activity increased in response to infection by <b>black-rot</b> fungus but decreased in response to cutting. Many papers on NAD-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from animals, fungi, and bacteria have been published.

40|$|Systematic {{literature}} review (SLR) {{is a method}} to retrieve, analyse and summarize research studies, conducted through an explicit and reproducible methodology. SLR includes meta-synthesis and meta-analysis to: (i) develop new conceptualizations and interpretations; (ii) combine the results of different studies {{in order to identify}} the overall trend of the results, and (iii) transform the findings of existing studies in raw data for further analysis and interpretation. SLRs have been carried out in many disciplines, but none was performed in plant pathology with the aim of developing mechanistic, dynamic models of specific patho-systems. In this work, the available knowledge on Guignardia bidwelii, the causal agent of <b>black-rot</b> of grapevine, was retrieved through a SLR and analysed to conceptualize the life cycle of the pathogen. Following the ‘systems analysis’ approach the life cycle was divided in three compartments: (i) production and maturation of ascospores from pseudothecia and conidia from pycnidia in berry mummies and cane lesions (i. e.,the primary inoculum of the disease); (ii) infection caused by ascospores and conidia; (iii) disease onset and production of secondary inoculum. A mechanistic model, driven by weather and vine phenology data was developed from a meta-analysis of the quantitative information available in the literature. In particular, new equations were developed for ascospore and conidial maturation in overwintered fruiting bodies, spore release and survival, infection occurrence and severity, incubation and latency periods, onset of the lesions, production of pycnidia and infectious period. Finally, the model was evaluated to demonstrate its capability to represent the real system and in helping understanding <b>black-rot</b> epidemic...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Proteus melanovogenes, {{originally}} {{isolated from}} <b>black-rot</b> in eggs, does {{not differ from}} Pr. hydrophilus, the cause of red-leg in frogs, more than different strains in each species differ from one another; and the two species may be considered as identical. Both species resemble Aerobacter liquefaciens Beijerinck, Pseudmnas fermentans von Wohlzogen Kuhr and Ps. ichthyomia. The divergences from a common type displayed by these ‘species ’ may be sufficient to warrant the preservation of some as separate species, some as varieties, but all strains of this type with the property of producing 2 : 3 -butanediol from glucose should be allotted to the genus Aeromonas in the Pseudomonadaceae, as recommended by Kluyver & van Niel(1936). In 1937, Miles & Halnan isolated a monotrichate, Gram-negative bacillus which {{was the cause of}} <b>black-rot</b> in South African eggs imported into England, and which they named Proteus rnelanovogenes. They found a similar bacillus in English soils and manures, and in the faeces of a patient with chronic colitis. Aitken, Barling & Miles (1936) also found a similar bacillus (Strain M 90) in a meat-pie responsible for a fatal Clostridium botulinum intoxication in man. From this limited experience it appeared that Proteus melanovogenes might be widely distributed and was potentially parasitic in a number of ways. Miles & Halnan (1937) noted the close resemblance of their bacillus to Pr. hydrophilus, the cause of red-leg in frogs, as described by Bergey (1934), but in their view Pr. hydrophilus was decisively distinguished by its reported possession of peritrichate flagella, and they accordingly created a new species in the genus Protezcs. Bergey’s description, which they omitted to check, was however incorrect. Of the authorities cited in the 1934 (4 th) edition of Bergey’s Manual, none mentions the number of flagella, though all agree in describin...|$|E
40|$|Grape {{production}} systems must adapt {{to reduce the}} quantities of pesticides used because of its negative effect on environment. Organic viticulture may be one solution to face this issue. But to drastically reduce pesticide use, innovative organic practices are required in every soil and climate conditions. In a context of transition to Innovative Organic Viticulture (IOV), changing practices can strongly affect the agronomic performances of grape production. In this study, we analyzed the performances of organic grape {{production systems}} during the transition to IOV. Published methods are used to assess yield and grape quality. An experimental network with 7 studied cases located in Northeastern and in Mediterranean area, in France, {{has been set up}} since 2013. Each case was studied during three years of transition to IOV. The cases tested dealt with conversion to organic or with introducing innovative practices in organic cases (Metral et al., 2012). In Mediterranean area, the cases were planted with Grenache grapevine variety to produce Protected Designation of Origin Côte du Rhône. In Alsace, the cases were planted with Riesling grapevine variety to produce Protected Designation of Origin Alsace for two cases (CHA and ING) and Grand Cru Osterberg for the third case (RIB). CHA case is a cooperative production; whereas all the other cases are private wineries. The results support that most of the studied cases succeed in expected yield and grape quality for Protected Designation of Origin wine production in very different soil and climate conditions. In all Alsace cases and in most of Mediterranean cases, the yield ratios were satisfactory the 3 -yeared of observation because estimated yield match with target yield. The diminution of yield ratio in CHA matches with the winegrower goal. Indeed, the winegrower introduced innovative practices to reduce yield together with drastically reduce copper fungicide use. In Mediterranean area, three of the four cases have acceptable yield ratio (VERR, SERG and VIN). The exception of year 2 in VIN case is due to a regional pathogen accident: <b>black-rot</b> attack exploded in Rhone valley and winegrower didn't manage to use pesticide to protect grapevines. The <b>black-rot</b> attack induced direct loose of 64 % of the VIN yield in year 2. In year 3, VIN strategy was a success to struggle against black rot: the winegrower managed the pesticide use very precisely to avoid a too high lack of yield. GUE case never reached the target yield. The winegrower strategy is ‘use zero pesticide’ and to accept yield loose. According to this, the estimated yield is not so inacceptable in year 1 and in year 2. The exception of year 3 in GUE case is due to the same regional <b>black-rot</b> accident as VIN case in year 2. Whatever the chosen innovative pesticide strategy, there is still a huge risk of yield loose not depending {{in the case of a}} large fungi regional attack. The three years good yield ratio of VERR and SERG cases is partly due to medium pathogens attacks. The quality results support that most of the studied cases succeed in expected sugar rate according to the different PDO conditions. Just on exception was observed: GUE sugar rate was the lowest. Maturity of berries was not reached even if yield ratio satisfied the winegrower. In this study, we demonstrated that the success of organic grape production is guaranteed in most of the studied cases. The target yield and target sugar rate are achieved in very different vineyard areas conditions. Equally, year climate, latitude climate and PDO conditions are appropriated to spread out Innovative Organic Viticulture...|$|E
40|$|The ascomycete Guignardia bidwellii is an {{economically}} important pathogen in many grapevine-growing areas. Primary infections {{are caused by}} ascospores and conidia produced in mummified berries and in cane lesions. Secondary infections are caused by the conidia produced by pycnidia formed in leaf lesions and, in later season, in rotted berries. Environment-controlled experiments were conducted to study the production dynamics of G. bidwellii conidia on grape leaf lesions as influenced by: i) repeated washing events, and ii) alternate dry and wet periods. Under optimal environmental conditions (25 °C, 100 % relative humidity), production of conidia declined over washings and was almost completely depleted after four washings. When pycnidia were kept in a low humidity environment (average of 54 % relative humidity) between two successive washings, the production of conidia progressively diminished as the time between washings increased, with few conidia being still produced after 87 days. This decline in conidial production was faster at 29 °C than at 20 °C. This information is relevant in that it determines the potential of <b>black-rot</b> lesions to produce conidia along the grape-growing season and, therefore, their contribution to epidemic development...|$|E
40|$|Pyruvate decarboxylase [2 -oxo acid carboxy-lyase, EC 4. 1. 1. 1] was {{isolated}} from sweet potato roots and was partially purified from healthy and diseased tissues.

Since sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a molecular weight of 60, 000 for the monomeric form of the •enzyme, it is likely that sweet potato pyruvate decarboxylase contains 4 single poly-peptide chains. The optimal pH of the decarboxylation reaction was 6. 1 - 6. 6.

40|$|Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris is a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} causing <b>black-rot</b> {{disease in}} crucifers. TC 820 was a mutant derived from strain P 20 H by mini-Tn 5 transposition at clp gene, encoding a protein homologous to cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), Clp (CRP-like protein). In this study, crude extracts prepared from P 20 H and TC 820 {{were subjected to}} two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In P 20 H and TC 820, 201 and 148 spots were labeled, respectively, with 125 of the spots matched. Six of the proteins showing differences in amounts were analyzed by mass spectrometry. One of them, upregulated by Clp, was identified as GroEL encoded by groEL, a gene forming an operon with the upstream groES gene. To understand whether transcription of groESL gene is regulated by Clp, transcriptional fusion constructs using LacZ as the reporter were assayed for β-galactosidase levels. One construct (pWHP 552) carried the region from — 32 to — 583 relative to groESL initiation codon, containing a putative Clp-binding site(- 243 to - 264), a CIRCE element(- 51 to - 77) and a σ 32 binding region(- 10 /- 35 at - 118 ~- 127 and - 142 ~- 148, respectively). The other (pWHP 150) contained a 150 bp fragment(- 29 to - 178) without Clp-binding site. The {{results indicated that the}} activity of groESL promoter is about 3 -fold lower in clp mutant TC 820 than that in the parental P 20 H. Using antibodies specific to GroES for Western blotting revealed the amounts of GroES were found to be reduced in clp mutant TC 820, confirming that Clp upregulates the expression of groESL operon. This is the first report identifying the stress-responsive groESL as Clp dependent. 十字花科黑腐病菌 Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 為革蘭氏陰性菌。 P 20 H之突變株TC 820 為由mini-Tn 5 致變在clp基因所得。 clp基因蛋白產物與cyclic AMP receptor protein （CRP） 相似，因此稱其為 Clp (CRP-like protein) 。 在本研究中，主要萃取P 20 H與 TC 820 之總體蛋白，進行二維電泳分析。 在 P 20 H 與TC 820 之 2 D gels中，分別標記有 201 spots和 148 spots，彼此之間有 125 個蛋白相符合。 將六個表現量有差異之蛋白進行質譜分析後，其中一個蛋白為GroEL，受Clp正調控，此蛋白是由與上游groES基因組成一操縱子（operon）的groEL 基因所轉譯出來。 為了了解groESL基因的轉錄是否會受Clp調控，所以我們分析以LacZ為報導基因之融合質體β-galactosidase 的表現量。 其中一個構築體（pWHP 552 ）含有相對於groES基因轉譯起始點的 - 32 到 - 583 的啟動子片段，在此片段中有 Clp-binding site （- 243 到 - 264 ）、 CIRCE element（- 51 到 - 77 ）及 σ 32 結合區域（- 10 /- 35, 分別在- 118 ~- 127 和 — 142 ~- 148 之間）。 另一個構築體（pWHP 150 ）含有一個大小為 150 bp（- 29 到 - 178 ）但不含Clp結合區域的片段。 這結果指出，groESL 基因之啟動子活性在 clp 基因突變株TC 820 之活性比在 P 20 H 野生株中降低約 3 倍。 藉由西方點墨法分析，使用GroES之專一性抗體，顯示GroES在clp突變株TC 820 表現量下降，證實Clp正調控groESL operon，此為認定stress-responsive groESL為 Clp-dependent 的首次報導。中文摘要 英文摘要 縮寫字對照表 1 前言 3 材料與方法 I. 材料 一、 菌種及質體 。 9 二、 藥品、酵素。 9 三. 、菌種培養基。 9 1. 液體培養基。 9 2. 固體培養基。 9 四、 引子。 10 五、 試劑與緩衝溶液。 10 1. 染色體DNA抽取之試劑。 10 2. 質體DNA抽取之試劑。 10 3. 一般電泳試劑。 10 六. 二維電泳分析系統。 11 七. 二維電泳藥品 11 II. 實驗方法 一、菌種保存。 11 二、質體 DNA 之抽取。 12 三、染色體 DNA 之抽取。 12 四、洋菜膠體電泳分析 (Agarose gel electrophoresis) 。 12 五、DNA片段回收。 13 六、DNA 黏接 (Ligation) 。 13 七、質體 DNA 之快速篩選法 (Rapid screen) 。 13 八、轉形作用 (transfomation) 。 14 九、聚合酶鏈鎖反應 (Polymerase chain reaction, PCR) 。 15 十、點測試法 (Spot test) 。? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ?? 15 十一、生長曲線測定 (growth curve) 。 16 十二、b-galactosidase 之活性測試。 16 十三、 SDS-聚丙醯銨凝膠電泳(SDS-PAGE) 。? ? ? ? ? 17 十四、西方點墨分析（Western blot）。 17 十五、二維電泳分析之蛋白質萃取。 18 十六、蛋白質二維電泳分析。 18 十七、蛋白質銀染 (silver stain) 。 19 十八、SYPRO Ruby stain。 19 結果 一、利用二維電泳分析 P 20 H 及 clp 基因突變株TC 820 蛋白表現 21 情形。 1. 生長曲線測試。 21 2. 二維電泳分析菌體內總體蛋白質表現情形。 21 二、利用ImageMasterTM 2 D Elite software 分析 2 Dgels? ? ? ? 22 三、質譜分析。 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 23 四、利用西方點墨法分析。 23 五、groESL基因啟動子在 P 20 H 及 clp 基因突變株之表現情形。 24 1. groESL基因啟動子之選殖與質體之構築。 24 2. 轉型株之篩選。 25 3. groESL基因啟動子之表現情形。 25 （ 1 ）在LB medium 之表現情形。 25 （ 2 ）在XOLN medium含 2 ﹪Xylose為碳源之表現情形。 26 4. 熱休克對groESL 基因啟動子在P 20 H野生株及clp基因 26 突變株TC 820 活性表現情形。 討論 28 參考文獻 34 圖表 4...|$|E
