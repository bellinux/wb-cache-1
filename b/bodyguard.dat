5|$|Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum were World War II {{deception}} operations. They {{were conducted}} {{as part of}} Operation <b>Bodyguard,</b> a broad strategic military deception intended to support the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in June 1944. <b>Bodyguard</b> was designed to confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the invasion. The London Controlling Section (LCS) had spent some time convincing German commanders that the fictional First United States Army Group (FUSAG) represented {{the bulk of the}} Allied invasion force. FUSAG's existence was fabricated through Operation Fortitude South.|$|E

5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the <b>bodyguard</b> instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the <b>bodyguard</b> about murdering Vasquez. As the <b>bodyguard</b> refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots were coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1944 invasion of Normandy, the Allied nations conducted a complex series of deceptions under the codename <b>Bodyguard.</b> The overall aim of {{the plan was to}} confuse the German high command as to the exact location and timing of the invasion. Significant time was spent constructing the First United States Army Group, a notional army to threaten Pas de Calais, along with political and visual deceptions to communicate a fictional Allied battle plan. Copperhead was a small portion of <b>Bodyguard</b> conceived by Dudley Clarke. Earlier in the war Clarke had pioneered the idea of strategic deception, forming a deception department in Cairo named 'A' Force. Clarke and 'A' Force were not officially in charge of <b>Bodyguard</b> planning (a role that fell to the London Controlling Section), but because of the location of the deception the Cairo planners organised much of the operation.|$|E

On {{the night of the}} assassination five of Pararajasingham's new police <b>bodyguards</b> were waiting outside the cathedral but none of them challenged the gunmen. The police <b>bodyguards</b> claimed that they didn't want to fire inside the cathedral in case they hit the worshippers. However, the police <b>bodyguards</b> didn't even fire at the gunmen even after they had exited the cathedral and were making their getaway. The police <b>bodyguards</b> also refused to take Pararajasingham and the injured to hospital. Pararajasingham was taken to hospital by a nephew whilst Sugunam was taken by a niece. Prior to the shooting, when worshippers were entering the cathedral they noticed that the surrounding area was teeming with security personnel. However, after the shooting, when worshippers left the cathedral the area was deserted - there were no security personnel.|$|R

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} forms of defense against assassins was employing <b>bodyguards.</b> <b>Bodyguards</b> act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way—both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target, and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, <b>bodyguards</b> are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.|$|R
