Heating of the coarse-grained granite at 1250 °C for durations of 1 to 48 h produced extreme disequilibrium among simultaneously generated mafic and felsic melts (quenched to glass) and whole-rock 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. In-situ microdrill Sr isotopic analyses across gradational contacts between mafic (high- 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) and felsic (low- 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) glass register significant isotopic and chemical heterogeneity on the submillimetre scale. Our experiments suggest that {{during the early stages}} of wall-rock melting, when the rate of heating may exceed melting rates, isotopic equilibrium may not be maintained, thus producing contaminant liquids having isotopic compositions different from the <b>bulk</b> <b>source</b> rock.

Date palm leaves (DPL) {{is one of the most}} abundant agricultural by-products in south of Iran. Almost all pruned leaves are discarded in the fields, mainly for nutrients recycling and soil conservation (M. Wan Zahari, et al 1999). The yearly maintenance of date palm tree produces a (around 20 kg per each tree) considerable quantities of green leaves (Bahman et al (1997); Pascual et al (2000)). Ruminant can utilize crop residues, with poor nutritional value. These residues are traditionally fed to animal as the main part of diet in many developing countries.

One 630 km long supersegment erupts N-MORB that is progressively {{enriched in}} incompatible element concentrations {{from east to}} west. The second 400 km long supersegment contains three separate volcanic centers erupting E-MORB and connected by long amagmatic accretionary segments, where mantle is emplaced directly to the seafloor with only scattered N-MORB and E-MORB erupted. Rather than a major break in mantle composition at the discontinuity between the supersegments, this sharp contrast in geometry, physiography, and chemistry reflects "source" versus "process" dominated generation of basalt. Robust along-axis correlation of ridge characteristics (i. e. morphology, upwelling rate, lithospheric thickness), basalt chemistry, and crustal thickness (estimated from gravity) provides {{a unique opportunity to}} compare the influence of spreading geometry and rate on MORB generation.

40|$|Clinopyroxene-silicate liquid {{partition}} coefficients for U and Th have been determined by particle track radiography from 1 atm crystallization experiments at controlled fO_ 2. Two natural basaltic and one synthetic composition were studied at fO_ 2 values from the Ni—NiO oxygen buffer to 1 log unit more oxidizing than Fe—FeO (IW+ 1). Over {{the range of}} fO_ 2 values and compositions studied, D_U^(cpx/liq) = 0. 0034 – 0. 015,D_(Th) ^(cpx/liq) = 0. 008 – 0. 036, and D_(Th) /D_U= 3. 4 – 1. 1. With decreasing fO_ 2, D_(Th) /D_U can decrease by up to a factor of 3 for a given composition, primarily from an increase in D_U^(cpx/liq), which we interpret as resulting from {{an increase in the}} proportion of tetravalent U in the system with decreasing fO_ 2. This demonstrates that crystal-liquid U—Th fractionation is fO_ 2 dependent and that U in terrestrial magmas is not entirely tetravalent. D_(Th) ^(cpx/liq) appears to decrease in the two basalts at the lowest fO_ 2, possibly as a result of changes in composition with fO_ 2. Our data show the sense of U—Th fractionation by clinopyroxene-liquid partitioning is consistent with previous experimental determinations, in that D_(Th) ^(cpx) /D_U^(cpx) > 1 in all cases. This indicates that, during partial melting, the liquid will have a Th/U ratio less than the clinopyroxene in the source.

The governance of these sports {{has created a}} hegemony which does not necessarily {{serve the interests of}} those engaged in sport (the ‘ruled’), but instead those who ‘rule’ sport. A key part of governance is the disciplinary mechanism and the control of cheating within the promotion of integrity.

40|$|The {{thickness}} {{and continuity}} of volcanic cover at slow-spreading ridges is variable. Magmatically ‘robust’ regions are interspersed with areas which experience little volcanism. Near the Fifteen-Twenty Fracture Zone (FTFZ), (MAR), volcanism appears exceptionally limited. Here, spreading at numerous sites is instead accommodated by extension on low-angle detachment faults, exposing peridotite to form oceanic core complexes (OCCs). Little {{is known about}} the mechanisms controlling the transition between spreading states. This study investigates these mechanisms in detail (MAR, 12 º 6 ’N- 14 °N). Basalts around the FTFZ are E-MORBs with a HIMU-FOZO flavour. There is no evidence that melt production is currently lower at OCC spreading sites than the surrounding magmatic areas. The geochemistry of dykes (OCC surface, 13 º 19 ’N,- 44 º 95 W) shows that melt here is diverted along the detachment fault, resulting in reduced volcanism in the axis. The mantle source in this region was extensively depleted during a previous melting episode(s). This study finds that the source was also variably veined with refertilising material of HIMU-FOZO character. Basalts erupted immediately prior to OCC formation, and now located off-axis, (13 º 19 ’N,- 44 º 95 W) are geochemically bimodal, and different to the on-axis melts. Trace element and geochemical modelling data shows that ‘M 1 ’ (LREE & volatile-rich, CPX-bearing E-MORBs) are high-pressure, garnet-phase, low melt fractions, whilst ‘M 2 ’ (less enriched, flatter REE profiles) are low melt fractions formed by spinel-phase melting. In areas of exceptional <b>bulk</b> <b>source</b> depletion, melt production is limited by the geochemistry of the source. ’ M 1 ’ basalts result from rapid melting and extraction of a small volume of enriched vein material. This locally cools and dehydrates the source. Low melt fractions ‘M 2 ’ are then generated from this depleted source. Due to the lack of fusible components, melt production remains insufficient to sustain magmatic spreading, and an OCC forms. Thus, periods of low melt production, resulting directly from mantle compositional characteristics, drive the transition from magmatic to ‘fault-dominated’ spreading.

40|$|Abstract – A unified {{electrodynamic}} {{approach to}} the guided wave excitation by external sources in the waveguiding structures with bianisotropic media is developed. Effect of electric, magnetic, and magneto-electric losses in such media manifests itself in the special form of eigenmode orthogonality {{referred to as the}} quasi-orthogonality relation. It reflects the existence of the cross-power flow Pkl and loss Qkl for any pair (k,l) of modes which are rigidly linked to each other by this relation. The quasi-orthogonality relation remains true in the limiting case of lossless waveguides yielding the customary relations of orthogonality and normalization for propagating (active) modes and also their generalization for nonpropagating (reactive) modes. It is shown that the eigenmode set for a waveguiding structure is complete only outside the region of exciting sources. Inside this region the modal expansions of fields are incomplete and must be supplemented with the orthogonal complementary fields which extend the proper Hilbert space spanned by waveguide eigenfunctions. Among exciting sources there are the external <b>bulk</b> <b>sources</b> (currents, fields, and medium perturbations) and the external surface currents.

40|$|The Musgrave Province {{lies at the}} {{convergence}} of major structural trends formed during the Proterozoic amalgamation of the North, West and South Australian Cratons prior to c. 1290 [*]Ma. The Musgrave Orogeny, one of three Mesoproterozoic orogenies to affect the province, produced the granites of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite, which dominate the outcrop. This orogeny was an intracontinental and dominantly extensional event in which ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) conditions persisted from c. 1220 to c. 1120 [*]Ma. The onset of UHT conditions is heralded by a change from low-Yb granites to voluminous Yb-enriched granites, reflecting a rapid decrease in crustal thickness. The Pitjantjatjara granites are ferroan, calc-alkalic to alkali-calcic rocks and include charnockites with an orthopyroxene-bearing primary mineralogy. They were emplaced at temperatures ≥ 1000 °C from c. 1220 to c. 1150 [*]Ma. Their geochemical and Nd and Hf isotopic homogeneity over a scale of > 15 [*] 000 [*]km 2 reflects a similarly homogeneous source. This source included an old enriched felsic crustal component. However, the <b>bulk</b> <b>source</b> was mafic to intermediate in composition. The long-lived UHT regime, and thermal limits {{on the amount of}} crust sustainable below the level of intrusion, indicates a significant (> 50 %) mantle-derived source component. However, a positive correlation between Mg-number and F suggests that many Pitjantjatjara granites formed through the breakdown of F-rich biotite in a crustal granulite. We suggest that under- and intraplated mafic magmas assimilated the limited available felsic crust into lower crustal MASH (melting, assimilation, storage, homogenization) domains. These partially cooled but were remobilized during subsequent under- and intra-plating events to produce the Pitjantjatjara granites. The duration of UHT conditions is inconsistent with a mantle plume. It reflects an intracontinental lithospheric architecture where the Musgrave Province was rigidly fixed at the nexus of three thick cratonic masses. This ensured that any asthenospheric upwelling was focused beneath the province, providing a constant supply of both heat and mantle-derived magma. R. H. Smithies, H. M. Howard, P. M. Evins, C. L.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} refine our {{knowledge}} of the mechanisms that drive the weathering reactions and the rate at which elements are exported out of a shale basin, we have analyzed the boron concentrations and isotopic compositions of 24 rivers contributing to the Mackenzie basin (Canada). Boron has been chosen to conduct this study because of the relatively high sensitivity of its isotopic system to water/rock interactions. After examination of the chemical composition of the Mackenzie River samples, boron appears to be regulated, in the largest part, by reactions involving silicate rocks. The other contributions of rainwaters and the dissolution of carbonate and evaporite rocks can locally control the B budget but they remain of second importance at the regional to continental scales. It also appears that dissolved B in rivers is regulated by input of groundwaters. The comparison between the isotopic composition of the B being exported by rivers (soluble and particulates) and of its <b>bulk</b> <b>source</b> indicates that it is behaving out of steady state in most of the Mackenzie tributaries and particularly in rivers draining the plain. A model of transport/reaction is proposed in this study, which demonstrates that B is controlled by rapid ion exchanges at the mineral/water interface and by long-term dissolution of shales. The responses of the model to tested conditions reveal that the B isotopic ratio of the solutions is highly sensitive to hydrological conditions and to changes in the weathering rate of shales, its partition coefficient with adsorbing surface, and the water velocity. The departure of the B geochemical cycle from a steady state is interpreted as the record of recent changes in the weathering regime in the basin. The temporal evolution of the B cycle modeled here implies an increase of the weathering rate and/or of the partition coefficient between soluble B and adsorbing surfaces whose the timescale is consistent with the last glacial events. This study demonstrates that the present B fluxes are actually inherited from past changes in the water/rock interactions and that the weathering history is a key parameter to interpret the modern geochemical fluxes. This conclusion is valid for any other element that has similar chemical properties with solid surfaces...|$|E
40|$|This poster {{presents}} {{the water and}} energy linkages in urban water supply systems with particular focus at both {{the city and the}} residential end use scales. At the city scale, analysis has been done on a variety of water supply systems in the U. S. and across the world to identify and compare the energy (electricity) required to 1) extract, convey, and treat <b>bulk</b> <b>source</b> water, 2) distribute treated water to customers, and 3) collect, treat and dispose of wastewater. The analysis reveals that the energy intensity (kilowatt hour/million gallons [KWh/MG] for water supply systems varies widely from 820 to 12, 700 KWh/MG depending on the water source type (surface or groundwater), quality, distance from demand location, city topography, wastewater effluent standards, and treatment technology. The analysis shows that overlooking the water-energy linkages in water supply decisions may lead to very high energy intensity like in Southern California where water is conveyed hundreds of miles and with huge pumping lifts from both northern California and the Colorado River to the demand location. At the household scale, we are investigating the range of behavioral (use frequency and duration), demographical (household size), and technological (use volume or flowrate) factors that affect residential water uses and therefore energy consumption though hot water use in the showerhead, laundry machine, dishwasher, and faucet. We are also considering the energy embedded to extract, treat, convey, and distribute water for toilet flushing and to irrigate outdoor landscaping. The analysis is being made with detailed, disaggregated end use data that was previously collected by the USEPA as part of a retrofit study of 100 single family households in Seattle WA, Oakland CA, and Tampa FL between the period from 2000 and 2003. We will use household and city scale energy-water data to build a simulation optimization model that seeks to minimize costs for water, energy, and retrofits at the household and city scales while meeting specified conservation targets. The model decision variables are to select and size water conservation actions targeted to particular residential end uses. The model also is subject to constraints of water use, energy use, and financial budgets to implement conservation measures. The simulation/optimization model will allow water mangers to better quantify water, energy, and money saved from water conservation actions and select and size these actions...|$|E
40|$|Low {{frequency}} {{noise in}} CdSe thin-film transistors (TFTs) has been studied, {{for the first}} time, {{over a wide range}} of gate and drain biases, temperatures and gate areas. The dependencies of the noise on the gate voltage and the gate length indicate that the 1 /f noise originates from the <b>bulk</b> <b>sources</b> homogeneously distributed in the channel. The value of Hooge parameter 3 ̆b 1 lies within the usual range 102 ̆ 0133 3 ̆b 1 2 < 10 < 2 ̆ 0132 for Si TFTs and amorphous Si. The absence of the illumination effect on the relative noise spectra of drain current fluctuations reveals that the nature of the 1 /f noise in CdSe is probably different from that in Si and GaAs.

The purpose of this section is to assess the different literatures by researchers who have contributed to the broader knowledge in the field of Theatre Audience Development. This review will aid our understanding of theatre audience development in South Africa. Search strings used in putting together the Literature review are from the University of the Witwatersrand Database, Theatres attendances, Audience development, and audience interest in theatre performances. The literature sourced has been past to current, with the <b>bulk</b> <b>sourced</b> from the past five years. This review is not exhaustive of all issues, but brings into perspective some of the key themes and arguments around audience development and audience motivations in theatre attendance...|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{shed some}} light on the field theoretic aspect of the spherically {{symmetric}} trapping horizon in Vaidya spacetime. The effective field equations are that of a Chern-Simons theory coupled to <b>bulk</b> <b>sources</b> through two different couplings, one is purely geometric and the other is matter dependent. This is an effective generalization of the equilibrium horizon scenario where the Chern-Simons theory is coupled to the bulk geometry through a constant matter-independent coupling. Further, we note that the field equations pulled-back to a cross-section of the horizon is inadequate to manifest the nature of the horizon. Hence, contrary to the usual practice, the evolution equation needs to be considered at least while passing on to the quantum theory. Comment: 8 pages, revised version, to appear in PR...|$|R
