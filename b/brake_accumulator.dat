50|$|Older, green coloured, {{suspension}} spheres typically last between 60,000 and 100,000 km. Spheres {{once had}} a threaded plug on top for recharging. Newer spheres do not have this plug, {{but it can be}} retrofitted enabling them to be re-gassed. The sphere membrane has an indefinite life unless run at low pressure, which leads to rupture. Timely recharging, approximately every 3 years, is thus vital. A ruptured membrane means suspension loss at the attached wheel, however, ride height is unaffected. With no springing other than the (slight) flexibility of tyres, hitting a pothole with a flat sphere can bend the suspension parts or dent a wheel rim. In the case of main accumulator sphere failure, the high pressure pump is the only source of braking pressure for the front wheels. Some older cars had a separate front <b>brake</b> <b>accumulator</b> on power steering models.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the heart}} of the system, acting as {{pressure}} sink as well as suspension elements, are the so-called spheres, five or six in all; one per wheel and one main accumulator as well as a dedicated <b>brake</b> <b>accumulator</b> on some models. On later cars fitted with Hydractive or Activa suspension, there may be as many as ten spheres. Spheres consist of a hollow metal ball, open to the bottom, with a flexible desmopan rubber membrane, fixed at the 'equator' inside, separating top and bottom. The top is filled with nitrogen at high pressure, up to 75 bar, the bottom connects to the car's hydraulic fluid circuit. The high pressure pump, powered by the engine, pressurizes the hydraulic fluid (LHM) and an accumulator sphere maintains a reserve of hydraulic power. This part of the circuit is at between 150 and 180 bars. It powers the front brakes first, prioritised via a security valve, and depending on type of vehicle, can power the steering, clutch, gear selector, etc.|$|E
50|$|In 1927 a new moving 'assembly line' {{system was}} {{introduced}} for repairing coaches more efficiently. A {{plan of the}} works, dating from 1931, shows large carriage and paint shops, together with smaller shops for springs, frames, wheels, gas and <b>brakes,</b> <b>accumulator</b> cells. There was also a traverser between the roads of the carriage shop, and a separate shop for Pullman cars.|$|R
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the <b>brake</b> <b>accumulators.</b> A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|R
50|$|RunWise is {{an energy}} {{recovery}} project within the Parker Hannifin Corporation. The plans {{of this project}} are: {{being part of the}} powertrain on trucks performing multiple stop and go cycles, the Runwise system will store energy from vehicle <b>braking</b> into <b>accumulators,</b> releasing the power again for acceleration.|$|R
40|$|Abstract：The {{full power}} {{hydraulic}} brake system has several advantages over traditional brake actuation systems. These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume service brakes with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic brake systems. Implementation of full power hydraulic brake system in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the brake system and develop a dynamic model for a hydraulic brake valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of full power hydraulic brake system are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (<b>brake</b> valve, <b>accumulator</b> and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full power hydraulic brake system using a test bench, which is a loader brake system specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full power hydraulic brake system dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Automotive under-the-hood {{electronics}} {{often have}} to withstand temperatures up to 175 °C in combination with harsh environment conditions. This paper gives an overview about the reliability potential of epoxy based encapsulants for automotive applications. Therefore the resistance of epoxy molding compound against typical automotive fluids at temperature of use is analyzed. Six epoxy molding compounds available on the market, showing high temperature automotive potential have been carefully selected to undergo a media resistance testing. For this purpose a dedicated mold tool has been designed and manufactured to prepare these encapsulants for material testing. Thermo-mechanical, mechanical and thermal properties had been determined in initial state directly after molding and after storage in aggressive fluids typical for automotive applications as e. g. gas oil, automatic transmission fluid (ATF), <b>brake</b> fluid or <b>accumulator</b> acid at the respective temperature of use...|$|R
40|$|Typical {{scenario}} for {{the integration of}} electronics into a car is a control unit in the engine compartment, where ambi-ent temperatures are around 150 °C and package junction temperatures may range from 175 °C to 200 °C, peak temperature may exceed these values. Apart from the high temperature load, electronics in automotive applications can be exposed to harsh environment conditions as e. g. to gas oil, <b>brake</b> fluid or <b>accumulator</b> acid. If advanced packaging technologies are used under harsh environment conditions, {{it is clear that}} especially the polymeric materials, i. e. Epoxy Molding Com-pound, Underfiller, solder mask or the organic substrate base material, are challenged. Generally, the development goal for encapsulants compatible with high temperature applications are materials with high Tg and low degradation even at temperatures beyond 200 °C. For these polymeric encapsulants the material suppliers provide basic information about thermo-mechanical and mechanical prop-erties directly after processing, but no information about material data after a certain time of use especially in a harsh environment is given. To yield more insight in transient material parameter changes, material properties of typical encapsulants used for high reliable pack-aging are studied in initial state and after aging under various harsh environment conditions relevant for automotive applications. With these data an evaluation of the material degradation and the related influence on package reliability should be possible. To do this encapsulants need to be robust in terms of chemical inertness when subjected to harsh environment, the second section of this paper is describing the reliability potential of epoxy encapsulants. An example for the reliability potential of such encapsulants is given in the third section, where direct Flip Chip encapsulation leads to extreme thermal cycling performance of 14. 000 cycles without electrical failure. The fourth section describes the most advanced options of encapsulation - i. e. the em-bedding of components or submodules into a printed circuit board - in this case of a 77 GHz Radar module for automotive use...|$|R
