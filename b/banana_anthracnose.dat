40|$|Antifungal {{activities}} of crude extractum of Nanshancha Seed Cake (NSC), to inactivate postharvest pathogens were investigated. Highest inhibitory rate was found against C. musae, C. gloeosporioides and C. papaya P. Henn, which was {{much stronger than}} that by tea saponin. Compared to tea saponin, effects of NSC extractum was relatively weak and similar on C. gloeosporioides Penzig and P. italicum. In an in vivo study, best controlling effects by NSC extractum was found with <b>banana</b> <b>anthracnose</b> disease development, which showed no inhibitory effects by tea saponin. NSC extractum controlled in vitro C. musae growth through directly inhibiting germination rate and germ tube elongation, and causing distortation, rupture and indentation of C. musae mycelium. In banana fruit subject to C. musae inoculation, higher PAL, POD, GLU and CHT activity was observed in banana fruit treated with crude NSC extractum than that of water control fruits. Current study proved the best controlling effects of crude NSC extractum in C. musae in vitro and in vivo development, which through direct inhibition of C. musae growth and increasing defense system of the banana fruit...|$|E
40|$|Crown rot and {{anthracnose}} constitute {{two major}} post-harvest diseases of exported <b>bananas.</b> <b>Anthracnose</b> {{results from the}} single action of C. musae while crown rot {{is caused by a}} parasitic complex which can contain C. musae. Geographical and seasonal variations in the symptoms expression were observed for both diseases. The symptoms expression is governed by two components; first a parasitic one which appears as the level of bananaâ€™s contamination and the second one is a physiological component which determines the susceptibility of the fruit and the response of the fruit to the inoculum pressure [...] The biological answers of the fruit and thus its sensitivity to C. musae are controlled by the expression of certain genes. One of the approaches to understand mechanisms and reactions implicated in the variation of sensitivity in relation to the physiological state consists in identifying genes implicated in these processes and studying their expression. cDNA-AFLP is a non-bias molecular technique allowing analysis of the gene differentially expressed between several populations of cells. The first step of the cDNA-AFLP is th...|$|R
