5|$|In 1883, Krakatoa begins {{stirring}} for {{the first}} time in 200 years. In the nearby village of Waringin, Sadidjah confides to her husband, village head Tjakra Amidjaja, that she has had a <b>bad</b> <b>dream</b> about the volcano; she fears that it will be the death of them. Tjakra Amidjaja consoles her, and tells her that they will leave the village in two days. In the meantime, the volcano grows increasingly violent and Tjakra Amidjaja and Sadidjah stay behind to manage the evacuation. They send their children, Hasan and Soerijati, to stay with family in Rangkas Gombong. Krakatoa erupts several hours later.

5|$|The game {{begins when}} the player assumes {{the role of}} a {{stranger}} who arrives at Tantegel Castle. A castle guard tells him that a dragon has captured the princess and is holding her captive in a distant cave. Determined to rescue the princess and defeat the Dragonlord, he discovers an ancient tablet hidden inside a desert cave; carved on the tablet is a message from Erdrick that outlines what the hero needs to do to follow in Erdrick's footsteps and defeat the Dragonlord. The hero eventually rescues Princess Gwaelin, but realizes that in order to restore light to Alefgard, he must defeat the Dragonlord at Charlock Castle. After the hero collects a series of relics, he creates a bridge to reach Charlock and fights his way through the castle before finally confronting the Dragonlord. At this point the hero is given a dialogue choice – to side with the Dragonlord or to challenge him. If players choose the former, the game ends, the hero is put to sleep, and the game freezes; however, in the GBC remake, the hero instead wakes up from a <b>bad</b> <b>dream.</b> If players choose to fight, a final battle between the hero and the Dragonlord commences.|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{similarities}} between <b>bad</b> <b>dreams</b> and nightmares, they differ in the regulation of affect levels (American Psychiatric Association 2013; Levin and Nielson 2009). Nightmares reflect increased deficits in emotional regulation, contain more negative dream imagery, more references to death, aggression and hostility and are significantly more intense and therefore {{more likely to be}} more distressing than <b>bad</b> <b>dreams.</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>dreams,</b> on the other hand, contain more markers of emotional processing, as articulated and modulated expressions of emotions (Fireman et al. 2014).|$|R

[...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, they were great experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a <b>bad</b> <b>dream</b> — but it's not a <b>bad</b> <b>dream,</b> it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E

Lee said changes are needed to keep a series fresh and compared the criticism from fans to the backlash Marvel Comics received when Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson married in the first place. The Spider-Man newspaper strip adopted the [...] "One More Day" [...] retcon in its version of [...] "Brand New Day" [...] (along with [...] "The Wedding!", one of just three stories to appear in both the Spider-Man comic book and newspaper strip), but reader reaction to the erasing of Peter and Mary Jane's marriage was so negative that Lee, who writes the strip, opted to conclude the story by revealing {{that it was in}} fact a <b>bad</b> <b>dream.</b> As such, Peter remains married to Mary Jane in the newspaper strip continuity.|$|E
500|$|Black and Horn {{realize that}} the killer will have chosen the {{optician}} as his next victim, and agree to set another trap with her as the bait. Horn, more and more unhinged throughout the case, begins imagining the killer and his van at every turn. As he and Black wait for the killer to make an attempt on the optician's life, Horn admits that he cannot trust himself to be there, and is told to go home. However, he parks his car on the route towards the trap, feigning a flat tyre. When the killer's van attempts to pass, Horn attacks him, but the police arrive in time to stop him beating the killer to death. The attack renders any evidence found in the van inadmissible in court, although Black tells him enough evidence was found at the killer's home to secure a conviction. Later, Horn asks Black how he can deal with cases like this on a regular basis. [...] Black does not answer, but later comforts his daughter after another <b>bad</b> <b>dream.</b>|$|E

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B–" [...] and {{concluded}} that, [...] "I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers <b>bad</b> <b>dream</b> that plays {{a little too much}} like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, we've been there before". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it [...] "lethargically lifeless" [...] and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, [...] "Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's just no replacing Englund". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to be scared? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response?".|$|E
500|$|In a mixed {{review for}} The Observer, Kitty Empire wrote that Jamie xx [...] "tear up Russell's soundbed entirely and {{showcase}} his own emerging versatility", {{but said that}} while his productions are [...] "consistently excellent, they aren't really there to augment Scott-Heron's words". Andy Gill of The Independent commented that the remixing techniques [...] "only occasionally work in its favour". Louise Brailey of NME wrote that he [...] "coaxes fresh narratives from the source material" [...] and that it [...] "isn’t exactly groundbreaking, but it showcases a producer {{so in love with}} the music of now that he not only preserves the power of his source material, but makes it more relevant". In MSN Music, Christgau called the record [...] "a young man's <b>bad</b> <b>dream</b> about mortality, and of interest as such", and wrote of the source material's importance to Jamie xx's remix, [...] "the snatches of Scott-Heron's voice, cracked for sure but deeper than night nonetheless, delivers it from callow generalization and foregone conclusion." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times felt that [...] "the duo lends each other gravitas and levity on this very curious but ultimately immersive LP".|$|E
500|$|Many sources {{claim that}} the 42-reel version was only ever {{intended}} to be a rough cut, and that Von Stroheim chose to cut it down to 24 reels by March 18, 1924, with the intention of screening it with intermissions over two nights. The director had difficulty cutting the film down, telling his friend Don Ryan, [...] "I could take out sequences and thus get the job over in a day. That would be child's play. But I can't do it. It would leave gaps that could only be bridged through titles. When you do such a thing you have illustrated subtitles instead of a motion picture." [...] Von Stroheim later claimed that at this time the Goldwyn Company wanted him to shoot a scene of McTeague waking up in his dentist chair, showing the entire film to have been a <b>bad</b> <b>dream.</b> While von Stroheim was editing the 24-reel cut June Mathis, who {{was the head of the}} Goldwyn Story Department, had made her own 13-reel version of Greed by January 21, 1924.

2500|$|Aside {{from these}} {{official}} days of fasting, Jews may take upon themselves personal or communal fasts, often to seek repentance {{in the face}} of tragedy or some impending calamity.
