50|$|The company {{manufactures}} ProCharger superchargers and supercharger {{systems for}} a variety of applications, including automotive, truck, motorcycle, UTV (utility terrain vehicle) and marine.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of superchargers defined {{according}} to the method of gas transfer: positive displacement and dynamic compressors. Positive displacement <b>blowers</b> <b>and</b> <b>compressors</b> deliver an almost constant level of pressure increase at all engine speeds (RPM). Dynamic compressors do not deliver pressure at low speeds; above a threshold speed, pressure increases with engine speed.|$|E
50|$|An {{end face}} {{mechanical}} seal, {{also referred to}} as a mechanical face seal but usually simply as a mechanical seal, is a type of seal utilised in rotating equipment, such as pumps, mixers, <b>blowers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>compressors.</b> When a pump operates, the liquid could leak out of the pump between the rotating shaft and the stationary pump casing. Since the shaft rotates, preventing this leakage can be difficult. Earlier pump models used mechanical packing (otherwise known as Gland Packing) to seal the shaft. Since World War II, mechanical seals have replaced packing in many applications.|$|E

50|$|If {{a stream}} or jet of air is {{directed}} through a flame, fuel air mixing is enhanced and the jet exiting the flame is intensely hot. Jewelers and glassblowers engaged in lampwork {{have used the}} blowpipe since ancient times, with the blast being powered by the user's lungs. For small work, mouth-blown blowpipes may be used with candle flames or alcohol lamps. Starting in the 1800s, blowpipes have been powered by mechanisms, initially bladders and bellows, but now <b>blowers,</b> <b>compressors</b> <b>and</b> compressed gas cylinders are commonplace. While blowing air is effective, blowing oxygen produces higher temperatures, {{and it is also}} practical to invert the roles of the gasses and blow fuel through air. Contemporary blowtorches and oxy-fuel welding and cutting torches can be considered to be modern developments of the blowpipe.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [80]- 82) Acoustic noise problems {{become more}} and more evident as increased numbers of large industrial equipment such as engines, <b>blowers,</b> fans, transformers, <b>and</b> <b>compressors</b> are being employed. Active noise control (ANC), in which additional secondary sources are used to cancel noise from the original primary source, has drawn considerable attention and shown significant promise. However, the performance of narrowband ANC systems is limited by out-of-band overshoot (one kind of the passband disturbance), which was first addressed in a 1991 study by Dennis Morgan. Although several methods for alleviating the out-of-band overshoot were presented in his study, practical limitations still remain. In this thesis, the out-of-band overshoot problem in narrowband ANC is comprehensively studied. One characteristic of the out-of-band overshoot, asymmetry, is analyzed from both mathematics and zero-pole placement theory points of view. An effective technique to eliminate the out-of-band overshoot, phase compensation, is presented. Computer simulations for verifying the theoretical results are also provided. M. S.

40|$|Abstract. In active {{noise control}} filter, IIR filter {{structure}} which used for control filter assures the stability property. The stability characteristics of IIR filter structure is mainly determined by pole location of control filter within unit disc, so stable selection {{of the value of}} control filter coefficient is very important. In this paper, we proposed novel adaptive stabilized Filtered_U LMS algorithms with IIR filter structure which has better convergence speed and less computational burden than conventional FIR structures, for multi-channel {{active noise control}} with vehicle enclosure signal case. For better convergence speed in adaptive algorithms, fuzzy LMS algorithms where convergence coefficient computed by a fuzzy PI type controller was proposed. Multi-channel Active Noise control systems Unwanted acoustic noise problems become more and more evident as increased numbers of large industrial equipment such as engines, <b>blowers,</b> fans, transformers, <b>and</b> <b>compressors</b> are in use. Mechanical vibration is another related type of noise that commonly creates problems in all areas of transportation and manufacturing, as well as many household appliances. The traditional approach to acoustic noise control use passive techniques such as enclosures, barriers, and silencers to attenuate the undesired noise. These passive silencers are valued for thei...|$|R

50|$|United States Navy ships have a varying {{number of}} {{engineering}} officers, {{depending upon the}} size of the crew, occupying positions named for subsidiary responsibilities of the Engineering Officer. The two highest ranking subordinates are usually the Main Propulsion Assistant (MPA), responsible for operation and maintenance of propulsion machinery, and the Damage Control Assistant (DCA), responsible for prevention and control of damage. Anticipation of battle damage increases the significance of responsibilities of the latter position on warships. A DCA often stands routine deck or engineering watches, but spends his off-watch time overseeing maintenance of watertight integrity and firefighting equipment. A DCA's battle station normally includes responsibility for controlling the ship's stability, list and trim by flooding and dewatering undamaged compartments as necessary to prevent capsizing. Additional engineering officers may include an Electrical Officer, responsible for the ship's electrical generating and distribution system as described above, and an Auxiliaries (or A Division) Officer, responsible for pumps, ventilation <b>blowers,</b> refrigeration <b>compressors,</b> <b>and</b> windlass machinery as described above for the Fourth Engineer.|$|R
