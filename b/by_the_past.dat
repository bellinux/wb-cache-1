Miri City Day is celebrated each year on 20 May since it was declared <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> Chief Minister, Abdul Taib Mahmud. A time capsule containing news article of the day and a souvenir book was buried at Petroleum Science Museum at Canada Hill, Miri. The time capsule will be opened 100 years later on 20 May 2105. An effort has also been made to develop Miri as liveable resort city.|$|E
5|$|Thebe is the {{outermost}} {{of the inner}} Jovian moons, and orbits Jupiter {{at a distance of}} about 222,000km (3.11 Jupiter radii). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.018, and an inclination of 1.08° relative to the equator of Jupiter. These values are unusually high for an inner satellite and can be explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io; in the past, several mean-motion resonances with Io would have passed through Thebe's orbit as Io gradually receded from Jupiter, and these excited Thebe's orbit.|$|E

In Gestalt therapy, non-verbal cues are an important indicator of how the client may actually be feeling, despite the feelings expressed.|$|E
25|$|In June of {{this year}} two vessels were sent from Manila to New Spain. The {{flagship}} was the Nuestra Señora de los Remedios and the other vessel was the Sant Antonio. Many rich men of Manila, frightened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> troubles, took passage in these vessels (especially the Sant Antonio) with their households and property, with the greatest wealth that had ever left the Philippines. Both vessels experienced such severe storms during the voyage, that the flagship, without masts and greatly lightened and damaged, put back in distress to Manila. The Sant Antonio was swallowed up in the sea, {{and no one was}} saved.|$|E

25|$|In {{the modern}} {{production}} system, machines and apparatuses {{play an important}} role. What {{is referred to as}} capital is nothing other than these machines and apparatuses, together with materials and intermediate products consumed in the production process. Capital is the most important of factors, or one should say as important as labor. By the help of machines and apparatuses, the human being got a tremendous production capability. These machines, apparatuses and tools are classified as capital, or more precisely as durable capital, for one uses these items for many years. Their quantity is not changed at once. But the capital is not an endowment given by the nature. It is composed of goods manufactured in the production and often imported from foreign countries. In this sense, capital is internationally mobile and the result of past economic activity. The concept of capital as natural endowment distorts the real role of capital. Capital is a production power accumulated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> investment.|$|E
25|$|With the {{destruction}} of the Second Temple around 70 CE, the Sadducees were divested of their main source of authority, without which their theology could not survive. On the other hand, the Pharisees became the progenitor of the rabbinic class, who formalized the traditions of their predecessors. Following the fall of the Temple, it appears that the Pharisaic leader Johanan ben Zakkai (30-90 CE) established himself in Yavneh (a town south of Jaffa known to the Greeks as Jamnia), where he established a school that came to be regarded by fellow Jews as the successors of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin. Upon this Council of Jabneh fell the duty of administering and interpreting religious law, conserving tradition, and solving problems that arose <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> dependence of numerous observances on the existence of the Temple and priesthood. Thus, from 70 to 130 CE, when the Bar Kochba revolt further decimated the Jewish community, the Oral Law experienced a significant period of development and an unprecedented level of legal and religious authority among the populace.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} Scottish {{architect of the}} early twentieth century, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, developed a unique and internationally influential [...] "Glasgow style". Architects who continued to employ styles informed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> included James Robert Rhind and James Miller. From the mid-twentieth century, architecture in Scotland became increasingly utilitarian and influenced by modernism. Key Scottish architects in this movement included Thomas S. Tait, James Stirling and James Gowan. The introduction of brutalism led to urban clearances and extensive use of the tower block. The style was also used in new towns like Glenrothes and Cumbernauld, but has received considerable criticism. More recent major architectural projects include the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, Glasgow, the many striking modern buildings {{along the side of}} the River Clyde and the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh.|$|E

500|$|Flight Unlimited was self-published by Looking Glass Technologies. Their {{previous}} games {{had been}} developed for other video game publishers, and had generated $90 million total earnings for those companies. However, Ronald Rosenberg of The Boston Globe reported that Looking Glass was [...] "no longer satisfied as a backroom player surviving on royalties". Doug Church later explained that the company wanted to self-publish in order to escape the [...] "treadmill of waiting for advances", which {{would allow them to}} make long-term plans without needing to satisfy the immediate demands of a publisher. In late 1994, Looking Glass announced that venture capital investors, including Matrix Partners and Institutional Venture Partners, had provided the company with $3.8 million. The sum was intended to fund the development and self-publication of Flight Unlimited. According to Michael Humphreys of Matrix Partners and Ruthann Quindlen of Institutional Venture Partners, the decision was partly influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> success of the company's co-founders, Paul Neurath and Ned Lerner.|$|E
