40|$|<b>Berm</b> {{formation}} and morphological {{development of the}} beach face have been observed during a neap-neap tidal cycle on the gently sloping and accreting beach at Vejers, Denmark. During the field campaign, an intertidal bar migrated onshore and stabilized as a <b>berm</b> on the foreshore. A new intertidal bar occurred on the lower beach face, migrated onshore on the rising tide and finally merged with the pre-existing <b>berm.</b> As the tide continued to rise, the new <b>berm</b> translated further onshore as an intertidal bar to the uppermost part of the foreshore. The sediment transport during the <b>berm</b> transition was onshore directed in the upper swash and offshore directed in the lower swash. This <b>berm</b> development can be described through both the neap-berm, ridge-and-runnel and berm-ridge development concepts proposed by Hine (Sedimentology 1979; 26 : 333 - 351), and all three stages were observed during only three tidal cycles. The main factors controlling this fast transformation were the gentle slope of the cross-shore profile, rapid water level translation rates, substantial swash overtopping of the <b>berm,</b> and low infiltration rates. Despite the onshore migration of intertidal bars and <b>berm</b> formation, no net foreshore accretion {{took place during the}} field campaign.

40|$|This study {{documents}} {{two different}} modes of <b>berm</b> development: (I) vertical growth at spring tides or following significant beach cut due to substantial swash overtopping, and (2) horizontal progradation at neap tides through {{the formation of}} a proto-berm located lower and further seaward of the principal <b>berm.</b> Concurrent high-frequency measurements of bed elevation and the associated wave runup distribution reveal the details of each of these <b>berm</b> growth modes. In mode I sediment is eroded from the inner surf and lower swash zone where swash interactions are prevalent. The net transport of this sediment is landward only, resulting in accretion onto the upper beach face and over the <b>berm</b> crest. The final outcome is a steepening of the beach face gradient, a change in the profile shape towards concave and rapid vertical and horizontal growth of the <b>berm.</b> In mode 2 sediment is eroded from the lower two-thirds of the active swash zone during the rising tide and is transported both landward and seaward. On the falling tide sediment is eroded from the inner surf and transported landward to backfill the zone eroded on the rising tide. The net result is relatively slow steepening of the beach face, a change of the profile shape towards convex, and horizontal progradation through {{the formation of a}} neap <b>berm.</b> The primary factor determining which mode of <b>berm</b> growth occurs is {{the presence or absence of}} swash overtopping at the time of sediment accumulation on the beach face. This depends on the current phase of the spring-neap tide cycle, the wave runup height (and indirectly offshore wave conditions) and the height of the pre-existing <b>berm.</b> A conceptual model for <b>berm</b> morphodynamics is presented, based on sediment transport shape functions measured during the two modes of <b>berm</b> growth.

40|$|The {{recession}} {{of two different}} <b>berm</b> breakwater design have been investigated.

The second {{is very similar to}} the Sirevåg <b>berm</b> breakwater, but with class II instead of class I at the upper front of the <b>berm.</b> Both breakwaters have been subjected to the same storm progression model, consisting of 7 different steps containing a total of 18 000 waves. The storm progression model is based on measurements carried out close to the Sirevåg harbour,and have been used for several <b>berm</b> breakwater studies at NTNU the last decade. The model of the original Sirevåg <b>berm</b> breakwater behaves to a large extent according to former studies carried out at the same test facilities. It thereby confirmes an apparent discrepancy between model and prototype behaviour observed during its ten year lifetime. The tests show small differences between the two breakwater designs. Differences are found however found in the way they develop; The alternative breakwater reshapes quicker than the original Sirevåg <b>berm</b> breakwater model, but seems to develop a equilibrium profile {{towards the end of the}} the storm progression. This is due to the fact that the class I layer behind the class II gradually is revealed and act as a stronger cover for the already reshaped profile. The original Sirevåg <b>berm</b> breakwater model behaves completely opposite, as the class II layer is ultimately revealed providing less cover. Comparisons between two different ways of measuring recession have been carried out. The traditional and much used definition of recession as the reshaping at the top of the <b>berm</b> is compared to method where the whole <b>berm</b> down to the bottown is analysed and measurements related to the size of the cover stones. Results indicate that the diffrences are small and no particular pattern is detected. However, as the alternative method have been utilized in all test studies regarding the Sirevåg <b>berm</b> breakwater at NTNU, most analysis is based on measurements utilizing this mehtod. A part of the study has been to look at potential economical benefits from construction according to the alternative breakwater compared to the original Sirevåg <b>berm</b> breakwater. Though the extent of this analysis is very limited, the cost reductions are insignificant. It should however be pointed out that other effects than those making the basis for this calculation can come into play. Different wave parameters measured during testing have been analysed and compared to the target values. Though deviations are present in all aspects, they are deemed acceptable taking into account the inherent scatter in <b>berm</b> breakwater model tests. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe main aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>berm</b> breakwater on wave run-up. A total of 200 numerical analysis tests have been carried out in this paper to investigate the effect of <b>berm</b> width, wave height, and wave period on the wave run-up, using an integrating technique of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Direct application of Navier Stokes equations within the <b>berm</b> width has been used to provide a more reliable approach for studying the wave run-up over <b>berm</b> breakwaters. A well tested Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) code with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) scheme was adopted for numerical computations. The computational results were compared with theoretical data to validate the model outputs. Numerical results showed that the simulation method can provide accurate estimations for wave run-up over <b>berm</b> breakwaters. It was found that the wave run-up may be decreased by increasing the <b>berm</b> width up to about 36 percent. Furthermore, the wave run-up may increase by increasing the wave height and wave period up to about 53 and 36 percent, respectively.

It is beneficial to reintroduce the dredged material {{back into the}} littoral system, {{in the form of}} beach or nearshore nourishments. Nourishment in the nearshore is becoming an increasingly utilized method, particularly for dredged material that contains more fine sediment than the native beach. This research examines the morphologic evolution of two different nearshore nourishments. A nearshore <b>berm</b> was constructed at Fort Myers Beach, Florida using mixed-sized sediment dredged from a nearby channel. The nearshore <b>berm</b> was placed in water depths between 1. 2 and 2. 4 m with the <b>berm</b> crest just below MLLW {{in the shape of a}} bar. The nearshore <b>berm</b> migrated onshore while the system was approaching a dynamic equilibrium. Near the end of the fourth year, the beach profiles had returned to the equilibrium shape characteristic of the study area. Gaps in the <b>berm</b> allowed water circulation and should be considered as a design parameter. The fine sediment fractions in the original placed material was selectively transported and deposited offshore, while the coarser component moved onshore. The dry beach maintained the same sediment properties throughout the study period and was not influenced by the fine sediment in the initial construction of the <b>berm.</b> Another nearshore nourishment was placed along eastern Perdido Key, Florida in 2011 - 2012 using maintenance dredged material from nearby Pensacola Pass. Different from the Fort Myers Beach <b>berm,</b> the material was placed within the swash-zone, with a maximum elevation of + 0. 91 m NAVD 88 (or 0. 62 m above MHHW). The low constructed <b>berm</b> elevation allowed natural overwash processes to occur frequently, which resulted in net onshore sediment transport and growth of the active beach <b>berm.</b> Sediment volume gain west of the project area due to longshore spreading of the nourishment occurred mostly in the trough between the shoreline and the bar, rather than on the dry beach. The swash-zone <b>berm</b> evolved back to the natural equilibrium profile shape maintained in the study area within 8 months. The performance of the swash-zone nourishment was compared to two previous beach nourishments at the same location in 1985 and 1989 - 1991, with higher <b>berm</b> elevations, at + 3 m and + 1. 2 m NAVD 88, respectively. The 1. 2 -km 1985 nourishment performed the poorest with a shoreline retreat rate of 40 m/year. The 7. 3 -km 1989 - 1991 nourishment performed the best with a retreat rate of 11 m/year. This suggests that high <b>berm</b> elevations do not necessarily lead to better nourishment performance. Longshore extent of a nourishment may play an essential role. The distant passage of two tropical storms (Tropical Storm Debby and Hurricane Isaac) generated high waves for the study areas. The two <b>berm</b> nourishments responded differently to the storm. Response was also compared to a beach nourishment in Sand Key. The bar-shaped Fort Myers Beach <b>berm</b> was split into two smaller bars, while a storm <b>berm</b> developed for the swash-zone nourishment at Perdido Key. In both cases, the energetic storm conditions accelerated the evolution of the <b>berm</b> profiles toward equilibrium. As compared to the measured nearshore waves by this study, CMS-Wave accurately propagated the WIS Hindcast waves. SBEACH accurately captured the maximum water elevation, consistent with measured upper limit of morphology change. The model correctly predicted beach and nearshore erosion during the storms. The growth of the storm <b>berm</b> at the Perdido Key swash-zone nourishment was predicted reasonably well by the SBEACH model. However, the magnitudes of the storm-induced erosion and the locations of the offshore bar were not accurately predicted consistently...|$|R
