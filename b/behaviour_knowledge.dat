40|$|Objectives: Low {{levels of}} {{physical}} activity and poor dietary habits are common in people with serious mental illness {{and contribute to the}} poorer overall health and early mortality observed in this population. This paper examines the relationships between health <b>behaviour</b> <b>knowledge</b> and self-reported health behaviours in people with serious mental illness. Methods: We examined the health <b>behaviour</b> <b>knowledge,</b> level {{of physical activity}}, consumption of fruits and vegetables and attitudes towards saturated fat intake in 21 community-based mental health consumers in a regional city in Queensland, Australia. Relationships between dichotomous variables of health <b>behaviour</b> <b>knowledge,</b> physical activity levels, daily fruit and vegetable intake, and attitude towards saturated fat intake were examined using Phi coefficients and point biserial relationships respectively. Results: The mean score for health <b>behaviour</b> <b>knowledge</b> was 10. 2 out of a possible maximum score of 14 points. No statistically significant relationships were observed between the dichotomous variables of health <b>behaviour</b> <b>knowledge</b> and level of physical activity, consumption of fruits and vegetables or attitudes towards saturated fat intake. A weak statistically significant relationship was observed between raw health knowledge score and the number of daily serves of vegetable. Conclusions: The lack of significant relationships between health <b>behaviour</b> <b>knowledge</b> and self-reported health behaviours is supported by health behaviour theory which proposes that knowledge alone is insufficient to elicit behaviour. In this regard, people with serious mental illness may not be dissimilar tothe general population...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to expalain the the effect of brain storming and demonstration about exclusive breastfeding on mother 2 ̆ 7 s <b>behaviour</b> (<b>knowledge,</b> attitude and practice) in giving breastmilk companion food for infant (0 - 6 month) at Bung Baruh 2 ̆ 7 s Village, Pamekasan. Method: This study used one group pre-test post-test design. Population were mothers in those area, and sample were 32 respondents who met the inclusion criteria. The independent variable were health education with brain storming and demonstration methods. The dependent variable were mother 2 ̆ 7 s <b>behaviour</b> (<b>knowledge,</b> attitude and practice) in giving food beside mother 2 ̆ 7 s milk for infant. The data were analyzed by using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test with significance level α≤ 0. 05. Result: The result showed that brain storming and demonstration had effect on mother 2 ̆ 7 s <b>behaviour</b> (<b>knowledge</b> p= 0. 000; attitude p= 0. 033; and practice p= 0. 000) in giving breastmilk companion food for infant (0 - 6 month). Analysis: It can be concluded that brain storming and demonstration has an effect on mother 2 ̆ 7 s <b>behaviour</b> (<b>knowledge,</b> attitude and practice) in giving breastmilk companion food for infant (0 - 6 month).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} sexual <b>behaviour,</b> <b>knowledge</b> and attitudes among first year university students {{in order to}} identify factors that may affect their acceptance of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in August 2006. The survey was a self-administered questionnaire comprising questions regarding general health, sexual <b>behaviour,</b> <b>knowledge</b> about HPV and cervical cancer, and attitudes towards vaccination. 2, anova and logistic regression tests were used to identify associations between categories. Of 992 students, 63 (6. 5 %) reported having had sexual intercourse, 22. 4 % of whom had had more than one sexual partner and 36. 5 % had had unprotected sexual intercourse. A total of 70. 8 % of participants were willing to accept the HPV vaccine, with 'willingness' independently associated with age, having had sexual intercourse and beliefs regarding the effectiveness of vaccination (P 0. 05).
