5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis {{for the cause of}} this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E

Next, pump structure <b>is</b> <b>explained.</b> Design of thrust balancing device {{is very important}} because density of CO 2 will vary from inlet to outlet. Critical design point <b>is</b> <b>explained,</b> when inlet condition is close to border between liquid and vapour zone. Then, influence of temperature fluctuation <b>is</b> <b>explained.</b> Next, seal and seal system suitable for CO 2 injection pump <b>is</b> <b>explained.</b> Supply experience of acid gas injection pump is introduced.

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{discovery}} in 2001, 47 Ursae Majoris was already known to host one extrasolar planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris b. Further measurements of the radial velocity revealed another periodicity in the data unaccounted for by the first planet. This periodicity could <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by assuming that a second planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris c, existed in the system with an orbital period close to 7 years. Observations of the photosphere of 47 Ursae Majoris suggested that the periodicity could not <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by stellar activity, making the planet interpretation more likely. The planet was announced in 2002.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, WASP-43b had an orbital period of {{approximately}} 0.8 days (19.2 hours), the second-shortest orbit ever detected, surpassed only by WASP-19b. In addition, at {{the time of}} discovery, WASP-43b was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter known, a phenomenon that can most likely <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by its host star's low mass.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk may <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk may <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel {{independently}} {{proposed that}} the phenomenon of optical activity could <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron.

5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to <b>be</b> <b>explained.</b> Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
