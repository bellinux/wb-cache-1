5|$|At {{the next}} snap {{elections}} in March 2017, GERB {{won for the}} fourth time and four other parties entered the parliament – <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party,</b> Patriotic Front, Movement for Rights and Freedoms and Volia.|$|E
5|$|Domestic {{politics}} in Eastern European countries continued {{to push for}} more enlargement, and political parties reluctant to move on NATO membership, such as the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> and Slovak HZDS, were voted out of office. Hungary's interest in joining was confirmed by a November 1997 referendum that returned 85.3 percent in favor of membership. Russia's actions in the First Chechen War were also a motivating factor for several countries that had memories of similar Soviet offensives.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} snap {{elections in}} May 2013 {{resulted in a}} narrow win for GERB. However, with no support from the other three political parties that entered the parliament, on 24 May, GERB leader Boyko Borisov returned the president's mandate to form a government. The <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> nominated the ex-Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski for the post of Prime Minister in May 2013. Only two weeks after its initial formation the Oresharski government came under opposition criticism and {{had to deal with}} another wave of large-scale protests some with more than 11 000 participants. The government survived five votes of no-confidence before voluntarily resigning on 23 July 2014. On 6 August, a caretaker government led by Georgi Bliznashki was sworn into office and the Oresharski government was officially dissolved.|$|E

50|$|SUCEE {{was founded}} after an {{initiative}} of the International Socialist Commission {{to appeal to the}} Polish, Czechoslovakian, Hungarian, Yugoslav and <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>socialist</b> <b>parties</b> to form a common centre for coordination of their work in exile. These five parties met in London July 4-5, 1949 and founded SUCEE as a joint organization. A SUCEE conference held in Paris later the same year decided to invite the Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian exiled <b>socialist</b> <b>parties</b> to join as members.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} much dispute {{over the future of}} the plant, yet no {{ecological}} sanctions have been imposed on the plant owners to bring into accord Kremikovtsi's pollution status by investing in filtering installations. Insofar, no action has been taken to either close the plant or exercise government power to control the level of harmful emissions to the air, which gave rise to concerns of corruption in the government of the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party's</b> ruling coalition.|$|R
5|$|A {{new round}} of snap {{elections}} in October 2014 resulted in a third GERB victory with around {{a third of the}} vote. A record of eight parties won seats, {{the first time since the}} beginning of democratic elections in 1990 that more than seven parties entered parliament. After being tasked by President Rosen Plevneliev to form a government, Borisov's GERB formed a coalition and members of the parties in the Reformist Bloc (Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), Bulgaria for Citizens Movement (DBG), Alternative for Bulgarian Revival and Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS)) were chosen for Minister positions. However, Boyko Borisov made a vow in 2016 – should GERB President nominee Tsetska Tsacheva does not win the Bulgarian presidential election, 2016, he would resign as a Prime Minister. GERB lost at this election from the independent candidate Rumen Radev who was, nevertheless, supported by the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party.</b> Subsequently, Boyko Borisov resigned for the second time.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of the collapsing of the Eastern Bloc, on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (BSP, the freshly renamed Communist Party). A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. A 1997 reform package restored economic growth, but living standards continued to suffer. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status. It became a member of NATO in 2004 and participated in the War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms it joined the European Union in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption.|$|E
25|$|In the 2005 elections, Simeon's party {{ranked second}} {{and participated in}} the grand {{coalition}} government led by the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> and including the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. Simeon II was given the unofficial ceremonial post of Chairman of the Coalition Council.|$|E
50|$|Until the {{democratic}} changes in 1989, Tsacheva {{was a member}} of the Bulgarian Communist Party, though she quit promptly after the fall of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. In 2007, she joined the Pleven Municipal Council as a member of Boyko Borisov's party GERB. Tsacheva was GERB's candidate for mayor of Pleven in 2007, but she only came third as Nayden Zelenogorski of the Union of the Democratic Forces won his third term in the first round. Tsacheva was also behind the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party's</b> Vasil Antonov in that election.|$|R

50|$|First {{signs of}} {{recovery}} showed 1994 when GDP grew by 1.4%. This progress continued with 2.5% rise in 1995. Inflation, which surged to 122% in 1994, fell to normal rates of 32.9% in 1995. During 1996, however, the economy collapsed during Jean Videnov's government. That {{was due to}} the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party's</b> inability to introduce vital economic reforms and failure to set legislative standards for banking and financial institutions, thus forcing an unstable banking system. All this led to an inflation rate of 311%, and the collapse of the lev. In the spring 1997, the pro-reform United Democratic Forces coalition came to power with its ambitious economic reform package. The reforms included introduction of a currency board regime, which was agreed to with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, allowed the economy to stabilize. The 2000s saw a steady pace of growth and budget surpluses, but shaky inflation.|$|R
25|$|Borisov denied these {{accusations and}} in turn accused the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> of {{attempting}} to discredit him. Borisov stated {{in a meeting with}} NGOs on 5 March 2009 that he intends to include representatives of the Roma ethnicity in all levels of government, including a potential minister, and has reached out to offer inclusivity to Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish population; although these measures and proposals have been seen as politically empty.|$|E
25|$|In February 1990 the Party voluntarily gave up {{its claim}} on power {{monopoly}} and in June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, {{won by the}} Communist Party, ridden of its hardliner wing and renamed the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party.</b> In July 1991 a new Constitution was adopted, in which the system of government was fixed as parliamentary republic with a directly elected President and a Prime Minister accountable to the legislature.|$|E
25|$|In the People's Republic of Bulgaria, on November 10, 1989 — the {{day after}} the mass {{crossings}} across the Berlin Wall — Bulgaria's long-serving leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted by his Politburo and replaced with Petar Mladenov. In February 1990 the Party voluntarily gave up its claim on power and in June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the moderate wing of the Communist Party, renamed the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kostov {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the UDF in 1994. During the winter of 1996 - 1997, mass protests took place against <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party's</b> government. The causes for the complete crisis were hyperinflation, unemployment and food shortages. The protests ultimately led to {{the fall of the}} socialist government. The UDF won the May 1997 elections, and Kostov became Bulgaria's Prime Minister, his cabinet eventually became the country's first post-communist government to serve its full 4-year term. He is credited with turning around his country's fortunes, implementing the currency board in Bulgaria, starting sustainable economic growth, and establishing a path towards Bulgaria's complete integration with the West. Under his government, long-delayed economic reforms were carried out, including privatization of state-owned enterprises was carried on a large scale and the country started long-sought accession talks with the European Union (which Bulgaria joined on January 1, 2007). In foreign affairs, Ivan Kostov followed a strongly pro-EU and pro-NATO course. Controversially during the war in Kosovo he allowed NATO but not Russia to use Bulgaria's airspace (despite overwhelming opposition in Bulgaria to the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia). On the other hand, Kostov didn't allow refugees from Kosovo to enter Bulgaria.|$|R

5000|$|Before the {{formation}} of the <b>party,</b> <b>socialist</b> <b>parties</b> or groupings only existed among the Ottoman Empire's minorities, the Selanik predominantly Jewish Socialist Workers' Federation and Bulgarian left-wing party called People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section), as well as to some <b>Bulgarian</b> narrow <b>socialists,</b> who worked there. On the other hand, there were the Istanbul Greek Socialist Center, the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. As Ezel Kural Shaw has written in her History of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, the Ottoman <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> [...] "gained its main support from the Armenian and Bulgarian groups in the Parliament".|$|R
25|$|On 12 May 2013, a {{group of}} more than 100 demonstrators alleging electoral machinations were {{involved}} in confrontations with police close to the National Palace of Culture after election day polls indicated that GERB was the projected winner. Mass protests for political causes are relatively uncommon in Bulgaria, but have become more frequent since {{the mid to late}} 2000s, with environmental issues such as the demands for the preservation of the Strandzha Mountain nature areas on occasions also triggering anti-establishment activism and discontent against governments. In Badzhakov's contention, these were the third notable protests against the post-communist status quo in Bulgaria, the first ones encompassing the period between 1989-1991 and directed against the collapsing communist regime and the first democratically elected government that was formed by the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party,</b> with the second ones opposing the Zhan Videnov government (as well as the possibility of another Socialist successor to it) and occurring between December 1996 and February 1997. Student occupations of universities had previously been considered in the autumn of 2010 (due to the Borisov government's policy in the realm of education) and in February 2013 (because of proposed increases in tuition fees for the semesters).|$|E

2500|$|Mladenov {{announced}} on 11 December 1989 that the Communist Party would abandon its monopoly on power, and that multiparty elections {{would be held}} the following year. In February 1990, the Bulgarian legislature deleted {{the portion of the}} constitution about the [...] "leading role" [...] of the Communist Party. Eventually, it was decided that a round table on the Polish model would be held in 1990 and elections held by June 1990. The round table took place from 3 January to 14 May 1990, at which an agreement was reached on the transition to democracy. The Communist Party abandoned Marxism-Leninism in April 1990 and renamed itself as the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party.</b> In June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Peevski was {{approved}} by parliament {{within an hour of}} being nominated by the ruling coalition of <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (BSP) and DPS. He was praised by Oresharski for [...] "being outside the system" [...] and thus likely to be effective in working for the interests of Bulgaria. His surprising election immediately provoked nationwide protests the same evening (10,000 in Sofia alone), organized through Facebook. Over 80,000 people joined the [...] "ДАНСwithme" [...] group on Facebook between 14 and 15 June. Peevski initially subscribed to the viewpoint that the protests were not attributable to genuine popular level sentiments, but were orchestrated by forces that had reasons to fear future investigations by him.|$|E
2500|$|The 2013–14 Bulgarian {{protests against}} the Oresharski cabinet are series of demonstrations that were held in Bulgaria, mainly in the capital Sofia, against the left-wing {{coalition}} cabinet of Oresharski (coalition between <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> and Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), supported by the ultra-nationalist party Ataka). The demonstrations started on 28 May 2013, but actual large-scale protests did not emerge until 14 June. While the trigger factor for the demonstrations was the controversial appointment of Delyan Peevski as head of DANS in June 2013, the public discontent stemmed {{from a variety of}} causes, to a large extent connected to the general nature of the BSP-MRF governing coalition and perceived legitimacy issues surrounding political processes in Bulgaria. They ended in July 2014 with the resignation of the Oresharski government. The protests have been described as being among the most massive in Bulgaria's recent history.|$|E

2500|$|Following 2013 Bulgarian {{protests against}} the Borisov cabinet of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov over {{government}} austerity measures encouraged by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund during the recession and high utility bills, the Borisov government resigned and brought forward the Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2013, which saw a very low voter turnout. Though Borisov's party Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) won a plurality with 97 deputies in the National Assembly, it could not form a government and gave up its mandate. The <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (BSP) led the government under technocratic Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski. The left-wing government of Plamen Oresharski {{was approved by the}} 120 members of the BSP and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. Outside support to the Oresharski Government was also given by nationalist party Ataka, dubbed by some sources as the [...] "hidden coalition partner", and regarded as a key instrument for allowing the Parliament to proceed with its functions, until June 2014.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 October 2013, {{students}} at Sofia University joined the anti-Oresharski Government protests and occupied the main lecture hall in {{protest against the}} [...] "façade democracy" [...] and asked for [...] "accountability from their professors", mainly from their history of law professor Dimitar Tokushev, who is also chairman of the Constitutional Court. The student protests and the occupation of university buildings injected new life into a persistent anti-government movement that was into its 140th day on 1 November. Three of the initiators of the student occupation had held a meeting with Mihail Mikov a few days prior to its beginning, during which the then chairman of the National Parliament {{is believed to have}} been dismissive of and expressed a lack of understanding of the demonstrations. The protest intensified over the next few days, and on 27 October counter-protesters, joined by a <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> MPs, made their way into the university and clashed with students. Police arrived at the place, but left shortly thereafter. The video of the clash could be seen at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFNhc-WSohQ By the next day, several universities across the country were occupied by students, including NBU, NATFIZ, VTU and UNWE.|$|E
2500|$|While {{initially}} (prior to Peevski's resignation), {{opinion polls}} revealed that 85% of Sofia citizens were {{supportive of the}} protests (with only 23% declaring trust in the Oresharski cabinet), approval for the protests dropped to 56% in mid July 2013 (with 37% expressing opposition to them and 48% believing them to be [...] "politically motivated") based on nationwide surveys administered by Sova Harris. In the months of September and October, societal reactions to the protests continued to be mixed, with a relatively even split between pro- and anti-protest voices. However, Alpha Research surveys (administered nationwide between 26 and 31 October as well as covering the period between 30 November and 8 December) indicated that the student protests enjoyed a slightly higher degree of popular support than the original demonstrations involving other societal members. In response to Gallup Research questions regarding their voting preferences if the elections were to be held {{on the same day}} in which the October surveys were administered, approximately 22% of interviewees stated that they would likely pick the governing <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> and circa 19% affirmed that they would be inclined to vote for the main one in opposition – Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria, which is reflective of the parity when it comes to popular support {{in the case of the}} two parties.|$|E
