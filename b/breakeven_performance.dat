40|$|Uncertainty in poker {{stems from}} two key sources, the shufed deck and an adversary whose {{strategy}} is un-known. One {{approach is to}} nd a pessimistic game theo-retic solution (i. e. a Nash equilibrium), but human play-ers have idiosyncratic weaknesses that can be exploited if a model of their strategy can be learned by observing their play. However, games against humans last for at most a few hundred hands so learning must be fast to be effective. We explore two approaches to opponent modelling {{in the context of}} Kuhn poker, a small game for which game theoretic solutions are known. Param-eter estimation and expert algorithms are both studied. Experiments demonstrate that, even in this small game, convergence to maximally exploitive solutions in a small number of hands is impractical, but that good (i. e. better than Nash or <b>breakeven)</b> <b>performance</b> can be achieved {{in a short period of}} time. Finally, we show that amongst a set of strategies with equal game theoretic value, in par-ticular the set of Nash equilibrium strategies, some are preferable because they speed learning of the opponent's strategy by exploring it more effectively...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} comparison of a waste heat driven Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) powered Vapour Compression Refrigeration (VCR) {{system and a}} waste heat driven NH 3 –H 2 O Absorption Refrigeration (AR) system were carried out through modelling and simulation using IPSEpro PSE simulation tool. The simulation result shows that at the given design constraints, the ORC driven VCR system gives a better COP and second law efficiency than the AR system. Also at the breakeven pressure ratio (pressure ratio at which the COP of both system is the same) the ORC driven VCR system also gives a better second law efficiency than the AR system. However, at pressure ratios higher than the <b>breakeven</b> point, <b>performance</b> behaviour seems to contradict the well known notion that systems with low irreversibility should be more efficient that those with high irreversibility. This is a paradox and might be {{as a result of}} high number of thermal systems in the AR system. However, the trend in the COP and Φ obtained for each of the systems conforms to expectation (i. e. increase in COP leads to decrease in Φ) ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{investment}} in renewable and sustainable energy sources, over 95 % of the UK’s electrical energy generation {{relies on the}} use of thermal power plants utilizing the Rankine cycle. Advanced supercritical Rankine cycle power plants typically have a steam temperature in excess of 600 °C at a pressure of 290  bar and yet still have an overall efficiency below 50 %, with much of this wasted energy being rejected to the environment through the condenser/cooling tower. This paper examines the opportunity for large-scale application of thermoelectric heat pumps to modify the Rankine cycle in such plants by preheating the boiler feedwater using energy recovered from the condenser system at a rate of approximately 1  MWth per °C temperature rise. A derivation of the improved process cycle efficiency and <b>breakeven</b> coefficient of <b>performance</b> required for economic operation is presented for a typical supercritical 600 -MWe installation...|$|R
40|$|According to the logics of the {{efficient}} capital investment, {{the management of}} the investment of the saving capital in the company’s assets must conclude, {{on the end of the}} financial year, with a plus of real value (NPV > 0). From this point of view, in this paper we suggest the usage of an investment valuation model for the assessment of the company managerial and technological performance. Supposing the book value is a proxy of the just value (of assets and operational results) and supposing the capital cost is correctly estimated, we evaluate the company’s performance both by the net present value model, and also by the company’s ability to create a surplus of the invested capital (NPV > 0). Our paper also aims to identify the performance of the financial breakeven point (for which NPV is at least equal to zero) as the minimum acceptable level for the company’s activity. Under this critical sales point, the company goes through the undervaluation of shareholders fortune even if the company’s sales are greater than accounting <b>breakeven</b> point. The <b>performance’s</b> activity level is one which the managers recover and surpass the cost of capital, cost which stand for the normal activity benchmark. The risks of applying of our suggested model we support go down to the confidence of accounting data and of the cost of capital estimating. In spite all of this, the usage of a sensitivity analysis to search an average NPV would leads to the company’s performance valuation within investment logic with a high information power. company performance; capital investment; capital cost; net present value; accounting break even; financial break even. ...|$|R
