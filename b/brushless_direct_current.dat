40|$|The {{roots of}} swarm {{intelligence}} are {{deeply embedded in}} the biological study of self-organized behaviors in social insects. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) {{is one of the}} modern metaheuristics of swarm intelligence, which can be effectively used to solve nonlinear and non-continuous optimization problems. The basic principle of PSO algorithm is formed on the assumption that potential solutions (particles) will be flown through hyperspace with acceleration towards more optimum solutions. Each particle adjusts its flying according to the flying experiences of both itself and its companions using equations of position and velocity. During the process, the coordinates in hyperspace associated with its previous best fitness solution and the overall best value attained so far by other particles within the group are kept track and recorded in the memory. In recent years, PSO approaches have been successfully implemented to different problem domains with multiple objectives. In this paper, a multiobjective PSO approach, based on concepts of Pareto optimality, dominance, archiving external with elite particles and truncated Cauchy distribution, is proposed and applied in the design with the constraints presence of a <b>brushless</b> DC (<b>Direct</b> <b>Current)</b> wheel motor. Promising results in terms of convergence and spacing performance metrics indicate that the proposed multiobjective PSO scheme is capable of producing good solutions...|$|R
40|$|The work {{concerns}} the constructive characteristics optimization of <b>brushless</b> D. C. (<b>direct</b> <b>current)</b> motors used in electromechanical spacecraft drives. The spacecraft electromechanical drives and units use rather widely the brushless D. C. motors {{in which a}} motor commutator is replaced with more reliable semiconductor commutator controlled by the rotor position sensors. However, these motors are of low power. Electrohydraulic actuators (EHA) use simple permanent-magnet motors (PMM) of rather high power and commutator motors with graphite brush variable contacts. High reliability of brush motors, and, therefore a reliability of EHA in general, substantially depends {{on the quality of}} motor commutator operation. There are different reasons for a possible impact on the normal motor commutator operation. One of them is brush wear. Sparking brushes and burning commutator bars are possible in case brushes are poorly grinded to fit, brushes cannot freely move true in the brush holder box, and in case an incorrect force to clamp brushes to the commutator is chosen. It is established that drive wear resistance and operability depends on the gas environment composition being under sealed motor housing. In dry nitrogen environment brush wear suddenly raises because of the changing tribological performances of the commutator thus leading to essentially falling isolation resistance and no motor start. It is recommended to fill a space under sealed motor housing with air. Positive experience of operating spacecraft device containers with mobile electromechanical couples allowed us to find that in this case a dew point of filled air must be minus 20 ˚C. The paper offers an electromechanical alternative of design to the electrohydraulic actuators, with a ball-screw gear of the actuation mechanism, possessing a number of advantages. </p...|$|R

Previous results showed that a single session of cathodal transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation can improve symptoms in childhood dystonia. Here we performed a 5 -day, sham-controlled, double-blind, crossover study, where we measured tracking and muscle overflow in a myocontrol-based task.

Here, we investigated, {{for the first time}} in a 'proof of principle' study, the behavioural effect of transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation on visuospatial attention in both healthy controls and stroke patients suffering from left visuospatial neglect. We applied anodal, cathoP:dal or sham transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation (57 microA/cm(2), 10 min) to the left or right posterior parietal cortex. Using a visual detection task in a group of right-handed healthy individuals (n = 20), we observed that transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation enhanced or impaired performance depending on stimulation parameters (i. e. current polarity) and stimulated hemisphere. These results are in good accordance with classic models of reciprocal interhemispheric competition ('rivalry'). In a second experiment, we investigated the potential of transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation to ameliorate left visuospatial neglect (n = 10). Interestingly, both the inhibitory effect of cathodal transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation applied over the unlesioned posterior parietal cortex and the facilitatory effect of anodal transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation applied over the lesioned posterior parietal cortex reduced symptoms of visuospatial neglect.
