40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of {{requirements}} engineering, {{the use of the}} so-called <b>boilerplates</b> (i. e. standard phrases and sentences containing gaps to be filled in) is a popular solution to reduce variation among requirements and writers, and thus to improve the clarity of technical specifications. However, the examples of <b>boilerplates</b> found in the literature are often very general, as they need to be applicable to projects as varied as computer software and aircraft or industrial machines. As a result, they only partially fulfill their role, leaving a lot of freedom to the writers in charge of filling in the gaps. Instead, we would like to propose a bottom-up approach for discovering more specific sequences that could constitute either <b>boilerplates</b> or elements to instantiate these <b>boilerplates.</b> To this end, we investigate whether sequential data mining techniques can be used on a small corpus of genuine requirements written in French at CNES (Centre National d'Études Spatiales), the French Space Agency...|$|R

5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a <b>boilerplate</b> MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E
5|$|Four Black Arrows were {{launched}} between 1969 and 1971. The first two launches were demonstration flights, with battleship third stages and a <b>boilerplate</b> payload. On {{the first flight}} an electrical fault caused a pair of first stage combustion chambers to pivot back and forth. Before it cleared the launch pad, the rocket was rolling erratically, and about a minute later it began to disintegrate. After the first stage engine failed, and the rocket began to fall back to earth, it was destroyed by range safety. The second launch was successful. The first all-up launch on 2 September 1970 was the third launch of the Black Arrow, and Britain's first attempt to launch a satellite. The launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser pressurisation system, which caused it to cut out early. The third stage fired, but the rocket did not reach orbit, and re-entered over the Gulf of Carpentaria. The fourth launch successfully orbited the Prospero satellite, making the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit {{by means of an}} indigenously developed carrier rocket. The satellite, also known as X-3, was named Prospero after the character Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play, in which Prospero, a sorcerer, gives up his powers. Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme, the satellite was to be named after Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E

40|$|Natural {{language}} is frequently applied {{to document the}} stakeholders’ statements during requirement elicitation activities. Nevertheless, the use of generic natural language has potential for the issues of unclear and inconsistent requirements. These issues may result from the diverse interpretations by the stakeholders or other various sources of documents and artefacts. The main objective {{of this paper was}} to discuss the definition and application of predefined <b>boilerplates</b> to specify the requirements in the form of natural language statements. The proposed <b>boilerplates</b> were defined and classified based on two main types of requirements, namely functional and non-functional (performance, constraints, and specific quality). Two methods have been applied to evaluate the research results; the applicability of the predefined <b>boilerplates</b> was demonstrated using two different case studies, and the usability aspect is evaluated through synthetic environment experimentation using human respondents. As a summary, the predefined <b>boilerplates</b> were found helpful, especially among novice requirement engineers to express and specify their requirements in a consistent manner and a standardized way, relatively able {{to improve the quality of}} the natural language statements...|$|R

25|$|The term <b>boilerplate</b> {{originated}} {{from the use}} of <b>boilerplate</b> steel for the construction of test articles/mock-ups. Historically, during the development of the Little Joe series of 7 launch vehicles, there was only one actual <b>boilerplate</b> capsule and it was called such since its conical section was made of steel at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. This capsule was used in a beach abort test, and then subsequently used in the LJ1A flight. However, the term subsequently came to be used for all the prototype capsules (which in their own right were nearly as complicated as the orbital capsules). This usage was technically incorrect, as those other capsules were not made of <b>boilerplate,</b> but the <b>boilerplate</b> term had effectively been genericized.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Current {{industrial}} automation systems {{are becoming more}} and more complex, and typically involve different phases of engineering, such as design time and runtime. System requirements, which are usually elicited during design time by engineers, currently are not sufficiently represented at runtime, like the runtime enforcement of safety requirements for {{industrial automation}} systems. Such kind of enforcement usually is very hard to model and predict at design time. Hence, the need exists to capture and manage safety requirements at design time and runtime, since safety requirements of industrial automation systems may lead to high risks if not addressed properly. In this position paper, we introduce a safety requirements enforcement framework and the using of <b>Boilerplates</b> for requirements elicitation and by explicitly modeling the runtime requirements knowledge for further application. We illustrate and evaluate the approach with data from a real-world case study in the area of industrial process systems. Major result was that the <b>Boilerplates</b> and explicit engineering knowledge are well suited to capture and enforce runtime safety requirements of industrial automation systems...|$|R
