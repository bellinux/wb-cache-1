5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E
5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Sinbad {{released}} Sinbad's Guide to Life: <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> Everything, {{a book of}} comedic short essays. It was co {{written with}} David Ritz.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{that bear}} hadn't gone far for that sugar; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> he hadn't stole {{it from a}} cache--it was too fresh, and we'd have seen the torn-up earth; because we had passed no camp; and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> there was no shanty here. And, besides," [...] she added in a low voice, [...] "may be I was huntin' a hole myself to die in--and spotted it by instinct." ...|$|R
60|$|Here I showed {{myself a}} {{perfectly}} wise man, for <b>I</b> only prophesied <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Douglas," [...] she said, [...] "it was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> fancied {{that you}} were {{beginning}} to care for me and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>I</b> cared for you that <b>I</b> went away--not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was afraid." ...|$|R
25|$|Would {{you ask me}} how I dare {{to compare}} the civil rights {{struggle}} with the struggle for lesbian and gay rights? I can compare them and I do compare them, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{what it means to be}} called a 'nigger' and I know what it means to be called a 'faggot,' and I understand the differences in the marrow of my bones. And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Corey Taylor {{commented on}} a {{slashing}} incident at a South African school to which Slipknot was linked; he said: ...obviously, I'm {{disturbed by the}} fact that people were hurt and someone died, as far as my responsibility for that goes, it stops there, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> our message is actually very positive...there {{are always going to be}} mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that they're fucked up and lost.|$|E
500|$|Donna Murphy {{played the}} Ba'ku woman Anij, who is Picard's love interest. Eighty actresses auditioned for the role, which {{was awarded to}} Murphy who had {{previously}} won two Tony Awards for her roles in the Broadway musicals Passion and The King and I. Murphy was such a favorite of Frakes and the producers that after auditioning, {{only a small number}} of other actresses were seen. She said of the role, [...] "I feel a great honor and responsibility to be a part of this film, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that the Star Trek audience has such a devotion to and affection for these richly drawn characters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "(Third.) That I {{entrapped}} {{your son}} Fritz into asking for my daughter's hand in marriage, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{his father to}} be a rich man.|$|R
60|$|The {{affair was}} beyond any human and {{rational}} experience. I {{tried to say}} 'Hydrophobia,' but the word wouldn't come, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>I</b> was lying.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then," [...] Babbie said, hiding her face, [...] "I {{could not}} tell you what <b>I</b> was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> you would loathe me. I could only go away." ...|$|R
500|$|Following her marriage, Kajol {{moved in}} with Devgan and his parents at the latter's ancestral house in Juhu. While media members speculated about a lack of {{compatibility}} between her in-laws and her, Kajol clarified that they were [...] "like parents to me" [...] and encouraged her to continue working in films. Tabloids have often romantically linked Devgan with other Bollywood actresses, and have reported about an imminent divorce. Refuting the rumours, Kajol stated, [...] "I don't believe in those rumours <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the way this industry functions. [...] You cannot continue a marriage without the basic trust. Frankly, I don't care for such talk." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton [...] "loved the idea" [...] {{of playing}} a {{character}} [...] "very different" [...] from Jason Morgan, who was characterized as [...] "Stone Cold". The role of Dylan {{allowed him to}} wear colors other than black, which he was famed for at General Hospital. Of returning to daytime television without Jason Morgan's [...] "uniform" [...] and [...] "black T-shirt", Burton described the experience as [...] "refreshing". Explaining his wardrobe process, he said: [...] "I never had to try stuff on. I'm not used to wardrobe fittings. I had to try on about 20 different outfits! That was really grueling. It was important to shake the leather coat and black t-shirt and do my hair different, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> people {{are always going to}} see me as Jason." ...|$|E
500|$|Jenna Fischer {{found her}} character's {{break-up}} scene with Roy [...] "really dark," [...] {{as she is}} friends with David Denman outside of the show. She explained, [...] "To see him turn like that, {{for me it was}} even more shocking <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> him as a big teddy bear. He played it so well and I think that cliffhanger of 'I’m gonna kill Jim Halpert' {{is one of the best}} last lines of our episodes ever." [...] "Cocktails" [...] included recurring guest star Michael Patrick McGill as Kenny Anderson, who called working on The Office [...] "a blast." [...] Other guest stars included Dan Cole as Dan Gore, Owen Daniels as the Wallaces' son, and Jean Villepique as Rachel Wallace.|$|E
3000|$|... “At {{that time}} I {{was a little}} bit shocked. I was really shocked. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that disease. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> how it is going to be…But I have to shout.” (Spoken in English by M 4) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Somebody said Denver. Some {{one else}} said Kansas City. I never asked dad, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> Jack {{had been sent}} away. I've {{supposed}} he was working--making a man of himself." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{said this}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> a doctor from Graz {{who was always}} {{wandering}} about, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{did not want to}} be myself, an Englishman, to these two old ladies. I wanted to be something else. So we exchanged confidences.|$|R
500|$|Maloney drew {{criticism}} {{for the fact}} that he bought a house in Cold Spring before the election, never having previously lived in the district. On June 11, former President Bill Clinton announced his endorsement of Maloney, saying [...] "I support Sean <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> he’ll be an outstanding member of Congress." [...] On October 21, The New York Times endorsed Maloney, stating that his opponent [...] "has favored limiting contraception coverage for employees and voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Mr. Maloney promises to support health care reform, help the middle class and oppose tax cuts for the rich. We recommend Mr. Maloney." [...] Maloney also was endorsed by Planned Parenthood, and the AFL-CIO and New York State United Teachers Union.|$|E
500|$|After leaving The Hills, Conrad {{appeared}} on The View in June 2009, {{where she was}} asked how she felt about her apology from Pratt involving the sex tape rumors. She replied, [...] "To be perfectly honest, I wasn't on the other line of that call [...] I didn't even know about it until , so no, I didn't get an apology, he's lying". At Montag and Pratt's wedding, it was depicted on the series as if Conrad and Cavallari were displeased with each other's presence, though the latter commented that they gave each other [...] "a big hug, and that's it". She also stated that when she joined The Hills, [...] "It's work! And drama sells. I think that's why they're bringing me in, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what works".|$|E
500|$|Holly's {{pregnant}} wife, María Elena, {{learned of}} his death from the reports on television. A widow after only six months of marriage, she suffered a miscarriage shortly after, reportedly due to [...] "psychological trauma". Holly's mother, on hearing the news on the radio at home in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. María Elena Holly {{did not attend the}} funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later said in an interview: [...] "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I {{came to you}} as soon as I {{heard of}} it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> you were all alone. If there had been any one else I should not have come." ...|$|R
5000|$|I said it {{from the}} platform! We told {{everyone}} the end was near. When I became a Witness I gave up my insurance policies, I cancelled all my insurance endowments, I never bought a house <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't need one, we didn't even {{want to put the}} kids' names down for school.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{told you}} that?" [...] Sam said. [...] "If I staid, it was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knowed</b> it wouldn't be long until I got {{the upper hand}} of the gang, an I've done it." ...|$|R
500|$|Cisneros {{explores the}} issue of place in {{relation}} not only to gender but also to class. As Saldívar has noted, [...] "Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman's space, Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the working poor and the homeless as well." [...] He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors {{to those who are}} less fortunate. Esperanza says [...] "Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how it is to be without a house." [...] According to Saldívar, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to [...] "the necessity for a decent living space" [...] that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.|$|E
500|$|Obviously we knew {{people were}} going to totally sensationalize it. They're {{beautiful}} girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [...] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them and talk to them on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} officially {{canceled}} by ABC on May 13, 2010. In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t think we got either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "You {{must have}} graded my exam incorrectly. I studied {{very hard for}} weeks {{specifically}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> my career depended on getting a good grade. If {{you give me a}} failing grade I'm ruined!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, much better. You were a poor {{caterpillar}} before; I {{liked you}} a little <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what a pretty butterfly you would be in time. I helped to make your wings. Now, listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] he said. [...] "I came <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that Mr. Fielding was half-way to America, and his {{daughter}} in Russia. Some friends of mine were curious to know who your guests could be." ...|$|R
500|$|It {{had been}} {{unlikely}} that Hershiser would ever became a successful pitcher. He {{was unable to}} make his high school varsity team until he was a junior, and he went undrafted as a high schooler. He {{failed to make the}} Bowling Green State University team as a freshman, and after graduating, he struggled through two years in both Double A and Triple A baseball. Drysdale said that he enjoyed rooting for Hershiser because his jersey number, 55, like Drysdale's own number, 53, indicated that Hershiser had been a long shot to make the majors (lower numbers were generally assigned to better prospects in those days). [...] After the record was broken, Drysdale said he was not surprised that his record was broken. Even though Hershiser had the second-best (behind Dwight Gooden) career ERA among active pitchers, he believed that someone would surpass the record because he did not feel he was that great a pitcher, saying, [...] "I think someone's going to break it from me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I'm not any big deal".|$|E
500|$|The Rolling Stone review {{stated that}} Björk [...] " [...] for {{inspiration}} in the soundscapes of orchestral jazz, ambient techno and classical". Influences of jazz fusion were also noted by a contemporary review by The New York Times. In a 1995 interview with Pulse, Björk {{was reluctant to}} listing other female vocalists as an inspiration, stating: [...] "I've never really compared myself to other people, not because I'm too big-headed or I've got a minority complex, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I just can't sing like anyone else." [...] Nevertheless, in 2015 Björk acknowledged that as she grew older, she understood [...] "that music like Kate Bush has really influenced [...]" [...] The Pulse article also read: [...] "a lot of Björk's early influences were books (George Bataille's Story of the Eye, Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita) and films (Tampopo, Star Wars, The Tin Drum) available internationally. [...] But talk about Iceland and you're getting {{to the heart of}} the matter, the source of her spirited outlook on life." [...] In 1996, when asked about the album's musical influences, Björk stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Rain in England {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} referenced for its uniqueness and its demonstration of Lil B's {{broad range of}} styles. Hip hop writer Andrew Nosnitsky remarked in The Wire that Lil B was likely the only rapper who could pull off both an ambient release on Weird Forest and a collaboration with Soulja Boy in the same year. The San Francisco Bay Guardian said the album demonstrated Lil B's unpredictability; similarly, SF Weekly called it [...] "a different beast entirely" [...] {{from the rest of}} his work. In Seattle Weekly, Eric Grandy called Rain in England an [...] "oddity" [...] and said Lil B's music is better served by randomly listening to him on YouTube then in a long-form album format. In a 2012 profile of Lil B's career so far, The Wires Lisa Blanning said the album [...] "feels like a new musical expression." [...] Lil B himself described Rain in England as [...] "my favorite work ... I think that's my most powerful work, to myself. ... That's my favorite, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> no one else has done that, and that's what I'm most proud of, when I do things that I know nobody else has done before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a dunce at many things," [...] she replied. [...] "The reason <b>I</b> came was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{that you}} were living in these parts, and I had a fancy to see you again." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were the}} names of the Douglases, the Elliots, the Scotts, the Armstrongs, and others. I looked at this {{arrangement}} with interest, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that Scott must have taken a particular delight in it.|$|R
5000|$|... "I found {{depiction}} credible <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{from the}} experience that we had assessing the need for my own device {{that it was an}} accurate portrayal of what was possible," [...] Cheney said of the plot.|$|R
