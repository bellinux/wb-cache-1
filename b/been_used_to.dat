5|$|RNAi has <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> genetically {{engineer}} {{plants to}} produce {{lower levels of}} natural plant toxins.

Cotton seeds are rich in dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi has <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta-cadinene synthase, a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production {{in other parts of the}} plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests. Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the cyanogenic natural product linamarin in cassava plants.|$|E
