Special programmes {{such as the}} four-year „bachelor plus", in which students spend one year at Michigan State University, USA, and the international M.Sc. in Biology enable students to gain international experience. The faculty has institutionalised support for doctoral studies {{in the form of}} iGRAD, the Interdisciplinary Graduate and Research Academy Düsseldorf to establish network structures and offer counselling and training services for doctoral students, supervisors and research training groups. Further backing for structured doctorates provide the following programmes: RTG 1203 Dynamics in Hot Plasms (DFG), Graduate Cluster CLIB, NRW Research Academy Biostruct, RTG [...] "Molecules of Infection" [...] (Manchot Foundation), the international graduate school iGRAD-Plant in collaboration with the Forschungszentrum Jülich and Michigan State University, US; and the internally funded initiatives vivid, e-norm, and iGRASPseed.Research hubs with a significant volume of third-party founded collaborative projects are biology (Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences CEPLAS) and physics (CRC-TR 6, CRC-TR 18). The Biomedical Research Center (BMFZ) and the Bioeconomy Science Center (a cluster of 54 departments of the universities of Aachen, Bonn and Düsseldorf, as well as the Forschungszentrum Jülich) are important organisations forming the local research environment.|$|E

In the theoretical {{part of the}} assignment we give the fundamental information about the Chinese martial art Tai chi chuan and about its basic exercise principles. Further on we introduce the phases of motoric learning and the education process concerning the practice of Tai chi chuan. In the practical part we are rather dealing with the suggestion of the Multimedia <b>Basic</b> <b>Programme</b> of 24 Forms of Yang Style Tai chi chuan and its software processing, including the description of table of contents. This is supplied with the photo documentation, which graphicly shows the feet position in individual steps of Tai chi chuan practice. The same principle implies synchronizing of the first exercises of the 24 Forms. The important part is also the photo documentation showing the most common mistakes in practicing Tai chi chuan, which by its exercising, is important to avoid. The <b>Basic</b> <b>Programme</b> on the DVD shows: the introduction of practice, chi kung, basic principles of body work and weight balance, the preparatory exercise, basic steps and stances, individual movements of 24 Forms, summary of routine 24 Forms, demonstration of applications...|$|R

The transformation of the vocational sector started in the 1980 s when highly specialised study lines were combined into more comprehensive <b>basic</b> <b>programmes.</b> Despite this effort to broaden the curricula, the structure of vocational education, including the so-called higher vocational education, was considered to be too rigid and inflexible both with regard to individual needs and the demands of the changing world of work.

40|$|A key {{step in the}} {{development}} of any educational programme is learning needs assessment. This is however often neglected. The purpose of this research was to identify learning needs of potential students in order to develop a relevant educational programme for registered nurses in advanced midwifery and neonatology. A survey design was used, and the population of the study was the registered nurses in the Free State. Two thousand questionnaires were mailed to respondents, selected by means of simple random sampling. Advanced educational programmes emphasize the teaching of advanced knowledge and skills and accept that the students entering these programmes already have specific knowledge and skills included in the curricula for <b>basic</b> <b>programmes.</b> This is contrary to the findings of this study.

The method has been developed by the authors in the academic sphere while teaching {{over the last six}} years on a number of degree courses – both the three-year <b>basic</b> <b>programmes</b> and the two-year specialist ones – at four Italian places of learning: the Politecnico di Milano, Sapienza University of Rome, the University of Palermo and ISIA (the Higher Institute for Artistic Industries) in Florence, which is now recognized as being equivalent to a degree course. Behind the research is a focus on a specific area of the design field which has until now been undervalued and not sufficiently expanded upon by teaching programmes, as it has always been seen as something which is simply there to be exploited. However, it has become more prominent in recent years, thanks in part to rapid technical and scientific development and the arrival on the scene of numerous new materials with unprecedented capabilities.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the issue of subsidies, and gives an {{overview}} on their structure and <b>basic</b> <b>programmes</b> offered by the funds, from which it is possible to draw grants and it subsequently informs about the conditions for the payment of subsidies. There also offers information about accounting and tax aspects. It focuses on the describtion of management of an agricultural entity operating in South Bohemia. The thesis elaborates the most important aspects of the application of exercicing costs reduction in the managment of Agricultural Cooperative in the absence of subsidies. Yet subsidies {{have a significant impact on}} the economic situation of the company. In the absence of any subsidy a Cooperative Entity would surely go bankrupt. This paper evaluates two cases to illustrate such eventuality. The first is maintenance cost analysis of grassed-areas, the second case- finding costs on the unemployed. We come to the conclusion that agricultural businesses today are not in a position to finance its activity only from their own resources and are significantly dependent on the subsidy policy, mainly of the European Union...|$|E

Its statistical activities are aimed at providing relevant, reliable and current information for development and policy-making purposes, both at the national and international levels, {{and the production of}} reliable statistical indicators for education. These indicators cover four main areas: educational population; access and participation; the efficiency and effectiveness of education; human and financial resources. The UNESCO Education Database covers a wide range of these areas, at four main educational levels: pre-primary, primary, secondary and tertiary, in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) system. This system provides standard definitions {{for each of the four}} levels of education examined. UNESCO collects and collates education data according to these definitions from approximately 200 countries, and compiles them into the Education Database time series, which is published annually. Main Topics : Data are available in this collection for various topics related to secondary education - the second ISCED level (ISCED = International Standard Classification of Education). Entry to secondary education is generally around 11 years of age, and graduation around 16 - 18 years of age. Core education at the secondary level continues the <b>basic</b> <b>programmes</b> started at the primary level (see SN: 3700), but usually with a more subject-oriented pattern. After three or four years of general academic education at this level, pupils may begin to specialize in vocational and technical subjects (which may or may not prepare them for employment or further technical study), or pursue a more academic programme designed to prepare them for university entrance. Topics covered here include: pupils in secondary education (total, by age and by grade), pupils repeating grades at secondary level (by grade), teachers and pupils at secondary level by institution, and numbers of teachers at secondary level. All data are further defined by gender...|$|E
