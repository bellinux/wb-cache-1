5|$|Diefenbaker was {{initially}} inclined {{to go along}} with Kennedy's request that nuclear weapons be stationed on Canadian soil as part of NORAD. However, when an August 3, 1961, letter from Kennedy which urged this was leaked to the media, Diefenbaker was angered and withdrew his support. The Prime Minister was also influenced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> demonstration against nuclear weapons, which took place on Parliament Hill. Diefenbaker was handed a petition containing 142,000 names.|$|E

5|$|Like its art, Palmyra's {{architecture}} {{was influenced}} by the Greco-Roman style, while preserving local elements (best seen in the Temple of Bel). Enclosed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> wall flanked with traditional Roman columns, Bel's sanctuary plan was primarily Semitic. Similar to the Second Temple, the sanctuary consisted of a large courtyard with the deity's main shrine off-center against its entrance (a plan preserving elements of the temples of Ebla and Ugarit).|$|E
5|$|On 5 November, the 2nd Marine Regiment {{launched}} Operation Steel Curtain {{against the}} border town of Husaybah. The Marines reported that ten Marines and 139 insurgents {{died in the}} offensive. Medical workers in Husaybah claimed that 97 civilians were killed. On 1 December, ten Marines from 2nd Battalion 7th Marines were killed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> IED while on a foot patrol in Fallujah.|$|E
5|$|The West Indies were an {{outpost of}} the British Empire {{in the late}} 18th century, and the source or {{destination}} of one-third of Britain's foreign trade in the 1790s. Britain's economic interests were protected <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> military presence, with 69line infantry regiments serving there between 1793 and 1801, and another 24 between 1803 and 1815.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} the Industrial Revolution was marked <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> boom in the textile industry, with {{remarkable}} technological innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain. In its early years, there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, spinning progressed much more rapidly than weaving.|$|E
5|$|All {{historical}} eruptions at Kīlauea {{have occurred}} {{at one of}} three places: its summit caldera, its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone. Half of Kīlauea's historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous {{for much of the}} 19th century, capped <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> explosive eruption in 1924 before petering out by 1934. Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kīlauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
50|$|However, a {{powerful}} criminal organization called SHADOW {{is out to}} destroy both the Galactic Patrol and the U.P.

5|$|In 1950, radio {{emission}} from the Andromeda Galaxy {{was detected by}} Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at Jodrell Bank Observatory. The first radio maps of the galaxy {{were made in the}} 1950s by John Baldwin and collaborators at the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group. The core of the Andromeda Galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C radio astronomy catalog. In 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. This was detected using a technique called microlensing, which is caused by the deflection of light <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> object.|$|E
5|$|In prison, Sideshow Bob calls local right-wing {{talk show}} host Birch Barlow and {{complains}} about being unfairly imprisoned. Barlow and Springfield's residents pressure Mayor Quimby into releasing Sideshow Bob. Sideshow Bob is soon unveiled as the Republican candidate for the Springfield mayoral election. Determined to keep Sideshow Bob from becoming mayor, Bart and Lisa decide to campaign for Mayor Quimby. Unfortunately, due to Sideshow Bob's charisma and Mayor Quimby's drowsy, overmedicated appearance at a televised debate, Sideshow Bob wins the election <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> margin.|$|E
5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma {{began to fall}} out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into the {{starboard}} side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E

5|$|The {{infantry}} {{assault was}} preceded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> artillery bombardment {{that was meant}} to soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but was largely ineffective. Approximately 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open fields for three-quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repulsed with over 50% casualties, a decisive defeat that ended the three-day battle and Lee's campaign into Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, imaging of {{the system}} with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys {{revealed}} {{the presence of a}} secondary dust disk inclined at an angle of about 5° to the main disk and extending at least 130 AU from the star. The secondary disk is asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less inclined than the northeast. The imaging was not good enough to distinguish between the main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust disk is predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU from the star. The secondary disk may be produced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> planet in an inclined orbit removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.|$|E
5|$|Jaws {{was first}} {{released}} on DVD in 2000 for the film's 25th anniversary, accompanied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> publicity campaign. It featured a 50-minute {{documentary on the}} making of the film (an edited version of the one featured on the 1995 LaserDisc release), with interviews with Spielberg, Scheider, Dreyfuss, Benchley, and other cast and crew members. Other extras included deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers, production photos, and storyboards. The DVD shipped one million copies in just one month. In June 2005, a 30th-anniversary edition was released at the JawsFest festival in Martha's Vineyard. The new DVD had many extras seen in previous home video releases, including the full two-hour Bouzereau documentary, and a previously unavailable interview with Spielberg conducted on the set of Jaws in 1974. On the second JawsFest in August 2012, the Blu-ray Disc of Jaws was released, with over four hours of extras, including The Shark Is Still Working. The Blu-ray release was part of the celebrations of Universal's 100th anniversary, and debuted at fourth place in the charts, with over 362,000 units sold.|$|E

5|$|Kessler then invites Cole to {{join him}} for a final fight in the same {{location}} where the game began. Displaying similar, if not superior, powers to the latter, Kessler comes close to killing him, only to be foiled by Zeke. Mortally wounded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> energy discharge, Kessler uses his last bit of strength to transmit a message into Cole's brain. In a final twist, Kessler {{turns out to be}} Cole himself from an alternate timeline. While raising a family with Trish, Kessler failed to prevent the Beast, a malevolent entity, from conquering humanity. With his reign secure, the Beast then tracked down and killed Trish and her children. Sending himself back in time, Kessler seized control of the First Sons, using their resources to prepare his past self for the future to come. Cole denounces Kessler's memory, but recognizes that his actions have given his life a new purpose.|$|E
5|$|Out of the {{hundreds}} of known Psittacosaurus specimens, only one has been described to possess any sort of pathology. The specimen in question, consisting of a complete adult skeleton and tentatively assigned to P. mongoliensis, was found in the lower beds of the Yixian Formation. There is no sign of a bone fracture, but very clear signs of an infection can be seen near the midpoint of the right fibula. The bone exhibits a large round pit, evidence of necrosis {{due to a lack of}} blood supply to the region. The pit is surrounded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> amount of swelling along the lower third of the bone. This large amount of bone deposited around the injury indicates that the animal survived for quite a while despite the injury and subsequent infection. As psittacosaurids were bipedal animals, a similar injury to a weight bearing bone in the leg would most likely have been fatal. Unlike the femur and tibia, the fibula is not a weight-bearing bone, so this animal would still have been able to walk to some extent. The source of the injury remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} the fortress' territory along the longitudinal axis. It belongs to the domed basilica type of churches, where the bearings join with the side-chapels of the apse. Two pairs of arches divided the longitudinal stretched prayer hall into three naves, the central one of which (with double side-chapels) on the eastern side ends with low staged, half-rounded apse and the side-chapels end with sacristies. They are characterized with stylish iconography, richness of theme and variety of different colors (where blue is dominant). The vertical axis of the building was crowned <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> dome. The pointed dome with the cylindrical drum has not survived. It was damaged during Tamerlane's invasion and completely demolished in 1784 when the Avar Omar Khan invaded the Transcaucasus from Dagestan. In the 19th century, Viceroy of the Caucasus, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov built a semi-spherical wooden dome covered with iron sheets in place of the original dome. The dome was renovated during Soviet years.|$|E
