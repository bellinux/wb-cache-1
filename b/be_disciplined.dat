5|$|Sloan Gibson, who {{had been}} Acting Secretary between the time of Shinseki's {{resignation}} and McDonald's taking office, is now Deputy Secretary. He said on August 6, 2014 that more punishments were planned for VA officials for their roles in the scandal. The VA announced the week prior to Gibson's statement that two supervisors would be fired and four other employees would <b>be</b> <b>disciplined</b> for their roles in falsifying data in Colorado and Wyoming. The VA previously announced plans to fire three executives at the Phoenix VA. “These were the first in what I expect {{will be a long}} series of announcements of personnel actions,” said Gibson.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian {{architect}} during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, {{which would have been}} unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come. Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period, while opulent, also to <b>be</b> <b>disciplined</b> and almost reined in. Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{consider}} how the female body <b>is</b> <b>disciplined</b> utilizing Foucault’s notion of the panoptic gaze. I build upon his insights concerning societal surveillance by examining how the pregnant body <b>is</b> <b>disciplined</b> to fit into four general categories. I first review literature about pregnant women and find that most scholarship frames pregnant women in four ways: women <b>are</b> <b>disciplined</b> to <b>be</b> commodified, to be selfless, to protect the fetus, and to respond willingly to the medical gaze. I then further this line of inquiry to {{consider how}} the reproductively primed body (i. e., a female that has reached menarche) <b>is</b> <b>disciplined</b> similarly. I {{make the argument that}} the pregnant body and the reproductively primed body <b>are</b> <b>disciplined</b> in order to continue keeping women docile within a body politic. Ultimately, exposing the ways pregnant bodies and reproductively primed bodies <b>are</b> <b>disciplined</b> allows us to consider how we might break or change discipline in order for women to control their own bodies...|$|R

25|$|Churchill, {{the then}} Secretary of State for War, wanted General Dyer to <b>be</b> <b>disciplined,</b> but the Army Council headed by him decided to allow Dyer to resign with no plan for further punishment.

25|$|A {{hearing was}} {{scheduled}} to be held in 2012 to determine whether and how Williams should <b>be</b> <b>disciplined.</b> On November 16, 2011, one of the five Superior Court judges in Williams' circuit district stated Judge Williams had stepped down from her drug court position and would stop hearing criminal cases until the investigation has been completed. Williams continued to work on civil cases previously assigned to her but did not accept new case assignments.|$|E

25|$|A basic ethical {{dilemma is}} that an {{engineer}} has the duty {{to report to the}} appropriate authority a possible risk to others from a client or employer failing to follow the engineer's directions.

An engineer may <b>be</b> <b>disciplined,</b> or have their license revoked, even if the failure to report such a danger does not result in the loss of life or health.|$|E
25|$|Officers were {{attacked}} with plastic bottles, rocks and other projectiles, and responded with tear gas, rubber bullets, and batons, with approximately 146 foam-rubber projectiles fired. Twenty-seven marchers and nine {{members of the}} media were injured, five people were arrested, and at least fifty civilians filed complaints with the LAPD regarding mistreatment by officers. A $13 million settlement was paid over allegations of civil rights violations. Seventeen officers and two sergeants from the Metropolitan Division would eventually <b>be</b> <b>disciplined</b> for their actions.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham clubs often {{featured}} exotic trappings, such as vivid {{lighting and}} murals with tropical or oasis scenes. Some believe these influenced the elements Sun Ra incorporated {{in his later}} stage shows. Playing for the big bands gave black musicians {{a sense of pride}} and togetherness, and they were highly regarded in the black community. They were expected to <b>be</b> <b>disciplined</b> and presentable, and in the segregated South, black musicians had wide acceptance in white society. They often played for elite white society audiences (though they were typically forbidden from associating with the audience).|$|E
50|$|While {{stationed}} in a segregated white section of San Fernando Valley, DuBay became {{very interested in}} the civil rights movement.

25|$|One {{practical}} {{result of}} this among Open Brethren is that, should a member <b>be</b> <b>disciplined</b> in one assembly, other Open assemblies aware of that disciplining would not automatically feel any binding obligation to deny that person participation in their breaking of bread service, {{as long as their}} leadership does not consider whatever caused the disciplinary action a serious issue. A numerically small movement known as the Needed Truth Brethren emerged from the Open Brethren around 1892, partly in an attempt {{to address the problem of}} making discipline more effective.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} was launched {{to determine whether}} any other officers should <b>be</b> <b>disciplined.</b> On January 12, investigation results were forwarded to the district attorney. The investigation, which interviewed seven police officers and 33 other witnesses, came to no conclusion and made no recommendations. The details were forwarded to Meyers Nave, an outside law firm, for an independent investigation. It was led by Jayne Williams, the former city attorney for San Leandro, and was estimated to cost $250,000. In August, the law firm provided two reports to BART but only released one publicly. The report said officers failed to follow recommended procedures, failed {{to work as a}} team, and had lapses in both tactical communication and leadership.|$|E
25|$|Pontesbury was replaced, but in 1522, his successor, Christopher Hunt, {{was accused}} of fornication, as well as {{incompetence}} and negligence. He admitted the fornication but claimed he had already performed penance. Nevertheless, {{he was sent to}} Lilleshall Abbey to <b>be</b> <b>disciplined,</b> and it was said he was much improved on his return. However, Hunt managed to get the abbey into debt by £100, a considerable feat considering its excellent revenues and low running costs. Between 1527 and 1529, he disappeared from the scene and was replaced by Thomas Corveser, who had been his chaplain and one of his sternest critics. Corveser seems to have restored the abbey's finances and reputation. He remained abbot until the dissolution.|$|E

25|$|His {{return to}} cricket came with him being {{appointed}} {{the captain of}} Pakistan. However, he {{had to deal with}} allegations of ball-tampering and a number of controversies. In July 2000 Waqar was banned for ball tampering and was fined 50% of his match fee. He was involved in further controversy during 2003 World Cup matches. In the opening match against Australia, Waqar was removed from the attack after bowling a beamer at Andrew Symonds, becoming the first bowler to <b>be</b> <b>disciplined</b> in such a way during an international match. The Pakistanis then crashed out of the group stage after winning only two matches, both against associate member teams. After the tournament he conceded the captaincy and was dropped from international selection. After a nearly 15-year career, Waqar announced his retirement from cricket altogether in April 2004.|$|E
25|$|In June, {{he became}} the first {{commander}} of the 89th Battalion, part of Sadeh's Armoured Brigade. His methods of recruiting volunteers from other army units, such as the Golani and Kiryati Brigades, provoked complaints from their commanders. On 20 June 1948, two men from one of his companies were killed in a confrontation with Irgun members trying to bring weapons ashore from the Altalena at Kfar Vitkin. During Operation Danny, he led his battalion in a brief raid through Lod in which nine of his men were killed. His battalion was then transferred to the south, where they captured Karatiya, close to Faluja on 15 July. His withdrawal of his troops after only two hours leaving a Givati Company to face an Egyptian counterattack led to Givati Commander Shimon Avidan to demand that Dayan <b>be</b> <b>disciplined</b> for breach of discipline. Chief of Staff Yigael Yadin instructed the military attorney general to proceed, but the case was dismissed.|$|E
25|$|The citizen Draka army {{is made up}} {{of shock}} troops, meant to be used as the arm of {{decision}} in maneuver warfare. These Citizen troops are, to a man (and woman), superb physical specimens, unbelievably strong with startling muscle definition, astonishing stamina and reactions, and are the equal of several elite enemy soldiers, due to their fanatical and relentless dedication to fitness, physical conditioning, endless combat training and diet. Draka men and women are trained for combat from their infancy. Free Draka troops can <b>be</b> <b>disciplined</b> by superior officers for neglecting to keep their physiques and fitness sharply honed to the highest possible standard, although this would be extremely rare, as poor physical conditioning would be seen as an affront to one's family and reputation. Their physical regimen is expected to be maintained in times of relative peace, as the Draka are almost always on a permanent war footing. For attritional warfare, the Domination uses Janissary slave soldiers, who make up 60% of the Draka army. These troops are also quite formidable, and are probably on a par with regular Alliance combatants, although they are less well armed or equipped than their Draka masters or enemy troops. Draka soldiers neither ask nor give quarter—all captured enemies are killed, permanently enslaved or on very rare occasions used as hostages to trade for serfs and Janissaries captured by the enemy or Citizen troops who for some reason have been unable to take their own lives to avoid capture, perhaps through injury because Draka are never willingly captured alive. Several of the books' characters, however, do pay professional, if not personal, respect {{from time to time to}} the bravery, skill and tenacity of enemy troops they encounter, and if the enemy's equipment doesn't always impress, the Draka occasionally acknowledge their good use of it.|$|E

He prefers to employ a 4–3–3 formation, explaining it allows his teams to play entertaining football and makes them hard to beat, and it brought him success when at Tamworth and York. He has stuck with this formation despite charges from some of being tactically stubborn, saying: [...] "I'm not going to change the way my teams play, the systems.

500|$|With {{the highly}} publicized Army–McCarthy {{hearings}} of 1954, {{and following the}} suicide of Wyoming Senator Lester C. Hunt that same year, McCarthy's support and popularity faded.

McCarthy died at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland on May 2, 1957, at the age of 48. His death certificate listed the cause of death as [...] "Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown".

500|$|Sandoval's {{first days}} in the majors were marked by a {{tendency}} to free swing.

[...] "As much as I try to get him to <b>be</b> <b>disciplined,</b> it's like caging a lion. He leaves the dugout ready to swing the bat. I literally tell him before every at-bat, 'Swing at a strike.'" [...] Sandoval himself characterized his approach as [...] "See ball, swing." [...] In July 2009, he was named a Sprint Final Vote candidate for the 80th annual All-Star Game for the final roster spot on the National League team. He was edged by Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies on the last day of voting.|$|E
