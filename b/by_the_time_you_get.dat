500|$|Sahar Ghosh from Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{felt that}} the best songs on the EP were [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer", saying that [...] "the lyrics Madonna sang in 2001 [...] still (unfortunately) ring true today, but they acquire a new poignancy as they are sung by the boys in Glee Club. [...] But the best {{performance}} of the album is definitely 'Like a Prayer'. The talented voices of the Glee cast, backed by a full choir, masterfully carry the lyrics to greater heights." [...] Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly gave it an [...] "A" [...] rating, explaining [...] "Sue hilariously revises the spoken-word bit on 'Vogue', and the Glee guys give a surprisingly tender reading of 'What It Feels Like for a Girl'. Go ahead— open your heart." [...] David Hiltbrand from Star Tribune gave a negative review of the EP saying that [...] "things go downhill as soon as Jane Lynch starts camping up the spoken portion of 'Vogue'. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to 'Like a Virgin' and '4 Minutes', the songs sound overproduced and melodramatic, more show tune than disco." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} from July 1993 to September 1993 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington, as according to Cornell [...] "there {{was never a}} decent studio in Seattle and now there's one with a Neve console, so it seemed obvious to use it". Bad Animals' resident engineer Adam Kasper, {{who went on to}} produce Soundgarden's following albums, assisted Beinhorn on the recording process. Soundgarden took the approach of recording one song at a time. The drum and bass parts were recorded first for each song, and then Cornell and Thayil would lay down their parts over top. Cornell said that getting to know Beinhorn contributed to the length of time Soundgarden spent working on the album. The band spent time experimenting with different drum and guitar sounds, as well as utilizing techniques such as layering, resulting in an expansive production sound. Cornell said, [...] "Michael Beinhorn was so into sounds. He was so, almost, anal about it, that it took the piss out of us a lot of the time... <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the sounds that you want to record the song, you're sick and tired of playing it." [...] Beinhorn tried to add many of his preferred musicians to mold the band's sound, in what Billboard described as [...] "weaning the band from brute force, giving it the impetus to invest in a more subtle power". For instance, prior to recording the vocals of [...] "Black Hole Sun", Beinhorn made Cornell listen to Frank Sinatra.|$|E
2500|$|On December 19, Duty offered Wise some {{cigarettes}} {{in exchange for}} allowing himself to be tied up to make the guards think {{that he had been}} taken hostage, with the goal of having Duty transferred into administrative security. The prosecutor's report stated that after tying Wise's hands and feet behind his back, Duty strangled him to death with a shoelace. Duty then wrote a letter to Wise's mother Mary, in which he stated: [...] "Well <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> this letter you will already know that your son is dead. I know now because I just killed him an hour ago. Gee you'd think I'd be feeling some remorse but I'm not." [...] The letter was intercepted at the prison.|$|E

2500|$|Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald {{gave the}} film one star, commenting, [...] "There are enough laughs {{scattered}} throughout A Million Ways to Die in the West that while you're watching it, the movie {{seems like a}} passable comedy. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> home, though, you can barely remember the jokes." [...] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film's running time: [...] "Though the film is hardly laugh-free, its uneven jokes appear to have breezed through a very forgiving editing process." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal too found the film's length [...] "exhausting," [...] noting, [...] "Some of it sputters, settling for smiles instead of laughs, {{and much of it}} flounders while the slapdash script searches [...] for ever more common denominators in toilet humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} Albarn went to Mali, {{he was taken}} to a {{landfill}} where he saw people [...] "taking every little bit, a little bit of fabric to the fabric regenerators, or the metal and the cans to the ironsmiths and the aluminium recyclers, and it goes on and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to the road, they're selling stuff." [...] When Albarn went to a landfill outside London to record the sound of seagulls for the album, he noticed a [...] between the way the two countries dealt with rubbish. [...] "They've got more snakes... like adders, grass snakes, slow worms, toads, frogs, newts, all kinds of rodents, all kinds of squirrels, a massive number of squirrels, foxes, and obviously, seagulls. [...] This is part of the new ecology. And for the first time I saw the world in a new way. I've always felt, I'm trying to get across on this new record, the idea that plastic, we see it as being against nature but it's come out of nature. We didn't create plastic, nature created plastic. And just seeing the snakes like living in the warmth of decomposing plastic bags. They like it. It was a strange kind of optimism that I felt... but trying to get that into pop music is a challenge, anyway. But important." ...|$|E
