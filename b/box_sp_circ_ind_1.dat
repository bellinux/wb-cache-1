40|$|In {{order to}} model the {{transport}} and fate of aniline and chloroaniline in the subsurface, the geochemical reactions between these contaminants and important metals and minerals surfaces must be quantified. The thermodynamic stabilities of the aqueous and surface aluminum-aniline and aluminum- 2 -chloroaniline complexes were investigated at 55 $ sp circ$C and 80 $ sp circ$C. Solubility and adsorption experiments place quantitative constraints on the thermodynamic properties of these complexes. No evidence was found for stable Al-aniline or Al- 2 -chloroaniline aqueous complexes. Conversely, the adsorption data provide unequivocal evidence {{for the presence of}} two distinct surface Al-aniline and A-chloroaniline complexes according to the following reactions: (1) $Aniline <b>sp</b> <b>circ</b> + { equiv}Al(OH) <b>sp</b> <b>circ</b> leftrightarrow { equiv}(AlOH(Aniline) sp circ$; (2) $Aniline <b>sp</b> <b>circ</b> + { equiv}Al(O) sp- leftrightarrow { equiv}AlO(Aniline) sp-$; (3) $Chloroaniline <b>sp</b> <b>circ</b> + { equiv}Al(OH) <b>sp</b> <b>circ</b> leftrightarrow { equiv}AlOH(Chloroaniline) sp circ$; (4) $Chloroaniline <b>sp</b> <b>circ</b> + { equiv}Al(OH sb 2) sp+ leftrightarrow { equiv}AlOH sb 2 (Chloroaniline) sp+$.

Inverted diagenesis occurs in northwest part of the Chaudiere Nappe, indicating the Chaudiere Nappe underwent pre-orogenic deep burial diagenesis (maximum burial of 7 km) at the original depositional site. To the southeast, the diagenetic pattern was affected by later synorogenic heating. Within the east-dipping thrust-fold belt and the St. Lawrence Lowlands, increasing grade towards southwest along strike suggests a gradual southwestward increase in post-Taconian burial depth (4. 5 - 7 km) with paleogeothermal gradients of 33 - 37 $ sp circ$C/km. Narrow (3 - 5 km) thermal halos around the Cretaceous Monteregian intrusions show limited thermal effects of these plutons on their country rocks. Maximum burial depth and paleogeothermal gradients were determined from fluid inclusion trapping temperatures and pressures, and from organic reflectance.

The main goals are: (i) Resolution of several {{issues related to}} steady, two-dimensional, laminar natural convection in pure water near its density inversion temperature; and (ii) development, testing, and demonstration of a nonintrusive experimental/numerical method for the determination of interfacial heat flux distributions in steady, two-dimensional, pure water-ice systems. Attention was found on pure water and water-ice systems contained in a long cylindrical enclosure of square cross-section. One wall was maintained at a constant temperature equal to or less than $ 0 sp circ$C; the opposite wall was maintained at a constant temperature above the density inversion temperature of water; the other two walls of the cross-section were essentially adiabatic. Several angles of inclination, $ Theta,$ of the hot and cold walls, {{with respect to the}} gravitational acceleration vector, were considered: $ Theta = 0 <b>sp</b> <b>circ,</b> 30 <b>sp</b> <b>circ,</b> 45 <b>sp</b> circ,$ and ${-} 45 <b>sp</b> <b>circ.</b> $ For these conditions, the natural convection in water is governed by three nondimensional parameters: the Rayleigh number, Ra; a density inversion parameter, R; and the Prandtl number, Pr. The following ranges of these parameters were investigated: $ 10 sp 3 le Ra le 3. 37 times 10 sp 7; 0. 1 le R le 0. 9;$ and $ 6. 74 le Pr le 12. 4. $A complete rig was designed and constructed. The water-ice interface positions were obtained using shadowgraphy and computer-aided image processing techniques. In the complementary numerical work, a staggered-grid finite volume method (FVM) and a co-located, equal-order, control-volume finite element method (CVFEM) were formulated and used. In the first investigation, variable- and constant-property models (VPM and CPM) were used. Results of the VPM and CPM were found to be similar, except when the values of R are in the vicinity of 0. 5, where significant differences in the flow patterns, but only minor changes in the overall Nusselt number, $ overline{Nu},$ were observed. It was demonstrated that the fluid flow is extremely sensitive to changes in the value of R in the vincinity of 0. 5. A correlation that gives the $ overline{Nu}$ as a function of Ra and R has been proposed for the vertical enclosure $(Theta = 0 <b>sp</b> <b>circ).</b> $In the proposed experimental/numerical technique to determine the interfacial heat flux distributions, the interface position obtained by the shadowgraphy and image processing techniques was used as an input to the CVFEM. The CVFEM was then used to solve the heat conduction problem in the ice and obtain the interfacial heat flux distribution. It was found that if the raw digitized interface position data are directly inputted to the CVFEM simulations of heat conduction in the ice, the interfacial heat flux distributions exhibit physically untenable fluctuations. The reasons for this difficulty were identified and successfully overcome using appropriate data filtering techniques. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Gene {{activation}} by NF-κB/Rel transcription {{factors is}} modulated by synergistic or antagonistic interactions with other promoter-bound transcription factors. For example, Sp 1 sites are {{often found in}} NF-κB-regulated genes, and Sp 1 can activate certain promoters in synergism with NF-κB through nonoverlapping binding sites.

Fourteen parasitoid and three hyperparasitoid species (12 Hymenoptera, 2 Diptera) were identified. The most important parasitoid, Cotesia rubecula, is a larval parasitoid of A. rapae that is newly established in Quebec. Overall, parasitism of lepidopterous eggs is almost not existent, whereas parasitism and infection of larvae and pupae by pathogens are important, but not significant to reduce butterfly populations. In order to evaluate the potential of oophagous parasitoids, the parasitism of up to 42 species/strains of Trichogramma was studied with different development stages of P. xylostella, A. rapae and T. ni eggs.

During greisenization, the leucogranite was converted into quartz-sericite greisen through sequential replacement of K-feldspar and albite. Muscovite was replaced by topaz to form quartz-topaz greisen, host to sulphide and cassiterite mineralization. In this greisen, the OH$ sp-$ of muscovite is replaced by H$ sb 2 $O and O$ sp{ 2 -},$ which leads to its dehydration during microprobe analyses. Close to veins, suphides and cassiterite were re-dissolved in quartz greisen.

Treatment sludges were characterized physically (e. g., solids content, settling rate, etc.), chemically and morphologically, while the treated effluent was examined for residual iron(III) content.

Eliminating this CCTCCT sequence results in a marked reduction in promoter activity, suggesting a necessary role in IL- 10 gene expression. Despite its dissimilarity to the G + C-rich Sp 1 consensus sequence (GC <b>box),</b> <b>Sp</b> 1 and Sp 3 transcription factors could be shown to bind to this motif. The requirement for Sp 1 and Sp 3 in transcription of IL- 10 was confirmed using Drosophila SL 2 cells, which lack endogenous Sp factors.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} maximal promoter activity of the gene for extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK 2; also known as p 42 mitogen-activated protein kinase) resides in the 371 bp 5 '-flanking sequence. In the present study we defined roles for a CCAAT box and two adjacent GC boxes in the activity of this promoter. Deletion analysis and DNase I footprinting of this 371 bp region indicated that the CCAAT box at - 64 and GC boxes at - 86 and - 39 are crucial for promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed that transcription factor NF-Y/CBF binds to the CCAAT <b>box.</b> <b>Sp</b> 1 and Sp 3, members of the Sp family of transcription factors, bind to the GC boxes of the ERK 2 promoter. The binding of Sp 3 was predominant over that of Sp 1. Disruption by mutation {{of any of the}} CCAAT box and GC boxes similarly decreased promoter activity. These three cis elements exhibited a moderate synergy in promoter function. The transactivating role of NF-Y was corroborated by the finding that a dominant-negative form of NF-YA diminished the promoter activity. These results provide clues for refining our understanding of not only the regulation of expression of the gene for ERK 2 but also mechanisms by which NF-Y and Sp 1 /Sp 3 regulate transcription...|$|R

Patterns were assessed over 14 months in groups of 10 rams and ewes, half of which received E$ sb 2 $ replacement (Silastic implants) {{at the time of}} gonadectomy to maintain blood E$ sb 2 $ at ram breeding-season values. Mean monthly PRL level (based on two 3 -h periods of blood sampling) was consistently elevated by E$ sb 2 $ in the ram (mean 19 %), and during all but a few months {{in the spring and summer}} in the ewes (mean 90 %). Sex differences in the mean PRL were most apparent for the E$ sb 2 $-treated sheep in August (rams 280 $ pm$ 54 ng/ml vs ewes 128 $ pm$ 18 ng/ml) and for the control sheep in November (rams 19 $ pm$ 5 ng/ml vs ewes 10 $ pm$ 2 ng/ml). Episodic PRL secretion (with 5 -min sampling for 4 h) was assessed in every season. In all four groups, pulse amplitude and frequency and basal level were higher in summer than winter. E$ sb 2 $ treatment was associated with larger PRL pulses in both sexes in every season but summer, and with decreased (from 8. 2 to 4. 6 per 4 h) and increased (from 2. 2 to 6. 6 per 4 h) frequencies of pulses in rams in the spring and summer, respectively. The PRL response to TRH (two iv injections 50 ng/kg BW given 80 min apart) was also assessed in every season. Mean 40 -min increases after injection were highest in spring and summer. E$ sb 2 $ treatment produced in both sexes a 2 - 3 fold larger increment 1 in every season, and increment 2 in specific seasons.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{performance}} of the plane parallel model in analyzing satellite measurements of clouds, and to examine what role 3 D cloud effects may play in explaining any discrepancies. Direct comparisons between one year of Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) scanner radiances and plane parallel model calculations are carried out under different Sun-Earth-satellite viewing configurations over ocean between 30 $ sp circ$N and 30 $ sp circ$S. When the plane parallel model calculations are matched to observations at nadir on a pixel-by-pixel basis by adjusting cloud fraction and cloud optical depth, the resulting frequency distributions of cloud optical depth show a systematic shift towards larger values with increasing solar zenith angle, regardless of what assumptions are made in the calculations. On average, this increase in cloud optical depth is extremely large for solar zenith angles $ sbsp{ tilde}{>}$ 63 $ <b>sp</b> <b>circ.</b> $ For the thinnest 50 % of the clouds, the increase only occurs at very oblique sun angles, whereas it is observed at all solar zenith angles for the thickest 10 % of clouds. The cause is traced to a fundamental flaw in plane parallel theory when applied to real clouds: at nadir the solar zenith angle dependence of model reflectance is opposite to that of the observations. On average, differences between observed and plane parallel model reflectances are found to be less sensitive to view and relative azimuth angle than to solar zenith angle. For solar zenith angles less than ${ approx} 63 sp circ,$ plane parallel model reflectances are within $ approx$ 10 % of the observations. As solar zenith angle increases, differences between the observations and calculations increase at all view angles. At lower sun elevations, observed reflectances exceed plane parallel values by a constant amount at all view angles in the backscattering direction, while plane parallel model reflectances show a different view angle dependence from that observed in the forward direction. When comparisons are performed as a function of relative azimuth angle, no appreciable dependence in the reflectance difference is observed. Violation of the principle of reciprocity applied to real observations is shown to be mainly caused by the systematic difference in the solar zenith angle dependence between observations and plane parallel calculations. Monte Carlo simulations involving stochastic, isotropic, scale-invariant broken cloud fields are carried out in order to show that, qualitatively, differences between observed and plane parallel reflectances are generally consistent with 3 D theory. While much of the discrepancy between 3 D and 1 D reflectances can be attributed to the presence of cloud sides, affecting the illuminated cloud area, it is shown that the slope of the illuminated cloud top surfaces may also play an important role...|$|R
40|$|The UL 3 protein of equine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (EHV- 1) KyA strain is a homolog of the ICP 27 alpha {{regulatory protein}} of {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV- 1) and the ORF 4 protein of varicella-zoster virus. To characterize the regulatory function of the UL 3 gene product, a UL 3 gene expression vector (pSVUL 3) and a vector expressing a truncated version of the UL 3 gene (pSVUL 3 P) were generated. These effector plasmids, in combination with an EHV- 1 immediate-early (IE) gene expression vector (pSVIE) and chimeric EHV- 1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter constructs, were used in transient transfection assays. These assays demonstrated that the EHV- 1 UL 3 gene product is a regulatory protein that can independently trans activate the EHV- 1 IE promoter; however, this effect can be inhibited by the repressive function of the IE gene product on the IE promoter (R. H. Smith, G. B. Caughman, and D. J. O'Callaghan, J. Virol. 66 : 936 - 945, 1992). In {{the presence of the}} IE gene product, the UL 3 gene product significantly augments gene expression directed by the promoters of three EHV- 1 early genes (thymidine kinase; IR 4, which is the homolog of HSV- 1 ICP 22; and UL 3 [ICP 27]) and the promoter of the EHV- 1 late gene IR 5, which is the homolog of HSV- 1 US 10. Sequences located at nucleotides - 123 to + 20 of the UL 3 promoter harbor a TATA <b>box,</b> <b>SP</b> 1 binding site, CAAT box, and octamer binding site and, when linked to the CAT reporter gene, are trans activated to maximal levels by the pSVIE construct in transient expression assays.

40|$|The {{isothermal}} crystallization kinetics, spherulite morphology, {{and thermal}} {{behavior of the}} melt-crystallized optically active R and S polyenantiomers, their blends, and the stereoblock form of poly(epichlorohydrin) (PECH) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPrO) have been investigated using polarized light microscopy (PLOM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The novel optically pure polyenantiomers of PECH were synthesized from the optically active monomers using a triethylaluminum$ cdot$water (1 : 0. 6) catalyst, which was also used in the polymerization of the racemic monomer to an isotactic crystalline stereoblock fraction. The optically pure polyenantiomers and the stereoblock form of PPrO were obtained by the quantitative dechlorination reaction of the corresponding PECH polymers, using LiAlH$ sb 4 $, with retention of configuration of the main chain chiral centers. The spherulite radial growth rates of the melt-crystallized PECH equimolar polyenantiomer blend are depressed relative to those of either optically pure components over the range of crystallization temperatures from the glass transition temperature ($T sb{ rm g} = - 26 sp circ$C) to the equilibrium melting temperature ($T sb{ rm m} <b>sp</b> <b>circ</b> = 138 <b>sp</b> circ$C), which were determined {{to be the same}} for all of the PECH polymers. A further marked reduction in growth rates is recorded for the stereoblock polymer. Conversion of the PECH polyenantiomers to PPrO results in an overall order of magnitude increase in the spherulite radial growth rates. The growth rates of the PPrO stereoblock are only slightly depressed relative to those of either optically pure polyenantiomer over the range of crystallization temperatures from $T sb{ rm g}({-} 65 sp circ$C) to $T sb{ rm m} sp circ(82 sp circ$C), which were determined to be the same for all of the PPrO polymers. An analysis of the linear spherulite radial growth rates of the PECH polymers in terms of the Hoffman-Lauritzen treatment gives evidence of a rougher lamellar fold surface in the stereoblock polymer than in the polyenantiomers, but suggests similar surface free energies among the polyenantiomers and stereoblock form of PPrO. The multiple melting behavior exhibited by the different forms of PECH is greatly dependent on DSC heating rate and isothermal crystallization time, for samples crystallized at low temperatures and high temperatures, respectively. The behavior is demonstrated to be due to reorganization during the DSC heating scan in the former case, and linked to the process of secondary crystallization in the latter. The optically pure polyenantiomers, their equimolar blend, and the stereoblock form of PPrO exhibit regularly banded spherulites, observed using PLOM. In contrast, only the optically active polyenantiomers of PECH form banded spherulites, whereas the equimolar polyenantiomer blend and the stereoblock display nonbanded, coarser spherulites. The birefringent extinction banding pattern of the PECH optically pure polyenantiomer spherulites corresponds directly to the surface topography mapped by AFM: Regularly alternating concentric ridges and valleys indicate the edges and the fold surfaces, respectively, of the radiating helicoidal lamellae. The direction or "sense" of an apparent surface spiral pattern of a banded spherulite is directly dependent on the chiral sense of the constituent polyenantiomer. It is suggested that the effects of the backbone chirality are being transmitted {{to the level of the}} gross spherulite morphology. On the basis of the observed differences in crystallization kinetics and spherulite morphology among the well characterized PECH polymers, a mechanism of stereospecific segregation at the growth front is proposed...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are {{promising}} anticancer drugs. Although some HDACi {{have entered the}} clinic, the mechanism(s) underlying their tumor selectivity are poorly understood. Experimental Design/Results: Using gene expression analysis, we define a core set of 6 genes commonly regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and cell lines. c-Myc, the most prominently modulated, is preferentially altered in leukemia. Upon HDACi treatment, c-Myc is acetylated at lysine 323 and its expression decreases, leading to TRAIL activation and apoptosis. c-Myc binds to the TRAIL promoter on the proximal GC <b>box</b> through <b>Sp</b> 1 or Miz 1, impairing TRAIL activation. HDACi exposure triggers TRAIL expression, altering c-Myc-TRAIL binding. These events do not occur in normal cells. Excitingly, this inverse correlation between TRAIL and c-Myc is supported by HDACi treatment ex vivo of AML blasts and primary human breast cancer cells. The predictive value of c-Myc to HDACi responsiveness is confirmed in vivo in AML patients undergoing HDACi-based clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings identify a key role for c-Myc in TRAIL deregulation and as a biomarker of the anticancer action of HDACi in AML. The potential improved patient stratification could pave the way towards personalized therapies...|$|R
