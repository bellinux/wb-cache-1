5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen an unexpected attack on Bannerman Road, from an unknown alien species. Sarah Jane would have disappeared along with several other residents. It would have <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> Clyde, Rani and Luke to stop the Alien.|$|E
5|$|If the {{election}} had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the papacy, Ernst {{would have been}} the choice, but the Pope was {{not a member of the}} Cathedral Chapter and Gebhard had the support of several of the Catholic, and all the Protestant, canons in the Chapter. In December 1577, he was chosen Elector and Archbishop of Cologne after a spirited contest with the papacy's candidate, Ernst: Gebhard won {{the election}} by two votes. Although it was not required of him, Gebhard agreed to undergo priestly ordination; he was duly consecrated in March 1578, and swore to uphold the Council of Trent's decrees.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Fisher, {{exhausted}} by the constant pressure, returned to Moscow for six months of rest and recuperation, leaving Häyhänen in charge. While in Moscow, Fisher informed his superiors of his dissatisfaction with Häyhänen. Upon his return to New York in 1956, he found that his carefully constructed network had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> disintegrate in his absence. Fisher checked his drop points only to find messages several months old, while Häyhänen's radio transmissions had routinely been sent from the same location using incorrect radio frequencies. The money Häyhänen received from the KGB to support the network was instead spent on alcohol and prostitutes.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> our {{imagination}} to paint for us {{a picture of}} this weeping; it <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> us to conclude that these precious tears were symbolical of the grief of Italy herself; that the catastrophe that provoked them must have been terrible indeed.|$|R
5|$|The ruling {{has been}} criticized for its {{intrusion}} into state affairs and its basis in previous rulings. Prior to Santosky, the realm of family life had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the states. Because of this, Santoskys direct intervention into the affairs of state interests was seen as contrary to United States v. Yazell, which held that federal courts should only overturn state statutes when those statutes cannot adequately serve a clear and substantial federal interest.|$|E
5|$|The stolen Ford Escort {{belonged to}} a man from Portadown, who {{according}} to Captain Fred Holroyd, had links {{with one of the}} UVF bombers and the driver of the bomb car which had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> explode in Parnell Street, Dublin on 17 May 1974. He {{was also one of the}} prime suspects in the sectarian killing of Dorothy Traynor on 1 April 1975 in Portadown.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{begins with}} Tommy Brock, a badger, being entertained by old Mr. Bouncer, {{the father of}} Benjamin Bunny. Mr. Bouncer has <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> tend his grandchildren while his son and daughter-in-law Flopsy are away, but, after smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, he falls asleep in Tommy's company. Tommy puts the bunnies in his sack and slips out. When the parents return, Benjamin sets off {{in pursuit of the}} thief.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham School of Art, {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the School of Art, Laura met {{one of the most promising}} students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, and determined that the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique. They became friends, and married in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Richard's son, Edmund {{took over}} the earldom in 1278 but had little {{interest}} in Lydford, preferring Restormel and Lostwithiel; by his death in 1299 the castle had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> decay and was in ruins. It reverted to the Crown, and when Edward II made his royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, the Earl of Cornwall in 1307, Lydford Castle was passed to him. The castle was repaired {{at the start of the}} century and was in use once again as a prison. Edward II and Gaveston fell from power in 1327 and Thomas le Ercedekne was temporarily entrusted with the castle and Dartmoor by the new regime. In 1329 the castle was valued at a little over £11. Piers Gaveston's widow, Margaret de Clare, leased the property to Tavistock Abbey, and it continued to operate as a prison.|$|E
5|$|Wizards & Warriors III: Kuros: Visions of Power {{takes place}} {{immediately}} after the events {{at the end of}} the previous game, , when Kuros has defeated his nemesis, the evil wizard Malkil, on the peak of IceFire Mountain. Unaware that Malkil's spirit has survived, Kuros is struck by a bolt of magic from the spirit, knocking him out and removing his armor, memory, and honor. A weakened Malkil then flees and takes refuge in the peaceful city of Piedup, where he dethrones Good King James and takes control of the city. Meanwhile, Kuros has <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> wander in the wilderness without any weapons, armor, or food. After wandering for several months, he finally reaches the city of Piedup, where Malkil's spirit lies. While in the city, Kuros assumes several disguises of wizard, knight, and thief, in order to travel through town undetected and build strength and skill, rescue damsels, and prepare for his battle with Malkil.|$|E

5|$|From the Lindley Library, Stearn (see 1950 Photograph) {{moved to}} the Botany Department at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington in 1952, {{and by the time}} he retired in 1976, he was the Senior Principal Scientific Officer there. He had now {{achieved}} his aim of becoming a research scientist, despite lack of formal qualifications, enabling him to spend more of his time collecting and studying plants. During this time the Museum was undergoing steady expansion, with new staff and programmes. At the Museum he was put in charge of Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the Dicotyledons in the Bentham & Hooker system, i.e. Monochlamydae) and floristic treatment of the regions of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including work on the Museum's Flora of Jamaica and the Nepal flora he started work on during the war. Seven volumes of the Flora of Jamaica had appeared prior to the Second World War. Although the project was revived after the war, and Stearn carried out six months of field work in Jamaica, it never came to fruition; no further volumes appeared. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the footsteps of Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), whose collection had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the Natural History Museum. Stearn's generic work at the museum concentrated on Allium, Lilium and Paeonia. He continued to travel widely, with field work in Europe (particularly Greece), Australia, and the United States, and published 200 papers during his twenty-four years at the Museum, and although the library was not his responsibility, he spent much time there adding written notes to many of the critical texts.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Kronan began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright Francis Sheldon frequently came {{in conflict with}} the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators complained that he was unduly delaying the project and was spending too much time on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the problem was that the timber had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.|$|E
25|$|While {{previously}} many farms {{had their}} own seters, today it is more usual for several farmers to share a modernized common seter (fellesseter). Most of the old seters have <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> decay or are used as recreational cabins.|$|E

25|$|According to John Grimes, a {{professor}} of Indian philosophy, Indian thought denied even dogmatic idolatry of its scriptures.

25|$|The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) {{was created}} on February 18, 1890, in Washington by a {{convention}} that merged the NWSA and the AWSA.

The company later became Pioneer Hi-Bred, a major agriculture corporation. It was acquired in 1999 by the DuPont Corporation for approximately $10 billion.|$|E
