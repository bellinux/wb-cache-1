40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In its November 2011 report, CMS presented three options for removing SSNs from Medicare cards. One option would truncate the SSN so that only the last four digits would appear on the card. However, the full SSN {{would continue to be}} used by both beneficiaries and providers for all Medicare business transactions. The other two options would replace the display of the SSN on the Medicare card with a newly developed identifier that CMS calls the Medicare <b>Beneficiary</b> <b>Identifier</b> (MBI). In one of these options, this new identifier would be used by the beneficiary in their interactions with CMS; however, the provider would continue to use the SSN to interact with CMS. In the other, both the beneficiary and provider would use the new identifier printed on the Medicare card and the SSN would be entirely excluded from the transaction. CMS, SSA, and RRB reported that all three options would generally require similar efforts, including coordinating with stakeholders; converting information-technology (IT) systems; conducting provider and beneficiary outreach and education; conducting training of business partners; and issuing new cards. While the level and type of modifications required to IT systems would vary under each option, the one involving use of a new identifier by both beneficiaries and providers would require somewhat more-extensive IT modifications. However, CMS has not committed to implementing any of the three options presented in its report. Nor did CMS consider other options in its 2011 report, such as how machine-readable technologies, including bar codes, magnetic stripes, or smart chips, could assist in the effort to remove SSNs from Medicare cards. CMS officials told us that they limited their options to those retaining the basic format of the current paper card, and did not consider options that they believed were outside the scope of the congressional request. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) [...] which is the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for administering Medicare [...] has not taken needed steps, such as designating a business owner and establishing a business case for an information technology (IT) project, {{that would result in}} selecting and implementing a technical solution for removing Social Security numbers (SSN) from Medicare cards. However, the agency has collected information and data as part of its most recent study of SSN removal that could contribute to the identification and development of an IT solution. These include information relevant to examining alternative approaches, identifying costs and risks, and assessing the impact of different approaches on the agency's existing IT systems. For example, the agency identified two approaches for removing the SSN: (1) replacing it with a new identifier, referred to as the Medicare <b>Beneficiary</b> <b>Identifier,</b> and (2) masking the first five digits of the SSN for display on Medicare cards. CMS system and business owners also conducted high-level assessments of the types of changes that would need to be made to systems identified in the agency's IT inventory. For example, system owners estimated the level of complexity of the changes, the number of hours of work at each life-cycle phase, business and technical risks, and the potential to leverage related efforts. CMS noted in its most recent study that replacing the SSN with a new identifier could reduce the risk of identity theft from a lost or stolen card, and actions taken thus far could inform a future IT project to address SSN removal. However, according to CMS officials, agency leadership has not directed them to initiate such a project. Until such a project is undertaken, the agency will not be positioned to identify or implement a solution to support the removal of SSNs from beneficiaries' cards. ...|$|E
