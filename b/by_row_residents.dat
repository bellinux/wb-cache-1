40|$|Taking {{the notion}} of {{transgression}} – the breaking of boundaries – as its starting point, this book brings a fresh approach to cultural criminology by exploring representations of the transgressive in fictive texts and ethnographic research. Chapters focus on topics of urgent contemporary interest, including school shooters, violent female avengers, sex workers, those labelled 'mad', serial killers, asylum seekers and skid <b>row</b> <b>residents.</b> The book is interdisciplinary in scope, blending insights from film and media studies, literary criticism and psycho-social analysis with cultural criminology. It also presents cutting edge, participatory arts-based ethnography {{carried out in the}} UK and Canada...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if planting cotton into the space between the previous year's rows reduces crop loss due to Meloidogyne incognita compared to planting in the same row every year. Row placement had a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) effect on nematode population levels only on 8 July 2005. Plots receiving 1, 3 -dichloropropene plus aldicarb had lower nematode population levels than non-fumigated plots on 24 May and 8 July in 2005, but not in 2004. The effect of nematicide treatment on nematode populations was not affected <b>by</b> <b>row</b> placement. Row placement did not have a significant effect on root galling or yield in 2004 or 2005. Nematicide treatment decreased root galling in all years, and the decrease was not influenced <b>by</b> <b>row</b> placement. Yield was increased by nematicide application in 2004 and 2005, and the increase was not affected <b>by</b> <b>row</b> placement. Percentage yield loss was not affected <b>by</b> <b>row</b> placement. Changing the placement of rows reduced nematode population levels only on one sampling date in one year, but end-of-season root galling and lint yield were not affected by changing the placement of rows, nor was the effect of fumigation on yield influenced <b>by</b> <b>row</b> placement. Therefore, row placement is unlikely to contribute to M. incognita management in cotton...|$|R
