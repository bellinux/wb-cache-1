5000|$|Madame Aphrodite is {{essentially}} a modern fable built around the aphorism that beauty is more than skin deep. The titular Madame Aphrodite (Nancy Andrews), described as [...] "a bitter recluse", lived alone in a dingy apartment. Working from her kitchen, she manufactured a phony <b>beauty</b> <b>cream</b> using unpleasant and ineffective ingredients, which she planned to sell to her neighbours as revenge for what she perceived as meaness towards her. [...] To help distribute the phony product, Madame Aphrodite hired an attractive but naive young man named Barney (Jack Drummond) as her salesman. Believing the cream to have genuine magical powers, Barney sells it to a shy young girl, Rosemary (Cherry Davis), who becomes attracted to him. The rather plain Rosemary believes that she is being trandsformed into a beauty, and attributes this to the phony product. [...] Madame Aphrodite, touched by the girl's innocence, confesses that the <b>beauty</b> <b>cream</b> is a hoax, and {{points out that the}} change in Rosemary's demeanor was, in fact, due to her love for the likeable Barney. Madame Aphrodite further reveals that she sold the cream to take revenge on womankind because, as a child, she herself had been duped by an advertisement for a fake beauty product. The show concludes with her moment of self-realisation, where [...] "another life has been saved on Second Avenue".|$|E

Zedd was furious that Rita had failed to defeat [...] "children" [...] and conquer the Earth, even when Rita warned him about Zordon. Despite Rita's begging and pleading, Lord Zedd vaporized Rita's magic wand and shrank her down {{to the size of a}} toy before again exiling her into space in a space dumpster. Locked within a space dumpster, Rita came within inches of freedom when her dumpster came to Earth, and Bulk and Skull succeeded in opening the dumpster. But the Power Rangers were successful in sending Rita back into space. Eventually her dumpster crashed into the moon, and she escaped. Down but not out, after regaining her freedom, Rita sought assistance from Finster, her still loyal henchman, to concoct a love potion that would generate libidic feelings for use on Lord Zedd. She also used a <b>beauty</b> <b>cream</b> made by Finster over her face to become younger (serving to transition the actress from Soga to Perez). The love potion worked, and the two were then married. Once married to Lord Zedd, Rita eventually gave up her magic practices and worked alongside Lord Zedd as a partner in crime. Zedd and Rita attempted to defeat the Rangers, using clones of the Rangers and time-travel, and though they each failed, the Rangers did not claim victory so easily.|$|E

50|$|By 2000, one of Jack's former {{lovers and}} Victor's latest ex-wife, Diane Jenkins (Alex Donnelley) steals Victor's sperm from a sperm bank, though Nikki {{switches}} the sample with Jack's sperm. Ashley then steals Victor's sperm and impregnates herself, {{claiming that the}} father is a stranger; this was {{to make up for}} the abortion she had years prior. She then marries Brad Carlton and gives birth to Abby Carlton, who is raised to believe she is the daughter of Brad. Ashley is diagnosed with breast cancer, and feeling that she may not have time left, she confesses the truth about Abby's paternity to Victor. Brad and Ashley split, though are brought together when she becomes pregnant with their child. Stress over the battle between Jabot and Newman Enterprises causes her to leave town.

Tom Fisher (Roscoe Born), the dangerous ex-husband of John's wife Gloria Abbott (Judith Chapman), arrives in town. To protect his family, John shoots and kills Tom. Ashley covers this up by confessing to the crime herself, though John soon confesses himself, and is jailed for seven years.

30|$|The use of {{cosmetics}} by Bangladeshi {{women is}} an ancient tradition. They believe that cosmetics help them to improve their features and cover the blemishes of the skin. A survey, conducted by Environment and Social Development Organization (ESDO) Bangladesh, reported {{that there are so}} many toxic chemicals present in both imported and exported beauty products of Bangladesh which is so alarming for human health and environment. However, there are very few reports published about the heavy metal concentration in Bangladeshi cosmetics. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study in Bangladesh regarding the study of heavy metal contents in the <b>beauty</b> <b>cream</b> samples and also calculated the possible health risk assessment. As the use of cosmetic products is increasing rapidly in Bangladesh and various chemicals including the heavy metals are used in the cosmetics which pose health risk to consumers, the aim of the present study is to assess toxic metals like lead, cadmium, chromium, and mercury in some fairness creams highly used by the Bangladeshi people and their effect on human health.|$|E
30|$|In Bangladesh, use of <b>beauty</b> <b>cream</b> is {{very much}} popular and a common daily task for the people. The current study is {{focusing}} on the assessment of some toxic heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, chromium, and mercury contamination in some beauty creams commonly used by Bangladeshi people. The {{results indicate that the}} concentrations of lead, cadmium, and chromium exceed the maximum allowable concentrations, whereas mercury is found below the acceptable limit set by WHO/EU. However, according to Health Canada, the concentrations of cadmium and chromium for all the selected samples (except cadmium in sample coded A) was within the permissible limit. Health risks associated with these metal intakes via dermal exposure route are evaluated in terms of chronic daily intake (CDI) and hazard quotient (HQ). The carcinogenic risk (CR) estimated for chromium indicates that it is within the acceptable range. The cancer and non-cancer risk results indicate that although the chances of cancer risk and non-cancer risk resulting from the use of these cosmetic products were unlikely, buildup of these toxic heavy metals overtime on continuous usage could be detrimental for Bangladeshi people.|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{describe}} demographic characteristics, {{patterns of}} use, and symptoms associated with mercury poisoning among persons who used aMexican <b>beauty</b> <b>cream</b> containing mercurous chloride and {{to estimate the}} prevalence of cream use in Texas near the Mexico border. Design Case series and cross-sectional survey. Setting Border communities ofArizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas. Participants Persons who used the cream and contacted a health department in response to announcements about the cream and households that participated in the Survey of Health andEnvironmental Conditions in Texas Border Counties and Colonias, 1997. Mainoutcome measures Urine mercury concentrations, self-reported symptoms, and prevalence of cream use among households. Results Of 330 cream users who contacted their health department, 96 % were women, and 95 % were Hispanic. The mean urine mercury concentration was 146. 7 μg/L (reference range : 0 - 20 μg/L). In 5 % of 2, 194 randomly selected Texas households near the Mexico border, at least 1 person had used “Crema de Belleza-Manning”(Laboratorios Vida Natural, S. A., Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico) in the previous year. Conclusions Most cream users had increased urine mercury concentrations. Cream use was common in Texas near the Mexico border. Physicians should consider toxicity in patients with neurologic symptoms of unclear cause and use public health departments when investigating unusual illnesses...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{damage is}} {{the primary cause of}} skin aging. Skin care {{products}} are numerous and overwhelming, yet there is certain similarity among different formulations. Moisturizers are ubiquitous and the presence of particular added ingredients supports specific marketing claims. The antioxidant effects of botanical polyphenols possess tremendous marketing appeal, because oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the skin ability to neutralize them. The concept of evidence-based cosmetics lacks a widely accepted method to estimate the antioxidant capacity of the <b>beauty</b> <b>cream.</b> This was the motive force of the present study: {{for the first time we}} put forth a quantitative rating system of skin care products. The overall antioxidant power of 75 widely used and advertised beauty creams was comparatively measured via the oscillating Briggs-Rauscher (BR) reaction. Many dermocosmetic products confirmed their ability to ensure protection against free radicals, even if differences among various creams are striking and often not correlated with the their price. The method we developed is simple and cheap and it can allow dermatologists and consumers to compare and choose effectively; on the other hand, producers can used this method to select the most active antioxidant cosmetic agent to optimise the product performance...|$|E
