5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers have <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> cooperate {{and to share}} the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E

Victory ships <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> last longer {{and serve the}} US Navy after the war as these were faster, longer, wider, taller, had a thinner stack set farther toward the superstructure, and had a long raised forecastle.|$|R
5|$|At {{the west}} end of the Lower Ward is the Horseshoe Cloister, {{originally}} built in 1480, near to the chapel to house its clergy. It houses the vicars-choral, or lay clerks of the chapel. This curved brick and timber building is said to have <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> resemble the shape of a fetlock, one of the badges used by Edward IV. George Gilbert Scott heavily restored the building in 1871 and little of the original structure remains. Other ranges originally built by Edward III sit alongside the Horseshoe, featuring stone perpendicular tracery. As of 2011, they are used as offices, a library and as the houses for the Dean and Canons.|$|E
5|$|GRBs {{were first}} {{detected}} in 1967 by the Vela satellites, which had <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> detect covert nuclear weapons tests. Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. Little information {{was available to}} verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Henry III's younger brother, Richard of Cornwall, {{was granted}} the earldom in 1227. Backed by the {{revenues}} from the lucrative Cornish tin mining industry, he reconstructed the defences at the castle. Richard only visited Cornwall occasionally during his life, probably using Berkhampsted and Wallingford castles as his primary residences in England, and the work may have <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> impress the Cornish nobility, with whom Richard had a difficult relationship.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool Street had <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> {{integrate}} {{with the}} expanding London Underground network, {{and served as}} the new terminus for the Metropolitan Railway which extended east from Moorgate. From 1874 to 1875 the Metropolitan Railway used the Liverpool Street main-line station as a terminus; on 12 July 1875 the company opened their own station, initially called Bishopsgate. Subsurface platforms 1 and 2, were opened in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Lotus' {{synthetic}} {{sound system}} was {{incorporated in the}} Lotus Evora 414E Hybrid, a concept plug-in hybrid unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The system, called HALOsonic Internal and External Electronic Sound Synthesis, is a suite of noise solutions that uses patented technologies from Lotus and Harman International. The audio system generates engine sounds inside the vehicle through the audio system. The system also generates the external sound through speakers mounted at {{the front and rear}} to provide a warning to increase pedestrian safety. The system comes with four driver-selectable engine sounds, two of which have <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> have characteristics of a multi-cylinder conventional V6 and V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} suggests that that fortification actually commanded the harbour adequately. No single site would have been completely effective due to the rugged coastline, and that Harry's Walls may have <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and {{have been easy to}} defend, due to the surrounding water and marshland. Instead, the high costs of England's wider fortification programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable £35,228 on construction work during the five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.|$|E

5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices have <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope {{can also be used}} as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Planners {{believed}} the SEALs {{could get to}} Abbottabad and back without being challenged by the Pakistani military. The helicopters {{to be used in}} the raid had <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be quiet and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known. The U.S. had supplied F-16 Fighting Falcons to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a Pakistani military base under 24-hour U.S. surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Pricing {{was central}} to the {{marketing}} strategy, {{as it had been}} through Sinclair's career. The ZX81 had <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> meet a £70 price point and was launched at a price of £69.95 (built) or £49.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from £630 {{in the case of the}} Apple II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine.|$|E

5|$|Several {{missions}} were {{proposed to}} demonstrate methods of landing the Gemini spacecraft on land. The spacecraft had originally <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> land using a paraglider {{and a set}} of skis or wheels, however this was abandoned in favor of splashdowns under parachutes due to delays in development and failures during testing. As the proposed Big Gemini spacecraft would have landed this way, McDonnell Aircraft asked NASA to consider flying standard Gemini spacecraft with the paraglider in order to test the system before it would be required operationally.|$|E
5|$|Speakers at {{the inquiry}} have also testified that a {{significant}} volume of city traffic regularly cut across the roof deck as a bypass of the traffic lights {{at the corner of}} Hillside Drive and Ontario Avenue, resulting in more stress on the structure than it had <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> handle.

5000|$|Linda Williams {{argues that}} horror, melodrama, and {{pornography}} all {{fall into the}} category of [...] "body genres" [...] since they <b>are</b> each <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> elicit physical reactions on the part of viewers. Horror <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> elicit spine-chilling, white-knuckled, eye-bulging terror; melodramas <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> make viewers cry after seeing the misfortunes of the onscreen characters; and pornography <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> elicit sexual arousal. This approach can be extended: comedies make people laugh, tear-jerkers make people cry, feel-good films lift people's spirits and inspiration films provide hope for viewers.|$|R
