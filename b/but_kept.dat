5|$|Elizabeth's {{personal}} {{religious convictions}} {{have been much}} debated by scholars. She was a Protestant, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, when Alf {{was working}} with Charlie Lennon in the Barn Restaurant in Solihull, their brother Sydney sent a {{newspaper}} clipping from the Liverpool Echo reporting that Julia had died. A saddened Alf left Solihull for London, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> in touch with Charlie by phone.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, {{domestic}} ducks come in wild-type plumages, white, {{and other}} colours. Most of these colour variants are also known in domestic mallards not bred as livestock, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> as pets, aviary birds, etc., {{where they are}} rare but increasing in availability.|$|E

5|$|To {{create a}} death scene, Aronofsky drew from Mayan mythology the {{description}} of flowers and butterflies emerging from the bodies of valiant warriors when they die. Aronofsky excluded butterflies from the death scene to minimize the film's computer-generated imagery <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> the effect of flowers bursting from the body.|$|E
5|$|As {{he waited}} for the Emperor's {{confirmation}} of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son of the former conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor. Subsequently, the two were rarely in agreement, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> their divisions private.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957, Hergé {{sent his}} publisher, Casterman, {{the cover of}} his {{completed}} nineteenth Tintin adventure, The Red Sea Sharks, and for several weeks considered plot ideas for his next story. Fondly recalling the Scouting days of his youth, his first idea was to send Tintin back to the United States, as in the third adventure, Tintin in America, to help a group of Native Americans defend their land from a large corporation that wished to drill for oil; on reflection, Hergé {{came to believe that}} retracing old ground would be a step backwards. Another idea had Tintin striving to prove that Haddock's butler Nestor was framed for a crime committed by his old employers, the Bird brothers. He dismissed this as well, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> the idea of an adventure with no guns or violence—the only Tintin story without an antagonist. A third idea sent Tintin and Professor Calculus to a snow-covered polar region, where a stranded group of explorers need Calculus to save them from food poisoning. He abandoned this plot also, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> the setting in a snowy environment and decided to focus, not on Calculus, but on his main character Tintin.|$|E

5|$|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is {{an action}} game {{released}} in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game {{is based on}} the arcade game and film of the same name.

5|$|John F. Kennedy and {{his running}} mate, Lyndon B. Johnson, {{were close to}} {{securing}} their spots on the Democrats' ticket when they took a two-day swing through the Dallas–Fort Worth area in September 1960. Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a motorcade through Dallas to the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; the pictures were developed, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> in storage until their publication in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Juan Manuel de Rosas forced Lavalle {{to leave}} the province, and the federals ruled Buenos Aires until 1852. Rosas {{modified}} a number of policies of the Rivadavian period but maintained others: he set a customs law with protectionist policies, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> the port under the exclusive control of Buenos Aires and refused to call a constituent assembly.|$|E

5|$|Off the field, Miller was {{dogged by}} {{speculation}} {{as to whether}} he would honour a contract he had signed with Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the English Lancashire League, which would have ended his Test career. Miller resolved that he would remain in Australia, and accepted a job offer in New South Wales, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> his decision private.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{proposed to}} avoid exporting money, and to include high tariffs on {{the import of}} luxury goods. This is often seen as a contradiction of The Representation of the Hacendados, but each request different things. The Representation opposed the absolute prohibition of trade with Britain, {{which is not the}} same than allowing it while following a protectionist policy. As secretary, Moreno reduced the tariffs on national exports, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> high ones for imports.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the CID was immediately absorbed into the War Cabinet as Ismay had planned. In the midst of the turmoil, Ismay was promoted to Major General, and began to work closely with Chamberlain, accompanying him on a visit to France in December 1939. Ismay disagreed with several Allied strategic choices, including the decision to try to stop the German advance in Belgium, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> his doubts to himself.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after his arrival in Buenos Aires in the United Provinces (formally named the Argentine Republic in 1826), San Martín was interviewed by the First Triumvirate. They {{appointed}} him a lieutenant colonel of cavalry, {{and asked him to}} create a cavalry unit, as Buenos Aires did not have good cavalry. He began to organize the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers with Alvear and Zapiola. As Buenos Aires lacked professional military leaders, San Martín was entrusted with the protection of the whole city, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> focused in the task of building the military unit.|$|E
5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{was obtained}} in 1966 and the find {{was published in}} 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who noted that the species is closely similar to O.palustris. Later workers affirmed the relationship between O.dimidiatus, O.palustris and associated species like O.couesi. Fiona Reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen had been found. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in Oryzomys from the genus, {{because they are not}} closely related to the type species O.palustris, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> O.dimidiatus as an Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|Another {{war with}} Russia {{followed}} in 1632 and was concluded without much {{change in the}} status quo. King Władysław IV then proceeded to recover the lands lost to Sweden. At {{the conclusion of the}} hostilities, Sweden evacuated the cities and ports of Royal Prussia <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> most of Livonia. Courland, which had remained with the Commonwealth, assumed the servicing of Lithuania's Baltic trade. After Frederick William's last Prussian homage before the Polish king in 1641, the Commonwealth's position in regard to Prussia and its Hohenzollern rulers kept getting weaker.|$|E

5|$|Beadle's de jure {{recognition}} of the post-UDI government in 1968 outraged the Wilson administration and drew accusations from the British Prime Minister and others that he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; he was almost removed from the Privy Council, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> his place following Wilson's electoral defeat soon after. Beadle retired in 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences. He died in Johannesburg on 14 December 1980, aged 75.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Fair {{closed the}} Geauga Lake {{amusement}} park following the 2007 season <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> the water park area open. It was first known as Geauga Lake's Wildwater Kingdom, {{and the name}} was later shortened to Wildwater Kingdom. Its normal operating season extended from late May to Labor Day each year. The park featured 15 water slides including Thunder Falls, which opened as the tallest water slide complex in Ohio. In August 2016, Cedar Fair released a statement announcing the permanent closure of Wildwater Kingdom. Its final day of operation was September 5, 2016.|$|E
5|$|For {{the home}} Ashes series of 195051 Tallon was fit {{once more and}} {{available}} for national selection. Despite making only 37 runs in four innings in the lead-up matches, Tallon was chosen for all five Tests. He had a poor time with the bat, making only 39runs {{at an average of}} just 6.50. He took only eight catches, <b>but</b> <b>kept</b> tidily to retain his place in the team. His performances for Queensland were hardly more productive; he scored 161 runs at 16.10 and aside from a rain-affected draw, his state lost their remaining six matches.|$|E
