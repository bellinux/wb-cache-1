40|$|Abstract: In Switzerland {{hydropower}} production contributes roughly 60 % to {{the electricity}} supply. However {{for the protection}} of fishes almost no downstream migration facilities yet exist. Until 2030 all hydropower facilities have to provide a safe downstream migration corridor for fishes. In Europe some technological solutions exist to enable downstream migration at small hydropower plants, but no analogous solutions exist for larger hydropower facilities. Guidance efficiency of five fish species (barbel, spirling, brown trout, eel and grayling) was tested in a laboratory flume with modified bar racks and louvers angled at 30 and 15 degree to the approaching flow (0. 3 - 0. 9 m/s). The bar spacings were 5 and 11 cm. The test fishes were collected from wild river populations using electrofishing techniques. A total of 34 different configurations were evaluated. For selected experiments we additionally used a <b>bottom</b> <b>overlay</b> in order to increase the guiding efficiency. All the experiments were documented with video recordings. A detailed analysis of the flow is presented by the companion paper by Albayrak et al. (2015). The main angle of the guiding array (15 or 30 degree) did not {{have a significant effect on}} the guidance efficiency. Apart from the spirlin the increase in flow velocity did not affect the successful bypass passage. The guidance efficiency was • higher for bar racks and louvers with clear spacings of 5 cm, compared to 11 cm • higher for bar racks than for louvers (tested with barbel and spirlin) • considerably higher with a <b>bottom</b> <b>overlay,</b> notably for grayling. Our studies showed that angled bar racks have a striking potential for diverting European fish species away from turbine intakes. However additional lab and field studies (at a pilot hydropower plant) are needed and more fish species have to be tested...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: VAW of ETH Zurich conducts {{research}} on louvers and angled bar racks, so-called ‘fish guidance structures’ (FGS) for run-of-river hydropower applications. The {{purpose of the}} system is to improve the sustainable and efficient usage of hydropower by providing safe downstream fish guidance past the hydropower intake, guidance towards a fishbypass collection system, and minimizing negative economic impacts. The FGSs create complex two- and three-dimensional flow structures at different scales in the water column near them and the bypass, which can be sensed and behaviorally avoided by approaching fish. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on bar racks with and without a solid <b>bottom</b> <b>overlay</b> angled at 15 ° and 30 ° to the approach flow in a laboratory flume. The bars or slats were angled 45 ° against the flow direction. The bar spacing, thickness, and length were 0. 05 m, 0. 01 m and 0. 10 m, respectively. The mean approach flow velocity and flow depth were 0. 60 m/s and 0. 9 m/s, respectively. Profiles of longitudinal and transversal flow velocity components and turbulence characteristics in the water column were measured upstream, downstream, and around the structures using 2 D-Laser Doppler Anemometer at 1 kHz. The results of the experiments will be presented and discussed in relation to fish guidance efficiency of the investigated bar rack configurations obtained from live-fish experiments. In the companion paper by Peter et al. 2015, the results of live-fish experiments carried out in the same flume for the same and different bar rack, and flow configurations will be presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{downstream}} migrant silver phase American eels Anguilla rostrata to guide along various configurations of angled bar racks (25 - and 50 -mm clear spacing) and louvers (50 -mm clear spacing) was evaluated {{in a laboratory}} flume. Guidance tests were conducted with bar racks and louvers angled at 45 and 15 degrees to the approach flow at velocities of 0. 3 m/s to 0. 9 m/s. A full-depth bypass was used for all tests. Guidance efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of fish recovered from the bypass {{by the total number}} recovered downstream (bypass and entrainment combined). Mean guidance efficiency (MGE) with the 45 -degree, 25 -mm bar rack ranged from a low of 56. 8 % at 0. 6 m/s to a high of 65. 9 % at 0. 9 m/s. MGE of the 45 -clegree, 50 -mm bar rack decreased from 72. 7 % at 0. 3 m/s to 54. 5 % at 0. 9 m/s, while MGE of the 45 -clegree louver ranged from a low of 34. 9 % at 0. 3 m/s to a high of 61. 9 % at 0. 6 m/s. Guidance efficiency was considerably higher for tests with the 15 -degree structures, exceeding 88 % at all velocities during tests with a solid <b>bottom</b> <b>overlay</b> placed over the lower 30 cm of each structure. During tests without the overlay in place and at a velocity of 0. 6 m/s, guidance efficiency of both bar racks and louvers decreased to 83. 3 and 60. 7 %, respectively. The estimated guidance efficiencies indicate that angled bar racks and louvers have potential for diverting American eels away from hydro intakes, particularly if a shallow angle is employed (e. g., 15 degrees to the approach flow). However, we believe our estimates of guidance efficiency are higher than would be experienced at an actual intake due to the full depth bypass, the limited depth of the flume, and the short length of each rack configuration that we evaluated...|$|E
30|$|The <b>bottom</b> layer, <b>Overlay</b> Management, is {{responsible}} for routing and addressing in the overlay network. When changes in volunteered resources occur, they are announced to the nodes of the local node neighbour set throughout update messages. The neighbour set is established and managed at this level. Moreover, this layer maintains all {{the information about the}} availability of resources that each node of its neighbour set has. This layer separates the system from the overlay network used, thus providing the freedom of choosing the most appropriate solution (e.g., CAN [25], Chord [30], Pastry [27], etc).|$|R
30|$|Figure  5 {{shows the}} strain {{predicted}} at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>overlay</b> for both control specimens {{and those with}} SAMIs. The figure indicates that the strains at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>overlay</b> are lower in the specimens with SAMIs than those without SAMIs, except the specimens with sand asphalt as SAMI, which have greater strain than the control. However, at 30  °C, the results are mixed. This is {{probably due to the}} high load magnitude and temperature. Whilst high strain concentration exists around the crack region in the models with SAMIs, the lower strains in the overlay indicate that the SAMIs are able to isolate the overlay from the strain concentration. Moreover, since greater strains were predicted in the overlay of models with sand asphalt as SAMIs, it shows that they {{might not be able to}} retard reflective cracking. The predicted strains increase with increasing temperature. This indicates that performance reduces as temperature increases.|$|R

It is based on the use of an elastomeric stamp containing microfeatures to print proteins on the substrate of choice. The process can be subdivided into three parts. First, a silicon master is fabricated, which contains the microfeatures of interest. Once fabricated, the master can be used multiple times to make stamps. Masters with customized patterns can also be purchased commercially. Second, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp is fabricated. Unlike fabrication of the master, this step can be performed without specialized equipment. The PDMS stamp is inked with extracellular matrix proteins. Proteins are printed on a substrate (e. g., a tissue culture polystyrene dish or a glass coverslip covered with a thin layer of polystyrene). The nonprinted areas are back-filled with poly-L-lysine-polyethylene glycol, which renders them resistant to cell adhesion. The production of these micropatterned substrates can be completed in < 2 h. The third and final portion of the protocol describes the deposition of cells onto the micropatterned substrate. ### RELATED INFORMATION *Movie 1 illustrates many of the steps for performing microcontact printing as described in this protocol*. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Movie 1 **. A step-by-step illustration of preparation of an elastomeric stamp containing microfeatures, preparation of the substrate, and cell growth on the microfeatures. (Movie created by Nicolas Carpi.) ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Acetone - AP 6000 adhesion promoter (Dow Chemical) - Cells of choice - Chlorotrimethylsilane - Culture medium, complete (DMEM or DMEM-F 12 containing 10 % fetal calf serum [FCS] and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin) - Developer (Clariant AZ 400 K) - Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (with calcium and magnesium; with phenol red) (PBS) - Ethanol - Fetal calf serum - Fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich F 1141) (50 μg/mL in PBS) - Fixative (optional; see Step 33) - HEPES (10 mM, pH 7. 4) - Photoresist (Clariant AZ 4562) - PLL(20) -g-[3, 5]-PEG(2) (PLL-g-PEG; SurfaceSolutions) - Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Sylgard 184; Dow Corning) - Polystyrene (Acros Organics 178890250) - Toluene - Trypsin-EDTA or Versen EDTA ### Equipment 1. Adhesive tape or sonicator (see Step 12) - Argon (optional; see Step 25) - Beaker, plastic - Beaker, small - Centrifuge, tabletop - Coverslips, glass (24 × 24 mm) or tissue culture polystyrene dishes - *See the section on Substrate Preparation*. - Flasks, cell culture (75 -cm 2) - Forceps - Hot plate or oven preset to 100 °C - Incubator, humidified, 5 % CO 2 - Laminar flow hood - Mask aligner (e. g., Süss MicroTec MA 750) with a vacuum mask holder - *A simpler and much cheaper alternative can be made from a UV lamp (Delolux 03 S, 400 W) mounted with a 310 - to 460 -nm band pass filter and a custom-made vacuum mask holder*. - Microscope, inverted - Nitrogen gas (optional; see Steps 1, 7) - Optical mask (Delta Mask) - *The optical mask is a quartz plate coated with a chromium layer that has been etched to obtain the desired patterns of opaque and transparent regions. A file with the desired micropatterns must be provided to the manufacturer. If the micropattern features are greater than several tens of micrometers in their smallest dimension, a high-resolution plastic transparency can be used instead. The plastic transparency is less expensive but has limited spatial resolution*. - Ovens preset to 60 °C, 70 °C - Parafilm - Petri dish sealed with Parafilm (for storing the resist master and stamps) - Photoresist master - *If a master is not produced in-house, then purchase one from a commercial manufacturer (e. g., Biotray or Advance Reproductions Corporation). If the experiment does not require pattern resolution better than 10 μm, the mask may be ordered as an inexpensive transparency film from a number of companies (e. g., CAD/Art Services) *. - Pipettes - Plasma cleaner or UV/ozone cleaner (λ< 200 nm) (see Step 17) - Scalpel - Silicon wafer, 100 mm (e. g., MEMC Electronic Materials) or glass (borosilicate) wafer, 100 × 100 × 0. 175 mm (Schott D 263 T) - *The glass wafers are thinner but much cheaper*. - Spin coater (e. g., Laurell Technologies Corporation WS- 400 - 6 NPP-LITE) - Spoon, fork, or pipette, plastic (see Step 8) - Tissue (optional; see Step 15) - Tubes, 50 -mL culture - Tweezers - Ultrasonic bath - Vacuum desiccator - Video recorder (optional; see Step 33) ### METHOD **Fabrication of the Master** *This part requires specialized equipment and training; thus, it is best to fabricate the master in collaboration with a nanofabrication facility. However, a relatively simple lithography facility can be set up under a chemical hood. Fabrication of a master need only be done once, because it can be reused indefinitely to produce the elastomeric stamps. The desired photoresist master can also be purchased from companies that fabricate custom-made microstructured masters on demand*. *This protocol provides guidelines for the various parameters needed to fabricate a photoresist master. Details of this photolithography protocol, however, must be adapted to the specific needs of each laboratory (e. g., size of the microfeatures, distance between features, incubation times and temperatures). Note that the production of a master with microfeatures ranging from 1 μm to several hundred micrometers is a routine procedure in any microfabrication facility. The example in this protocol is best suited for features with a minimum dimension of 3 - 10 μm (but up to several tens of micrometers is okay) and a distance between features of < 50 μm. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the steps required to fabricate a photoresist master*. ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 1 **. The steps involved in producing molds by photolithography. (Circled numbers correspond to numbered steps in the Method.) *Photoresist Layer Coating* 1. Clean the silicon or the glass wafer in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min in acetone. Dry it in a flow of filtered air or nitrogen. - Spin coat the wafer as follows: - i. Place the wafer on a spin coater. - ii. Cover the central half of the wafer’s surface with photoresist. - iii. Spin coat the photoresist onto the wafer at 500 rpm for 30 sec. - iv. Spin coat the photoresist onto the wafer at 2000 rpm for 30 sec. - v. Dry the wafer under a hood for 10 min. - *The photoresist will be ~ 5 μm in height, which is suitable for 4 - to 10 -μm-wide features. When using a different photoresist for smaller features, this spin-coating step will have to be modified*. - Bake the photoresist layer onto the wafer using either a hot plate or an oven for 1 min at 100 °C. Cool the wafer on the bench for ~ 15 min until it returns to room temperature. *Photoresist Lithography* 4. Place the photoresist layer and the optical mask into contact with one another on the mask aligner or on the custom-made vacuum mask holder. Illuminate with the UV lamp (UV power 45 mW/cm 2 at 365 nm) for 10 sec. 5. Dilute the stock developer using one part developer and four parts H 2 O. Develop the photoresist in diluted developer for 90 - 120 sec. Rinse the wafer in a distilled H 2 O bath, which stops the development process. Dry the resist master with a flow of filtered air. - *Because the photoresist used in this protocol is “positive,” the illuminated areas are dissolved in the developer, creating the microfeatures (a negative photoresist would yield the opposite result) *. - *Do not post-bake the master. During the development step, microfeatures can be observed through a microscope using reflected light. If the patterns have not been completely revealed, extend the development time. The UV illumination time, the developer concentration, and the development time in Steps 4 and 5 depend upon the resist used and on its thickness. It may be necessary to adjust these*. *Photoresist Master Surface Coating* 6. Silanize the resist master in order to prevent it from adhering to the PDMS during stamp fabrication. - i. Place the resist master into a vacuum desiccator along with a small beaker containing a few drops of chlorotrimethylsilane. - ii. Turn on the vacuum for 30 min to induce the formation of chlorotrimethylsilane vapors. - iii. Turn off the vacuum, keep the desiccator sealed, and let the resist master silanize overnight. 7. Place the resist master for 30 min in a 70 °C oven to complete the silanization. - *Store the resist master away from dust (a Petri dish sealed with Parafilm works well). Handle the master with care. Be careful not to touch the patterned area with anything that could scratch and destroy it (e. g., use forceps). Clean it only with pressurized air or nitrogen*. **Micropatterned Substrate Fabrication** *Fabrication of the elastomeric stamp and microcontact printing of the micropattern can be performed in any biology laboratory without the need for specialized equipment. Two substrates for micropatterning are presented: the glass coverslip, which ensures the best optical quality, and the tissue culture treated polystyrene dish. Because in most cases protein adhesion is better on oxidized polystyrene than on glass, glass coverslips must be coated with a thin layer of polystyrene before protein and cells are applied. On bare glass, cells have been observed to rip adherent proteins, like fibronectin, off the glass*. *Stamp Fabrication* *See Figure 2 for an overview of PDMS stamp production*. ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **. PDMS stamp production. 8. Combine PDMS and the curing agent (both are included in the Sylgard 184 kit) in a 10 : 1 ratio in a plastic beaker and mix thoroughly using a plastic spoon, fork, or pipette. This step will generate bubbles in the elastomer. 9. Degas the PDMS mixture under vacuum to remove all of the air bubbles. Alternatively, centrifuge the mixture for 5 min at 3000 rpm. - *Avoid an excessively strong vacuum, which can cause the mixture to spill out of the beaker*. 10. Cast a 5 -mm thick layer of degassed PDMS mixture onto the resist master. Cure it for 2 h in a 60 °C oven. 11. Gently peel off the PDMS layer. - *The microstructures can be seen at the surface of the PDMS layer when viewed through a microscope. See Troubleshooting*. 12. Using a microscope and transmitted light, locate the region of interest containing the desired micropattern geometries. With a scalpel, excise 1 -cm 2 stamps. Larger regions can be excised, but stamps larger than 1 cm 2 are not easy to handle. - *Store stamps in a closed container away from dust (a Petri dish sealed with Parafilm works well). Stamps can be kept for months before being used. Adhesive tape can be used to clean dusty stamps, although, for small features, it is better to use stamps that have been cleaned by sonication*. *Substrate Preparation* *See Figure 3 for an overview of preparation of a polystyrene-coated glass coverslip*. ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") **Figure 3 **. Preparation of a polystyrene-coated glass coverslip. *The substrate described here is a glass coverslip coated with polystyrene. A tissue culture polystyrene dish can also be used. A short plasma or UV/ozone activation step (if the equipment is available) will enhance protein adhesion and cell attachment (Van Kooten et al. 2004). Proteins can be covalently bound to one another on polystyrene using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (Grabarek and Gergely 1990). For a useful handbook on conjugation techniques, see Hermanson (2008) *. 13. Wash the glass coverslip with ethanol. Dry the coverslip with filtered air or let it dry in the hood. - *Sonicate the coverslip in ethanol to optimize dust removal*. 14. Spin coat the coverslip as follows: - i. Place the coverslip on the spin coater. - ii. Deposit a few drops of the adhesion promoter AP 6000 onto the glass. - iii. Spin coat the coverslip for 10 sec at 100 rpm (to cover the coverslip), then for 20 sec at 1000 rpm (to form a thin layer). - iv. Dry the AP 6000 layer. - *The adhesion promoter ensures that the polystyrene will attach to the glass*. 15. Coat with polystyrene as follows: - i. Prepare a solution of 2 % polystyrene solution in toluene (2 %) and place a few drops of it on the AP 6000 -treated coverslip. - ii. Spin coat for 10 sec at 100 rpm (to coat the coverslip), then for 20 sec at 1000 rpm (to form a thin layer of polystyrene). - iii. After the spin coating, dry the polystyrene layer. - *If a spin coater is not available for use in Steps 14 and 15, spread the drops manually by handling the coverslip with tweezers and displacing the drop with an orbital rotation of the coverslip. After coating the coverslip, remove excess liquid with a tissue. If this alternative method is used, reduce the polystyrene to 0. 5 % so that the polystyrene layer will not be too thick*. - *Glass coverslips covered with polystyrene can be stored at room temperature for days. Oxidation of the substrate (Step 17) should be carried out immediately before the substrate is stamped (Step 20) *. *Microcontact Printing* *See Figure 4 for an overview of stamping fibronectin and backfilling with PLL-g-PEG*. ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") **Figure 4 **. Stamping fibronectin and backfilling with PLL-g-PEG. 16. Place a 20 -μL drop of 50 μg/mL fibronectin in PBS onto the microstructured surface of a 1 -cm 2 stamp. Spread the fibronectin solution across the stamp surface with the tip of the pipette by moving it toward each corner of the stamp. Leave the inked stamp for ~ 30 min to allow the fibronectin to adsorb to the PDMS. - *Spreading the fibronectin is necessary because the PDMS is hydrophobic. The surface of the stamp can be gently touched without damaging it*. 17. Transfer the polystyrene-coated coverslip (from Step 15) into a plasma cleaner. Turn on the pump to create a vacuum in the chamber. Allow a low flow of oxygen into the chamber and apply an oscillating electric field at 30 W for 10 sec. - *Tissue culture polystyrene dish substrates can be printed on without plasma oxidation, but plasma treatment (as described here) significantly improves printing and passivation efficiencies. Polystyrene Petri dishes (not activated for tissue culture) can also be used, provided they are activated by plasma treatment*. - *Stamp oxidized substrates (Step 20) within 15 min of activating them*. - *Substrate activation can also be performed in a UV/ozone cleaner (λ < 200 nm) *. 18. Aspirate off the fibronectin drop and immediately add a large drop of PBS to the surface before it dries. Repeat the PBS wash two more times to remove all of the unadsorbed fibronectin. 19. Remove the PBS drop and let the stamp dry in the airflow of a hood (it will take from a few seconds up to 1 min). The stamp is ready for printing when the surface appears dry while looking at light reflecting from it. *See Troubleshooting*. 20. Grasp the dry stamp with tweezers, invert the stamp, and place the microstructured surface in contact with the activated substrate (from Step 17). Briefly apply gentle pressure with the tweezers to ensure good contact between the stamp and the substrate. Leave the stamp in contact with the substrate for 1 min. - *This step is absolutely critical for success and requires practice to achieve satisfactory results*. 21. Remove the stamp and immerse it into H 2 O in a 50 -mL culture tube. 22. Prepare 0. 1 mg/mL PLL-g-PEG solution in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7. 4). Immerse the printed substrate in this solution for 30 min. To minimize the amount of PLL-g-PEG used, place a 100 -μL drop on the substrate and cover it with a piece of Parafilm. - *The PLL-g-PEG renders the nonprinted areas resistant to cell adhesion. See Troubleshooting*. 23. During PLL-g-PEG adsorption, clean the stamp. Heat the culture tube containing the stamp at 60 °C and sonicate it in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. Then sonicate the stamp in ethanol for 15 min. - *This cleaning procedure might not remove all the protein from the stamp. If another type of protein is to be stamped, it is better to use a new stamp*. 24. Dry the clean stamp under a hood for 1 h. Return the stamp to its storage container. 25. Wash the PLL-g-PEG-grafted substrate with PBS for 2 min and then for 10 min. - *The substrate is now ready for cell deposition. If not used immediately, it can be stored immersed in PBS or dried and stored under argon at 4 °C for up to 1 wk*. **Cell Deposition** *Micropatterned substrates prepared using this protocol have been used successfully with the following cells: HeLa-B, RPE 1, MCF 10 A, MCF 7, NIH 3 T 3, HepaRG, MDCK, and human mesenchymal stem cells, as well as dendritic cells derived from murine bone marrow*. 26. Wash adherent cells in PBS. Detach the cells with trypsin-EDTA (for 5 - 10 min, depending on the dilution used) or Versen EDTA. 27. Add complete culture medium to the flask and collect the cells by centrifugation for 3 min at 1500 rpm. 28. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in complete culture medium at 50, 000 cells/mL. 29. Add the cell solution to the micropatterned substrate (from Step 25). The final cell density should be ~ 10, 000 cells/cm 2. Place the cell-covered substrate into a tissue culture incubator. - *The incubation time depends upon the cell line (e. g., 15 - 30 min for RPE 1 and 30 - 60 min for HeLa-B) *. 30. Check the cells under a microscope to determine if a sufficiently large proportion of cells have attached to the micropatterns. 31. Remove unattached cells with a gentle flow of medium added to one side of the dish and aspirated from the other side. - *Keep the cells moist; do not allow them to become exposed to the air. The physicochemical properties of PEG can cause dewetting, leading the attached cells to quickly dry out*. 32. Return the attached cells to the incubator. Let them spread fully (1 - 5 h, depending on the cell type). 33. Fix or video-record the cells. *See Figure 5 for examples of cells attached to micropatterns*. ![Figure 5]([URL] "Figure 5 ") **Figure 5 **. Images of cells on micropatterns.

Scale bar, 100 μm. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Separating the PDMS layer from the photoresist master destroys the master. **[Step 11]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Curing the PDMS mixture (Step 10) for more than 2 h at 60 °C can induce PDMS binding to the photoresist, which weakens the resist layer and results in destruction of the photoresist master when the two layers are separated. Avoid curing for more than 2 h. - 2. Silanization of the resist master (Steps 6 and 7) might have failed. This will result in strong binding of the cured PDMS to the master. Before making a new master, check on a blank one that the silane used for the coating is still functional. Silanes tend to degrade, and the silane solution should be renewed regularly. - **Problem**: Salt crystals form on the surface of the elastomeric stamp as the PBS dries. **[Step 19]** - **Solution**: This may happen if an excess of PBS is left to dry on the stamp. Avoid this by washing the stamp once with H 2 O before drying. - **Problem**: The polystyrene layer detaches and floats at the surface when the coverslip is placed in aqueous solution. **[Step 22]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Treat the coverslip with adhesion promoter (Step 14) prior to applying the polystyrene. - 2. Affix the polystyrene to the coverslip by placing the polystyrene-coated coverslip under a UV lamp for 5 min at λ = 185 nm and 4 × 60 W (Yan and Harnish 2003). - **Problem**: Cells do not grow uniformly and/or they grow significantly beyond the boundaries of the microfeatures. **[Step 33]** - **Solution**: Consider the following when stamping the substrate in Step 20 : - 1. Insufficient pressure might result in poor printing. Apply pressure with the tweezers both uniformly and for a longer period of time. - 2. Excessive pressure will induce sagging of the stamp, causing proteins to print outside of the features. Apply pressure more gently. - 3. Do not move the stamp once it has touched the surface. Both application and removal of the stamp should be done with precision and great care. ### DISCUSSION Microfabrication techniques as applied to cell biology now have a long and successful history (see Folch and Toner [2000] and Whitesides et al. [2001] for reviews of many micropatterning techniques developed from the 1970 s to the 1990 s). Accompanying the rapid development of biological applications (in cell biology, tissue engineering, cell co-cultures, bioassays, and biosensors, among other fields), there has been a huge burst of technical papers in the last 10 years that expand the utility of micropatterning techniques to new substrates (glass, plastics, hydrogels, and elastomers), additional molecules, cell types, and into three dimensions. There are many alternative techniques, but five main processes dominate the field of micropatterning: 1. Photolithography and lift-off (as well as other stencil-type methods) - Laser/electron beam etching - Micro- and nanoprinting - UV-based chemistry - Microcontact printing Each method has drawbacks and advantages, so that the method chosen will depend upon the application.

40|$|To {{protect the}} {{structure}} and restore a smooth riding surface, many airports repair deteriorating concrete pavements with an overlay of hot mix asphalt (HMA). Reflective cracking is a serious concern {{associated with the use}} of thin overlays but is not addressed in the current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular for asphalt concrete (AC) overlaid rigid pavements. This paper presents a comprehensive study to examine the crack initiation and propagation of a test HMA overlay with and without a strain relieving interlayer, and to evaluate the interlayer performance to retard thermally-induced reflection cracks. To achieve these objectives, three-dimensional finite element analyses (FEA) were first conducted to assess key structural parameters controlling the tension stresses at the <b>overlay</b> <b>bottom.</b> Next, laboratory tests were performed to characterized fatigue, fracture, and viscoelastic performance of the interlayer mixture. Finally, a test pavement was built, instrumented, and tested at the FAA National Airport Pavement Test Facility (NAPTF).

30|$|Two {{different}} types of mixing rate experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, the rate of transport through thermoclines was studied. In another set of experiments, water-column mixing with different settings to promote convective stirring was studied. In both cases, we used a rhodamine solution that was slowly added through a small funnel with PVC tubing attached to the neck and with an air diffuser attached {{to the other end}} of the tubing. To ensure that all of the rhodamine was injected, the tubing was flushed with 100  ml of water after the injection. The rhodamine solution and flush water was kept at the same temperature as the surrounding water. In the thermocline experiment, the temperature in the bottom layer was set to, respectively, 5, 10 and 15  °C, and to 20  °C above this bottom layer in all three tanks. A rhodamine solution (160  mg in 50  ml of water) was injected at 4.5  m in depth, and a 250 -W submersible heater was placed at 3.2  m in depth to ensure mixing in the upper water column. After adding the rhodamine, we lowered a small aquarium pump with horizontal in- and outlets down to the bottom and ran it for 1  min to get the bottom water well mixed with rhodamine. Vertical profiles of the rhodamine distribution were thereafter made over time, using a Turner Designs Databank handheld data logger with a pre-calibrated Turner Cyclops 7 model 2100 - 000 fluorimeter sensor (Turner Designs, San Jose, California, USA). After the profiling ended, the water column was mixed thoroughly, and the rhodamine concentration was recorded to get the equilibrium concentration. In the study of the transport rate through thermoclines, we divided the water column into four vertical sections, 0.2 – 1.8, 1.8 – 3.3, 3.3 – 3.6  m (main part of the thermocline), and 3.6 – 4.7  m (stagnant bottom layer where the rhodamine was added). The transport rate into the water above the bottom layer (above 3.6  m) was calculated by normalizing the final equilibrium concentration of rhodamine to 100 % and then plotting the % values of equilibrium rhodamine concentration over time and fitting a linear regression equation to the data. This is a simplification of the actual process since, in theory, a given proportion of water is mixed per time unit, which would generate a logarithmic succession. The exchange rate of rhodamine from the bottom layer through the thermocline was calculated by setting the start value minus the equilibrium value as 100 %, thereby normalizing the equilibrium rhodamine concentration to 0 %, and then plotting the % values over time. To define the effect of thermocline strength, i.e., the density difference between the <b>bottom</b> and <b>overlaying</b> water, we plotted the transport rate versus thermocline strength (density difference), both for transport into the upper two layers and out from the bottom layer, and adapted the best fit regression equation to the data.|$|R
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of road pavements in England {{has become a}} costly necessity, due largely to the large volume of commercial vehicles using the roads which cause pavements to deteriorate quickly, and makes their repair more difficult to carry out. These roadworks incur not only direct works costs, but also indirect costs from factors such as congestion, motor accidents and pollution. There is obviously a need for cost-effective maintenance that minimises the occurrence and duration of these disruptions. To strengthen pavements bituminous overlays are often used, but may crack prematurely when placed over a layer with discontinuities such as cracks or joints, or deform excessively under wheel loading. The problem of 'reflective cracking' is widespread and reduces the life of maintenance treatments considerably. To increase the time before cracking appears {{on the surface of}} a pavement, a (more expensive) thicker overlay may be used, but this can lead to problems with property thresholds and bridge clearance. One possible option of reducing the thickness of overlays by making them more resistant against cracking and deformation, is to place a layer-of reinforcement within or at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>overlay.</b> Although this approach has been used occasionally to reinforce overlays, over 40 years or so, it is not favoured with many road authorities, as the results of these treatments are difficult to anticipate, and may not be cost effective. This thesis describes an investigation into the effect of reinforcing thin bituminous overlays to identify key factors that significantly influence their performance. By identifying these factors, optimum use of reinforced asphalt should be possible, and thus {{maintenance of}} the road network made more cost effective. The investigation was principally carried out in the laboratory using beam tests, shear box tests, tensile tests on reinforcement and large-scale wheel tracking tests. 2 -D Finite Element Analysis was used in the analysis of test results. Results show that properly constructed reinforced overlays can be between two or three times more resistant to cracking, and have less than half the permanent deformation of unreinforced materials...|$|R
40|$|Benthic fluxes of {{nutrients}} and metals were {{measured in the}} coastal zone of the north-western Black Sea, which {{is influenced by the}} Danube and Dniestr rivers. The results from the benthic flux chambers deployed during two EROS 21 cruises in summer 1995 and in spring 1997 yield information on benthic nutrient cycling and diagenetic pathways at the sediment-water interface. This information is discussed in the light of benthic activity as well as pore-water data. The benthic recycling {{of nutrients}} varied seasonally due to the availability of oxygen and organic material, and spatially due to river influence. Areas of high benthic fluxes near-shore and of low benthic fluxes offshore on the shelf were distinguished. Nutrients and suspended particulate matter discharged by the Danube is kept nearshore by the coastal current. The oxygen concentrations in the bottom water varied strongly between the two seasons. In summer, the bottom water at the near-shore stations turned anoxic. In spring, the higher oxygen concentrations are related to more intense mixing of the water column due to stormy periods and high river discharge. Highest oxygen concentrations were found on the offshore continental shelf. However, the benthic oxygen consumption rates in spring (13 - 23 mmolm- 2 day- 1) were as high as in summer. Areas with highest nutrient concentrations in the <b>overlaying</b> <b>bottom</b> water were found at the Danube delta front and Danube prodelta. On the Danube delta front and the Dniestr mouth, ammonia fluxes were lower in spring (1 · 1 - 1 · 7 mmolm- 2 day- 1) than in the summer (2 · 6 - 4 · 4 mmolm- 2 day- 1) due to higher nitrification rates and the lower influx of organic matter. In spring, the concentrations of dissolved iron and manganese in the bottom water were one order of magnitude lower than during the summer. This decrease in flux rates is related to the higher oxygen concentrations in the bottom water in spring. A rough comparison of the river's nutrient load and the benthic recycling over a certain area showed that the near-shore benthic phosphate and silica recycling account for 50 % and 35 % of the Danube input in summer, respectively. The fluxes of ammonia from benthic recycling and from the Danube discharge were at the same order of magnitude in both seasons. Nitrogen is introduced by the rivers mostly as nitrate. Benthic recycling is the dominant source of ammonia. The Danube input is phosphate deficient. In brief, benthic nutrient recycling {{is an important factor in}} sustaining high productivity of the syste...|$|R
