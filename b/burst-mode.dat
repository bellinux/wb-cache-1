40|$|The {{continuous}} {{stream of}} new {{applications for the}} internet, increases the need for higher access speed in the currently deployed communication networks. Most networks in use today still consist of twisted copper wires, inherited from the telephone network. The disadvantages of reusing the existing telephone network are twofold. Firstly, the bandwidth of twisted copper wires is limited and secondly, {{a large number of}} switches and routers are needed throughout the network leading to an excessive power consumption. The hybrid fiber coax network that reuses the television distribution network is not free from these drawbacks. The bandwidth is also limited and power hungry amplifiers are needed to bridge the distance to and from the user. The future of broadband access lies in optical fiber networks. The optical fiber has a virtually unlimited bandwidth and the lower attenuation leads to less switches and amplifiers in the network, reducing the power consumption of the complete infrastructure. This dissertation describes the design of a 10 Gb/s <b>burst-mode</b> receiver for high-split extended reach passive optical networks (PONs). The designed receiver incorporates two very advanced features. Firstly, the <b>burst-mode</b> receiver locks its gain setting within 6 ns avoiding packet loss due to gain switching during data payload reception.

40|$|Abstract—The {{utilization}} of a <b>burst-mode</b> power amplifier (PA) together with pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a promising concept for achieving high efficiency in radio frequency (RF) transmitters. Nevertheless, such a transmitter architecture requires bandpass filtering to suppress side-band spectral com-ponents {{to retrieve the}} wanted signal, which reduces the transmit power and the transmitter efficiency. High efficiency can only be expected with the maximum transmit power and signals with low peak-to-average-power ratios (PAPRs). To boost efficiency for signals with high PAPRs and signals at variable transmit power levels, the <b>burst-mode</b> multilevel transmitter architecture has been widely discussed as a potential solution. This paper presents an efficiency optimization procedure of <b>burst-mode</b> multilevel transmitters for signals with high PAPRs and signals at variable transmit power levels. The impact of the threshold value on the transmitter efficiency is studied, where the optimum threshold value and the maximum transmitter efficiency can be obtained according to input magnitude statistics. In addition, {{the relation between the}} threshold value and the efficiency expression of <b>burst-mode</b> multilevel transmitters and those of Doherty PAs is investigated. It is shown that the obtained optimum threshold value, although originally designed for <b>burst-mode</b> transmitters, can also be applied to Doherty and multistage Doherty PAs to achieve maximum transmitter efficiency. Simulations are used to validate the efficiency improvement of the optimized <b>burst-mode</b> multilevel transmitters compared to two-level and non-optimized multilevel transmitters.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two techniques}} to quantify energy consumption of <b>burst-mode</b> asynchronous(clock-less) control circuits. The circuit specifications considered are extended <b>burst-mode</b> specifications, and the implementations are multi-level logic implementations whose outputs {{are guaranteed to}} be free of any voltage glitches (hazards). Both techniques use stochastic analysis to combine a small number of simulations in order to quantify average energy per external signal transition.

Using this technique we bound the effect of hazards under all possible operating conditions and environments for a given circuit. Additionally, to drive synthesis tools for low-power, we propose a second technique that uses fixed-delay simulation to derive a realistic estimate of energy consumption within our derived upper and lower bounds. We demonstrate the feasibility of both these techniques on a variety of <b>burst-mode</b> control circuits used in an industrial-quality chip.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{eliminating}} a certain class of timing assumptions {{inherent in the}} synthesis of aynchronous “burst-mode ” finite-state machines. Existing <b>burst-mode</b> synthesis methods (e. g., Minimalist) assume the fundamental mode of operation: the environment is assumed to provide a new input stimulus only after adequate time has been allowed for the state machine to stabilize. Therefore, this mode of operation often imposes strict timing constraints on {{the operation of the}} machine’s environment; fast-reacting environments could cause malfunction. This paper introduces a new method for synthesizing <b>burst-mode</b> finite-state machines that does not rely on the fundamental mode assumption, but instead operates in input-output mode, i. e., the environment is allowed to react as soon as the state machine produces its outputs. Given a <b>burst-mode</b> specification, our method produces a set-reset implementation that is quasi-delay-insensitive. Our method provides new steps for state encoding and logic covering. The process is automated and has been applied to a number of examples for comparison to previous synthesis methods. ...|$|E
40|$|Long reach passive optical {{networks}} (LR-PONs), which integrate fibre-to-the-home with metro networks, {{have been}} the subject of intensive research in recent years and are considered one of the most promising candidates for the next generation of optical access networks. Such systems ideally have reaches greater than 100 km and bit rates of at least 10 Gb/s per wavelength in the downstream and upstream directions. Due to the limited equipment sharing that is possible in access networks, the laser transmitters in the terminal units, which are usually the most expensive components, must be as cheap as possible. However, the requirement for low cost is generally incompatible with the need for a transmitter chirp characteristic that is optimised for such long reaches at 10 Gb/s, and hence dispersion compensation is required. In this thesis electronic dispersion compensation (EDC) techniques are employed to increase the chromatic dispersion tolerance and to enhance the system performance at the expense of moderate additional implementation complexity. In order to use such EDC in LR-PON architectures, a number of challenges associated with the <b>burst-mode</b> nature of the upstream link need to be overcome. In particular, the EDC must be made adaptive from one burst to the next (<b>burst-mode</b> EDC, or BM-EDC) in time scales on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds. <b>Burst-mode</b> operation of EDC has received little attention to date. The main objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the feasibility of such a concept and to identify the key BM-EDC design parameters required for applications in a 10 Gb/s <b>burst-mode</b> link. This is achieved through a combination of simulations and transmission experiments utilising off-line data processing.

It was introduced to SAR data compression in [1] as an option for the efficient processing of SAR data. It is computationally efficient, since only one FFT is required. Then it was mostly used for low-resolution SAR image generation at low computational cost. Meanwhile, SPECAN was employed for processing SAR data within DLRs ECS processor. It seems that apart from the range variant sampling problem, that has been solved by azimuth scaling, it could be also made phase preserving by simply applying a quadratic phase to the data. ScanSAR and <b>burst-mode</b> interferometry suffer from the complexity of <b>burst-mode</b> and ScanSAR data in its signal properties and data/ product handling. However, it can be shown that <b>burst-mode</b> data can be processed by a standard chirp scaling time-domain or range-Doppler domain processor without loss of computational efficiency when the resampling and range spectral filtering steps in Interferometry are integrated into a interferogram formation step based on a bank of azimuth and range resampling filters. Cross-correlation for fine-registration of the data sets can be optimized by a in-advance raw data line nulling and alignment. After application of a quadratic phase matching the SARs FM rate burst images may be treated like low resolution strip-map images. This may be exploited to efficiently process <b>burst-mode</b> imagery with standard interferometric strip-map SAR processors. In this paper the question of phase preserving SAR processing with SPECAN is discussed. Time processing serves as a reference for discrimination. Moreover, the pack-and-go algorithm is verified. In this respect, a novel combination for ScanSAR processing and two new processing strategies for <b>burst-mode</b> interferometry are presented...|$|E

Ideally, a PWM signal is of infinite bandwidth, however, high-frequency spectral components are attenuated, e. g., by the bandlimitation of the PA matching network or the PWM circuit itself. Bandlimitation introduces ripples in the signal amplitude, which might reduce the PA efficiency in <b>burst-mode</b> operation.
