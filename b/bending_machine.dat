50|$|Form bound bending {{procedures}} like “press bending” or “rotary draw bending” {{are used}} to form the work piece {{into the shape of}} a die. Straight tube stock can be formed using a <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> to create a variety of single or multiple bends and to shape the piece into the desired form. These processes can be used to form complex shapes out of different types of ductile metal tubing. Freeform-bending processes, like three-roll-pushbending, shape the workpiece kinematically, thus the bending contour is not dependent on the tool geometry.|$|E

PSDs protect the operator and other employees in the area.|$|E

40|$|Recently, the rebar bending {{methodology}} {{started to}} change from field processing to utilizing rebar <b>bending</b> <b>machines</b> at plant sites prior to transport to the construction locations. Computerized control of rebar plant <b>bending</b> <b>machines</b> provides more accurate and faster bending of rebars than the low quality inefficient field processing alternative. The bending process involves plastic deformation of rebars, where bending stress beyond the yield point of the material is applied. When the bending stress is removed, spring back {{is caused by the}} elastic restoring stress. Therefore, an accurate numerical analysis of the spring-back process is required to reduce the bending process errors. The most sensitive factors affecting the spring-back process are the bending radius, the bending angle, the diameter of the rebar, the friction coefficient, and the yielding strength of material. In this paper, we suggest a numerical modeling method using these factors. The finite element modeling of the dynamic mechanical behavior of the material during bending is performed using a commercial dynamic analysis program “DAFUL. ” We use the least squares approach to derive the spring-back deflection {{as a function of the}} rebar bending parameters...|$|R

50|$|The Three-Roll Push Bending (TRPB) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used freeform-bending process to manufacture bending geometries consisting of several plane bending curves. Nevertheless, a 3D-shaping is possible. The profile is guided between bending-roll and supporting-roll(s), while being pushed through the tools. The position of the forming-roll defines the bending radius. The bending point is the tangent-point between tube and bending-roll. To change the bending plane, the pusher rotates the tube around its longitudinal axis. Generally, a TRPB tool kit can be applied on a conventional rotary draw <b>bending</b> <b>machine.</b> The process is very flexible since with a unique tool set, several bending radii values Rm can be obtained, although the geometrical precision of the process is not comparable to rotary draw bending. Bending contours defined as spline- or polynomial-functions can be manufactured.|$|E

The company soon added several new machines to its line to make automobile sheet metal parts. In 1915 the company had grown sufficiently for it to purchase land and build a small factory on Walworth Avenue {{on the west side of}} Cleveland.

5000|$|Bender was {{designed}} specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders into various angles. Despite this apparent simplicity, he possesses numerous features superfluous to his original purpose, which become more apparent after an electric jolt to his antenna from an overhead light socket in the pilot episode. The scope of Bender's functionality is impressive; he often acts {{as if he were}} a multifunctional gadget rather than a special <b>bending</b> <b>machine.</b> Similar to a contemporary computer, he hosts a number of input/output devices: his head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control. His body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket power receptacle, a reset button, a kill switch, and a self-destruct button. Having the hardware-based self-destruct control on his body, rather than in his software, prevents Bender from committing suicide in [...] "A Head in the Polls" [...] when he pawns everything but his head, grows desperate without it and desires to kill himself.|$|E

50|$|As {{the oldest}} drum {{company in the}} United States, Noble & Cooley has been in {{operation}} since 1854, when Silas Noble and James Cooley starting building marching snare drums for the Union Army. The company also made toy drum sets for children {{through most of the}} 1900s. In the early 1980s, company vice-president Jay Jones (Great-great-great grandson of James Cooley) decided to enter the professional drum arena, effectively starting the custom drum shop movement in the US. He worked closely with designer Bob Gatzen and pulled out of retirement a steam <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> that was old enough to have survived a fire in 1889. Noble & Cooley first offered its SS Classic solid shell snare drums in 1983. The SS Classic series was the first one ply construction snare drum of the modern era. The quality and tone of the drum was so much better than other drums at the time that it has been used on countless recordings and used by most professional drummers {{at some point in their}} careers. The company briefly tried to manufacture complete solid shell kits and were able to produce some, most notably used by Denny Carmassi in Heart. The cost and daunting nature of constructing larger shell sizes led the company to abandon complete kits and focus primarily on the snare drums. Since that time, the company has created many other professional wood and metal snare drums and different lines of complete drum sets. After suffering some financial setbacks pertaining to globalization of the their toy business, the company scaled back its innovation and production efforts and built snare drums and drum sets on demand for the better part of a decade. Tired of watching the commoditization of the drum manufacturing business, in 2015, they decided to refocus their efforts on bringing innovation to the custom drum world. They partnered with business executive, drummer and long time Noble & Cooley player John Keane to reinvigorate the brand. They are currently experiencing a renaissance, bringing the Noble & Cooley sound to the next generation of drummers and developing products to again move the needle on drum quality. A key result of this partnership was the re-introduction of Horizon and Solid Shell Series Kits in 2016. The company also purchased the Witt drum company in 2015. The first release from this acquisition is the highly touted Walnut snare drum line.|$|E
