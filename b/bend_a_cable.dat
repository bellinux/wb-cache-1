50|$|Bend radius, {{which is}} {{measured}} {{to the inside}} curvature, is the minimum radius one can <b>bend</b> <b>a</b> pipe, tube, sheet, cable or hose without kinking it, damaging it, or shortening its life. The smaller the bend radius, the greater is the material flexibility (as the radius of curvature decreases, the curvature increases). The diagram below illustrates <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> with <b>a</b> seven-centimeter <b>bend</b> radius.|$|R

40|$|Cable-stayed bridges are an {{efficient}} and elegant solution to bridging long spans. Though a widely used structural system, several significant issues are still unresolved regarding a cable-stayed bridge's performance, particularly {{with respect to}} the response of the <b>cables</b> to wind. <b>As</b> tension members, stay <b>cables</b> have <b>a</b> very low diameter-to-span ratio such that the effect of <b>bending</b> stiffness on <b>a</b> <b>cable's</b> vibration characteristics is inconsequential. Coupled with this, stay cables have very little internal mechanical damping, thus they are quite susceptible to dynamic excitation. Several vibration mechanisms have been identified, however for some, including the potentially more damaging mechanisms, the required conditions and generating mechanisms are not completely understood. Aerodynamically, <b>a</b> stay <b>cable</b> is simply <b>a</b> circular cylinder exposed to wind. A circular cylinder positioned normal to airflow is a touchstone topic in the fields of aerodynamics and fluid mechanics. A circular cylinder inclined to airflow, from a fundamental viewpoint, has been given very little attention considering the body of work concerning the former case. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the characteristics of the airflow about an inclined circular cylinder, and to determine and clarify necessary conditions for the generation of galloping vibrations and high-speed vortex vibrations in dry, inclined stay <b>cables.</b> <b>A</b> wind tunnel study was conducted in which a static circular cylinder was exposed, at varying relative wind-cylinder angles, to wind speeds corresponding to a Reynolds number range of 1 x 105 to 6 x 105 Surface pressure data was recorded to determine both the instantaneous and time-averaged pressures and forces on the section. Using the matrix computation software Matlab, programs were written to evaluate and analyse lift and drag forces, and pressure, lift, and drag coefficients. From the extensive data compiled, several significant conclusions concerning flow about an inclined or yawed cylinder and about the galloping and high-speed vortex vibration phenomena result. Concerning flow about an inclined circular cylinder, the drag force coefficient is generally lower for lower relative inclination angles. This trend reverses over a small range of speeds within the critical Reynolds number range. Note that this and the following findings are based on the minimum inclination angle tested of 54. 7 °.

40|$|In this degree {{paper we}} study the {{behavior}} of conductors for overhead lines. We present typical characteristics of overhead lines structures and detailed characteristics of conductors. We compare different models for conductors: inextensible cable, extensible cable, inextensible and extensible shallow cable and engineering cable theory. These models neglect the <b>bending</b> stiffness of <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> and appropriately reduce the governing equations of a system. The validity {{of the results of}} these models is limited, due to the simplifications. For these reason the conductors for overhead lines were also analyzed by computer program Nodi that uses the finite element method. Nodi is an educational software for dynamic analysis of planar frames, based on the Reissner beam theory. The appropriate parameters for the numerical model are chosen and then the results of the closed-form equations are compared to more accurate ones. We have found out that besides limitations, mentioned in the literature, there are also other restrictions. The higher inclination of the line between the supports leads to less accurate results of the closed-form equations. Besides that, closedform equations cannot describe {{the behavior of}} a conductor under the dynamic load, which is a common situation for conductors. We used numerical model to analyze the falling sleet from the conductor, which runs over one or several fields. We have compared a behavior of the conductor at the time the sleet from different parts of the conductor has fallen. The better we know the behavior of the conductors for overhead lines, the better we can assess the sags for the evaluation of appropriate safety distances and forces that affect electricity transmission towers. Therefore, we have also analyzed a numerical model of actual part of overhead line with load cases defined in standard SIST EN 50341 - 3 - 21...|$|R
