5|$|The Lone Gunmen contact Mulder and Scully about a {{successful}} attempt {{by a friend}} of theirs to hack the United States Department of Defense computer system. The hacker, Kenneth Soona (Bernie Coulson), is able to give Mulder the downloaded information on a digital cassette. However, Soona is later assassinated, and the downloaded files {{are found to be}} written in Navajo. Contacting Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman)—a Navajo man capable of translating the files—Mulder is shown a <b>box-car</b> full of what appear to be alien corpses. He is trapped in the <b>box-car</b> by the series' antagonist, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and left for dead after it is destroyed. He is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen. Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien-human hybrids. Her sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw), however, is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in hospital that night.|$|E
2500|$|Box {{cars were}} used for bulk {{commodities}} such as coal, particularly in the Midwestern United States in the early 20th century. [...] This use was sufficiently widespread that several companies developed competing <b>box-car</b> loaders to automate coal loading. [...] By 1905, 350 to 400 such machines were in use, mostly at Midwestern coal mines.|$|E
6000|$|... "Olsen, I've an idea," [...] {{returned}} Kurt, excitedly. [...] "You fellows keep shooting--attract their attention. I'll slip below, {{climb on}} top of a <b>box-car,</b> and get a rake-off at that bunch." ...|$|E
60|$|At this {{juncture}} a temporary station {{had been left}} {{in the shape of}} several <b>box-cars</b> where the telegraph operators and a squad of troopers lived.|$|R
60|$|Olsen halted his force {{near one}} of the {{detached}} lines of <b>box-cars,</b> which he probably meant to take advantage of in case of a fight.|$|R
60|$|At {{eight o'clock}} the engine drew out, pulling after it a dozen <b>box-cars</b> laden with stock and {{household}} goods, {{and on the}} roof of a freight caboose, together with several other young Jasons, I rode, bound for the valley of the James.|$|R
6000|$|There was a town {{down the}} road which I had first heard {{discussed}} nigh twenty {{years ago by a}} broken-down prospector in a <b>box-car.</b> 'Young feller,' said he, after he had made a professional prophecy,' you'll hear of that town if you live. She's born lucky.' ...|$|E
6000|$|A Denver man {{entered the}} war, lost himself and God, [...] and found manhood. [...] "I played poker in the <b>box-car</b> [...] which carried {{me to the}} front and read the Testament [...] in the {{hospital}} train which took me to the rear," [...] he [...] tells us.|$|E
60|$|It {{was with}} much caution that Whistling Dick slid back {{the door of}} the <b>box-car,</b> for Article 5716, City Ordinances, {{authorized}} (perhaps unconstitutionally) arrest on suspicion, and he was familiar of old with this ordinance. So, before climbing out, he surveyed the field with all the care of a good general.|$|E
60|$|It was {{necessary}} {{to go around the}} long line of <b>box-cars.</b> Olsen led the way, with Kurt just back of him. The men spoke but little and in whispers. At the left end of the line the darkness was thick enough to make objects indistinct.|$|R
60|$|The colt {{was almost}} run {{out when he}} entered the circle of reddish flare. Kurt saw the glowing ruins of the {{elevators}} and a long, fiery line of <b>box-cars</b> burned to the wheels. Men were running and shouting round in front of the little railroad station, and several were on the roof with brooms and buckets. The freight-house had burned, and evidently the station itself had been on fire. Across the wide street of the little village the roof of a cottage was burning. Men were on top of it, beating the shingles. Hoarse yells greeted Kurt as he leaped out of the saddle. He heard screams of frightened women. On {{the other side of the}} burned <b>box-cars</b> a long, thin column of sparks rose straight upward. Over the ruins of the elevators hung a pall of heavy smoke. Just then Jerry came galloping up, his lean face red in the glow.|$|R
60|$|Benton had two trains {{each day}} now. This one, just in, {{was long and}} loaded to its utmost capacity. Neale noticed an Indian arrow {{sticking}} fast over a window {{of one of the}} coaches. There were flat cars loaded with sections of houses, and <b>box-cars</b> full of furniture. Benton was growing every day. At least a thousand persons got off that train, adding to the dusty, jostling melee.|$|R
60|$|But Tim Hagan {{never lived}} to see his father a saloon keeper. Two days later, on a trestle, the lads were fired out of an empty <b>box-car</b> by a brake-man who should have known better. The trestle spanned a dry ravine. Young Dick {{looked down at the}} rocks seventy feet below and demurred.|$|E
60|$|After {{twilight}} had gone, in {{the first}} darkness of the night, a freight train rumbled into the station. When the engine was switching cars on to the side-track, Johnny crept {{along the side of}} the train. He pulled open the side-door of an empty <b>box-car</b> and awkwardly and laboriously climbed in. He closed the door. The engine whistled. Johnny was lying down, and in the darkness he smiled.|$|E
60|$|A fight started somewhere, full of loud curses {{and dull}} blows; {{and then a}} jostling mass tried the temper of the slow-marching men. Some boss yelled an order from a <b>box-car,</b> and he was hooted. There was no order. When the train whistled for Benton a hoarse and {{sustained}} shout ran through the mob, not from all lips, nor from any massed group, but taken up from man to man--a strange sound, the first note of calling Benton.|$|E
60|$|Neale was {{all eyes}} when he rode into that {{construction}} camp. The place was a bedlam. A motley horde of men appeared to be doing everything under the sun but work, {{and most of them}} seemed particularly eager to board a long train of <b>box-cars</b> and little old passenger-coaches. Neale made a dive for the train, and his sojourn in that camp was a short and exciting one of ten minutes.|$|R
60|$|The little crowd {{broke and}} melted {{into the shadows}} behind and under the <b>box-cars.</b> Kurt crawled under a car and between the wheels, from which vantage-point he looked out. Glidden's gang were there in the red glow, most of them now standing. The sentry who had given the alarm still sat {{on top of the}} flat-car, {{swinging}} his legs. His companions, however, had jumped down. Kurt heard men of his own party crawling and whispering behind him, and he saw dim, dark, sprawling forms under {{the far end of the}} car.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he thought}} of the strenuous round of army duties, of {{training}} tasks, of traveling in cold <b>box-cars,</b> of endless marches, of camps and villages, of drills and billets. Never to be forgotten was that morning, now seemingly long ago, when an officer had ordered the battalion to pack. [...] "We are going to the front!" [...] he announced. Magic words! What excitement, what whooping, what bragging and joy among the boys, what hurry and bustle and remarkable efficiency! That had been a reality of actual experience, but the meaning of it, the terrible significance, had been beyond the mind of any American.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] he replied. [...] "Keep {{me in the}} running. Well, I took my {{handful of}} copy paper down to the {{railroad}} yards (for local color), dangled my legs from a side-door Pullman, which is another name for a <b>box-car,</b> and ran off the stuff. Of course I made it clever and brilliant and all that, with my little unanswerable slings {{at the state and}} my social paradoxes, and withal made it concrete enough to dissatisfy the average citizen.|$|E
60|$|In conclusion, I {{want to tell}} of what {{happened}} when I {{reached the end of}} the division. On single-track, transcontinental lines, the freight trains wait at the divisions and follow out after the passenger trains. When the division was reached, I left my train, and looked for the freight that would pull out behind it. I found the freight, made up on a side-track and waiting. I climbed into a <b>box-car</b> half full of coal and lay down. In no time I was asleep.|$|E
60|$|He {{could see}} plainly, and stole {{up to his}} {{objective}} point, with little risk to himself until he climbed upon the <b>box-car.</b> He crouched low, almost on hands and knees, and finally gained the long shadow of a shed between the tracks. Then he ran past the derrick {{to the dark side}} of the car. He could now plainly see the revolver flashes and could hear the thud and spang of their bullets striking. Drawing a deep breath, Kurt climbed up the iron ladder on {{the dark side of the}} car.|$|E
60|$|Anderson was the scout. He rode up on a foam-lashed mustang, and got off, {{dark and}} grimy with dust. His report {{was that he}} had been unable {{to get in touch with}} any {{soldiers}} or laborers along the line, but he had seen enough with his own eyes. Half-way between the camp and Benton a large force of Sioux had torn up the track, halted and fired the work-train. A desperate battle was being fought, with the odds against the workmen, for the reason that the train of <b>box-cars</b> was burning. Troops must be rushed to the rescue.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile the blazes {{from the}} <b>box-cars</b> died out, {{leaving only the}} dull glow from the red heap {{that had once been}} the elevators. However, this gave forth light enough for any one to be seen a few rods distant. Sparks had ceased to fall, and from that source no further danger need be apprehended. Olsen had been going from man to man, sending those who were not armed home for guns. So it came about that half an hour after Kurt's arrival a score of farmers, villagers, and a few railroaders were {{collected}} in a group, listening to the pale-faced Olsen.|$|R
6000|$|The collarless man mopped his head, {{and replied}} that, {{in the present}} state of the yard and freight and a few other things, the {{engineer}} would switch and keep on switching till the cows came home. [...] .007 pushed out gingerly, his heart in his headlight, so nervous that the clang of his own bell almost made him jump the track. Lanterns waved, or danced up and down, before and behind him; and on every side, six tracks deep, sliding backward and forward, with clashings of couplers and squeals of hand-brakes, were cars--more cars than [...] .007 had dreamed of. There were oil-cars, and hay-cars, and stock-cars full of lowing beasts, and ore-cars, and potato-cars with stovepipe-ends sticking out in the middle; cold-storage and refrigerator cars dripping ice water on the tracks; ventilated fruit--and milk-cars; flatcars with truck-wagons full of market-stuff; flat-cars loaded with reapers and binders, all red and green and gilt under the sizzling electric lights; flat-cars piled high with strong-scented hides, pleasant hemlock-plank, or bundles of shingles; flat-cars creaking to the weight of thirty-ton castings, angle-irons, and rivet-boxes for some new bridge; and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of <b>box-cars</b> loaded, locked, and chalked. Men--hot and angry--crawled among and between and under the thousand wheels; men took flying jumps through his cab, when he halted for a moment; men sat on his pilot as he went forward, and on his tender as he returned; and regiments of men ran along the tops of the <b>box-cars</b> beside him, screwing down brakes, waving their arms, and crying curious things.|$|R
6000|$|... "We camped up {{country and}} didn't {{come back to}} clean up until next day. It was some cleaning. Every flat-car, <b>box-car,</b> coach, {{asthmatic}} switch engine, and even hand-car that mob of Spiggoties had shoved off the dock into sixty feet of water {{on top of the}} Governor Hancock. They'd burnt the round house, set fire to the coal bunkers, and made a scandal of the repair shops. Oh, yes, and there were three of our fellows they'd got that we had to bury mighty quick. It's hot weather all the time down there." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{put him in}} a roomy <b>box-car</b> and bedded him {{knee-deep in}} clean yellow straw. I padded the {{hitching}} pole with his blanket, moistened his hay, and put some bran before him. Then I nailed him in and took my leave of him with some nervous dread, for the worst part of his journey was before him. He must cross three great mountain ranges and ride eight days, over more than two thousand miles of railway. I could not well go with him, but I planned to overhaul him at Spokane and see how he was coming on.|$|E
60|$|He had {{piled into}} an open <b>box-car.</b> It was empty, at least of freight, and the floor {{appeared}} to have a thin covering of hay. The train, gathering headway, made a rattling rolling roar. Kurt hesitated about getting up and groping back in the pitch-black corners of the car. He felt that it contained a presence besides his own. And suddenly he was startled by an object blacker than the shadow, that sidled up close to him. Kurt could not keep the cold chills from chasing {{up and down his}} back. The object was a man, who reached for Kurt and felt of him with a skinny hand.|$|E
60|$|But {{the beams}} or cleats I found myself on {{were not the}} broad, generous ones that at that time were usually on <b>box-cars.</b> On the contrary, they were very narrow--not more than {{an inch and a}} half in breadth. I couldn't get half of the width of my sole on them. Then there was nothing to which to hold with my hands. True, there were the ends of the two box-cars; but those ends were flat, {{perpendicular}} surfaces. There were no grips. I could only press the flats of my palms against the car-ends for support. But that would have been all right if the cleats for my feet had been decently wide.|$|R
40|$|A 75 -year-old man {{presented}} {{to us with}} sudden onset of profound vision loss in his right eye and was identified as suffering from an ophthalmic artery occlusion. Apart from the retinal whitening and <b>box-carring</b> of the retinal arteries, there were characteristic triangular patches of retinal whitening in the midperipheral temporal fundus indicating a previous lateral posterior choroidal artery occlusion. The patient was a chronic smoker and had dyslipidemia. The carotid Doppler study showed complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery. The presence of these triangular patches of retinal whitening or amalric sign can therefore herald a more proximal vessel occlusion. Hence such patients require evaluation on an emergency basis. The characteristic features of the patches on fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography are discussed here...|$|R
60|$|That was {{the last}} I saw of him for weary days. I hit the high places across those {{hundreds}} of miles of Nevada desert, riding the overlands at night, for speed, and in the day-time riding in <b>box-cars</b> and getting my sleep. It was early in the year, and it was cold in those upland pastures. Snow lay here and there on the level, all the mountains were shrouded in white, and at night the most miserable wind imaginable blew off from them. It was not a land in which to linger. And remember, gentle reader, the hobo goes through such a land, without shelter, without money, begging his way and sleeping at night without blankets. This last is something that can be realized only by experience.|$|R
6000|$|I {{arrived in}} Reno, Nevada, in a <b>box-car</b> that was {{promptly}} side-tracked. It was a Sunday morning, and after I threw my feet for breakfast, I wandered {{over to the}} Piute camp to watch the Indians gambling. And there stood the Swede, hugely interested. Of course we got together. He was the only acquaintance I had in that region, and I was his only acquaintance. We rushed together {{like a couple of}} dissatisfied hermits, and together we spent the day, threw our feet for dinner, and late in the afternoon tried to [...] "nail" [...] the same freight. But he was ditched, and I rode her out alone, to be ditched myself in the desert twenty miles beyond.|$|E
6000|$|... "To h----l {{with the}} {{newspapers}}," [...] he growled. [...] "What do they spell but brag and blow and boodle in <b>box-car</b> letters? Suppose they do {{take up a}} case--what does it amount to? The police are easy enough to fool; but what do the newspapers do? They send a lot of pin-head reporters around to the scene; and they make for the nearest saloon and have beer while they take photos of the bartender's oldest daughter in evening dress, to print as the fiancée {{of the young man}} in the tenth story, who thought he heard a noise below {{on the night of the}} murder. That's about as near as the newspapers ever come to running down Mr. Burglar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No? Of {{course this}} ain't your regular business, but say, don't you think it's interestin'? Have {{you seen the}} yard-master? Well, he's the {{greatest}} man on earth, an' don't you forget it. When are we through? Why, kid, it's always like this, day an' night--Sundays an' week-days. See that thirty-car freight slidin' in four, no, five tracks off? She's all mixed freight, sent here to be sorted out into straight trains. That's why we're cuttin' out the cars one by one." [...] He gave a vigorous push to a west-bound car as he spoke, and started back with a little snort of surprise, for the car was an old friend--an M. T. K. <b>box-car.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Pugad Baboy group finally arrives back in 1992 {{aboard the}} same LRT car, but now {{have no memory}} of their adventures in 2078. They wonder why Polgas lies spread-eagled on the <b>box-car's</b> rear windshield. They also notice that his Garapata Gun looked {{different}} and that it now shoots at longer range. The OCB Weapons and Armaments laboratory analyzes the weapon, but could not determine the exact kind of metal used in its construction, but notes its built-in laser sight, a satellite transceiver, and an etching engraved on the trigger housing - [...] "Dobermaxx". Since his memory of the events of 2078 had been erased, Polgas could only speculate on where the new Garapata Gun came from and decides to adopt [...] "Dobermaxx" [...] as his new OCB callsign.|$|R
60|$|But he doesn't try to slug me, {{and that}} problem is settled. Instead, {{he starts to}} lead me back toward the train, and another {{possible}} problem arises. I see the lanterns of the conductor and the other shack. We are approaching them. Not for nothing have I made the acquaintance of the New York police. Not for nothing, in <b>box-cars,</b> by water-tanks, and in prison-cells, have I listened to bloody tales of man-handling. What if these three men are about to man-handle me? Heaven knows I have given them provocation enough. I think quickly. We are drawing nearer and nearer {{to the other two}} trainmen. I line up the stomach and the jaw of my captor, and plan the right and left I'll give him {{at the first sign of}} trouble.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the whistle}} sounded. The page was done. We sprang to our feet and strung out {{alongside}} the track. There she came, coughing and spluttering up the grade, the headlight turning night into day and silhouetting us in sharp relief. The engine passed {{us, and we}} were all running with the train, some boarding on the side-ladders, others [...] "springing" [...] the side-doors of empty <b>box-cars</b> and climbing in. I caught a flat-car loaded with mixed lumber and crawled away into a comfortable nook. I lay on my back with a newspaper under my head for a pillow. Above me the stars were winking and wheeling in squadrons back and forth as the train rounded the curves, and watching them I fell asleep. The day was done--one day of all my days. To-morrow would be another day, and I was young.|$|R
