5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology. Since the 1970s, {{a variety of}} techniques have been developed to specifically add, remove and edit genes in an organism. Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the <b>break</b> <b>is</b> repaired. The related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism.|$|E
5|$|In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, {{and played}} Boston in the Finals {{for the first}} time since 1969. The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast <b>break</b> <b>is</b> {{credited}} as a turning point of the series. Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.|$|E
5|$|Quantum <b>Break</b> <b>is</b> an action-adventure {{video game}} played from a third-person perspective. Players play as Jack Joyce, who has time {{manipulation}} powers {{in a world}} where time stutters, making everything freeze except Joyce. Players face a variety of enemies, including Monarch security guards; Strikers, who are equipped with specially-designed suits which allow them to manipulate time; and Juggernauts, heavily armored enemies equipped with very strong firearms. Different enemies have different behaviors, and the game requires players to deploy different tactics and strategies in order to defeat them.|$|E

40|$|The {{yields of}} unrepairable single-and double-strand {{breaks in the}} DNA of x-irradiated Chinese hamster cells were {{measured}} by low-speed neutral and alkaline sucrose density gradient sedimentation in order to investigate the relation between these lesions and reproductive death. After maximal single-strand remoining, at all doses, the number of residual single-strand <b>breaks</b> <b>was</b> {{twice the number of}} residual double-strand breaks. Both double-strand and unrepairable single-strand <b>breaks</b> <b>were</b> proportional to the square of absorbed dose, in the range 10 - 50 krad. No rejoining of double-strand <b>breaks</b> <b>was</b> observed. These observations suggest that, in mammalian cells, most double-strand <b>breaks</b> <b>are</b> not repairable, while all single-strand <b>breaks</b> <b>are</b> repaired except those that are sufficiently close on complementary strands to constitute double-strand breaks. Comparison with cell survival measurements at much lower doses suggests that loss of reproductive capacity corresponds to induction of approximately one double-strand break...|$|R

5|$|Prison <b>Break</b> <b>is</b> an American {{television}} serial drama {{created by}} Paul Scheuring, that was broadcast on Fox for four seasons, with 81 episodes from August 29, 2005 to May 15, 2009, and a fifth season which aired from April 4, to May 30, 2017. The series revolves around two brothers, {{one of whom}} has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, and the other who devises an elaborate plan to help his brother escape prison and clear his name. The series was produced by Adelstein-Parouse Productions, in association with Original Television and 20th Century Fox Television. Along with creator Paul Scheuring, the series is executive produced by Matt Olmstead, Kevin Hooks, Marty Adelstein, Dawn Parouse, Neal H. Moritz, and Brett Ratner who directed the pilot episode. The series' theme music, composed by Ramin Djawadi, {{was nominated for a}} Primetime Emmy Award in 2006.|$|E
5|$|After being {{admitted}} to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion. While the sport's lack of a following {{in much of the}} world was a factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the National Hockey League now does during the Winter Olympic Games. Such a <b>break</b> <b>is</b> more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather. Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players, but the effort failed. Major League Baseball initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede the major league season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.|$|E

50|$|Double-strand breaks, both {{intentional}} and unintentional, regularly {{occur in}} cells. Unintentional <b>breaks</b> <b>are</b> commonly generated by ionizing radiation, various exogenous and endogenous chemical agents, and halted replication forks. Intentional <b>breaks</b> <b>are</b> generated as intermediaries in meiosis and V(D)J recombination, which are primarily repaired through homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. Both cases require the ends in double strand <b>breaks</b> <b>be</b> processed by nucleases before repair can take place. One such nuclease is Mre11 complexed with Rad50. Mutations of Mre11 can precipitate ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder.|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} gauge {{symmetry}} breaking mechanism due to orbifold projections in orbifold model building. We explicitly show {{the existence of}} a scale of breaking if such a symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>is</b> due to freely-acting orbifold operators only, i. e. in case the <b>breaking</b> <b>is</b> realized non-locally in the internal space. We show that such a scale is related to the compactification moduli only, and that there are no extra continuous parameters, at least in semirealistic models with N = 1 SUSY in four dimensions. In this sense, the mechanism is peculiarly different from the standard Higgs (or Hosotani) symmetry breaking mechanism. We show that the mechanism also differs from that present in standard orbifold models where, even in presence of discrete Wilson lines, a scale of <b>breaking</b> <b>is</b> generically missing, since the <b>breaking</b> <b>is</b> localized in specific points in the internal space. We review a set of background geometries where the described non-local <b>breaking</b> <b>is</b> realized, both in the case of two and six extra dimensions. In the latter case, relevant in string model building, we consider both heterotic and open string compactifications...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of {{the future}} {{behaviour}} of economic variables can be biased if structural <b>breaks</b> <b>are</b> not considered. When these structural <b>breaks</b> <b>are</b> present, the in-sample fit of a model gives us a poor guide to ex ante forecast performance. This problem is true for both univariate and multivariate analysis and can be extremely important when co-integration relationships are analysed. The main goal {{of this article is}} to analyse the impact of structural breaks on forecast accuracy evaluation. We focus on forecasting several interest rates from the Spanish interbank money market. In order to carry out the analysis, we perform two forecasting exercises: (a) without structural breaks and (b) when structural <b>breaks</b> <b>are</b> explicitly considered. We use new sequential methods in order to estimate change-points in an endogenous way. This method allows us to detect structural breaks in all four rates in May 1993. However, the effects of these <b>breaks</b> <b>are</b> not very strong, since we found scarce gains in forecasting accuracy when the structural <b>breaks</b> <b>are</b> included in the models. ...|$|R
