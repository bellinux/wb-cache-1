5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in frontman Sam Eastgate's bedroom in Castle Donington, England, and at several locations in London. It went through a fractured creative process that lasted {{for more than two}} years. It was eventually produced by Eastgate and DJ Erol Alkan between 2007 and 2008. Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> does not contain a unifying musical or lyrical theme; rather, it is a collage of all the ideas, genres, and studio effects that fascinated the band members and Alkan, especially during live recording sessions. The record was very well received by critics. It was often treated {{as one of the best}} British albums of 2008 because of its eclecticism and spirit of invention. Late of the Pier did not record any further albums following the death of drummer Ross Dawson in 2015.|$|E

500|$|Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> {{figured in}} several publications' end-of-year best album lists for 2008, notably, at number three by Clash, at number five by FACT, and at number 18 by NME. It was ranked at number 16 in HMV's Poll of Polls for 2008, which {{aggregates}} {{the votes of}} prominent British critics to decide the commercial group's Album Of The Year. Earlier in 2008, Rory Carroll of Artrocker claimed that the record {{would have been a}} late entrant for the Mercury Music Prize, and would have probably won the award, if nominations had been made in August rather than July 2008. Because of their work on the album, Late of the Pier received a nomination for Best New Band at the 2009 NME Awards. Two tracks were also nominated: [...] "Bathroom Gurgle" [...] and [...] "Heartbeat", in the Best Dancefloor Filler and Best Video categories respectively. In 2009, Clash placed Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> at number 40 in its list of the 50 Greatest Albums, 2004–2009, while FACT included it at number 99 in its editorial staff list of the 100 Best: Albums of the Decade.|$|E
500|$|Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> is {{the debut}} and only studio album by British dance-punk band Late of the Pier. It was {{released}} on 30 July 2008 in Japan through Toshiba EMI and on 4 August 2008 in the British Isles on Parlophone, the band's primary label. Five tracks had already been released as singles in the United Kingdom: [...] "Bathroom Gurgle", [...] "The Bears Are Coming", [...] "Space and the Woods" [...] and [...] "Focker" [...] as a double A-side, and [...] "Heartbeat". The record peaked at number 28 on the UK Albums Chart, but failed to chart in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Media {{response}} to Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> was highly favourable; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 81% based on 18 critical reviews. AllMusic's K. Ross Hoffman described the album as [...] "glorious and galvanising" [...] and labelled it [...] "a convoluted construction crammed {{with so many}} immediately gratifying moments that it takes multiple listens to extricate them all". John Burgess of The Guardian explained that a new favourite song, riff, or wayward moment can be found every time that the album is listened to. Tim Chester of NME [...] concluded, [...] "It takes {{a certain kind of}} mind to make this. While others whinge about living and dying in cul-de-sac towns shackled by cul-de-sac imaginations, LOTP's vision is housed on Dubai's 'The World' island-creation project." ...|$|E

500|$|Late of the Pier {{started using}} the album working title Interesting Adventure in 2006 after practising in Eastgate's bedroom {{for about a}} year and previewed their new {{material}} at the Liars Club in Nottingham. After receiving contract offers from Parlophone and Atlantic Records, the band members signed to Parlophone because the label gave them total autonomy over the recording process without pressuring them to be commercially successful immediately. The record deal was followed by the recording of an EP titled Zarcorp Demo, from which a demo single, [...] "Space and the Woods", was released in March 2007. Eastgate has claimed that the band members were influenced by the music of the 1980s during these formative stages of Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> even though none of them were born before 1986.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} for Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> was largely unplanned. The verses of [...] "Broken" [...] were {{conceived}} {{late at night}} and are inspired by insomnia. It took Eastgate a long time to describe how he was feeling [...] "in a way that sounded original" [...] for such a common theme in pop music. The lyrics in the chorus are about the first time Late of the Pier drove to London and got lost. [...] "Space and the Woods" [...] tries to weigh up what is more important: a person or an inanimate object, or an absence of anything, while [...] "The Bears Are Coming" [...] concerns [...] "a silent threat". The idea for the lyric [...] "A heartbeat, a flicker, a line" [...] in [...] "Heartbeat" [...] came to Eastgate while recording the song and hearing its time signature always changing.|$|E
500|$|In late 2007, Late of the Pier {{formally}} met renowned DJ Erol Alkan {{after seeing}} him play a {{set at the}} Liars Club. Alkan called them [...] "THE most exciting band around" [...] and offered the band members help in the recording process of Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel.</b> They accepted and made him producer for the album because of the immediate rapport that developed between the two parties. Dawson has explained the choice of producer by suggesting that Alkan is famous for playing broad genres of music and that he understands the properties and crossover of dance and guitar music. Alkan fully embraced the band members' ideas and immediately understood what {{they were trying to}} achieve. [...] "Bathroom Gurgle" [...] was recorded by the new collaboration and was released as a limited edition single in September 2007.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} process for Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> gathered pace around December 2007. Late of the Pier usually proceeded by taking bedroom recordings into the studio, {{where they were}} refined by Alkan into [...] "a more presentable package". They tried unconventional techniques {{in the style of}} avant garde producer Joe Meek during the live studio recording sessions, including stamping in baths and reamping guitars through air vents. When tracks were mixed after being recorded, the band members, Alkan, and engineer Jimmy Robertson worked in tandem and unanimously decided when a track had finished undergoing the studio effects process. No songs changed after this point, even when one of the parties had further ideas. At the time, {{in an interview with the}} band, Stuart Turnbull of the BBC Collective indicated that Alkan managed to [...] "channel Late of the Pier's sonic attack into something more focused yet still undeniably different".|$|E
500|$|Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> {{is largely}} built on sonic {{experiments}} {{and the use}} of studio and computer techniques. The opening track, [...] "Hot Tent Blues", is an instrumental short which contains seven layers of electric guitar run through a Zoom 506 bass guitar pedal. [...] "Broken" [...] was conceived during a jam session between Eastgate's guitar riffs and Dawson's drumming, while a demo of [...] "Space and the Woods" [...] similar to the Nirvana song [...] "All Apologies" [...] was reworked and remixed in the studio. Eastgate credits Storm Mortimer, who used to drive Late of the Pier around London, as the muse for [...] "The Bears Are Coming". She often sang impromptu and the frontman eventually borrowed a page of her songs and added an afrobeat-inspired rhythm to it. Eastgate and Dawson wanted to create a track that evoked the idea of [...] "coming out of the jungle" [...] and credit varied musical acts like Slagsmålsklubben, Prince, The Beatles, Mr Flash, FrYars, and Lutricia McNeal as inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Having officially {{formed a}} band {{under the name}} Late of the Pier in 2004, {{childhood}} friends Sam Eastgate, Andrew Faley, Sam Potter, and the late Ross Dawson initially developed {{the sound of their}} first album by listening to the alternative dance music of British ensemble The Prodigy and the grunge music of American band Nirvana. They soon branched out into listening to diverse genres from the last 40 years of music, including Motown and soul. Potter has treated their conception of Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> as a reaction to [...] "mediocre, complacent indie-schmindie bands who find a sound and stick to it; whose songs sound exactly the same", while lead writer and composer Eastgate has pointed out that they wanted to [...] "take people past their own limits". The nascent recording stages took place in Eastgate's bedroom, where unconventional time signatures and experimental chords were performed because, at the time, no band member could play an instrument properly.|$|E

40|$|Conductive polymer {{composites}} {{were prepared}} by sintering {{a mixture of}} ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) powder and carbon black. Two processing parameters - time and temperature - were shown to have a notable effect on the resistivity of the composites. The relationships between the processing parameters and morphology were studied using optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results of the optical microscopy studies indicate that the carbon black is distributed in the interfacial regions between the UHMWPE particles. The dimension of the carbon <b>black</b> <b>channels</b> increases with the carbon black concentration. TEM micrographs show that {{a high degree of}} intermixing between the carbon black and the polymer occurs at higher temperatures and longer processing times, resulting in higher resistivities. A positive temperature coefficient (PTC) effect was observed for these materials. A mechanism for the PTC effect in this system is proposed. The magnitude of the PTC effect is found to be inversely proportional to the dimension of the carbon <b>black</b> <b>channels</b> in the composites. The dimension {{is directly related to the}} carbon black concentration. The PTC effect is a result of the polymer volume expansion caused by melting of the crystallites, A large PTC effect is observed for the composites with a low carbon black concentration and vice versa. No negative temperature effect (NTC) is observed at temperatures substantially above the melting point of the polymer...|$|R
500|$|The {{record was}} nearly {{completed}} {{by the end of}} January 2008. Late of the Pier stopped recording to embark on a headlining UK tour during the month of February, in which they previewed new material. [...] "The Bears Are Coming" [...] was released as a vinyl single in March 2008. The band toured until the end of April 2008 to promote another single—a double A-side containing a reworked [...] "Space and the Woods" [...] and [...] "Focker"—from the as-yet-unreleased Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel.</b> Studio work with Alkan restarted in May 2008 to put the finishing touches on the album; the final version was christened as [...] "a compilation of hits" [...] and [...] "anti-pop pop". The album was recorded during six months in different studios and the band members have admitted that the variety in venues partially explains why it sounds disjointed. The idea of having a single 45-minute track instead of a track list of songs was mooted at the end of May 2008, but was not followed through.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{classified}} Fantasy <b>Black</b> <b>Channel</b> {{into the}} British New Rave genre and musical scene. Others {{claimed that they}} could hear impressions of Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry and musician Gary Numan in the recording. Pitchfork Media's Adam Moerder commented that it contains several New Rave compositions which are aesthetically dubious. Chris Baynes of PopMatters claimed that the band members [...] "wear their influences pretty much inked onto their sleeves", but concluded that the album is exciting and excitable in equal measure. According to Late of the Pier, comparisons to Klaxons and New Rave are the results of lazy journalism, especially for a scene the band has never been in. Eastgate has explained that musical influences are often subconscious, even though the band members tried not to listen to anything but their own work while recording the album. Nick Mitchell of The Skinny {{pointed out that the}} record is [...] "an unrestrained, unclassifiable, unexpectedly triumphant romp through blaring influences and genres, from the 70s camp rock of Queen and Bowie to the primitive electronics of Gary Numan, with echoes of 90s computer games and snatches of modern house".|$|E

5000|$|My band, Attila and the Huns, were so {{impressed}} with Harvey Scales' live performance that we decided {{right then and there}} that we would start doing more soul music. We eventually became so good at it that we ended up changing the band name to Filet of Soul. Many of the recordings we did managed to fool the black radio station execs into playing our music on solid black stations. This was Lenny's idea. He knew he could promote a white band through his predominately <b>black</b> <b>channels</b> and he knew that he could also get plays on white stations as well.|$|R
6000|$|It {{seems to}} me that I remember, somewhere in the {{realistic}} novel I have mentioned [...] "Le Feu"--reading of singing soldiers, and an assumption on the part of their hearers that such songs are prompted only by a devil-may-care lightness of heart which the soldier achieves. A shallow psychology (as the author points out), especially in these days of trench warfare! The soldier sings to hide his real feelings, perhaps to give vent to them. I am reminded of all this in connection with my trip to the British front. I left London after lunch on one of those dreary, grey days to which I have referred; the rain had begun to splash angrily against the panes of the car windows before we reached the coast. At five o'clock the boat pushed off into a <b>black</b> <b>channel,</b> whipped by a gale that drove the rain across the decks and into every passage and gangway. The steamer was literally loaded with human beings, officers and men returning from a brief glimpse of home. There was nothing of the glory of war in the embarkation, and, to add to the sad and sinister effect of it, each man as he came aboard mounted the ladder and chose, from a pile on the hatch combing, a sodden life-preserver, which he flung around his shoulders as he went in search of a shelter. The saloon below, where we had our tea, was lighted indeed, but sealed so tight as to be insupportable; and the cabin above, stifling too, was dark as a pocket. One stumbled over unseen passengers on the lounges, or sitting on kits on the floor. Even the steps up which I groped my way to the deck above were filled, while on the deck there was standing-room only and not much of that. Mal de mer added to the discomforts of many. At length I found an uncertain refuge in a gangway amidships, hedged in between unseen companions; but even here the rain stung our faces and the spray of an occasional comber drenched our feet, while through the gloom of the night only a few yards of white water were to be discerned. For three hours I stood there, trying to imagine what was in the minds of these men with whose bodies I was in such intimate contact. They were going to a foreign land to fight, many of them to die, not in one of those adventurous campaigns of times gone by, but in the wet trenches or the hideous No Man's Land between. What were the images they summoned up in the darkness? Visions of long-familiar homes and long-familiar friends? And just how were they facing the future? Even as I wondered, voices rose in a song, English voices, soldier voices. It was not [...] "Tipperary," [...] the song that thrilled us a few years ago. I strove to catch the words: ...|$|E
