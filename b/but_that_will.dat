Books will be harder to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E

25|$|Barcelona {{is governed}} by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a {{four-year}} term by universal suffrage. As {{one of the two}} biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006. According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level. This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions. It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> need a favourable report from the council.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{opened their}} Champions League {{campaign}} with a 3–0 defeat against Inter Milan. Goals from Julio Ricardo Cruz, Andy van der Meyde and Obafemi Martins {{all in the}} first half extended Arsenal's run of six home games in the competition without a win. Wenger said afterwards: [...] "We can complain and cry the whole night <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> not change the result. The only {{thing we can do is}} to respond." [...] The team, without Campbell and Vieira, earned a draw away to Lokomotiv Moscow, but remained bottom of the group. Arsenal lost to Dynamo Kyiv in late October; Wenger's decision to shift from his preferred 4–4–2 formation caused the team to play more narrow than usual. Cole scored the winning goal in the reverse fixture at Highbury. A cross by Wiltord was flicked on by Henry in the direction of an incoming Cole, who dived to head the ball past goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovskiy.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{years after}} the World Cup, on 1 June 1968, the two teams met again in another {{friendly}} match, this time in West Germany, in which the Germans won their first victory over an English team, 38 {{years after the}}y had first played. The scoreline was 1–0, Franz Beckenbauer scoring for West Germany, but as Hugh McIlvanney wrote in his match report for The Observer: [...] "Comparing this miserable {{hour and a half}} (in which fouls far outnumbered examples of creative football) with the last great meeting between the countries is entirely fatuous. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> not prevent the Germans from doing it. Their celebrations will not be inhibited by the knowledge that today's losers were almost a reserve team, and even the agonies of boredom they shared with us will now seem worthwhile. They have beaten England, and that is enough." ...|$|E

Anderson supports tribal rights charity Survival International, an organization that champions tribal peoples {{around the world and}} in early 2010 she participated in a performance in a London stage fundraiser for its cause. In February 2011, Anderson narrated a short film about recent footage of an uncontacted tribe, in which the Amazon Indians were spotted from the air on the Brazil-Peru border. Anderson has said: [...] "What comes across powerfully from this amazing footage is how healthy and confident these people appear. I hope they can be left alone – <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> only happen if the loggers are stopped." [...] In June 2011, Anderson became an ambassador for Survival International. In September 2015, Anderson was among the artists who signed a letter calling for a new approach to conservation that would respect tribal peoples' rights.|$|E
2500|$|Soak {{the seven}} drugs in this, then decant {{the mixture into}} a vase; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> still not do. After leaving the drugs to {{macerate}} for three nights, take them out {{and put them in}} the sun to dry out. (Then) again take the aforesaid liquor and steep (the seven drugs) in it for three nights. Once more draw off (the wine) from them {{and put them in the}} sun (and continue this alternative steeping in the wine and drying them) until the wine is exhausted; then stop putting them out to dry. Pound them in an iron mortar and put them through a fine sieve to reduce them to powder. Then take white honey and mix the powder with it for making pills. In the morning, facing East, roll two pills the size of a small pea; then increase this by one pill (each day) to ten or more. This regimen cures third-degree fever within the belly, it truly makes the breath rise up in such a way that the heart and breast are freed of all obstruction, coagulates the flesh and skin, makes the body light and produces a halo around it. When a whole dose has been taken, the cereal Worms die; when the Worms are dead the Corpses dry out; when they are dry, they drop down by themselves. This has to be done several times, not restricting oneself to a single dose. (tr. Maspero 1981: 336) ...|$|E
