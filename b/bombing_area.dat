50|$|In 1936, ADGB was {{abolished}} as a command, {{with the}} <b>Bombing</b> <b>Area</b> becoming Bomber Command and the Fighting Area becoming Fighter Command and remaining {{responsible for the}} ADGB function.

However, the changing threat meant that AA defences were needed for many more potential targets in the British Isles, notably industries important for war production. The AA component became 1st AA Division, and in 1937, 2nd AA Division was formed to defend the Midlands, with AA Command created to replace the previous Army arrangements.|$|E

50|$|In 1942, SR 25 {{appeared}} {{to have a significant}} gap in its route. State maps from the time show a large area within Nye and Lincoln Counties where all roads had been removed. The route existed in one piece again by 1946, although it had been realigned northward and shortened to 111 mi. A sizable portion of SR 25 passing through the Tonopah U.S. Army Air Force Bombing Range (now the Nellis Air Force Range and Nevada Test Site) was restricted from public travel by 1950, the restricted section being approximately the same area that was removed in 1942. To avoid the restricted area of the testing range, the west end of SR 25 was realigned by 1957. The highway connected to US 6 at Warm Springs about 37 mi east of the previous terminus, heading north around the Reveille Range instead of climbing the Kawich Range within the <b>bombing</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

50|$|The trophy was {{originally}} awarded in a competition held between bomber squadrons of the Air Defence of Great Britain, which {{came in the}} Wessex <b>Bombing</b> <b>Area</b> — the precursor of Bomber Command. Wing Commander Charles Portal, commander of No. 7 Squadron, won the trophy in its initial year of 1927, and then again in 1928. The 1928 contest {{took place at the}} North Coates Fitties bombing range where Portal, in a Vickers Virginia flying at 10000 ft, dropped his bombs to within 30 - 40 yd of the target. From 1930 until 1936, the competition was confined to night bombing squadrons in home commands, and was then in abeyance until revived in 1949, when it was awarded to the Bomber Command squadron showing the best all-round excellence in training throughout the year. The annual awards gradually petered out in the late 1950s. In 2011 the trophy was found to be at the official residence of the Chief of the Air Staff, and at their request was transferred to the Officer's Mess of No. 57 Squadron at RAF Wyton. In August 2013 No. 57 Squadron also acquired Captain Minôt's Military Cross, presented to them by one of his last remaining relatives.|$|E

[...] In early 1918 Steel was appointed Officer Commanding No. 58 Wing which was based at Eastchurch and in March, at the age of 40, Steel learned to fly. Meanwhile, he became General Officer Commanding No. 8 Group. On 1 April 1918 the Royal Naval Air Service merged with the Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force. Steel, like other RNAS personnel transferred to the RAF and was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general. Promoted to group captain and then air commodore in 1919 he was appointed Deputy Chief of the Air Staff and Director of Operations and Intelligence and, following his promotion to air vice marshal in 1925, he was made Air Officer Commanding the Wessex <b>Bombing</b> <b>Area</b> and then Air Officer Commanding RAF India. He was promoted to air marshal in 1932 and appointed Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Air Defence of Great Britain in August 1935.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of cytogenetic studies in sheep from the region of Bujanovac that was contaminated by depleted uranium during the NATO air strikes in 1999. The study was conducted on sheep blood lymphocytes, {{in order to determine the}} frequency of chromosomal aberrations and to assess the presence of genetic risk as a result of the possible impact of depleted uranium. Blood samples for lymphocyte cultures were taken at random from the 20 animals of the households in the village of Borovac, near Bujanovac. The animals were chosen because they were pastured, fed, and watered in the NATO <b>bombing</b> <b>area.</b> With the purpose of comparing the results two control groups were cytogenetically analyzed, each consisted of 20 sheep from Zemun and Ovča, two northern localities that were not contaminated with depleted uranium. The established structural chromosomal changes were of breaks and gap types, and their frequencies in sheep of all surveyed localities were within the range of basic level values that are commonly found in the sheep lymphocyte cultures analyses. Significant differences are apparent between the values defined in the sheep from Bujanovac compared to those obtained in the sheep from the northern locality (Zemun), probably as a result of breeding of animals in the farm conditions and their being less exposed to the impact of environmental agents. There were neither elevated values of polyploid and aneuploid cells nor significant differences between the sites. According to earlier known data, depleted uranium was below the detection limit of the method applied both in the soil and feed given to cytogenetically analyzed animals. Based on the low-level changes that are in the range of the basic level changes, commonly observed in sheep lymphocytes control cultures, it cannot be said with certainty that it was depleted uranium that caused the changes, or that it is wide-spread in the region of Bujanovac.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to analyze the various {{counter-terrorism}} strategies undertaken by Indonesia and to explain the reasons of the Indonesian government chose those strategies. Moreover, this study explores generally and theoretically the differences of Indonesian strategies from other state???s strategies on countering terrorism as well as the actions taken to implement the strategies. This thesis also verifies the success of strategies in combating terrorism. Finally, this thesis investigates the Indonesian people in general support government strategies. This thesis is a theoretical-based qualitative study. It is eclectic and uses several approaches including interviews, historical method of study, and document analysis. This thesis implements indirect strategy to analyze the combat terrorism in Indonesia. Indirect strategy emphasizes diplomatic and economic as an indirect pressure, then political deterrence and military coercion as a direct pressure. The result has shown that there were some reasons so that the Indonesian government chose these strategies namely, maintaining stability and peace in the region generally, particularly in Indonesia and rebuilding the Indonesian economy because the terrorist attack devastated much of the infrastructure of the <b>bombing</b> <b>area.</b> Then, the actions were taken by the Indonesian government to implement these strategies such as, building the capacity through education, the civilian security and law enforcement personnel has joined in ATA (Anti-Terrorism Assistance) program in fighting terrorism, and freezing and preventing access to account of the organization terrorist as well as prosecute or extradite person involved in organization terrorist. Furthermore, through the winning the hearts and minds of people strategy, various religious and civil society groups support the government efforts to fight terrorism. This is one of indicator if the Indonesian government has been successful to combat terrorism. In addition, the Indonesian Government has successfully made arrests and convictions since the first Bali bombings in 2002, with more than 220 suspects jailed for terrorist activities since then. The Indonesian government has been working hard to take strong and wide-ranging counterterrorism measures which have achieved a measurable operational success. In sum, we find that indirect pressure combined direct pressure can help combat terrorist movement in Indonesi...|$|E
