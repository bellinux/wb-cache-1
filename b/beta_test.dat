5|$|Dirge of Cerberus {{was first}} {{announced}} in September 2004, and {{was scheduled for}} release in Japan in 2005. The game's official site went online in April 2005. In May, Nomura stated that several snippets from the game would be revealed during that year's E3. However, no demo was shown at E3, as the staff were still trying to fix some issues with the controls in the game. In September, the <b>beta</b> <b>test</b> program was postponed indefinitely. Listed as 60% complete, the company stated if the <b>beta</b> <b>test</b> started with the game's current state, {{they would not be}} able to fully utilize the beta testers.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} announced {{that there would}} be a simultaneous release on the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows as well as concurrent Japanese and American release, but this was later changed. There was also discussion of an Xbox release, but it was abandoned mainly because of its small 8 GB hard drive. Originally announced in January 2000 at the Yokohama Millennium Conference, there was a great deal of negative press. There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series, since it was not clear whether the game would have a structured story, which it ended up having, and the title of Final Fantasy Online was suggested. Following an August 2001 <b>beta</b> <b>test</b> in Japan, a public Japanese <b>beta</b> <b>test</b> was done in December 2001.|$|E
40|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>testing</b> is {{the last}} stage of testing, and {{normally}} involves sending the product for <b>beta</b> <b>testing</b> and real-world exposure outside the company. <b>Beta</b> <b>testing</b> is often preceded by a round of testing called alpha <b>testing.</b> <b>Beta</b> <b>testing</b> {{can be considered a}} form of external user acceptance testing. Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed applications, as well as speed and performance issues that may still cause crashes or data loss. <b>Beta</b> <b>testing</b> is the first opportunity to get real feedback from target customers. The launch of a mobile application is especially crucial because it is the single biggest opportunity to get an application discovered in the mobile markets. In this article, the <b>beta</b> <b>testing</b> of mobile applications is presented. Our aim is to identify the optimal number of testers, who can reveal the majority of errors and mistakes during <b>beta</b> <b>testing.</b> The findings were obtained through the case study research method.

5|$|Due {{to earlier}} {{recurring}} issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team {{decided not to}} implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of mistranslation fears, dedicated teams {{in each of the}} game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During alpha testing, the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate. The open <b>Beta</b> <b>test</b> was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game. The <b>Beta</b> <b>test</b> eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners to log into the game from that date.

The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions.|$|E

The successful demonstration provided for a ten-year contract with WiFi Rail, Inc. {{for the services}} throughout the BART right of way. In 2008 the Wi-Fi service was expanded to include the Transbay Tube. BART terminated the relationship with Wi-Fi Rail in December 2014, citing that WiFi Rail had not submitted an adequate financial or technical plan for completing the network throughout the BART system.|$|E
