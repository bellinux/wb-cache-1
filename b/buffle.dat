6000|$|... "When is Mr. Eames {{going to}} be back?" [...] Mrs. Thorne said at dinner one day. On this {{occasion}} the squire was dining at Mrs. Thorne's house; and there were three or four others there,--among them a Mr. Harold Smith, who was in Parliament, and his wife, and John Eames's especial friend, Sir Raffle <b>Buffle.</b> The question was addressed to the squire, but the squire was slow to answer, and it was taken up by Sir Raffle <b>Buffle.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Mentioning Mr. Baffle {{gives an}} {{instance}} of there being good in persons where good is not expected, for it cannot be denied that Mr. Buffle's manners when engaged in his business were not agreeable. To collect is one thing, and to look about as if suspicious of the goods being gradually removing {{in the dead of}} the night by a back door is another, over taxing you have no control but suspecting is voluntary. Allowances too must ever be made for a gentleman of the Major's warmth not relishing being spoke to with a pen in the mouth, and while I do not know that it is more irritable to my own feelings to have a low-crowned hat with a broad brim kept on in doors than any other hat still I can appreciate the Major's, besides which without bearing malice or vengeance the Major is a man that scores up arrears as his habit always was with Joshua Lirriper. So at last my dear the Major lay in wait for Mr. <b>Buffle,</b> and it worrited me a good deal. Mr. <b>Buffle</b> gives his rap of two sharp knocks one day and the Major bounces to the door. [...] "Collector has called for two quarters' Assessed Taxes" [...] says Mr. <b>Buffle.</b> [...] "They are ready for him" [...] says the Major and brings him in here. But on the way Mr. <b>Buffle</b> looks about him in his usual suspicious manner and the Major fires and asks him [...] "Do you see a Ghost sir?" [...] "No sir" [...] says Mr. <b>Buffle.</b> [...] "Because I have before noticed you" [...] says the Major [...] "apparently looking for a spectre very hard beneath the roof of my respected friend. When you find that supernatural agent, be so good as point him out sir." [...] Mr. <b>Buffle</b> stares at the Major and then nods at me. [...] "Mrs. Lirriper sir" [...] says the Major going off into a perfect steam and introducing me with his hand. [...] "Pleasure of knowing her" [...] says Mr. <b>Buffle.</b> [...] "A--hum!--Jemmy Jackman sir!" [...] says the Major introducing himself. [...] "Honour of knowing you by sight" [...] says Mr. <b>Buffle.</b> [...] "Jemmy Jackman sir" [...] says the Major wagging his head sideways in a sort of obstinate fury [...] "presents to you his esteemed friend that lady Mrs. Emma Lirriper of Eighty-one Norfolk Street Strand London in the County of Middlesex in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Upon which occasion sir," [...] says the Major, [...] "Jemmy Jackman takes your hat off." [...] Mr. <b>Buffle</b> looks at his hat where the Major drops it on the floor, and he picks it up and puts it on again. [...] "Sir" [...] says the Major very red and looking him full in the face [...] "there are two quarters of the Gallantry Taxes due and the Collector has called." [...] Upon which if you can believe my words my dear the Major drops Mr. Buffle's hat off again. [...] "This--" [...] Mr. <b>Buffle</b> begins very angry with his pen in his mouth, when the Major steaming more and more says [...] "Take your bit out sir! Or by the whole infernal system of Taxation of this country and every individual figure in the National Debt, I'll get upon your back and ride you like a horse!" [...] which it's my belief he would have done and even actually jerking his neat little legs ready for a spring as it was. [...] "This," [...] says Mr. <b>Buffle</b> without his pen [...] "is an assault and I'll have the law of you." [...] "Sir" [...] replies the Major [...] "if you are a man of honour, your Collector of whatever may be due on the Honourable Assessment by applying to Major Jackman at the Parlours Mrs. Lirriper's Lodgings, may obtain what he wants in full at any moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|My dear the Major has Mr. <b>Buffle</b> {{brought up}} our steps and whisked into the parlour and carted {{out on the}} sofy, and then he {{and all the rest}} of them without so much as a word burst away again full speed leaving the {{impression}} of a vision except for Mr. <b>Buffle</b> awful in his blanket with his eyes a rolling. In a twinkling they all burst back again with Mrs. <b>Buffle</b> in another blanket, which whisked in and carted out on the sofy they all burst off again and all burst back again with Miss <b>Buffle</b> in another blanket, which again whisked in and carted out they all burst off again and all burst back again with Mr. Buffle's articled young gentleman in another blanket--him a holding round the necks of two men carrying him by the legs, similar to the picter of the disgraceful creetur who has lost the fight (but where the chair I do not know) and his hair having the appearance of newly played upon. When all four of a row, the Major rubs his hands and whispers me with what little hoarseness he can get together, [...] "If our dear remarkable boy was only at home what a delightful treat this would be for him!" ...|$|E
