While the 'throat-and-girth' harness was still in use throughout much of the ancient world (placing an excessive amount of pressure on horses' necks), the Chinese were placing a wooden yoke across their horses' chests with traces to the chariot shaft by the 4th century BCE in the State of Chu (as seen on a Chu lacquerware). By Han times, the Chinese replaced this heavy yoke with a softer <b>breast</b> <b>strap,</b> as seen in Han stamped bricks and carved tomb reliefs.

500|$|Horse harness, ("trace" [...] or [...] "breast"): Throughout {{the ancient}} world, the 'throat-and-girth' harness {{was used for}} {{harnessing}} horses that pulled carts; this greatly limited a horse's ability to exert itself as it was constantly choked at the neck. A painting on a lacquerware box from the State of Chu, dated to the 4th century BC, shows the first known use of a yoke placed across a horses's chest, with traces connecting to the chariot shaft. The hard yoke across the horse's chest was gradually replaced by a <b>breast</b> <b>strap,</b> which was often depicted in carved reliefs and stamped bricks of tombs from the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). Eventually, the horse collar was invented in China, at least by the 5th century.|$|E
5000|$|There is evidence, though disputed, {{that humans}} first began riding the horse {{not long after}} domestication, {{possibly}} as early as 4000 BC. [...] The earliest known saddle-like equipment were fringed cloths or pads used by Assyrian cavalry around 700 BC. These were held on with a girth or surcingle that included <b>breast</b> <b>straps</b> and cruppers. From the earliest depictions, saddles became status symbols. To show off an individual's wealth and status, embellishments were added to saddles, including elaborate sewing and leather work, precious metals such as gold, carvings of wood and horn, and other ornamentation.|$|R

5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in 1914, the huge number of volunteers answering the appeal of Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, were formed into a New Army. The problem of providing uniforms for these recruits was acute and many trained in their civilian clothes for weeks. A highly simplified version of Service Dress was produced for them, without <b>breast</b> pockets, shoulder <b>straps</b> and other refinements. They were dark blue in colour, because the original khaki dye had been produced in Germany before the war and it had proved difficult to acquire sufficient from alternative sources. This colour {{gave rise to the}} popular name for the uniform; [...] "Kitchener's Blues". Around 500,000 sets of these uniforms were produced and worn during basic training.|$|R
50|$|The {{breastplate}} {{should not}} be fitted {{in any way that}} will restrict the horse's movement. Special attention should be paid to the shoulders, chest, and the area between the horse's front legs. In general, a fist should fit between breastplate and the horse's chest, and there should be a hand's width between the wither strap and the withers. The <b>breast</b> <b>strap</b> should be have some slack, and care should be taken that its buckle doesn't rub the sensitive skin in the area. It should also be adjusted so that the chest straps lie above the point of the shoulder so that the horse's motion is not restricted.|$|E
50|$|Being {{the classic}} {{breastplate}} for English riding, campdrafting or stockwork, the stockman's or hunting breastplate {{is the most}} common type. It consists of a yoke (with a neck and wither strap), a <b>breast</b> <b>strap</b> {{at the bottom of the}} yoke which runs through the horse's front legs and attaches to the girth, and two straps at the top of the yoke which attach to the D-rings of a saddle. There are usually buckles for adjusting the size of the yoke as well as the length of the straps which attach to the saddle and girth. The hunting breastplate not only helps to prevent the saddle from slipping, but also may be used to attach a Market Harborough or standing and running martingales, which are clipped or buckled onto a ring at the chest.|$|E

I, who at the time was about twenty-one years of age, wondered if he had gone mad to talk thus of this beautiful creature. Then I remembered that just before we had left home I had caught Ragnar kissing the daughter of one of our thralls behind the shed in which the calves were kept. She was a brown girl, very well made, as her rough robe, fastened beneath her <b>breast</b> with a <b>strap,</b> showed plainly, and she had big dark eyes with a sleepy look in them. Also, I never saw anyone kiss quite so hard as she did; Ragnar himself was outpassed. I think that is why even the great lady, Iduna the Fair, did not please him. All the while he was thinking of the brown-eyed girl in the russet robe. Still, it is true that, brown-eyed girl or no, he read Iduna aright.|$|R
40|$|The {{harnessing}} {{guidelines for}} donkeys pulling a single donkey cart {{are based on}} practices from Europe which are adapted {{to the situation in}} many African countries. The basic principles remain the same, anatomy of the donkey and criteria for a donkey harness, but the concept is to make a comfortable harness from locally available materials. The most simple pulling device is opted for, the <b>breast</b> <b>strap</b> harness. Examples are given how to measure the size of the straps and how to make the <b>breast</b> <b>strap</b> harness, keeping in mind the necessary animal comfort. Cheap saddles and breaking devices are also described and a few examples of single donkey carts from Kenya and West Africa are included...|$|E
40|$|Profound changes {{occur within}} the female breast with {{increasing}} age; glandular atrophy, increased skin laxity and stretched Cooper‟s ligaments cause an inferior lateral migration {{of the breast}} tissue. However, the current lingerie market predominantly revolves around bras designed for younger women that older women may feel are inappropriate for their physique. Literature regarding age-appropriate clothing has postulated that bras should be designed based on specific shapes, populations and usages. Yet the bra preferences of older women have been neglected in the literature. By determining women's requirements, the performance of current bras may be ascertained, and subsequent alterations may be recommended for bra design in order to optimise bras for older women if required. The aims of the current thesis were to: provide a wider understanding of the bra requirements of women aged 45 to 65 years, determine the key bra performance variables for this population, develop procedures to assess these variables and to determine the current appropriateness of {{a small sample of}} bras for this population. To achieve the research aims the thesis contained five studies. The first study was exploratory in nature, using focus groups and interviews to develop a knowledge base on the bra preferences of women aged 45 to 65 years. A survey was subsequently designed and implemented to determine the key bra performance variables among a wider sample of the population. The results of these studies identify the general dimensions that women consider when purchasing a bra (comfort, support, aesthetics, practicalities, and psychological aspects). From these dimensions, 11 key bra performance variables that are of importance to older women were derived (comfort, support, bra's ability to stay in place, appearance under clothes, silhouette, breast shape, <b>breast</b> lift, shoulder <b>straps,</b> discreetness, fabric and fit). Methods to quantify the key bra performance variables were required to assess the performance of current bras for older women. The third experimental study developed methods which minimised the limitations of existing procedures, and determined the validity and reliability of these methods. As a result of this study, methods to assess the 11 key bra performance variables were deemed acceptable for both objective and subjective measures. In the fourth study, two bras were selected from a popular and unpopular brand; the performance of these bras was assessed with regard to the 11 key bra performance variables. The results indicate that women aged 45 to 65 years preferred a bra that minimises breast kinematics, provides greater breast projection and lifts the breast sufficiently. Although differences lay between the bare breasted and bra conditions, the two bras performed similarly despite the difference in popularity. The final study incorporated a four week wearer trial to elucidate any changes in performance that may appear with increased usage. Subjective ratings of breast support and the bras' ability to stay in place were lower following the wearer trial. The bras tested performed well for the bra variables; comfort, fit, support and shoulder strap position. However, the remaining key bra performance variables may require alteration to ensure their appropriateness for women aged 45 to 65 years. It is concluded that women aged 45 to 65 years are generally cognisant of changes to their breasts as they age, subsequently seeking bras that are different from those they previously would have worn. The findings of this thesis suggest that alterations in bra design are required to optimise bras for older women. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
