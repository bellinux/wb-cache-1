2500|$|IGN's Douglass C. Perry {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "the {{inclusion}} of chapters {{from the book}} skipped over in the movie, and the general variety of missions, spread out over the large landscapes work to its favor." [...] However, he was critical {{of the lack of}} an autosave feature, the implementation of the Ring, which he felt was completely optional, and the combat system, which he called [...] "basic and repetitive." [...] He concluded [...] "what this game has that the EA game doesn't have - chapters, characters and events from the book - is important to a Tolkien fan, and it warrants playtime [...] but without this license, this game is very, very average." [...] GameZone's Michael Knudson scored it 7.4 out of 10 arguing [...] "the game has a lot of potential, but a few gameplay quirks ruin it." [...] He concluded [...] "this game will only suit hardcore fans of the J.R.R. Tolkien series." [...] GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker scored it 5.5 out of 10 calling it [...] "an average adventure game with a high-profile license attached." [...] GameSpy's Bryan Stratton scored it 1.5 out of 5, comparing it unfavorably with the film; [...] "the reason that the movie worked was that Peter Jackson knew what to keep from the book, what to fast-forward through, and what to cut altogether. Fellowship doesn't have the benefit of so capable an editor." [...] Game Informers Andy McNamara scored it 3 out of 10, writing [...] "There are so many things wrong with this one, it's hard to decide. For one, the story is delivered with all the emotion of a grade school play. This wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing, if the gameplay weren't absolutely abysmal." ...|$|E

60|$|The City of Dreadful Monotony, the East End {{is often}} called, {{especially}} by well-fed, optimistic sightseers, who {{look over the}} surface of things and are merely shocked by the intolerable sameness and meanness of it all. If the East End is worthy of no worse title than The City of Dreadful Monotony, and if working people are unworthy of variety and beauty and surprise, it would not <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> place in which to live. But the East End does merit a worse title. It should be called The City of Degradation.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} entirely {{funded by the}} Film Fund of the Film Finance Corporation. Armstrong made the movie {{straight}} after Fires Within and enjoyed it much more because the Hollywood film had <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> experience.|$|R

6000|$|Thoroughly {{astonished}} as Gabriel {{was with}} this sarcastic reception, {{there was still}} a certain relief that it brought to him. [...] "Olly was wrong," [...] he said to himself; [...] "that woman only thinks of washing dishes and lookin' after her boarders. Ef she was allus like this--and would leave a man alone, never foolin' around him, but kinder standin' off and 'tendin' strictly to the business of the house, why, it wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing to marry her. But like as not she'd change--you can't trust them critters. Howsomever I can set Olly's mind at rest." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{three months}} of {{domestic}} life, a great idea struck him. Matrimony-- English matrimony--could not <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing after all. If he were so thoroughly comfortable at the Back of Beyond with this Burmese girl who smoked cheroots, how much more comfortable would he be with a sweet English maiden who would not smoke cheroots, and would play upon a piano instead of a banjo? Also he had a desire {{to return to his}} kind, to hear a Band once more, and to feel how it felt to wear a dress-suit again. Decidedly, Matrimony would be a very good thing. He thought the matter out at length of evenings, while Georgina sang to him, or asked him why he was so silent, and whether she had done anything to offend him. As he thought, he smoked, and as he smoked he looked at Georgina, and in his fancy turned her into a fair, thrifty, amusing, merry, little English girl, with hair coming low down on her forehead, and perhaps a cigarette between her lips. Certainly, not a big, thick, Burma cheroot, of the brand that Georgina smoked. He would wed a girl with Georgina's eyes and most of her ways. But not all. She could be improved upon. Then he blew thick smoke-wreaths through his nostrils and stretched himself. He would taste marriage. Georgina had helped him to save money, and there were six months' leave due to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know." [...] Anne looked thoughtful. [...] "I {{read in a}} book {{once that}} a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I've {{never been able to}} believe it. I don't believe a rose WOULD be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I suppose my father could have been a good man even if he had been called Jedediah; but I'm sure {{it would have been a}} cross. Well, my mother was a teacher in the High school, too, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A husband was enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that they were a pair of babies and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a weeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke. I've never seen that house, but I've {{imagined}} it thousands of times. I think it must have had honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in all the windows. Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born in that house. Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I was so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I was perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn't you? I'm glad she was satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her--because she didn't live very long after that, you see. She died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she'd lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it would be so sweet to say 'mother,' don't you? And father died four days afterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits' end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see, nobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother had both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn't any relatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she'd take me, though she was poor and had a drunken husband. She brought me up by hand. Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people? Because whenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> girl when she had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like.|$|E

6000|$|She {{had taken}} courage now, and answered, far more in her usual manner, 'You are so good! But {{even if there}} was nothing else in it to be sorry for and ashamed of, it <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> return to you--' ...|$|R

50|$|Caro {{is married}} to {{architect}} Andrew Lister, and they have two daughters, Tui and Pearl. Their first daughter was born shortly after the success of Whale Rider.

[...] "It was her belief--her religion--that Ormond {{had seen}} Death, {{in person or}} personified, or the angel of it; and that the sight was {{something}} beautiful, and not terrible.

5000|$|The {{album was}} a {{financial}} {{success for the}} band {{in the eyes of}} their label, Warner Bros.

It was the final album with Constanten, who last performed with the band in January, 1970.|$|E
50|$|After Kapkov {{reforms and}} all his battles, {{regional}} administrations {{across the country have}} suddenly become interested in the renovation of parks and the rejuvenation of public space. In Moscow, many of the positive changes to the fabric of the city are hard to undo, whatever happens. Many people worry there are changes in the air, but hope is far from lost - with some suggesting that if the Europeanisation of Moscow is over, the end of this copycat urban development may not <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing anyway.|$|E
5000|$|To explain further, Gewin {{invoked the}} legal saying that hard cases make bad law. While he {{agreed that the}} {{substance}} of Givhan's complaints to Leach {{might well have been}} seen as [...] "laudable" [...] by some observers, [...] "protection of the First Amendment, however, does not turn on the social worth of ideas. If we held Givhan's expressions constitutionally protected, we would in effect force school principals to be ombudsmen, for damnable as well as laudable expressions." [...] While such a policy might not <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> idea, he continued, it would be better being adopted by the school board or legislature, rather than being imposed by a court.|$|E
50|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were {{typically}} uneven, though never in Jones's career would the gulf between the most favorable and the least favorable reviews be so wide.
