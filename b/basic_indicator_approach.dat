In this article, loss distribution approach is applied with simulated data. 20 nonparametric loss distributions and mixing internal and external data with loss distribution are applied. We introduced switching distribution Approach in loss distribution approach.

40|$|Abstract: The Basel Committee’s {{release of}} the new Basel Accord and its new {{operational}} risk class are raising questions on how regulatory capital for operational risk should be determined and is transforming the banks ’ view of economic capital. This paper investigates the relationship between publicly available economic capital- and regulatory capital figures from 2002 and 2003, and compares these with figures from the Basel Committee’s Quantitative Impact Studies. The focus will be constrained to top 50 internationally active banks. Initially, many if not most banks will be using the simplest regulatory method, the <b>Basic</b> <b>Indicator</b> <b>Approach,</b> to calculate the operational risk capital charge. Hence, the <b>Basic</b> <b>Indicator</b> <b>Approach</b> is applied in order to study the impact of different definitions of gross income resulting in different levels of operational risk capital charges. Finally, the comprehensiveness of year-end economic capital disclosure in 2002 and 2003 annual reports of the top 50 banks is examined to reflect the considerable evolutionary change that the banking industry is undergoing...|$|E

Further, the stock price movements of banks have been examined for randomness and it has been proved that the bank stock prices do not follow a Geometric Brownian motion.

40|$|The paper {{applies the}} methodologies {{proposed}} by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision {{for assessing the}} capital requirements {{in the context of}} operational risk to a Romanian commercial bank. The basic indicator, standard and internal measurement approaches (IMA) have been used to asses the capital requirement levels needed to cover the operational risk. The IMA is implemented using the loss distribution methodology (LDA). The capital at risk is computed from the loss distribution that aggregates, using Monte-Carlo simulations, the frequency and loss size distributions, fitted to the empirical data, for each business line and event type pair. Even though IMA is more costly and difficult to implement, it has, in some circumstances, considerable rewards in terms of capital requirements. operational risk, <b>basic</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>approach,</b> standardized approach, internal measurement approach, loss distribution methodology, Monte-Carlo simulation...|$|E

The new capital accord encourages financial institutions to gradually evolve from basic to sophisticated methodologies.

The methodologies related to operational risk will be applied to a group of national banking institutions. These methodologies are referred to in Pillar I of the new capital accord: (i) the <b>basic</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>approach,</b> (ii) the standardized approach and (iii) the alternative standardized approach.
