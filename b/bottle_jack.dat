50|$|A <b>bottle</b> <b>jack</b> or whiskey jack is a jack which {{resembles a}} bottle in shape, having a {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} neck. Within is a vertical lifting ram with a support pad of some kind fixed to the top. The jack may be hydraulic or work by screw action. In the hydraulic version the hydraulic ram emerges from the body vertically by hydraulic pressure provided by a pump either on the baseplate or at a remote location via a pressure hose. With a single action piston the lift range is somewhat limited, so its use for lifting vehicles is limited to those with a relatively high clearance. For lifting structures such as houses the hydraulic interconnection of multiple vertical jacks through valves enables the even distribution of forces while enabling close control of the lift. The screw version of the <b>bottle</b> <b>jack</b> works by turning a large nut running on the threaded vertical ram at {{the neck of the}} body. The nut has gear teeth and is turned by a bevel gear spigotted to the body, the bevel gear being turned manually by a jack handle fitting into a square socket. The ram may have a second screwed ram within it, which doubles the lifting range telescopically.|$|E

5000|$|A {{roasting}} jack is {{a machine}} which rotates meat roasting on a spit. It {{can also be}} called a spit jack, a spit engine or a turnspit, although this name can also refer to a human turning the spit, or a turnspit dog. [...] Cooking meat on a spit dates {{back at least to}} the 1st century BC, but at first spits were turned by human power. In Britain, starting in the Tudor period, dog-powered turnspits were used; the dog ran in a treadmill linked to the spit by belts and pulleys. Other forms of roasting jacks included the steam jack, driven by steam, the smoke jack, driven by hot gas rising from the fire, and the <b>bottle</b> <b>jack</b> or clock jack, driven by weights or springs.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{renewable}} energy {{is becoming an}} important source of energy in our world. Renewable energy is a solution that can overcome the problems that occur in our world right now such as global warming, urban smog, acid rain and many more dangerous emmisions. Biomass is one the sources of {{renewable energy}} that have specific properties that can change our world environment right now. Biomass use and application is the one way for decreasing the above negative effect to the world. Briquette technology is the one technology which uses the biomass product in the right way. In order to develop a small scale of piston type briquetting tools, an analysis was carried out to choose the best design to develop briquette machine. Four samples of different designs then was sketch in 3 D drawing by using Solidworks Premium Software. Every designs was sketch in different application of theories which are pascal theory, <b>bottle</b> <b>jack</b> theory, <b>bottle</b> <b>jack</b> theory with heavy duty spring and use of power supply of motor. By using Solidwork Premium Software stress strain anlysis, the designs then being analysed. After do the analysis, comparison and concept selection between the designs was carried out. The result is finalised and the concept of using of power supply of motor is selected. For the final stage, the machine was fabricate by using the selected concept...|$|E
