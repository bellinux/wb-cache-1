50|$|<b>Buserelin</b> (INN) is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist). The drug's {{effects are}} {{dependent}} on the frequency and time course of administration. GnRH is released in a pulsatile fashion in the postpubertal adult.

LHRH and <b>buserelin</b> stimulated gonadotropin release equally well. After cessation of this stimulation, the gonadotropin release by the buserelin-treated pituitary glands and the glands, treated with the highest dose of LHRH (1000 ng/ml), continued, while the release by the glands, treated with the lower doses of LHRH, declined.

The combined results from six different experiments show that the various dosages of sandostatin caused no tumor growth inhibition. Somatostatin receptors could not be demonstrated in these mammary tumors. Sandostatin treatment by daily injections did not suppress levels of growth hormone, prolactin, or epidermal growth factor-like activities.

40|$|Summary. Sixty one men, with {{advanced}} prostatic cancer, were entered on a trial using a nasally administered gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue agonist, <b>buserelin,</b> as first line treatment.

The only side effects were hot flashes (69 %) and decreased libido (25 %). The response rate of 82 %, with a median response duration of 16 months, compares favourably to responses reported with orchidectomy or estro-gens. Serum testosterone, FSH and LH were monitored at regular intervals. Mean serum testosterone baseline values of 15 nmol/L decreased to castrate levels, and remained low while patients were on study.

40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs {{are given}} to women {{undergoing}} in vitro fertilization. Case reports describing the development of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and auto-antibodies against GnRH after such treatment suggest a strong association between intestinal dysfunction and GnRH analogs. No experimental model for studying such a relationship is currently at hand. Our main goal was to investigate possible enteric neurodegeneration and titers of GnRH antibodies in response to repeated administration of the GnRH analog <b>buserelin</b> in rat. Rats were treated for 1 - 4 sessions with daily subcutaneous injections of <b>buserelin</b> or saline for 5 days, followed by 3 weeks of recovery. <b>Buserelin</b> treatment caused significant loss of submucous and myenteric neurons in the fundus, ileum, and colon. The loss of enteric neurons can, at least partly, be explained by increased apoptosis. No GnRH- or GnRH-receptor-immunoreactive (IR) enteric neurons but numerous luteinizing hormone (LH) -receptor-IR neurons were detected. After <b>buserelin</b> treatment, the relative number of enteric LH-receptor-IR neurons decreased, whereas that of nitric-oxide-synthase-IR neurons increased.

We then studied the in vitro effects of <b>buserelin</b> (GnRH analogue), antide (GnRH antagonist), and <b>buserelin</b> plus antide or inhibitor of phospholipase C (compound 48 / 80) and COXs (acetylsalicylic acid) on the production of testosterone, PGE 2, and PGF 2 and on the enzymatic activities of COX 1 and COX 2. Immunoreactivity for GnRHR was detected in the cytoplasm of Leydig cells and in the acrosomal region of spermatids. COX 1 and COX 2 immunosignals were noted in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, Leydig cells, and Sertoli cells.

Although the basal growth rate was only slightly inhibited by the LH-RH antagonist [Ac-D-Nal(2) 1,D-Phe(pCl) 2,D-Pal(3) 3,D-Cit 6,D-Ala 10]LH-RH (SB- 75), the estrogen-stimulated growth was completely abolished by the antagonist. In contrast, the LH-RH agonist <b>buserelin</b> stimulated cell growth in estrogen-deficient medium, whereas it had no effect in the presence of estrogen. 125 I-labeled <b>buserelin</b> was used for the measurement of LH-RH receptors on MCF- 7 cells. A Scatchard plot analysis of buserelin-specific binding revealed a nonlinear plot, which suggested the presence of one high-affinity binding site with a Kd of 1. 4 +/- 1. 0 nM and the remaining sites with low affinity (Kd = 1. 3 +/- 1. 0 microM). The binding of 125 I-labeled <b>buserelin</b> was displaced equally well by unlabeled <b>buserelin</b> and by the LH-RH antagonist SB- 75, suggesting that both analogues are bound to the same receptor. When parallel experiments were performed with 125 I-labeled SB- 75, the binding was displaced by unlabeled SB- 75 and other antagonists, but only partially displaced by unlabeled <b>buserelin.</b> The results suggest that in these mammary tumor cells there is a LH-RH antagonist binding site that is not recognizable by LH-RH agonists.

Results The mean of multilaminar follicles class I decreased significantly in the second and first treated groups compared with the control group (P= 0. 018, P= 0. 012, respectively). Also, mean of multilaminar follicles class II decreased significantly in second and first treated groups compared with the control group (P= 0. 031, P= 0. 005, respectively). Conclusion Our findings suggest short-term administration of high dose <b>buserelin</b> inhibits development of follicles in rat ovary. *Corresponding Author: Urmia University of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine.

Animal Reproduction Science, 95, 107 - 115. Keywords: GnRH; PGF 2 ?; Ewes; Ewe lambsThe objectives {{of this study}} were {{to determine the effects of}} <b>buserelin</b> or saline treatment on ovarian function (Experiment 1), plasma PGFM concentrations and oxytocin stimulated prostaglandin F 2 ? (PGF 2 ?) release (Experiment 2) in ewe lambs and ewes. Welsh Halfbred ewes (n = 26) and ewe lambs (n = 24) were mated to vasectomised rams at synchronised oestrus and on Day 12 post-mating each animal was injected intramuscularly either normal saline or 4 ?g <b>buserelin.</b> In Experiment 1, plasma progesterone and oestradiol concentrations were determined in samples collected by jugular venepuncture 1 h before and at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment (n = 7 per treatment group). Progesterone concentrations increased (P 0. 05). However, peak duration following oxytocin challenge on Day 15 post-mating was shorter (P < 0. 05) in control ewes compared with control ewe lambs. In conclusion, <b>buserelin</b> treatment given on Day 12 post-oestrus enhances luteal function more in ewes than ewe lambs and after a transitory increase, reduces oestradiol concentrations in both ewes and ewe lambs. However, <b>buserelin</b> treatment does not significantly attenuate the luteolytic signal. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Benefits of the {{short-term}} utilization of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (<b>Buserelin,</b> Hoechst, AG, Frankfurt am Mein, FRG) for induction of ovulation in an {{in vitro fertilization}} program (IVF) program were assessed. Eighteen patients underwent consecutively an induction of ovulation by clomiphene citrate (CC) and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), then by hMG alone, and finally by <b>Buserelin</b> and hMG. The switchover from CC and hMG to hMG alone significantly {{increased the number of}} aspirated follicles and the oocyte recovery rate. The addition of <b>Buserelin</b> prevented the outcome of spontaneous luteinizing hormone (LH) surges. It reduced the preovulatory luteinization and increased the number of recovered oocytes as well as the number of embryos available for transfer. A 33 % clinical pregnancy rate per ovum pick-up was achieved with the Buserelin-hMG treatment...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we used mice {{lacking the}} G_(11) ^α[G_(11) {{knockout}} (KO) ] or G_q^α gene (G_q KO) to examine LH release {{in response to}} a metabolically stable GnRH agonist (<b>Buserelin).</b> Mice homozygous for the absence of G_(11) ^α and G_q^α appear to breed normally. Treatment of (5 wk old) female KO mice with the GnRH agonist <b>Buserelin</b> (2 μg/ 100 μl, sc) resulted in a rapid increase of serum LH levels (reaching 328 ± 58 pg/ 25 μl for G_(11) KO; 739 ± 95 pg/ 25 μl for G_q KO) at 75 min. Similar treatment of the control strain, 129 SvEvTacfBr for G_(11) KO or the heterozygous mice for G_q KO, resulted in an increase in serum LH levels (428 ± 57 pg/ 25 μl for G_(11) KO; 884 ± 31 pg/ 25 μl for G_q KO) at 75 min. Both G_(11) KO and G_q KO male mice released LH in response to <b>Buserelin</b> (2 μg/ 100 μl of vehicle; 363 ± 53 pg/ 25 μ l and 749 ± 50 pg/ 25 μl 1 h after treatment, respectively). These values were not significantly different from the control strain. In a long-term experiment, <b>Buserelin</b> was administered every 12 h, and LH release was assayed 1 h later. In female G 11 KO mice and control strain, serum LH levels reached approximately 500 pg/ 25 μl within the first hour, then subsided to a steady level (∼ 100 pg/ 25 μl) for 109 h. In male G_(11) KO mice and in control strain, elevated LH release lasted for 13 h; however, LH levels in the G_(11) KO male mice did not reach control levels for approximately 49 h. In a similar experimental protocol, the G_q KO male mice released less LH (531 ± 95 pg/ 25 μl) after 13 h from the start of treatment than the heterozygous male mice (865 ± 57 pg/ 25 μl), but the female KO mice released more LH (634 ± 56 pg/ 25 μl) after 1 h from the start of treatment than the heterozygous female mice (346 ± 63 pg/ 25 μl). However, after the initial LH flare, the LH levels in the heterozygous mice never reached the basal levels achieved by the KO mice. G_(11) KO mice were less sensitive to low doses (5 ng/per animal) of <b>Buserelin</b> than the respective control mice. Male G_(11) KO mice produced more testosterone than the control mice after 1 h of stimulation by 2 μg of <b>Buserelin,</b> whereas {{there was no significant difference}} in <b>Buserelin</b> stimulated testosterone levels between G_q KO and heterozygous control mice. There was no significant difference in <b>Buserelin</b> stimulated estradiol production in the female G_q KO mice compared with control groups of mice. However, female G_(11) KO mice produced less estradiol in response to <b>Buserelin</b> (2 μg) compared with control strain. Although there were differences in the dynamics of LH release and steroid production in response to <b>Buserelin</b> treatment compared with control groups of mice, the lack of complete abolition of these processes, such as stimulated LH release, and steroid production, suggests that these G proteins are either not absolutely required or are able to functionally compensate for each other...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the minimum dose of <b>buserelin</b> acetate (<b>buserelin)</b> able to induce ovulation between 24 and 48 h from treatment (positive response) in estrous jennies. Jennies were studied during a total of 172 estrous cycles: ovarian activity was routinely monitored by ultrasound; when the dominant follicle reached a diameter of 33 ± 1 mm, estrous jennies were treated by subcutaneous administration of different doses of <b>buserelin,</b> 3. 3 mg (N = 11), 1. 5 mg (N = 21), 0. 8 mg (N = 12), 0. 4 mg (N = 16), 0. 2 mg (N = 13), 0. 1 mg (N = 16), 0. 04 mg (N = 14), 0. 02 mg (N = 16), or employed as controls (N = 53). Single jennies (P = 0. 0001) and GnRH dose (P = 0. 003) significantly affected ovulation rates. Ovulation rates between 24 and 48 h of each treated group, except for the 0. 02 mg group, was higher than in the control group (P < 0. 05).
