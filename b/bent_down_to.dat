25|$|Laurent {{took a few}} steps, not speaking. He {{removed his}} jacket and vest. In shirtsleeves, he glanced again at Thérèse, who had not stirred. He seemed to hesitate. Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> press his {{trembling}} lips against that bit of bare skin. The young woman pulled her shoulder away, turning around abruptly. She stared at Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance and dread that he stepped back, troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.|$|E
25|$|Park also notched up {{some fine}} {{performances}} for Victoria, and soon earned a Test call-up in the 1920–1921 season. He was unsuccessful in his debut against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), making a first-ball duck in his only innings, and bowling a single over of off-spinners which went for nine runs. He {{was said to}} have been called late during the night for medical duties, and not to have got any sleep before his debut. He never played Test cricket again. Legend has it that his wife, who was watching in the stands, dropped her knitting as he prepared to face his first ball, <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> retrieve it at the moment of delivery, and thus missed his entire Test career.|$|E

2500|$|Southall rail crash - 19 September 1997 - An InterCity 125 {{service from}} [...] to Paddington, {{operated}} by Great Western Trains, failed {{to stop at}} a red signal and collided with a freight train entering Southall goods yard. Seven {{people were killed and}} 139 were injured. The incident severely damaged public confidence in the safety of the rail system. It was found that the train's AWS was faulty, and the driver had been distracted (he had <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> pack his bag). Great Western Trains was fined £1.5 million for violations of health and safety law in connection with the accident.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the banquet}} had lasted for three days, Urse and Roluo escaped from Uppsala, {{early in the}} morning in {{carriages}} where they had put all the Swedish king's treasure. In order to lessen their burden, and to occupy any pursuing warriors they spread gold in their path (later in the work, this is referred to as [...] "sowing the Fyrisvellir"), although there was a rumour that she only spread gilded copper. When Athislus, who was pursuing the escapers saw that a precious ring was lying on the ground, he <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> pick it up. Roluo was pleased to see the king of Sweden bent down, and escaped in the ships with his mother.|$|E
2500|$|Rajiv Gandhi's last {{public meeting}} was on 21 May 1991, at Sriperumbudur, a village {{approximately}} [...] from Madras, {{where he was}} assassinated while campaigning for the Sriperumbudur Lok Sabha Congress candidate. At 10:10pm, a woman later identified as Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, approached Gandhi in public and greeted him. She then <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> touch his feet and detonated a belt laden with [...] of RDX explosives tucked under her dress. The explosion killed Gandhi, Rajaratnam, and at least 25 other people. The assassination was captured by a 21-year-old local photographer, whose camera and film were found at the site. The cameraman, named Haribabu, died in the blast but the camera remained intact. Gandhi's mutilated body was airlifted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi for post-mortem, reconstruction and embalming.|$|E

2500|$|The classicist Helen Bacon has {{proposed}} that Frost's deep knowledge of Greek and Roman classics influenced {{much of his}} work. [...] Frost’s education at Lawrence High School, Dartmouth, and Harvard [...] "was based mainly on the classics." [...] As examples, she links imagery and action in Frost’s early poems Birches" [...] (1915) and [...] "Wild Grapes" [...] (1920) with Euripedes' [...] "Bacchae". She cites the certain motifs, including that of the tree <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> earth, as evidence of his [...] "very attentive reading of 'Bacchae', almost certainly in Greek." [...] In a later poem, [...] "One More Brevity" [...] (1953), Bacon compares the poetic techniques used by Frost to those of Virgil in the [...] "Aeneid". [...] She notes that [...] "this sampling of the ways Frost drew on the literature and concepts of the Greek and Roman world at every stage of his life indicates how imbued with it he was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{approached}} another {{table where}} two girls were hiding. He <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{look at them}} and dismissed them as [...] "pathetic". Harris then moved to another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. When Tomlin attempted {{to move away from the}} table, Klebold kicked him. Harris then taunted Tomlin's attempt at escape before Klebold shot the youth repeatedly, killing him. Harris then walked back over to the other side of the table where Lauren Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her instantly. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend and Kreutz again, and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. An autopsy later revealed that Townsend died from the earlier gunshots inflicted by Klebold.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} medieval period, cotton {{became known as}} an {{imported}} fiber in northern Europe, without any knowledge of how it was derived, other than {{that it was a}} plant. Because Herodotus had written in his Histories, Book III, 106, that in India trees grew in the wild producing wool, it was assumed that the plant was a tree, rather than a shrub. This aspect is retained in the name for cotton in several Germanic languages, such as German , which translates as [...] "tree wool" [...] (Baum means [...] "tree"; Wolle means [...] "wool"). Noting its similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep. John Mandeville, writing in 1350, stated as fact the now-preposterous belief: [...] "There grew there [...] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches. These branches were so pliable that they <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> allow the lambs to feed when they are hungry." [...] (See Vegetable Lamb of Tartary.) By the end of the 16th century, cotton was cultivated throughout the warmer regions in Asia and the Americas.|$|E

60|$|He had {{scarcely}} {{turned his}} head about again, {{and it was still}} <b>bent</b> <b>down,</b> listening <b>to</b> the girl, when the stoppage ceased, and the obstructed stream of people flowed on.

60|$|It {{was with}} {{difficulty}} that she refrained from uttering an exclamation, {{and she felt}} the blood crimson her cheeks, but she mastered the impulse and lay perfectly quiet, glancing up into the face <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> close <b>to</b> hers--it was not familiar to her, and yet {{it seemed to her}} that she had seen it somewhere; another minute and it was gone.|$|R
