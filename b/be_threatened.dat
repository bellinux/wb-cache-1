5|$|Neither {{species of}} melampitta is {{believed}} to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> with extinction. The greater melampitta is not generally common across New Guinea, but appears to be relatively common in its preferred habitat type when that habitat is studied. The lesser melampitta is less restricted in its habitat requirements and is common over a large area. Because of this, {{and the fact that}} their habitat is not considered to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> and their populations are considered to be stable, both species are listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the role of A.viridimontanum in the ecosystem. In general, ferns are less {{susceptible}} to herbivory than flowering plants due to higher levels of toxic and distasteful compounds in their foliage. A.viridimontanum is not known to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by a particular predator or disease.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is an {{abundant}} and familiar bird of human habitations and cultivation {{in most of}} southern Africa. It is not believed to <b>be</b> <b>threatened,</b> and accordingly is listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN's Red List. It can be an agricultural pest, especially of grain cultivation and vineyards.|$|E
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat degradation. It {{requires}} open {{habitat for}} germination, but {{this kind of}} habitat <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by introduced flora. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by introduced grazing animals.|$|R

25|$|In Utah, its habitat <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{commercial}} development, whereas the Grand Canyon population <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by discharges from the Glen Canyon Dam which can sweep the snail and its habitat downstream.|$|R
5|$|After a {{successful}} Maltese uprising against French rule, in 1800 Malta became a British protectorate, with the Castellania becoming {{known as the}} Gran Corte della Valletta. It was amongst the first public institutions to be reestablished. In February 1806, Alexander Ball gave instrcutions to presumably guarantee independence of the Judiciary, whereas the Judges could not be removed at a simple request, and legal persons would not <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> to be jailed if they disagree with signing legal documents.|$|E
5|$|After {{her husband}} died in 1841, a series of {{complications}} obstructed Hańska's marriage to Balzac. Chief of these was the estate and her daughter Anna's inheritance, both of which might <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> if she married him. Anna married a Polish count, easing some of the pressure. About the same time, Hańska gave Balzac the idea for his 1844 novel Modeste Mignon. In 1850 they finally married, and moved to Paris, but he died five months later. Though she never remarried, she took several lovers, and died in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{habitat loss}} due to {{deforestation}} for timber and agriculture and its current status <b>is</b> near <b>threatened.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Latvia, the Union of Greens and Farmers is {{supportive}} of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by development, while small farms <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by large industrial-scale farms.|$|R
50|$|Northern bobwhite and California quail {{are popular}} gamebirds, with many taken by hunters, but these species {{have also had}} their ranges {{increased}} to meet hunting demand and <b>are</b> not <b>threatened.</b> They <b>are</b> also artificially stocked. Some species <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by human activity, such as the bearded tree quail of Mexico, which <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss and illegal hunting.|$|R
5|$|Frogs {{are valued}} as food by humans and also have many {{cultural}} roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than {{one third of}} species are considered to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> with extinction and over one hundred and twenty {{are believed to have}} become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.|$|E
5|$|In November 1810 he {{requested}} authorization from the Junta {{for a military}} operation: to cross the Desaguadero river, {{the border between the}} two viceroyalties, and take control of the Peruvian cities of Puno, Cuzco, and Arequipa. Castelli argued that it was urgent to rise against Lima because its economy depended largely on those districts, and if they lost power over that area, the main royalist stronghold would <b>be</b> <b>threatened.</b> The plan was rejected as too risky, and Castelli complied with the original orders.|$|E
5|$|In some areas, {{introduced}} {{black and}} brown rats raid nests for eggs and young. Cats also threaten the red-billed tropicbird. This bird {{is considered to}} be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though populations are thought to be declining. In some places, such as Brazil and Mexico, this bird is considered to <b>be</b> <b>threatened.</b>|$|E
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by livestock, which {{relish the}} semi-succulent leaves. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by {{recreational}} {{activity in the}} habitat.|$|R
50|$|Schizolaena parviflora <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{deforestation}} due to shifting {{patterns of}} agriculture. The species <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by timber harvesting and wildfires.|$|R

5|$|Sumatran {{orangutan}} populations {{declined by}} 80% in 75 years. This species is now {{found only in}} the northern part of Sumatra, with most of the population inhabiting the Leuser Ecosystem. In late March 2012, a once-significant population in northern Sumatra were reported to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> with approaching forest fires and might be wiped out entirely within a matter of weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} {{is frequently}} caught incidentally by trawlers of Australia's South East Trawl Fishery, which operate throughout its range. It is discarded after capture with an unknown, but probably high, rate of survival. Since this species {{does not appear}} to <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and they may also <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the cliff face, or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E
50|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist montane forests. It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss. This species {{is listed as}} Near Threatened because it occupies a small range, in which it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by hunting and limited habitat loss and degradation.|$|R
50|$|This plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{habitat loss}} {{in parts of}} its range, even in remote areas. Some occurrences in the {{southern}} parts of its range <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by recreational activities, such as off-road vehicle use. Grazing is a threat in some areas.|$|R
50|$|While {{some small}} populations <b>are</b> <b>threatened,</b> the species {{as a whole}} (in the present sense, i.e. unsplit) is not {{considered}} to <b>be</b> globally <b>threatened.</b>|$|R
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} {{has a very}} large range of 5.9millionkm2 (2.29millionsqmi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the pale crag martin is not considered to <b>be</b> <b>threatened,</b> and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} {{reptiles}} {{are considered to}} <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> and two species are endangered– these are protected under the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan. Six more species {{are considered to be}} of special concern, though not protected under the act. The copperbelly water snake is listed as threatened by the federal government, while the eastern massasauga rattlesnake is a candidate species to be included on the US endangered species list.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} oceanic islands, Inaccessible Island has {{remained}} free from introduced predators, allowing this species to flourish while many other flightless birds, particularly flightless rails, have gone extinct. The species is nevertheless considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), {{due to its}} single small population, which would <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by the accidental introduction of mammalian predators such as rats or cats.|$|E

5|$|After the WTO {{phased out}} {{quantitative}} quotas on textile in 2004 under the Agreement on Textile and Clothing(ATC). Egyptian textile and garment producers feared that their industry would <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by global competition from China and India. The flood of similar articles {{from these two}} nations to the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result {{in the loss of}} 150,000 job opportunities. This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt. Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force.|$|E
5|$|All four {{species have}} {{extensive}} ranges and large populations, {{and the increasing}} use of artificial nest sites has enabled range expansion. The rock martin often breeds in lowland and desert towns, the Eurasian crag martin's range is expanding in Austria, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and the dusky crag martin is spreading northeastwards into Guangxi, south into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean that none of the crag martins are considered to <b>be</b> <b>threatened,</b> and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly after taking office in 1957. He generated headlines by proposing that 15% of Canadian spending on US imports instead be spent on imports from the United Kingdom. Britain responded with an offer of a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the Canadians. As the Harold Macmillan government in the UK sought to enter the Common Market, Diefenbaker feared that Canadian exports to the UK would <b>be</b> <b>threatened.</b> He also believed that the mother country should place the Commonwealth first, and sought to discourage Britain's entry. The British were annoyed at Canadian interference. Britain's initial attempt to enter the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle.|$|E
