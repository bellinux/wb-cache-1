An Organized Crime Control Bureau affidavit made in 2007 alleges that Scarfo met Merola after moving to New Jersey in the early 1990s. Scarfo later became godfather to Merola's son. The affidavit claims that Scarfo helped manage Merola's illegal gambling operations in 1998 and 1999 after Merola was briefly jailed after being convicted of extortion. Although Scarfo was a [...] "person of interest" [...] in the case, he was never charged; Merola pleaded guilty and was convicted of several felonies in connection with the case in early 2010.|$|E

60|$|I {{must confess}} some impalpable quality of that ancient room {{disturbed}} me. I tried {{to fight the}} feeling down. I resolved to make a systematic examination of the place, and so, by leaving nothing to the imagination, dispel the fanciful suggestions of the obscurity before they obtained a hold upon me. After satisfying myself of the fastening of the door, I began to walk round the room, peering round each article of furniture, tucking up the valances {{of the bed and}} opening its curtains wide. In one place there was a distinct echo to my footsteps, the noises I made seemed so little that they enhanced rather than broke the silence of the place. I pulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several windows. Attracted by the fall of a particle of dust, I leaned forward and looked up the blackness of the wide chimney. Then, trying to preserve my scientific attitude of mind, I walked round and <b>began</b> <b>tapping</b> the oak paneling for any secret opening, but I desisted before reaching the alcove.

Many of the town’s men became sailors on the Great Lakes and numerous captains built homes in the city.

50|$|The FBI, under written {{directive}} from Attorney General Robert F.

FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the Civil Rights movement and investigated the allegations of communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape {{over the next five years}} in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the COINTELPRO program.|$|E

Also that year, GBC purchased VeloBind, Inc., for approximately $50 million. Research and development spending continued, resulting in the introduction of 14 new products in 1992, including binding machines, improved Therm-A-Bind systems, and shredding machines. The next year, GBC entered the office supply business with the acquisition of Bates Manufacturing Company.|$|E

One day while biking on an abandoned road used only by hunters (and Clem was not a hunter), Qwill finds Clem's truck abandoned in a ditch.

50|$|The {{history of}} voice {{communication}} technology begins in 1876 with {{the invention of}} Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone. In the 1890s, “law enforcement agencies <b>begin</b> <b>tapping</b> wires on early telephone networks”. Remote voice communications “were carried almost exclusively by circuit-switched systems,” where telephone switches would connect wires to form a continuous circuit and disconnect the wires when the call ended). All other telephone services, such as call forwarding and message taking, were handled by human operators. However, the first computerized telephone switch was developed by Bell Labs in 1965. This got rid of standard wiretapping techniques.|$|R

5000|$|Slaughter tapping is an {{obsolete}} {{method of}} extracting large quantities of natural latex from rubber trees in a forest environment. Prior to commercial exploitation of latex-bearing trees such as Hevea brasiliensis in the Amazon Basin and Funtumia elastica in the Congo, native populations limited harvesting to non-lethal tapping of the latex. However, with the rising demand for rubber worldwide {{in the late nineteenth}} century, debt-slave [...] "hunters" [...] <b>began</b> <b>tapping</b> more intensively, using ladders to extract as much latex as possible from all areas of the tree, killing the tree as a result. This [...] "slaughter tapping" [...] resulted in the destruction of all latex-bearing trees across large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Eventually, the establishment of rubber plantations in the Far East made [...] "hunting" [...] of naturally occurring rubber trees unprofitable, and the practice largely ceased in the early twentieth century.|$|E
5000|$|Considering {{the dreadful}} {{state of the}} program he'd inherited, Snyder made the Wildcats respectable fairly quickly. In his third year, 1991, Snyder's Wildcats {{finished}} 7-4 and narrowly missed receiving the school's second bowl bid ever. The team also finished with a winning record in conference play for only the third time since winning the conference title in 1934.In Snyder's fifth season in 1993, Kansas State played in the 1993 Copper Bowl, only its second bowl bid ever. They then pounded Wyoming 52-17 to tally the first bowl win in school history, breaking {{one of the longest}} such droughts in Division I-A at the time. Success and high rankings continued over the next decade, including six top-ten finishes in the AP Poll and a perfect (11-0) regular season in 1998 (before stumbling in the Big 12 Championship Game against Texas A&M). As the team improved, recruiting also improved, in large part because Snyder <b>began</b> <b>tapping</b> the rich talent base in Kansas' junior college system. Snyder was able to bring in athletes such as quarterback Michael Bishop, the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy in 1998, and running back Darren Sproles, who led the nation in rushing in 2003 and holds the Big 12 record for all-purpose yards in a career. The run of success culminated in a Big 12 Conference championship in 2003 with a 35-7 victory over the #1 ranked Oklahoma. (The 69 years since the last conference title in 1934 was the longest span between football titles in Division I history.) ...|$|E
