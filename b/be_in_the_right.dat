5|$|From {{at least}} {{the time of the}} Pyramid Texts, kings hoped that after their deaths they could emulate Osiris's {{restoration}} to life and his rule over the realm of the dead. By the early Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE), non-royal Egyptians believed that they, too, could overcome death as Osiris had, by worshipping him and receiving the funerary rites that were partly based on his myth. Osiris thus became Egypt's most important afterlife deity. The myth also influenced the notion, which grew prominent in the New Kingdom, that only virtuous people could reach the afterlife. As the assembled deities judged Osiris and Horus to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> undoing the injustice of Osiris's death, so a deceased soul had to be judged righteous in order for his or her death to be undone. As ruler of the land of the dead and as a god connected with maat, Osiris became the judge in this posthumous trial, offering life after death to those who followed his example. New Kingdom funerary texts such as the Amduat and the Book of Gates liken Ra himself to a deceased soul. In them, he travels through the Duat and unites with Osiris to be reborn at dawn. Thus, Osiris was not only believed to enable rebirth for the dead; he renewed the sun, the source of life and maat, and thus renewed the world itself.|$|E
25|$|PDZ domains {{are found}} in many {{different}} contexts and diverse proteins, but all assist in localization of cellular elements. PDZ domains are primarily involved in anchoring receptor proteins to the cytoskeleton. For cells to function properly {{it is important for}} the right components—proteins and other molecules— to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place at the right time. Proteins with PDZ domains are able to bind to different components to ensure that the correct arrangement is met. In the neuron, making sense of neurotransmitter activity requires specific receptors to be located in the lipid membrane at the synapse. PDZ domains are crucial to this receptor localization process. Proteins with PDZ domains generally associate with both the C-terminus of the receptor and cytoskeletal elements in order to anchor the receptor to the cytoskeleton and keep it in place. Without such an interaction, receptors would diffuse out of the synapse due to the fluid nature of the lipid membrane.|$|E

500|$|Australia batted {{first and}} Loxton {{came in to}} bat {{in front of a}} {{supportive}} home crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He made 80, putting on 159 with fellow Victorian Neil Harvey, who made his first Test century in his second international match, as Australia amassed 8/575. The debutant all-rounder said that he was nervous but Harvey [...] "was going along merrily and he soon settled me down". Bradman fell ill and Bill Brown led the Australians in the field during the first innings. Understanding that one of the objectives was to give the new players an opportunity to show their talent, Brown threw the ball to his debutants. Johnson was given the ball first change, but failed to make an impact, so Loxton was handed his chance. He had a catch dropped early on but ended with 2/61 in the first innings, removing Hemu Adhikari and then Vinoo Mankad. In the words of Brown, the Victorian all-rounder [...] "looked twice the bowler Johnson did". The Victorian debutant took the wicket of Adhikari in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and skittled India by 67 to win by an innings. The Test debut performance won Loxton a place on the Invincibles tour to England in 1948. He reflected that [...] "It's not the fellow who gets the opportunity it's the fellow who puts his hands around it and grabs it. I just happened to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place at the right time." [...] After his position in the touring party was confirmed, he continued his late-season resurgence, scoring two fifties for the Australians in two matches against Tasmania before they departed for England.|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{testing of}} the M22 {{occurred}} in 1943 and 1944, and was conducted by both the Ordnance Department and the British Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) Gunnery School at Lulworth Ranges. These tests uncovered a number of faults and problems with the Locust. The AFV School noted {{that the process of}} loading the M22 into a C-54 transport aircraft took considerable time and involved the use of complex equipment. [...] Overall the process took six untrained men 24 minutes, although it was believed this could be shortened with sufficient training. Unloading was also a long process, taking approximately ten minutes; it was noted that the time it took to unload the M22 from a C-54 on the battlefield meant that both the tank and aircraft would make excellent targets for enemy fire. Operational use of the tank would therefore be restricted to the availability of airfields large enough to accommodate a fully laden C-54, which might not <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> geographical location or might even have to be captured in advance of a planned airborne operation. A heavy transport aircraft, the Fairchild C-82 Packet, was developed to specifically carry the M22 inside its fuselage and unload it through a set of clam-shell doors, but it did not enter service until after the war had ended. The US Army Armored Board released a critical report on the Locust in September 1943, stating that it was inadequate in the areas of reliability and durability, and indicating {{that it would not be}} able to be successfully used during airborne operations. By 1944 it was also realized that the design of the tank was actually obsolete. The armor of the M22 in several areas was found to be so thin that it was incapable of even resisting the armor-piercing ammunition of a [...]50 caliber machine-gun. [...] Complaints were also made about the 37mm main armament, which was not powerful enough to penetrate the armor of most tanks used by the Axis powers. Similarly a report made on March 13, 1944 by elements of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment complained that when a high-explosive shell was fired from the gun, the resulting shell-burst was so weak that observers had difficulty in seeing where it impacted. There were also mechanical problems with the design, which caused it to be unreliable; the engine was also found to be underpowered, possibly due to problems with the torque characteristics of the engine or an inefficient transmission system.|$|E

500|$|The {{reviews for}} Lights and Sounds were mostly mixed upon release, {{particularly}} from mainstream media, but {{some critics have}} stated that the album had fallen well short of the standards of Ocean Avenue, the album's predecessor. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times, in review of the album, wrote: [...] "To listeners {{on either side of}} rock's latest generational divide, there's a big difference -- the difference of a decade -- between being a loser and being a twerp... Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's attempt to split that difference." [...] Sanneh reports that the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty", one of the band's anti-war song, [...] "sounds suspiciously like Green Day; the lyrics echo the plot of the video for Green Day's 'Wake Me Up When September Ends'." [...] Despite this, Sanneh {{goes on to say that}} Yellowcard is still [...] "pretty good" [...] at [...] "writing sweeping, upbeat punk-rock love songs". Ben Breier of Kent News wrote: [...] "One thing is certain: The Yellowcard you grew to know and love circa Ocean Avenue is no longer with us. The band has vastly matured when compared to past records, but it comes at a price [...] members forgot what made them occasionally catchy and addictive in the first place. It's clearly the right direction for the band, but Yellowcard needs to further refine its new style before it can come up with something above average." [...] Mike Schiller of PopMatters, who was somewhat displeased with the album, wrote that the album does not [...] "make up for the overabundance of flaccid mediocrity on display throughout most of the album". Schiller went on to say, [...] "Lights and Sounds may be Yellowcard’s attempt at a big, serious album, but the band doesn’t sound even remotely ready." [...] Nick Cowen from Drowned in Sound wrote: [...] "Those who register for Pop-Punk 101 will receive Yellowcard’s Lights And Sounds as their first set-work; the Jacksonville quintet's new album would be the perfect teaching aid, as it's technically proficient while being boring and forgettable enough not to inspire the temptation to plagiarise." [...] Cowen concluded that the album [...] "is a substandard, second-tier album with some strings thrown in for good measure. It's really not worth the money in your wallet [...] even if that wallet is attached to a very long chain." [...] Now magazine claimed that the band [...] "may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place, it's clear they're simply incapable of realizing this clumsy faux magnum opus." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's vocals on [...] "Sparks Fly", commenting that her voice {{in such an}} upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer. Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it [...] "dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song [...] "the purest iteration of Swift’s template and repertoire", also saying that it [...] "could turn things around for Swift, as it’s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting." [...] He concluded by stating that the song [...] "proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase can <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> context. To that end, “Sparks Fly” plays as a template {{as much as it}} does as a standalone single, and it’s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets [...] "a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little [...] burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts. While I don't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another 'You Belong with Me'-level [...] hit, I still think that even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift, saying [...] "Her infusion of individual lines with urgency (“Drop everything now,” she insists) and earnestness (“Take away the pain,” she pleads) are a tribute to her talent, {{not so much as a}} distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, she wonders, [...] away the hours before he calls her again." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is [...] "just another one of those so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn't to [...] "hot on" [...] the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, [...] "Fearless", [...] "Hey Stephen", and [...] "Forever and Always", and stated that Swift [...] "puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm beginning to think she watches The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, [...] "Long Live".|$|E

2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E
