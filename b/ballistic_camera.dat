40|$|An {{operational}} airborne <b>ballistic</b> <b>camera</b> {{tracking system}} was tested for operational and data reduction feasibility. The acquisition and data processing {{requirements of the}} system are discussed. Suggestions for future improvements are also noted. A description of the data reduction mathematics is outlined. Results from a successful reentry test mission are tabulated. The test mission indicated that airborne <b>ballistic</b> <b>camera</b> tracking systems are feasible...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} astrometric and photogrammetric plate {{reduction}} techniques {{for a short}} focal length camera are compared. Several astrometric models are tested on entire and limited plate areas to analyze their ability to remove systematic errors from interpolated satellite directions using a rigorous photogrammetric reduction as a standard. Residual plots are employed to graphically illustrate the analysis. Conclusions are made as to what conditions will permit the astrometric reduction to achieve comparable accuracies to those of photogrammetric reduction when applied for short focal length <b>ballistic</b> <b>cameras...</b>|$|R
40|$|The West German {{tracking}} {{stations are}} equipped with <b>ballistic</b> <b>cameras.</b> Plate measurement and plate reduction must therefore follow photogrammetric methods. Approximately 100 star positions and 200 satellite positions are measured on each plate. The mathematical model for spatial rotation of the bundle of rays is extended by including terms for distortion and internal orientation of the camera {{as well as by}} providing terms for refraction which are computed for the measured coordinates of the star positions on the plate. From the measuring accuracy of the plate coordinates it follows that the timing accuracy for the exposures has to be about one millisecond, in order to obtain a homogeneous system...|$|R
