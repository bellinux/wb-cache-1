40|$|The fuel {{composition}} of the Generation IV 600 MWth 'efficient' Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GCFR) that realizes zero <b>breeding</b> <b>gain</b> without using fertile blankets is determined. The analysis includes all the stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, including irradiation, reprocessing and fuel fabrication. The time-dependent multiplication factor, reactor safety parameters, and decay heat production for different {{fuel composition}}s are simulated using the deterministic SCALE 4. 4 code. The depletion equation and the 1 -D transport equation are solved for multiple timesteps during reactor irradiation. It is seen that adding {{a small percentage of}} minor actinides (MA) to a mixture of uranium- and plutonium carbide favors the creation of a closed fuel cycle with zero <b>breeding</b> <b>gain.</b> Furthermore, addition of MA increases the burnup potential of the fuel, extending its feasible irradiation time from 40 to 90 MWd / kg, due to the transmutation of Np- 237 to fissionable Pu- 238 and Am- 241 to fissionable Am- 242. Mixing MA negatively affects safety parameters by decreasing the delayed neutron fraction, decreasing the negative Doppler feedback and increasing the positive reactivity introduced when the reactor is depressurized. However, the magnitude of the delayed neutron fraction is comparable to existing fast reactors. Worths of individual isotopes are introduced as a value of their contribution to the core reactivity. Throughout the fuel cycle, the time-dependence of the isotopic and total worth of the fuel is determined. Zero <b>breeding</b> <b>gain</b> is achieved when the initial total worth of the fuel stays constant for multiple cycle burnup. The effect of different reprocessing strategies on the closed fuel cycle is shown. Research confirms that when there are no reprocessing losses, depleted uranium can be used during the recycling step to replace fission products and obtain a new critical fuel composition.

40|$|The gas-cooled {{fast reactor}} (GCFR) is {{regarded}} as the primary candidate for a future sustainable nuclear power system. In this paper a general core layout is presented for a 2400 -MW(thermal) GCFR. Two fuel ele-ments are discussed: a TRISO-based coated particle and the innovative hollow sphere concept. Sustainability calls for recycling of all minor actinides (MAs) in the core and a <b>breeding</b> <b>gain</b> close to unity. A fuel cycle is designed allowing operation over a long period, requiring re-fueling with 238 U only. The evolution of nuclides in the GCFR core is calculated using the SCALE system (one-dimensional and three-dimensional). Calculations were done over multiple irradiation cycles including repro-cessing. The result is {{that it is possible to}} design a fuel and GCFR core with a <b>breeding</b> <b>gain</b> around unity, with recycling of all MAs from cycle to cycle. The burnup reactivity swing is small, improving safety. After several fuel batches an equilibrium core is reached.

40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} fuel cycle and safety {{aspects of a}} Gas Cooled Fast Reactor, one of the so-called "Generation IV" nuclear reactor designs. The Generation IV Gas Cooled Fast Reactor uses helium as coolant at high temperature. The goal of the GCFR is to obtain a "closed nuclear fuel cycle", where only natural uranium is used as raw material, and only fission products are discharged to a repository. Uranium and heavier isotopes (plutonium, americium, etc) are recycled in the reactor and are eventually fissioned. Since the heavy isotopes determine the long-term radiotoxicity of the nuclear waste, application of a closed fuel cycle maximizes the energy output of the fuel material, and can significantly reduce the lifetime of nuclear waste. It is shown {{that it is possible}} to obtain a closed fuel cycle with the GCFR. Coated particle fuel and ceramic plate fuel are discussed as fuel candidates for GCFR. A theoretical framework is derived using a combination of eigenvalue perturbation theory and nuclide perturbation theory to estimate the <b>Breeding</b> <b>Gain</b> of the reactor, and the change of <b>Breeding</b> <b>Gain</b> due to changes of the initial fuel composition. It is shown that the GCFR has some potential as an actinide transmutation reactor. To increase the safety of the GCFR, passive elements have been designed to automatically shut down the reactor in case of incidents. These elements use liquid Li- 6, which is introduced into special assemblies if necessary. It has been shown that with these elements the reactor can withstand transients without damage to the fuel. The research has been performed in a European framework. Applied Science...|$|E

40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} Coupled Breeding Superheating Reactor, CBSR, for achieving a positive <b>breeding</b> <b>gain</b> and for producing 65 Mw of electric power is presented. The design combines a steam-cooled fast region and a nonboiling pressurized light-water-cooled thermal region. The advantage offered by this arrangement as compared with that using a solid moderator in the thermal zone is that, if a power excursion occurs, the water will increase the void content and tend to limit the excursion. The total reactor power is 216 Mwt, of which 163 Mwt is used to superheat steam as it passes through the fast regions of the reactor and 53 Mwt is transferred to the pressurized water. For this power split the fast core is 4 % subcritical without the reactivity contribution of the thermal region. A breeding ratio of 1. 4 is calculated for an oxide-fueled fast and thermal core and a high-density, metal-fueled radial blanket. The steam throttle conditions produced are 75 atm and 453 deg C for an average fast-core power density of 500 Mw/l. The original goal of 565 deg C throttle steam temperature and 1 Mw/l power density was compromised because of the surface temperature limitation of currently available cladding materials. The system {{does not require a}} large external power source for producing the steam introduced into the fast core. This is possible {{through the use of a}} steam compressor that increases the pressure of a portion of the superheated steam and thus permits its use to generate the required saturated-steam flow rate by vaporizing the feedwater from the steam cycle. The design includes a pressure-balance system that equalizes the static pressure in both the pressurized-water and steam systems. The pressure-balance system provides a means of cooling the steam regions in an emergency by allowing the pressurized water to flash. These features are intended to permit easier startup, operation, and shutdown of the en tire system. A summary of the reactor design characteristics is tabulated. (auth...|$|E

40|$|The {{sodium-cooled}} {{fast reactor}} (SFR) {{is one of}} the options currently being investigated as a future Generation IV reactor. This concept may include minor actinide (MA) recycling in the radial blankets positioned in the outer core regions. Heterogeneous recycling on a UO 2 matrix has the advantage of providing flexible <b>breeding</b> <b>gains,</b> MA burnings and making blanket reprocessing possible in a standard MOX fuel flux, while limiting the proliferation risk of the blankets. Two separate-effect irradiations (with isothermal-type conditions in the experimental blankets) are currently in progress (MARIOS) or under preparation (DIAMINO), respectively in the HFR and the OSIRIS material test reactor (MTR).

40|$|Due to {{perceived}} proliferation risks, current US fast reactor designs have avoided {{the use of}} uranium blankets. While {{reducing the amount of}} plutonium produced, this omission also restrains the reactor design space and has several disadvantages over blanketed cores. This study investigated many blanket options that would satisfy the proliferation concern while minimizing negative fuel cycle impact. To do so, a multi-variable metric was developed that combines 6 attributes: proliferation resistance, fuel fabrication, radiotoxicity, <b>breeding</b> <b>gain,</b> reactivity penalty and transportation. The final version of the metric consisted of using a yes or no decision on the proliferation criteria proposed by Bathke (for technologically advanced nations). The remaining 5 attributes are scaled between 0 and 1 with assigned weights for each. For our analysis, a 2400 MWth sodium cooled core was considered. One row of blanket was added radially. Metal fuel composed of depleted uranium, zirconium and Np/Pu from light water reactor used fuel was used for the driver. It was determined that to meet the prescribed proliferation resistance criteria, a minimum of 4 % MA (by volume) was needed in the blanket assemblies. However, increasing the amount of MA past 4 % became detrimental to the combination of the other 5 attributes, mainly impacting the radiotoxicity, fuel fabrication and transportation. The addition of moderation by itself did not provide any means of dissipating proliferation issues. In the cases studied, it was determined that ZrH 1. 6 and BeO were the most promising moderating materials. They both provided some reduction in required MA concentration but {{at the expense of the}} radiotoxicity of the end product. Using our defined metric, it was determined that moderation provided no immediate benefit. It should also be noted that the homogeneous or heterogeneous addition of moderators has minimal impact on such scoping studies. Separation of the Cm/Bk/Cf vector from the Am was also studied. The blankets were composed of Am while the remaining Cm/Bk/Cf was left to decay in storage. The metric was then applied to the combined streams for all attributes except proliferation. The separated case performed worst in all cases examined. Also, as expected, varying the uranium composition vector from natural (NU), depleted (DU) and recycled (RU) had very little impact on our metric, thus the choice of uranium vector would be mostly left to cost and initial fabrication considerations. It should however be noted that the k-infinity at beginning-of-life was obviously higher for the recycled and natural cases. Looking at the reactivity over the first cycle indicates that NU provides an additional - 40 pcm over DU while RU provides - 60 pcm, which could provide 30 and 45 extra days of operation, respectively, or a reduction in driver core enrichment for a given cycle length. by Mohit Singh.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} adjoint techniques to fuel cycle analysis, {{in order to provide}} a more accurate description of the effects of nuclides on reactor behaviour. Transmutation and decay processes change the composition of the fuel. Allowing for these changes makes it possible to create different fuel compositions that yield similar reactor behaviour. This approach can then be used to improve the sustainability of nuclear energy, for example by reducing the heat produced by radioactive waste. Chapter 2 reviews and extends the continuous fuel cycle model described in Ott and Borg (1980). This approach approximates the long-term behaviour of the reactor using an eigenvalue problem, removing the complexity associated with the discrete operating cycles. The model provides reasonable predictions of the behaviour of a sodium cooled fast reactor model, although extending it to include additional nuclides decreases the quality of the results significantly. The use of a constant power constraint in place of the reactivity constraint makes little difference to the results. Applying the model to a negative growth system gives worse results than those found for the breeder system, with the growth rate prediction being particularly poor. The effects of fuel cycle strategies such as different feed materials and recycling schemes on the negative growth system are also studied. Recycling additional actinides decreases the waste radiotoxicity, while including more light uranium isotopes in the feed material increases the amount of Pu- 239 and decreases the amount of other plutonium isotopes in the fuel. The double adjoint method is developed in chapter 3. This approach relies on using the nuclide worths found from an adjoint reactivity calculation as the source values for a time adjoint problem. This allows the contributions of nuclides present {{at the start of the}} burn-up period to the reactivity at the end of it to be determined. Combining this measure with reactivity worths found at the beginning of the burn-up period yields a method that can be used to produce a new fuel composition that gives very similar reactor behaviour to that seen with the original composition. This leads to a <b>breeding</b> <b>gain</b> definition that includes the effects of the feed material and that can be applied to non-equilibrium situations. The importance of including the effects of the compound material in the calculation is demonstrated. Results are found for both fast and thermal systems, with the indirect effects causing inaccuraciesin the worths of up to 50 % in the worst cases. The coupled perturbation theory proposed by Williams (1979) is used in chapter 4 to allow for the indirect effects that are neglected in chapter 3. Including the coupling to the flux allows for accurate results to be found for both the fast and thermal systems. The effects of studying a different response are also investigated, with the flux coupling having a larger effect on results for the Pu- 239 response than for the reactivity response. The scale of the coupling effect is illustrated by comparison between the values found using the coupled and uncoupled approaches. The use of longer burn-up periods increases the importance of the flux coupling. This implementation of the coupled model relies on an approximation to produce some of the multi-group cross sections, and it is expected that the use of more accurate data would improve the results. Chapter 5 {{describes the}} application of the coupled model to waste heat production. The model is used with fast and thermal systems, and the effects of different post burn-up decay periods are considered. The waste heat worths for different isotopes are found with no recycling, with plutonium recycling, and with uranium and plutonium recycling. Equivalent fuel compositions using plutonium from different sources are determined and the resulting waste heat is calculated, with the results showing that plutonium from lower burn-up sources tends to produce less waste heat, by up to a factor of 5 in the extreme cases. The effects of different recycling schemes on the waste produced by these fuels are determined, and both the waste heat per unit mass and the total waste mass are examined. The methods developed in this thesis demonstrate some of the potential uses of adjoint techniques in fuel cycle analysis. Quantifying how nuclides present at the beginning of the burn-up period affect the reactor behaviour at the end of the period allows a better comparison of fuels of different compositions. One possible application of such comparisons is demonstrated in the study of the waste heat produced by different fuels. There is a wide range of other possibilities, some of which are described in the recommendations given in the final chapter. RST/Radiation, Science and TechnologyApplied Science...|$|E

Identification of post-head-emergence frost (PHEF) resistance in cereals poses {{a number of}} unique and difficult challenges. Many decades of research have failed to identify genotypes with PHEF resistance that could offer economically significant benefit to growers. Research and <b>breeding</b> <b>gains</b> have been limited by the available screening systems. Using traditional frost screening systems, genotypes that escape frost injury in trials due to spatial temperature differences and/or small differences in phenology can be misidentified as resistant. We believe that by improving techniques to minimize frost escapes, such 'false-positive' results can be confidently identified and eliminated. Artificial freezing chambers or manipulated natural frost treatments offer many potential advantages but are not yet at the stage {{where they can be}} reliably used for frost screening in breeding programmes. Here we describe the development of a novel photoperiod gradient method (PGM) that facilitates screening of genotypes of different phenology under natural field frosts at matched developmental stages. By identifying frost escapes and increasing the efficiency of field screening, the PGM ensures that research effort can be focused on finding genotypes with improved PHEF resistance. To maximize the likelihood of identifying PHEF resistance, we propose that the PGM form part of an integrated strategy to (i) source germplasm;(ii) facilitate high throughput screening; and (iii) permit detailed validation. PGM may also be useful in other studies where either a range of developmental stages and/or synchronized development are desired. ...|$|R

To be truly useful, such germplasm must be characterized for morphological traits and genetic diversity. In this work, agro-morphological diversity was assessed in 137 Turkish sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) genotypes (129 accessions and eight cultivars) by examination of eight qualitative and nine quantitative traits. As expected, morphological variability in the cultivars was low with broader diversity present in sesame accessions. However, some accessions were identified with interesting features, such as increased number of capsules and seed yield, which could be employed in future cultivar development. The sesame genotypes were analyzed for molecular genetic diversity with 140 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. The results indicated a relatively low level of variability with an average dissimilarity value of 0. 33 for all genotypes.

This study focuses on current minor crops in Finland that have potential for expanded production and considers changes in their cropping areas, yield trends, <b>breeding</b> <b>gains,</b> roles in crop rotations and potential for improving resilience. Long-term datasets of Natural Resources Institute Finland and farmers' land use data from the Agency of Rural Affairs were used to analyze the above-mentioned trends and changes. The role of minor crops in rotations declined when early and late CAP periods were compared and that of cereal monocultures strengthened. Genetic yield potentials of minor crops have increased as also genetic improvements in quality traits, although some typical trade-offs with improved yields have also appeared. However, the gap between potential and attained yields has expanded, depending on the minor crop, as national yield trends have either stagnated or declined. When comparing genetic improvements of minor crops to those of the emerging major crop, spring wheat, breeding achievements in minor crops were lower. It was evident that the current agricultural policies in the prevailing market and the price environment have not encouraged cultivation of minor crops but further strengthened the role of cereal monocultures. We suggest optimization of agricultural land use, which is a core element of sustainable intensification, as a future means to couple long-term environmental sustainability with better success in economic profitability and social acceptability.

Evolutionary theory predicts that organisms should reproduce as early as {{they are capable of}} doing so, although there are potential tradeoffs if breeding is costly. The Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus, Knopf and Wunder 2006) :is a shorebird of conservation concern that nests in disturbed areas of the Great Plains and Great Basin. It is a moderate-sized bird (90 - 110 g) that is sexually monomorphic and drably-colored and usually has a three-egg clutch. Mountain Plovers have an uncommon parental care system where both male and females tend individual nests unaided. Males arrive at the breeding grounds in early to mid-April, establish loose territories, and compete for females. Mountain Plovers are capable of breeding at age one but not all do so, even with the potential increase in fitness. This is may be a consequence of individuals delaying <b>breeding</b> to <b>gain</b> additional experience. Mountain Plovers have the opportunity for multiple reproductive attempts since they are fairly long-lived with several birds documented living 3 ̆e 10 years. ...|$|R
40|$|Water-level {{fluctuations}} (WLF) {{affect the}} ecological processes {{and patterns of}} lakes in several ways. Aquatic habitats and feeding or <b>breeding</b> grounds are <b>gained</b> or lost, as light, climate and wave impacts change to mention only a few phenomena. While the phenomenon of WLF has been studied in many rivers (better known as flood pulse, Junk & Wantzen, 2004) and environmental flows (Bunn et al., 2006), {{so far it has}} not received due attention in lakes (Coops et al., 2003). A potential reason for why WLF in lakes have been overlooked {{for such a long time}} may be that central Europe and North America the cradles of limnological research are situated in landscapes which have been shaped by man for long time.

40|$|Participation {{of farmers}} in the genetic {{improvement}} of staple crops in vulnerable environments is now widely accepted as a necessary approach for enhancing the acceptance of improved varieties. Our study set out to assess the genetic gains achieved by collaborative decentralized participatory breeding programmes in comparison with those obtained by conventional <b>breeding.</b> The <b>gains</b> were estimated on farmer acceptance and combination of agronomic and quality-related traits, from three breeding programmes on tortillero sorghum for low-input cropping systems in northern Nicaragua. In each pro-gramme, three selection modes were compared: selection by the farmers on-farm (FoF), by the breeder on-station (BoS), and by the breeder on-farm (BoF). Our {{results showed that the}} lines produced by FoF selection were more praised by the farming community, compared to BoS and BoF selection. Comparative advantage of FoF selection was to develop higher proportion of lines with an adequate balance between agronomic traits, and with better quality traits related to grain appearance and plant type. A composite selection index, ISFA, was computed for each line as a combination of agronomic performance in the target environment, and ex post farmer appraisal. Based on this index, FoF selection proved again to be more efficient than BoS and BoF selection. We propose that such a selection index be used in participatory breeding programmes to improve their efficiency. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

50|$|Eight {{miles from}} the village of Middleburg, the area had long been home to many horse farms and since the mid-19th century, a center for equestrian events. By {{the early part of the}} 20th century Thoroughbred <b>breeding</b> {{operations}} were <b>gaining</b> importance and in 1930, Liz Whitney would be one of the first of a number of prominent personalities in Thoroughbred horse racing who would develop substantial and important breeding operations. Others who came to the area include heiress Isabel Dodge Sloane, who built the highly successful Brookmeade Stud, the very prestigious Rokeby Farm of Paul Mellon, Jack Kent Cooke's Kent Farms, and the Newstead Farm of Diana M. Firestone and her husband Bertram. Since the early 1960s, for two days each year more than ten horse farms and centers in Upperville and Middleburg open their gates to visitors.

40|$|Cooperative {{breeding}} – {{in which}} some sexually mature individuals forgo independent breeding, join a group as subordinate and help to raise the offspring of others – occurs in at least 3 % (mammals) and 9 % (birds) of vertebrates. Because helping others is costly, this behaviour contradicts the concept of ‘selfish’ natural selection. The intriguing evolutionary paradox of such seemingly altruistic behaviour has, therefore, {{been the focus of}} much study aiming to unravelling the evolutionary drivers underlying cooperative breeding. The benefits of group living, costs of dispersal and constraints of limited available independent breeding positions may persuade individuals to delay independent breeding and remain as subordinates within a group. However, it is the range of subsequent benefits (indirect benefits – such as improving reproduction and survival of related individuals or direct benefits – such as <b>gaining</b> <b>breeding</b> experience, benefits of future cooperation with raised recruits or gaining a share in reproduction) that favour the evolution of helping...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{evaluations}} {{are rapidly}} replacing traditional evaluation systems used for dairy cattle selection. Higher reliabilities from larger genotype files promote cooperation across country borders. Genomic {{information can be}} exchanged across countries using simple conversion equations, by modifying multi-trait across-country evaluation (MACE) to account for correlated residuals originating {{from the use of}} foreign evaluations, or by multi-trait analysis of genotypes for countries that use the same reference animals. Methods Traditional MACE assumes independent residuals because each daughter is measured in only one country. Genomic MACE could account for residual correlations using daughter equivalents from genomic data as a fraction of the total in each country and proportions of bulls shared. MACE methods developed to combine separate within-country genomic evaluations were compared to direct, multi-country analysis of combined genotypes using simulated genomic and phenotypic data for 8, 193 bulls in nine countries. Results Reliabilities for young bulls were much higher for across-country than within-country genomic evaluations as measured by squared correlations of estimated with true <b>breeding</b> values. <b>Gains</b> in reliability from genomic MACE were similar to those of multi-trait evaluation of genotypes but required less computation. Sharing of reference genotypes among countries created large residual correlations, especially for young bulls, that are accounted for in genomic MACE. Conclusions International genomic evaluations can be computed either by modifying MACE to account for residual correlations across countries or by multi-trait evaluation of combined genotype files. The gains in reliability justify the increased computation but require more cooperation than in previous breeding programs. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{charge state}} breeder, which {{transforms}} externally injected singly charged ions {{to a higher}} charge state q+, is an important tool which has applications within atomic, nuclear and even particle physics. The charge breeding concept of radioactive ions has already been demonstrated at REX-ISOLDE/CERN {{with the use of}} an Electron beam Ion Source (EBIS) and at several facilities employing Electron Resonance Cyclotron Ion Sources (ECRIS). As will be demonstrated in this paper, EBIS and Electron Beam Ion Traps (EBIT), are well suited for the task as they are capable of delivering clean, highly charged beams within a short transformation time. The increasing demand for highly charged ions of all kind of elements and isotopes, stable and radioactive, to be used for low-energy experiments such as TITAN at TRIUMF and MATS at FAIR, but also for post-acceleration to higher energies, is now pushing the development of the breeders. The next challenge will be to satisfy the needs, for example space-charge capacity, of the second generation radioactive beam facilities presently under construction or in the design stage, such as the MSU re-accelerator (ReA 3), SPIRAL 2, SPES and later on EURISOL. Radioactive trap facilities will also require high performance breeders geared towards rapid breeding times. The requirements and the critical issues of the breeding concept will be discussed and a review of the different facilities, operational and plan ned, will be given. The paper does furthermore feature a summary of the extensive <b>breeding</b> experience <b>gained</b> under operational conditions at REX-ISOLDE, including results from dedicated beam cleaning tests, isotope production using in-trap decay, high-current and continuous ion injection into the breeder, and closed-shell breeding...|$|R
40|$|Theoretically, {{individuals}} of migratory species should optimize reproductive investment {{based on a}} combination of timing of and body condition at arrival on the breeding grounds. A minimum threshold body mass is required to initiate reproduction, and the timing of reaching this threshold is critical because of the trade-off between delaying <b>breeding</b> to <b>gain</b> in condition against the declining value of offspring with later reproductive timing. Long-lived species have the flexibility within their life history to skip reproduction in a given year if they are unable to achieve this theoretical mass threshold. Although the decision to breed or not is an important parameter influencing population dynamics, the mechanisms underlying this decision are poorly understood. Here, we mimicked an unpredictable environmental perturbation that induced a reduction in body mass of Arctic pre-breeding (before the laying period) female common eiders Somateria mollissima; a long-lived migratory seaduck, while controlling for individual variation in the pre-laying physiological reproductive readiness via vitellogenin (VTG) – a yolk-targeted lipoprotein. Our aim was to causally determine the interaction between body condition and pre-laying reproductive readiness (VTG) on breeding propensity by experimentally reducing body mass in treatment females. We first demonstrated that arrival body condition was a key driver of breeding propensity. Secondly, we found that treatment and VTG levels interacted to influence breeding propensity, indicating that our experimental manipulation, mimicking an unpredictable food shortage, reduced breeding propensity, regardless of the degree of pre-laying physiological reproductive readiness (i. e. timing of ovarian follicles recruitment). Our experiment demonstrates that momentary environmental perturbations during the pre-breeding period can strongly affect the decision to breed, a key parameter driving population dynamics...|$|R
