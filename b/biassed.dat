2500|$|... 1999 â€” On 27 December, four {{high-profile}} Falun Gong {{practitioners are}} put on trial for [...] "undermining {{the implementation of the}} law" [...] and illegally obtaining state secrets. They include Beijing engineer and prominent Falun Gong organizer Zhiwen Wang, sentenced to 16 years in prison, and Li Chang, an official of the Ministry of Public Security, sentenced to 18 years. [...] According to Amnesty International, in these prosecutions and others, [...] "the judicial process was <b>biassed</b> against the defendants at the outset and the trials were a mere formality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Malthus {{might have}} created a much better book, {{suggests}} Hazlitt, [...] "a great work {{on the principle of}} population". But he has weakened its effect, even precipitated dangerous consequences, by being <b>biassed</b> in favour of the affluent establishment and too willing to place upon the poor the burden of solving the entire problem. [...] "It is not our author's wish to recommend any alterations in existing institutions. ... Mr. Malthus's 'gospel is preached to the poor.'" [...] "Our author has ... counteracted many capital errors formerly prevailing as to the universal and indiscriminate encouragement of population under all circumstances ... but he has countenanced opposite errors ... and has left it to future philosophers to follow up the principle, that some check must be provided for the unrestrained progress of population, into a set of wiser and more humane consequences." ...|$|E
60|$|We are all <b>biassed</b> {{to ignore}} our mental {{imperfections}} {{and to talk}} and act as though our minds were exact instruments,--something wherewith to scale the heavens with assurance,--and also we are <b>biassed</b> to believe that, except for perversity, all our minds work exactly alike.|$|E
60|$|Christina thinks you're {{so anxious}} not to favour him because he's your nephew {{that you are}} {{positively}} <b>biassed</b> against him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Papa {{will never}} hear of it--never--never! You don't know him. I do. He is either <b>biassed</b> {{in favour of}} a thing, or prejudiced against it. Argument is {{powerless}} against either feeling.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Lockhart was not fond of Sir Walter's {{experiments}} in gas, the [...] "smell" [...] gave him no [...] "deep, untold delight," [...] and his [...] "infamous review" [...] was <b>biassed</b> by these circumstances.|$|E
6000|$|Had he but persevered, and <b>biassed</b> her [...] To {{slip the}} {{breeches}} on, and hie away, [...] Who knows {{but that the}} map of France had shaped [...] And it will never now! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] said Lady Caroline, in {{her gently}} {{questioning}} voice; [...] "a woman whose dresses {{are made in}} Paris and whose marriage {{has been made in}} Heaven might be equally <b>biassed</b> for and against free imports." ...|$|E
60|$|I confess {{this little}} {{adventure}} {{gave me an}} aversion to popular tumults all my life after, and if nothing else {{had been in the}} cause, would have <b>biassed</b> me to espouse the king's party in England when our popular heats carried all before it at home.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{usually take}} stock of my guests' clothing,' replied the {{landlord}} drily, for the ready money of the first arrival had decidedly <b>biassed</b> him in favour of that gentleman's cause. 'You can certainly see some of {{it if you want}} to,' he added carelessly, 'for it is drying by the kitchen fire.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is really}} very {{good of you to}} come, Watson," [...] said he. [...] "It makes a {{considerable}} difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else <b>biassed.</b> If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets." ...|$|E
60|$|I confess I {{saw little}} about Monsieur Le Compte's {{management}} but skill and good seamanship; {{but nothing is}} more painful to most men than to admit the merit {{of those who have}} obtained an advantage over them. Marble could not forget his own defeat; and the recollection jaundiced his eyes, and <b>biassed</b> his judgment.|$|E
6000|$|Mor. She lives! and I {{shall see}} her once again! I have not thrown away {{my life in}} vain. [...] [Catches hold of INDAMORA'S gown, and falls by [...] her: She sits. I can no more; yet even in death I find My fainting body <b>biassed</b> by my mind: I fall toward you; still my contending soul Points to your breast, and trembles to its pole.|$|E
60|$|Every man {{is likely}} to be <b>biassed,</b> I suppose, in favour of his own {{educational}} course. Yet {{it seems to me that}} those three years of work were educational--that they gave a vision of the universe as a whole and a discipline and a power such as no other course, no classical or mathematical course I have ever had a chance of testing, could do.|$|E
6000|$|... "That isn't a {{very nice}} speech," [...] she said. [...] "There {{is a little bit}} of spitefulness in it. But it doesn't mean anything, anyway. I am out of the competition, and that is the reason I can speak to you so freely. Moreover, that is the reason I know so much about the matter. I am not <b>biassed.</b> But you need have no trouble--there's Amy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your lordship {{need not}} doubt my attention," [...] said the cavalier. And the republican General, after another pause, {{as one who}} gave his {{confidence}} not without hesitation, proceeded to explain his views with a distinctness which he seldom used, yet not without his being a little <b>biassed</b> now and then, by his long habits of circumlocution, which indeed he never laid entirely aside, save {{in the field of}} battle.|$|E
60|$|Wherewith {{he changed}} the {{conversation}} by a question about Stokesley; but he held to his dictum when alone with his nephew, and as {{he was the only}} person for whose opinion Captain Sam had any respect, it had its effect, though {{there was a sense that}} he might be <b>biassed</b> by his son-in-law and his herd of womanfolk, and that he did not partake Mrs. Samuel Merrifield's dislike to the very name of Sister or of anything not commonplace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{everyone}} {{that was not}} interested in the success of this coinage," [...] writes the author of the pamphlet already quoted, [...] "by having contracted for a great quantity of his halfpence at a large discount, or <b>biassed</b> by the hopes of immoderate gain to be made out of the ruins of their country, expressed their apprehensions of the pernicious consequences of this copper money; and resolved {{to make use of the}} right they had by law to refuse the same".[6] ...|$|E
60|$|He smiled faintly, {{and here}} Mr. Fellowes joined them; {{a good man}} likewise, but intent on demonstrating {{the other side of}} the question, and believing that the Popish, persecuting King had {{forfeited}} his rights, so that there need be no scruple as to renouncing what he had thrown up by his flight. It was an endless argument, in which each man could only act according to his own conscience, and endeavour that this conscience should be as little <b>biassed</b> as possible by worldly motives or animosity.|$|E
60|$|If these {{accounts}} by Mrs. Myers, Mrs. Woodward, Scarrat, Wintlebury, {{and others are}} trustworthy, then Elizabeth Canning's narrative is true, for she found the two girls, the tall, swarthy woman, the hay, and the broken water-pitcher, and almost everything else that she had mentioned on January 29, at Mother Wells's house when it was visited on February 1. But {{we must remember that}} most accounts of what Elizabeth said on January 29 and on January 31 are fifteen months after date, and are <b>biassed</b> on both sides.|$|E
60|$|First, There {{wants an}} established, settled, known law, {{received}} and allowed by common consent {{to be the}} standard of right and wrong, and the common measure to decide all controversies between them: for though the law of nature be plain and intelligible to all rational creatures; yet men being <b>biassed</b> by their interest, as well as ignorant for want of study of it, are not apt to allow {{of it as a}} law binding to them in the application of it to their particular cases.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Mrs. Dornell was staggered. Then it {{occurred}} to her that Betty might have privately obtained from Tupcombe the news of her father's serious illness, and, fearing she might be kept back to meet her husband, have gone off with that obstinate and <b>biassed</b> servitor to Falls- Park. The more she thought it over the more probable did the supposition appear; and binding her own head-man to secrecy as to Betty's movements, whether as she conjectured, or otherwise, Mrs. Dornell herself prepared to set out.|$|E
60|$|Thus, sir, it lies at {{your door}} {{to gain the}} applause of the whole city, a few misers excepted, by a generous and gentlemanlike {{discovery}} of this affair. And you are thus publicly called upon, that your discovery may be as public and beneficial to all. If you comply, I shall think you an honest man, above a fellow feeling, or being <b>biassed,</b> and most worthy your office; if not, give me leave to think, the citizens of London have made but an indifferent choice.|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} reason for her respect which Mrs. Baynes, too good a churchwoman to be worldly, {{would have been the}} last to admit--she often heard her husband {{describe}} old Jolyon as extremely well off, and was <b>biassed</b> towards his granddaughter for the soundest of all reasons. To-day she felt the emotion with which we read a novel describing a hero and an inheritance, nervously anxious lest, by some frightful lapse of the novelist, the young man should be left without it at the end.|$|E
6000|$|But {{when the}} Popish Plot was exploded, and Charles II. was firm on his throne, still more under James II., every one was {{apt to be}} <b>biassed</b> in the {{opposite}} direction, and to throw the guilt on the fallen party of Oates, Bedloe, Dugdale, and the other deeply perjured and infamous informers. Thus both the evidence of 1678- 1680, and that collected in 1684-1687, by Sir Roger L'Estrange, J.P. (who took great trouble and was allowed access to the manuscript documents of the earlier inquiries), must be regarded with suspicion.* ...|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{she came}} to me, and told me all the discourse; in short, she soon <b>biassed</b> me to consent, in a case which I had some regret in my mind for declining before; so I {{prepared}} to see him. I dressed me to all the advantage possible, I assure you, {{and for the first}} time used a little art; I say for the first time, for I had never yielded to the baseness of paint before, having always had vanity enough to believe I had no need of it.|$|E
60|$|A {{composite}} portrait {{represents the}} picture that would rise before the mind's eye {{of a man who}} had the gift of pictorial imagination in an exalted degree. But the imaginative power even of the highest artists is far from precise, and is so apt to be <b>biassed</b> by special cases that may have struck their fancies, that no two artists agree in any of their typical forms. The merit of the photographic composite is its mechanical precision, being subject to no errors beyond those incidental to all photographic productions.|$|E
60|$|Sixthly, and lastly, I have attended. {{as closely}} as I could, to the {{expression}} of the several passions in some of the commoner animals; and this I believe to be of paramount importance, not of course for deciding how far in man certain expressions are characteristic of certain states of mind, but as affording the safest basis for generalisation on the causes, or origin, of the various movements of Expression. In observing animals, we are not so likely to be <b>biassed</b> by our imagination; and we may feel safe that their expressions are not conventional.|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} explain the {{subtleties}} of her feeling as he could state his opinion, {{even though she had}} skill in speech, and her father had none. That Fitzpiers acted upon her like a dram, exciting her, throwing her into a novel atmosphere which <b>biassed</b> her doings until the influence was over, when she felt something of the nature of regret for the mood she had experienced--still more if she reflected on the silent, almost sarcastic, criticism apparent in Winterborne's air towards her--could not be told to this worthy couple in words.|$|E
60|$|Though it {{is rather}} {{unconnected}} with our immediate subject, we cannot help adding, that Mrs. Dods has preserved the recipes of certain excellent old dishes which we would be loath should fall into oblivion in our day; and in bearing this testimony, we protest that we are no way <b>biassed</b> by the receipt of two bottles of excellent sauce for cold meat, which were sent {{to us by the}} said Mrs. Dods, as a mark of her respect and regard, for which we return her our unfeigned thanks, having found them capital.|$|E
60|$|Starting {{for church}} {{the next morning}} several minutes earlier than was usual with him, the steward {{intentionally}} loitered along {{the road from the}} village till old Mr. Springrove overtook him. Manston spoke very civilly of the morning, and of the weather, asking how the farmer's barometer stood, and when it was probable that the wind might change. It was not in Mr. Springrove's nature--going to church as he was, too--to return anything but a civil answer to such civil questions, however his feelings might have been <b>biassed</b> by late events. The conversation was continued on terms of greater friendliness.|$|E
60|$|Laws and rights, like {{common terms}} in speech, are {{provisional}} things, conveniences for taking {{hold of a}} number of cases that would otherwise be unmanageable. The appeal to Justice is a necessarily inadequate attempt to de-individualize a case, to eliminate the self's <b>biassed</b> attitude. I have declared that it is my wilful belief that everything that exists is significant and necessary. The idea of Justice seems to me a defective, quantitative application of the spirit of that belief to men and women. In every case you try and discover and act upon a plausible equity that must necessarily be based on arbitrary assumptions.|$|E
60|$|But {{celestial}} imperiousness, love, wrath, and fervour {{had proved}} to be somewhat thrown away on netherward Egdon. Her power was limited, and the consciousness of this limitation had <b>biassed</b> her development. Egdon was her Hades, and since coming there she had imbibed much of what was dark in its tone, though inwardly and eternally unreconciled thereto. Her appearance accorded well with this smouldering rebelliousness, and the shady splendour of her beauty was the real surface of the sad and stifled warmth within her. A true Tartarean dignity sat upon her brow, and not factitiously or with marks of constraint, for it had grown in her with years.|$|E
60|$|But {{in order}} that {{the mind of the}} reader may not be <b>biassed</b> at the outset by that which he may happen to have {{received}} of current theories respecting beauty, founded on the above metaphorical uses of the word, (theories which are less to be reprobated as accounting falsely for the sensations of which they treat, than as confusing two or more pleasurable sensations together,) I shall briefly glance at the four erroneous positions most frequently held upon this subject, before proceeding to examine those typical and vital properties of things, to which I conceive that all our original conceptions of beauty may be traced.|$|E
60|$|DUKE. But I {{shall be}} the magistrate. [CONJURER stares at him again.] That's the system, my dear Hastings, that's the {{advantage}} of the system. Not a logical system--no Rousseau in it--but see how well it works! I {{shall be the}} very best magistrate that could be on the Bench. The others would be <b>biassed,</b> you know. Old Sir Lawrence is a Vegetarian himself; and might be hard on the Anti-Vegetarian roughs. Colonel Crashaw would be sure to be hard on the Vegetarian roughs. But if I've paid both of 'em, of course I shan't be hard on either of 'em--and there you have it. Just perfect impartiality.|$|E
60|$|There is {{one final}} and {{complete}} {{answer to all}} such charges. It {{is that we have}} now in our hands 42,000 males of the Boer nations. They assert, and we cannot deny, that their losses in killed have been extraordinarily light during two years of warfare. How are these admitted and certain facts compatible with any general refusal of quarter? To anyone who, like myself, has seen the British soldiers jesting and smoking cigarettes with their captives within five minutes of their being taken, such a charge is ludicrous, but surely even to the most <b>biassed</b> mind the fact stated above must be conclusive.|$|E
