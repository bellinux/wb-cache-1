25|$|Rosemary Hennessy {{traces the}} history of materialist {{feminism}} {{in the work of}} British and French feminists who preferred the term materialist feminism to Marxist feminism. In their view, Marxism had to be altered to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the sexual division of labor. Marxism was inadequate to the task because of its class bias and focus on production. Feminism was also problematic due to its essentialist and idealist concept of woman. Material feminism then emerged as a positive substitute to both Marxism and feminism, and pointed out the unequal distribution of social resources.|$|E

25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E
25|$|The 2 May 1776 at the Stockholm Palace, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte was {{initiated}} into the Freemasonry by the Grand Master of the Swedish Freemasons, her own consort Duke Charles. She was made Grand Mistress of Le véritable et constante amitié, a female Lodge of Adoption under the regular Swedish Masonic order, which {{used the same}} localities as the male order at the Stockholm Palace. The constitution of the Lodge was confirmed by Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and Bathilde d'Orléans, Grand Master and Grand Mistress of the French male and female Freemasons, on 8 May 1776. Known members of this female lodge were Countesses Sophie and Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen, Countess Ulrica Catharina Koskull and, likely, Countess Charlotte Gyldenstolpe. Not much is known about this lodge. However, Duke Charles gave Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte access to the first three grades of the regular male Freemasonic order. According to Karl Adolf Boheman, the reason was that she asked Charles to allow the female freemasons {{to participate in the}} male order. He did not agree, but he did give her access to the first three grades of the male Freemasons and the books of rituals, so that she could <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the Masonic rituals for the female freemasons better. A written statement is preserved where she explains the male freemasons first three grades and states that though females could not be regular members because of the warlike ideals of the orders, they are no reasons to why the remaining mysteries should be kept from females. There is no date on this statement. The mystic Karl Adolf Boheman was presented to the Ducal couple by Count Magnus Stenbock in 1793. In 1802, he founded the co-freemasonic adoption lodge Yellow Rose with the Ducal couple as leading members. Both male and female members were initiated in this lodge, one of them being the mother of the queen. When Boheman attempted to initiate King Gustav IV Adolf in 1803, he refused, warned by Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt that the lodge was in fact a society of the Illuminati conspiring against him. This led to the Boheman Affair, which caused a lasting rift between the King and the Ducal couple. Boheman was arrested and expelled, after Duke Charles had been forced by the King to exclude Boheman from the freemasons. The ducal couple were exposed to an informal investigation by the monarch, and the duchess was questioned {{in the presence of the}} royal council.|$|E

2500|$|In {{their book}} [...] (1977), Crone and her {{associate}} Michael Cook, {{working at the}} School of Oriental and African Studies, London at the time, provided a new analysis of early Islamic history.

By studying the only surviving contemporary accounts {{of the rise of}} Islam, which were written in Armenian, Greek, Aramaic and Syriac by witnesses, they reconstructed a significantly different story of Islam's beginnings, compared with the story known from the Islamic traditions.

2500|$|In the 1960s, Chomsky {{introduced}} two central ideas {{relevant to}} the construction and evaluation of grammatical theories. The first was the distinction between competence and performance. Chomsky noted the obvious fact that people, when speaking in the real world, often make linguistic errors (e.g., starting a sentence and then abandoning it midway through). He argued that these errors in linguistic performance were ir{{relevant to the}} study of linguistic competence (the knowledge that allows people to construct and understand grammatical sentences). Consequently, the linguist can study an idealised version of language, greatly simplifying linguistic analysis (see the [...] "Grammaticality" [...] section below). The second idea related directly to the evaluation of theories of grammar. Chomsky distinguished between grammars that achieve descriptive adequacy and those that go further and achieved explanatory adequacy. A descriptively adequate grammar for a particular language defines the (infinite) set of grammatical sentences in that language; that is, it describes the language in its entirety. A grammar that achieves explanatory adequacy has the additional property that it gives an insight into the underlying linguistic structures in the human mind; that is, it does not merely describe the grammar of a language, but makes predictions about how linguistic knowledge is mentally represented. For Chomsky, the nature of such mental representations is largely innate, so if a grammatical theory has explanatory adequacy it must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the various grammatical nuances of the languages of the world as relatively minor variations in the universal pattern of human language. Chomsky argued that, even though linguists were still a long way from constructing descriptively adequate grammars, progress in terms of descriptive adequacy will only come if linguists hold explanatory adequacy as their goal. In other words, real insight into the structure of individual languages can only be gained through comparative study {{of a wide range of}} languages, on the assumption that they are all cut from the same cloth.|$|E
