5|$|Some {{problems}} remain: ?Oryzomys pliocaenicus, a Miocene fossil from Kansas, is of uncertain identity but may {{belong in}} Bensonomys, and fossils from the Miocene of Oregon and Pliocene of New Mexico {{have also been}} ascribed to Oryzomys, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> incorrectly. A possible Oryzomys has been recorded from the Irvingtonian (Pleistocene) of Saskatchewan.|$|E

5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} {{is frequently}} caught incidentally by trawlers of Australia's South East Trawl Fishery, which operate throughout its range. It is discarded after capture with an unknown, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> high, rate of survival. Since this species {{does not appear}} to be threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E

The Atlantic City algorithms which are bounded probabilistic polynomial time algorithms are probably correct and probably fast.|$|R
5|$|Bulls and Bears, a farce {{performed}} at Drury Lane on 2 December 1715, {{was attributed to}} Cibber but was never published. The Dramatic Works of Colley Cibber, Esq. (London, 1777) includes a play called Flora, or Hob in the Well, {{but it is not}} by Cibber. Hob, or the Country Wake. A Farce. By Mr. Doggett was attributed to Cibber by William Chetwood in his General History of the Stage (1749), but John Genest in Some Account of the English Stage (1832) thought it was by Thomas Doggett. Other plays attributed to Cibber <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> not by him include Cinna's Conspiracy, {{performed at}} Drury Lane on 19 February 1713, and The Temple of Dullness of 1745.|$|E
5|$|Drymoreomys albimaculatus {{appears to}} be a {{specialist}} of dense, moist, montane and premontane forest. It has been found in disturbed and secondary forests as well as in pristine forest, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> needs contiguous forest to survive. Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. Although some of its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are suggestive of arboreal (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens were collected in pitfall traps on the ground.|$|E
5|$|In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The {{following}} year William Wallace and Andrew Murrey raised forces {{to resist the}} occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Murrey died of wounds after the battle and {{for a short time}} Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm. Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk. Wallace escaped <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> resigned as Guardian of Scotland. In 1305 he fell {{into the hands of the}} English, who executed him for treason despite the fact that he owed no allegiance to England.|$|E

5|$|Mammals signal by {{a variety}} of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, {{honestly}} indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> with a range of functions both within and between species. Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in echolocation.|$|E
5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii, {{also known}} as Vespucci's rodent, is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil. Italian {{explorer}} Amerigo Vespucci may have seen it {{on a visit to}} Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, perhaps because of the exotic rats and mice introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> Holocene age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July, {{a council}} {{was held in}} the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to {{establish}} a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond of Toulouse at first refused to become king, perhaps attempting to show his piety, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> hoping that the other nobles would insist upon his election anyway. Godfrey, who had become the more popular of the two after Raymond's actions at the siege of Antioch, did no damage to his own piety by accepting a position as secular leader. Raymond was incensed at this development and took his army out into the countryside.|$|E

5|$|The 400-year period {{following}} {{the collapse of}} Roman rule {{is the most difficult}} to interpret in the history of Wales. After the Roman departure from Britain in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples. Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades, some previously maintained that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. This idea has been discarded in the face of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> late Neolithic, or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas.|$|E
5|$|The actual authorship of {{the book}} is unclear. The second Dutch edition {{of the book}} carried the text 'Op last van den staatssekretaris der Z.A.R., F.W. Reitz' ('By order of the State Secretary of the S.A.R., F.W. Reitz'). J.C. Smuts is {{indicated}} as author, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> only edited the introduction {{and the end of the}} book, in co-operation with E. J. P. Jorissen. The rest of the text was probably prepared by J. de Villiers Roos.|$|E
5|$|The church {{held the}} right to conduct the marriages of people {{throughout}} Manchester, not only from within its parish, until 1874. Despite this, there were no such services for the first 35 years of its existence, {{perhaps because of the}} continued popularity of the Collegiate Church as a venue for weddings <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> because the latter insisted on collecting its own fees for marriages held in other local churches, which effectively doubled the cost of being married at St John's rather than at the Collegiate Church. Later, after the rights of the Collegiate Church were curtailed, some weeks saw more than 100 marriage services at St John's in the years just before 1874.|$|E

5|$|The east front {{looks more}} medieval {{than the other}} sides <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> dates from about 1900, however the south end cross-wing appears to be mostly sixteenth century. To {{the north of the}} house stands the well-preserved sixteenth century stable courtyard. This has timbered gabled dormer windows, and a tall clock-tower at the west side of its north range. These {{buildings}} have mullion windows, and Tudor arched-doorways. Also beside the courtyard are the brew house, one of the oldest in Britain, and the bakehouse. The two lodges are seventeenth century and the carriage-houses are eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} {{for this group}} appears to be {{restricted}} to a foot bone of an early Miocene bird from Bavaria which {{has been identified as}} an extinct representative of the climbing Certhioidea, a clade comprising the treecreepers, wallcreeper and nuthatches. It has been described as Certhiops rummeli. Two fossil species have been described in the Sitta genus: S. cuvieri Gervais, 1852 and S. senogalliensis Portis, 1888, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> not belong to nuthatches.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{posed by}} the ratio is that the {{multiple}} specimens studied, died in the same place, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> not in a sudden mass-death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population. The results may have been distorted by a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, {{it was suggested that}} individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus might be an indication of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.|$|E

5|$|According to {{at least}} one account, Bogdan-Pitești was educated in Geneva, at a local Catholic institution. Raised in the Romanian Orthodox faith, he {{converted}} to Catholicism in his twenties, but was no longer a practicing Catholic by the time of his death. He supposedly attended medical school at the University of Montpellier, without ever graduating, and afterwards left to join the bohemian milieu of Paris. He may have enrolled at the University of Paris, studying Law and Letters, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> withdrew after a short while. Art historian Sanda Miller recounts that Bogdan-Pitești attended the École des Beaux-Arts in the French capital, but that he was ultimately expelled. Other sources express doubt that the Romanian aristocrat was ever affiliated with any university or college, in either France or Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's 10-year {{campaign}} in Asia, and the Macedonian {{conquest of the}} Persian empire, were to become the stuff of legend. The Macedonian army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule {{over most of the}} territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the Macedonian army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns <b>but,</b> <b>probably</b> exhausted by years of hard campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.|$|E
5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E
