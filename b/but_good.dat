5|$|Some early {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, {{and preferred}} to eat parrots and pigeons; others {{described it as}} tough <b>but</b> <b>good.</b> Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters {{had to be careful}} not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E

5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, <b>but</b> <b>good</b> enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} months later, the Gardiners take Elizabeth {{on a trip to}} the Peak District; their visit also {{includes}} Darcy's estate, Pemberley; Elizabeth agrees to go with them, believing that he is away travelling. Elizabeth is stunned by its wealth and beauty, and hears nothing <b>but</b> <b>good</b> things about Darcy from his housekeeper. There, she accidentally runs into Darcy, who has arrived home early. He invites her and the Gardiners to meet his sister. His manners have softened considerably, and Georgiana takes an instant liking to Elizabeth. When Elizabeth learns that her immature and flirtatious youngest sister Lydia has run away with Wickham, she tearfully blurts out the news to Darcy and the Gardiners before returning home. Her family expects social ruin for having a disgraced daughter, but over a week later they are relieved to hear that Mr. Gardiner had discovered the pair in London and that they had married. Lydia later slips to Elizabeth that Darcy was the one who found them and paid for the marriage.|$|E

25|$|Keegan {{was unable}} to inspire Fulham to {{overcome}} Grimsby Town in the playoffs, <b>but</b> <b>good</b> form in 1998–99 – helped by the acquisition of more players who would normally have been signed by Premier League or Division one clubs – clinched them the Division Two title and promotion to Division One, but Keegan left {{at the end of}} the season to concentrate on his duties as England manager, having succeeded Glenn Hoddle in February 1999.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, Charles Cowden Clarke {{also wrote}} on this play. Kehler notes {{he was the}} husband of famous Shakespearean scholar Mary Cowden Clarke. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class {{mechanicals}} of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited <b>but</b> <b>good</b> natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with {{the representatives of the}} fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor.|$|E
25|$|The swallow-tailed hummingbird mainly forages at mid-levels, <b>but</b> <b>good</b> {{food sources}} are {{exploited}} from anywhere near ground level {{right up to}} the tree tops. It chiefly feeds on flower nectar, particularly from Fabaceae, Gesneriaceae, Malvaceae (especially Bombacoideae and Malvoideae), Myrtaceae, Rubiaceae and epiphytic Bromeliaceae. It is not a very specialized feeder however, and has also been recorded from plants of other families, such as Asteraceae or Caryocaraceae. It utilizes flowers of native {{as well as those of}} some introduced ornamental plants. It will also take insects caught by hawking. In south-eastern Brazil where it is plentiful even in urban parks and gardens, it is commonly attracted to hummingbird feeders.|$|E

25|$|In the ODI series Trott made 69 in {{the opening}} match to help England win by 24 runs. He {{continued}} his good form into the next match and {{made it back to}} back fifties as England won by four wickets to go 2–0 up in the series. Trott could only make two in the next match as Pakistan won to keep the series alive. He was dismissed for four in the next match as Pakistan levelled the series going into the decider. Trott could only make three in the final game, <b>but</b> <b>good</b> performance from teammates Eoin Morgan and Paul Collingwood ensured England won by 121 runs to win the series 3–2.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} caveat about quicksort is {{that its}} worst-case performance is O(n2); while this is rare, in naive implementations (choosing the first or last element as pivot) this occurs for sorted data, which is a common case. The most complex issue in quicksort is thus choosing a good pivot element, as consistently poor choices of pivots can result in drastically slower O(n2) performance, <b>but</b> <b>good</b> choice of pivots yields O(n log n) performance, which is asymptotically optimal. For example, if at each step the median is chosen as the pivot then the algorithm works in O(nlogn). Finding the median, such as by the median of medians selection algorithm is however an O(n) operation on unsorted lists and therefore exacts significant overhead with sorting. In practice choosing a random pivot almost certainly yields O(nlogn) performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} opinion, however, of most Islamic scholar {{is that a}} niqab wearer (niqabi), {{in exchange}} for being permitted to wear the niqab and it not being made prohibited, is required only to refrain from criticizing other Muslim women who don't wear the niqab if the other Muslim women cover all their body except for their face (i.e. hijabis). The niqabi is also required to refrain from forcing or propagating her niqab wearing practice upon others, especially against their will. Then, a niqabi shall also not be criticized for her wearing the niqab because {{she thought it was}} obligatory, or because she had been taught it was obligatory, or because she wishes {{to err on the side}} of caution in an incorrect <b>but</b> <b>good</b> faith gesture of extreme modesty.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday 13 January 2008 Sydney flew up to Brisbane to {{play the}} Queensland Roar at Suncorp Stadium. The game {{finished}} 0–0, with both sides taking a point. Sydney only needed a draw to secure their place for a 3rd consecutive finals appearance. The draw means that the top 4 teams (Sydney, Queensland Roar, Central Coast Mariners, Newcastle Jets) are all on 31 points each, although Queensland are on top due to goal difference. Both teams had excellent chances to open the scoring for their club, <b>but</b> <b>good</b> keeping and failure to capitalise on good opportunities meant that many goals went begging. In the end the 32,000 strong crowd at Suncorp Stadium went home feeling disappointed that they didn't get their moneys worth for this State of Origin Match.|$|E
25|$|The phrase 'bush carpentry' is a {{familiar}} Australian usage, but finding an exact description of its practice is rare. The Macquarie Dictionary for example, defines a bush carpenter as a rough amateur carpenter, and G. A. Wilkes says he is a rough and ready carpenter. The Macquarie in turn defines rough-and-ready as rough, rude or crude, <b>but</b> <b>good</b> enough for the purpose. Wannan says that a bush carpenter is 'a very rough, unorthodox artisan indeed', and includes a sardonic excerpt from Henry Lawson to exemplify it. In his Bushcraft series Ron Edwards describes hut and furniture building, and 'stockcamp architecture', without once using the phrase 'bush carpentry', though 'rough and ready' recurs. Tocal Agricultural College offers a course in 'Traditional bush timber construction'; The word 'traditional' appears six times in the course outline, but not 'bush carpentry'.|$|E
25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information <b>but</b> <b>good</b> quality visual information, {{they may be more}} likely to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E
