40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect that}} <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> has had on commodity and global food prices. The innovative contribution {{of this paper is}} the interactive spreadsheet that allows the reader to choose the assumptions behind the estimates. By allowing the reader to choose the country, time period, supply and demand elasticities, and the size of indirect effects we explicitly illustrate the sensitivity of the estimated effect of <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> on prices. Our best estimates suggest that the increase in <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> {{over the past two years}} has had a sizeable impact on corn, sugar, barley and soybean prices, but a much smaller impact on global food prices.; Over the past two years (ending June 2008), we estimate that the increase in worldwide <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> pushed up corn, soybean and sugar prices by 27, 21 and 12 percentage points respectively. The countries that account for most of the upward pressure on these prices are the United States and Brazil. Our best estimates suggest that the increase in U. S. <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> (ethanol and biodiesel) pushed up corn prices by more than 22 percentage points and soybean prices (soybeans and soybean oil) by more than 15 percentage points, while the increase in EU <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> pushed corn and soybean prices up around 3 percentage points. Brazil's increase in sugar-based ethanol production accounts for the entire rise in the price of sugar.; Although biofuels had a noticeable impact on individual crop prices, they had a much smaller impact on global food prices. Our best estimate suggests that the increase in worldwide <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> over the past two years accounts for just over 12 percent of the rise in the IMF's food price index. The increase in U. S. <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> accounts for roughly 60 percent of this effect, while Brazil accounts for 14 percent and the EU accounts for 15 percent. The key take-away point is that nearly 90 percent of the rise in global food prices comes from factors other than biofuels. Prices; Farm produce...|$|R

5|$|A {{study by}} the Brazilian {{research}} unit of the Fundação Getúlio Vargas regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices. concluded that the major driver behind the 2007–2008 rise in food prices was speculative activity on futures markets under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks. The study also concluded that expansion of <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> was not a relevant factor and also {{that there is no}} correlation between Brazilian sugarcane cultivated area and average grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country.|$|E

Furthermore, knowledge of how these microbial communities function is required to control them, and metagenomics is a key tool in their understanding. Metagenomic approaches allow comparative analyses between convergent microbial systems like biogas fermenters or insect herbivores such as the fungus garden of the leafcutter ants.|$|E

40|$|The <b>production</b> of {{cellulosic}} <b>biofuels</b> {{may have}} a large influence on future land emissions of greenhouse gases. These effects will vary across space and time depending on land-use policies, trade, and variations in environmental conditions. We link an economic model with a terrestrial biogeochemistry model to explore how projections of cellulosic <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> may influence future land emissions of carbon and nitrous oxide. Tropical regions, particularly Africa and Latin America, are projected to become major producers of <b>biofuels.</b> Most <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> is projected to occur on lands {{that would otherwise be}} used to produce crops, livestock and timber. <b>Biofuels</b> <b>production</b> leads to displacement and a redistribution of global food and timber production along with a reduction in the trade of food products. Overall, <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> and the displacement of other managed lands increase emissions of greenhouse gases primarily as a result of carbon emissions from deforestation and nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer applications to maximize <b>biofuel</b> crop <b>production</b> in tropical regions. With optimal application of nitrogen fertilizers, cellulosic <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> may enhance carbon sequestration in soils of some regions. As a result, the relative importance of carbon emissions versus nitrous oxide emissions varies among regions. Reductions in carbon sequestration by natural ecosystems caused by the expansion of biofuels have minor effects on the global greenhouse gas budget and are more than compensated by concurrent biofuel-induced reductions in nitrous oxide emissions from natural ecosystems. Land policies that avoid deforestation and fertilizer applications, particularly in tropical regions, will have the largest impact on minimizing land emissions of greenhouse gas from cellulosic <b>biofuels</b> <b>production.</b> [URL] research {{was supported in part by}} the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to the MBL, Department of Energy, Office of Science (BER) grants DE-FG 02 - 94 ER 61937, DE-FG 02 - 93 ER 61677, DE-FG 02 - 08 ER 64648, EPA grant XA- 83240101, NSF grant BCS- 0410344, and the industrial and foundation sponsors of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change...|$|R

25|$|The {{price of}} food is {{affected}} {{to a certain}} degree by the use of maize for <b>biofuel</b> <b>production.</b> The cost of transportation, production, and marketing are a large portion (80%) of the price of food in the United States. Higher energy costs affect these costs, especially transportation. The increase in food prices the consumer has been seeing is mainly due to the higher energy cost. The effect of <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> on other food crop prices is indirect. Use of maize for <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> increases the demand, and therefore price of maize. This, in turn, results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production. This reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the literature available on <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> through different chemical catalytic routes. Biofuels are promising alternative to the fast-depleting fossil fuel and oil reserves. In consideration of the existing environmental issues, such as greenhouse effect and global warming, researchers are now interested in <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> from biomass. <b>Biofuels</b> are produced from renewable and sustainable bioresources, which are available globally in the form of residual agricultural biomass and wastes. However, the <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> process through chemical transformation could be very expensive and uneconomical for large-scale commercial supply. Hence, there is a continuous need for improvisation on the research on this topic. This review broadly describes the different types of biofuels and the processes for their production through catalytic routes.

25|$|There {{is clearly}} a demand for {{sustainable}} <b>biofuel</b> <b>production,</b> but whether a particular biofuel will be used ultimately depends not on sustainability but cost efficiency. Therefore, research is focusing on cutting the cost of algal <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> {{to the point where}} it can compete with conventional petroleum. The production of several products from algae has been mentioned as the most important factor for making algae production economically viable. Other factors are the improving of the solar energy to biomass conversion efficiency (currently 3%, but 5 to 7% is theoretically attainable)and making the oil extraction from the algae easier.|$|E

30|$|<b>Biofuels</b> <b>production</b> has {{significantly}} increased {{during the last}} decade due to a favourable framework and the support of several policies. Nowadays biofuels represent 11 % of the total biomass produced in EU- 27, being biodiesel the highest contributor to the total production, 60 % (EC 2011). The contribution of Europe to <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> is expected to increase due to its high potential. Nevertheless, this affirmation could be misleading because of two reasons: i) According to many studies the potential for European <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> is clearly limited, and ii) Currently (2013), a substantial share of biofuels used in Europe is based on imported feedstock. In case of increasing, rapeseed oil seems {{to be one of the}} raw materials expected to contribute the most in the share of biodiesel. So, in order to cover this potential fuel in the analysis, biodiesel from rapeseed oil was included as dataset.|$|R
