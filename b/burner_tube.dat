40|$|Two {{mathematical}} {{models have}} been developed to simulate two-dimensional, premixed, laminar, stationary, axisymmetric methane-air flames, and successfully validated with non-intrusive Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) temperature measurements. With the first model, the heat releaser ate model, volumetric heat release rate was generalised from one-dimensional computations. This approximation greatly simplified the set of governing equations that need to be solved. However, it cannot describe the effects of high stretch rates or of negative stretch rate. The second model made use of a number of reduced chemical kinetic schemes, with realistic elementary reactions. These were drawn from the literature and realistic transport properties have been included. With this model, {{based on the work of}} Peters (1985), the effects of stretch are automatically accounted for. Practical experimental validation was obtained with a multiple slot burner, supplied by the collaborating body, British Gas p 1 c. Temperature fields, obtained with the CARS technique, partially validated the reduced chemical kinetic scheme model. Some uncertainty arose in the prediction of heat loss to the <b>burner</b> <b>tube.</b> A numerical algorithm based upon the SUVIPLE method was employed,with a fully staggered grid. Various discretisation schemes were examined with the heat release model. Based on these tests, the hybrid scheme was selected for use in the reduced model. With this approach, a few reduced kinetic schemes have been selected and implemented. The most successfuol ne was the Peters(1985) scheme. This consisted of 4 global reaction steps with 18 elementary reactions and 7 non-steady chemical species. The scheme has been employed in all the detailed computations in the present study. With this scheme, two-dimensional field solutions, for methane-air mixtures with equivalence ratios of 0. 75, 0. 84 and 1. 0, with slot widths of 2 mm, and 3 mm, and mean inlet velocities ranging from 0. 3 m/s to 2. 8 m/s have been obtained.

At sufficiently high rotational speeds, flame stabilization on top of the burner rim becomes impossible and the flame enters into the tube, i. e. immersed flame.

The direct photographic method was employed to investigate the influence of fuel flow rate and nozzle diameter, d, on the flame morphology. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} determination of the flame length, L_f, over a wide range of the fuel flow rate. It became clear that (i) as the nozzle velocty is increased from zero, the flame burning under conditions of mixing with air is induced and its length is monotonically increased until a laminar-to-turbulent transition occurs, and (ii) after the transition takes place, the turbulent flame length is substantially independent of further increase in fuel jet velocity. A few relationships pertinent to the flame length, i. e. L_f versus u_j, L_f/d versus, Re, and L_f/d versus d, were proposed and examined. In the laminar diffusion flame case, effects of nozzle diameter and Reynolds number on the flame length appear if the experimental data are summarized using the dimensionless flame length, L_f/d.

One {{of the most popular}} technological processes is through direct combustion of biomass or in a controlled atmosphere or gasification. The current gasifier that has a maximum heat capacity of combustion system of 15. 02 kW, used to burn biomass (oil palm shell) produces gases of low calorific gas through a low calorific swirl gas burner. Some problem appears using low calorific, it causes no circulation and weak swirling flame, and this will be an increase of residence time at high temperature. The gas burner, which is incorporated with the two-stage biomass combustion system, consists of <b>burner</b> <b>tube</b> and swirl-vane.

This technology could substantially reduce NOx and CO 2 emissions. In addition, the implementation of oxy-fuel combustion technology in a power generation system could potentially reduce negative environmental impacts of fossil fuel use. It also encourages the use of reliable and domestic energy sources. The U. S.

In an effort to better understand and characterize the fundamental flame characteristics of oxy-fuel combustion, this thesis presents the flame length, stability of CH 4 -O 2 /CH 4 -O 2 -CO 2 / CH 4 -O 2 -CO 2 -H 2 O flames, global flame radiation measurements, and flame temperature. ^ Lengths of oxy-fuel flames mainly depend on fuel firing input and are affected, although less, by O 2 concentration in the fuel-oxidizer mixture. In this study, the stability maps of CH 4 -O 2 were plotted using six different tubular burner diameters, ranging from 1 to 6 mm. The flame from the 1 mm diameter <b>burner</b> <b>tube</b> tended to extinguish, even at lower mass flow rates due to a quenching effect. For larger burner diameters, 2 to 6 mm, the flames tended to flashback. It was also observed that the stability regime increased with an increase in CO 2 and H 2 O concentration in the fuel mixtures. The radiative heat release rates of CH 4 -O 2 flames were greater than CH 4 -air flames. The radiative heat release rate of CH 4 -O 2 flame was almost constant for the lean flames, yielded F value 4. 09 %, 8. 90 % by using solar radiometer and Mark IV radiometer, respectively. Once the equivalence ratio reached more fuel rich conditions, the radiative factor increased as the equivalence ratio increased further. The radiative heat release rates also increased as the percentage of CO 2 increased at a constant fuel firing input.

40|$|Turbine combustors of {{advanced}} power systems have goals to achieve very low pollutants emissions, fuel variability, and fuel flexibility. Future generation gas turbine combustors should tolerate fuel compositions ranging from {{natural gas to}} {{a broad range of}} syngas without sacrificing operational advantages and low emission characteristics. Additionally, current designs {{of advanced}} turbine combustors use various degrees of swirl and lean premixing for stabilizing flames and controlling high temperature NOx formation zones. However, issues of fuel variability and NOx control through premixing also bring a number of concerns, especially combustor flashback and flame blowout. Flashback is a combustion condition at which the flame propagates upstream against the gas stream into the <b>burner</b> <b>tube.</b> Flashback is a critical issue for premixed combustor designs, because it not only causes serious hardware damages but also increases pollutant emissions. In swirl stabilized lean premixed turbine combustors onset of flashback may occur due to (i) boundary layer flame propagation (critical velocity gradient), (ii) turbulent flame propagation in core flow, (iii) combustion instabilities, and (iv) upstream flame propagation induced by combustion induced vortex breakdown (CIVB). Flashback due to first two foregoing mechanisms is a topic of classical interest and has been studied extensively. Generally, analytical theories and experimental determinations of laminar and turbulent burning velocities model these mechanisms with sufficient precision for design usages. However, the swirling flow complicates the flashback processes in premixed combustions and the first two mechanisms inadequately describe the flashback propensity of most practical combustor designs. The presence of hydrogen in syngas significantly increases the potential for flashback. Due to high laminar burning velocity and low lean flammability limit, hydrogen tends to shift the combustor operating conditions towards flashback regime. Even a small amount of hydrogen in a fuel blend triggers the onset of flashback by altering the kinetics and thermophysical characteristics of the mixture. Additionally, the presence of hydrogen in the fuel mixture modifies the response of the flame to the global effects of stretch and preferential diffusion. Despite its immense importance in fuel flexible combustor design, {{little is known about the}} magnitude of fuel effects on CIVB induced flashback mechanism. Hence, this project investigates the effects of syngas compositions on flashback resulting from combustion induced vortex breakdown.

40|$|Since its inception, the low-swirl burner (LSB) {{has shown}} to be a useful {{laboratory}} apparatus for fundamental studies of premixed turbulent flames. The LSB operates under wide ranges of equivalence ratios, flow rates, and turbulence intensities. Its flame is lifted and detached from the burner and allows easy access for laser diagnostics. The flame brush is axisymmetric and propagates normal to the incident reactants. Therefore, the LSB is well suited for investigating detailed flame structures and empirical coefficients such as flame speed, turbulence transport, and flame generated turbulence. Due to its capability to stabilize ultra-lean premixed turbulent flames (phi approx. = 0. 55), the LSB has generated interest from the gas appliance industry for use as an economical low-NO(x) burner. Lean premixed combustion emits low levels of NO(x), due primarily to the low flame temperature. Therefore, it is a very effective NO(x) prevention method without involving selective catalytic reduction (SCR), fuel-air staging, or flue gas recirculation (FGR). En the gas turbine industry, substantial research efforts have already been undertaken and engines with lean premixed combustors are already in use. For commercial and residential applications, premixed pulsed combustors and premixed ceramic matrix burners are commercially available. These lean premixed combustion technologies, however, tend to be elaborate but have relatively limited operational flexibility, and higher capital, operating and maintenance costs. Consequently, these industries are continuing the development of lean premixed combustion technologies as well as exploring new concepts. This paper summarizes the research effects we have undertaken {{in the past few years}} to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the low-swirl flame stabilization method for a wide range of heating and power generation systems. The principle of flame stabilization by low-swirl is counter to the conventional high-swirl methods that rely on a recirculation zone to anchor the flame. In LSBS, flow recirculation is not promoted to allow the premixed turbulent flames to propagate freely. A LSB with an air-jet swirler is essentially an open tube with the swirler at its mid section. The small air-jets generate swirling motion only in the annular region and leaving the central core of the flow undisturbed, When this flow exits the <b>burner</b> <b>tube,</b> the angular momentum generates radial mean pressure gradient to diverge the non-swirling reactants stream. Consequently, the mean flow velocity decreases linearly. Propagating against this decelerating flow, the flame self-sustains at the position where the local flow velocity equals the flame speed, S(sub f). The LSB operates with a swirl number, S, between 0. 02 to 0. 1. This is much lower than the minimum S of 0. 6 required for the high-swirl burners. We found that the swirl number needed for flame stabilization varies only slightly with fuel type, flow velocity, turbulent conditions and burner dimensions (i. e. throat diameter and swirl injection angle) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper, we {{reported}} on a small grid-connected thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system consisting of an ytterbia mantle emitter and silicon solar cells with a 16 % efficiency (under solar irradiance at standard test conditions, STC). The emitter was heated using a butane burner with a rated thermal power of 1. 35 kW (referring to the lower heating value). This system produced an electrical output of 15 W, which corresponds to a thermal to electric (direct current) conversion efficiency of 1. 1 %. In the interim, further progress has been made, and significantly higher efficiencies have been achieved. The most important developments are:- (1) The infrared radiation-absorbing water filter between the emitter and silicon cells (to protect the cells against overheating) {{has been replaced by}} a suitable glass tube. By doing this, it has been possible to prevent losses of convertible radiation in the water, and to protect the cells against the flue gasses. (2) Cell cooling has been significantly improved, in order to reduce the cell temperature, and therefore increase the conversion efficiency. (3) The shape of the emitter has been changed from spherical to a quasi-cylindrical geometry, in order to obtain a more homogeneous irradiation of the cells. (4) The metallic burner-tube, on which the ytterbia emitter was fixed in the initial prototypes, {{has been replaced by a}} heat-resistant metallic rod, carrying ceramic discs as emitter holders. This has prevented the oxidation and clogging of the perforated <b>burner</b> <b>tube.</b> (5) Larger reflectors have been used to reduce losses of useful infrared radiation. (6) Smaller cells have been used, to reduce the electrical series-resistance losses. A system efficiency of 1. 5 % was attained by applying all these improvements to the basic 1. 35 kW prototype. By using preheated air for combustion (at approximately 370 ÃÂ ÃÂ°C), 1. 8 % was achieved. In a subsequent step, a photocell generator was constructed, consisting of high-efficiency silicon cells (21 % STC efficiency). In this generator, the spaces between the cells were minimized, in order to achieve as high an active cell area as possible, while simultaneously reducing radiation losses. This new system has produced an electrical output of 48 W, corresponding to a system efficiency of 2. 4 %. This is the highest-ever-reported value in a silicon-cell-based TPV system using ytterbia mantle emitters. An efficiency of 2. 8 % was achieved by using preheated air (at approximately 350 ÃÂ ÃÂ°C). An electronic control unit (fabricated of components with low power consumptions, and including a battery store) was developed, in order to make the TPV system self-powered. This unit controls the magnetic gas-supply valve between the gas-supply cylinder and burner as well as the high-voltage ignition electrodes. Both the control unit's own power consumption and the battery-charging power are supplied directly by the TPV generator. A small commercial inverter is used to transfer excess power to the 230 V grid. In future systems, the effect of preheating the combustion air will be studied in more detail. Finally, this system will be scaled up to provide self-powered domestic boilers.

40|$|The goal of {{this program}} was to {{increase}} the high-temperature strength of the H-Series of cast austenitic stainless steels by 50 % and upper use temperature by 86 to 140 F (30 to 60 C). Meeting this goal is expected to result in energy savings of 38 trillion Btu/year by 2020 and energy cost savings of $ 185 million/year. The higher strength H-Series of cast stainless steels (HK and HP type) have applications {{for the production of}} ethylene in the chemical industry, for radiant burner tubes and transfer rolls for secondary processing of steel in the steel industry, and for many applications in the heat-treating industry. The project was led by Duraloy Technologies, Inc. with research participation by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and industrial participation by a diverse group of companies. Energy Industries of Ohio (EIO) was also a partner in this project. Each team partner had well-defined roles. Duraloy Technologies led the team by identifying the base alloys that were to be improved from this research. Duraloy Technologies also provided an extensive creep data base on current alloys, provided creep-tested specimens of certain commercial alloys, and carried out centrifugal casting and component fabrication of newly designed alloys. Nucor Steel was the first partner company that installed the radiant <b>burner</b> <b>tube</b> assembly in their heat-treating furnace. Other steel companies participated in project review meetings and are currently working with Duraloy Technologies to obtain components of the new alloys. EIO is promoting the enhanced performance of the newly designed alloys to Ohio-based companies. The Timken Company is one of the Ohio companies being promoted by EIO. The project management and coordination plan is shown in Fig. 1. 1. A related project at University of Texas-Arlington (UT-A) is described in Development of Semi-Stochastic Algorithm for Optimizing Alloy Composition of High-Temperature Austenitic Stainless Steels (H-Series) for Desired Mechanical and Corrosion Properties (ORNL/TM- 2005 / 81 /R 1). The final report on another related project at the University of Tennessee by George Pharr, Easo George, and Michael Santella has been published as Development of Combinatorial Methods for Alloy Design and Optimization (ORNL/TM- 2005 - 133). The goal of the project was to increase the high-temperature strength by 50 % and upper use temperature by 86 to 140 F (30 to 60 C) of H-Series of cast austenitic stainless steels. Meeting such a goal is expected to result in energy savings of 38 trillion Btu/year by 2020 and energy cost savings of $ 185 million/year. The goal of the project was achieved by using the alloy design methods developed at ORNL, based on precise microcharacterization and identification of critical microstructure/properties relationships and combining them with the modern computational science-based tools that calculate phases, phase fractions, and phase compositions based on alloy compositions. The combined approach of microcharacterization of phases and computational phase prediction would permit rapid improvement of the current alloy composition of an alloy and provide the long-term benefit of customizing alloys within grades for specific applications. The project was appropriate for the domestic industry because the current H-Series alloys have reached their limits both in high-temperature-strength properties and in upper use temperature. The desire of Duraloy's industrial customers to improve process efficiency, while reducing cost, requires that the current alloys be taken to the next level of strength and that the upper use temperature limit be increased. This project addressed a specific topic from the subject call: to develop materials for manufacturing processes that will increase high-temperature strength, fatigue resistance, corrosion, and wear resistance. The outcome of the project would benefit manufacturing processes in the chemical, steel, and heat-treating industries...|$|E
40|$|AbstractComputerized {{tomography}} is a non-intrusive {{diagnostic technique}} {{that can be}} used to analyze flame structure. This work describes a new algebraic algorithm for tomographic reconstruction of confined laminar axisymmetric flames, considering effects of refraction and divergence of light. A flame cross section is divided in a number of concentric rings of constant refraction indexes with the light rays being refracted at ring interfaces. The algorithm is initially tested with a theoretical flame model placed at different camera distances, with several digital camera resolutions and with different thickness of the confining flame quartz tube. Then, the algorithm is applied to the reconstruction of CHâ and C 2 â emissions in co-flow diffusion flames, considering refraction throughout the flame and across the <b>burner</b> quartz <b>tube.</b> The influence of refraction and divergence of light on flame tomography reconstruction appears to be significant depending on the parameters values chosen for the theoretical and experimental setup...|$|R
40|$|In this PhD project, the {{investigation}} of the stability of a laminar diffusion flame and the interaction of the flame with acoustic waves inside an acoustically excited cylindrical tube is presented. Interesting phenomena have been observed by studying both the infrasound and sound effect on the flame structure and dynamics. When a cylindrical <b>tube</b> <b>burner</b> is acoustically excited at one end, a standing wave will be produced along the <b>tube</b> <b>burner.</b> By applying a programming controlled signal from a signal generator, the loudspeaker generates acoustic waves with different frequencies and intensities to excite the flame, which can make the flame relatively stable or unstable, even blow out. Different methods in both frequency domain and time domain have been applied to analyze the flame stability affected by acoustic waves. Both infrasound and sound are tested in this research. Infrasound is the acoustic wave with a frequency too low to be heard by human ear covering sounds beneath the lowest limits of human hearing (20 Hz) down to 0. 001 Hz. It is found that infrasound is able to take over buoyancy-driven flame flickering and make the flame flicker at the same frequency as the forcing infrasound. For some infrasound, half excited frequency has been detected clearly in the power spectrum of CH* chemiluminescence signals acquired by a photomultiplier. On the other hand, some higher frequency acoustic wave can have observable effect on flame flickering but the buoyancy-driven flickering is still the dominant oscillating mode; some other higher frequency acoustic wave can make the flame very stable, such as the acoustic wave at 140 Hz. Image processing technique has shown that the influence of acoustic waves on the laminar diffusion flame varies spatially. It is also observed that a diffusion flame may oscillate at different frequency spatially. Taking the flame without acoustic excitation as an example, the inner most area of the flame oscillates at the typical flickering frequency, but the most outer areas of the flame oscillate at the second-harmonic of the typical flickering frequency. Finally, some control strategies are developed for the laboratory <b>tube</b> <b>burner</b> based on the gained physical insights in this research.
