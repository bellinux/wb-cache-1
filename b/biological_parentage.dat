40|$|This Comment {{examines}} {{the rights of}} men who held themselves out as a child’s father or {{who did not know}} they were the biological father with a focus on the equitable parent doctrine. Because the equitable parent doctrine has not been adopted in Illinois, the author proposes new legislation. The proposed legislation establishes factors to assist a court in determining when a man should be granted rights to a child with respect to two different scenarios: first, if he held himself out as the child’s father, but ultimately found out he was not the biological father, or second, if the man did not know he was the child’s father but found out he was the <b>biological</b> father after <b>parentage</b> had already been granted to a different man. The author then applies the proposed legislation to recent court decisions that established parentage to determine whether a more equitable result could have been reached. Lastly, this Comment briefly {{examines the}} effect the proposed legislation would have on child support...|$|R
40|$|Taking {{into account}} a recent decree {{enacted by the}} Catalan {{government}} stipulating the procedure to provide information on a persons biological roots, {{this article examines the}} tension between the anonymity of the gamete donor and the childs right to know their origin. The analysis of legal systems that recognise this right for children conceived through donated gametes spurs us to further examine the hypotheses, quite widespread today, which consider traditional arguments for secrecy outdated. In this regard, the article also challenges the different treatment granted to adopted children and donor gamete children by legal systems such as Spains. Beyond the possible conflicting rights of children, donors and parents, arguments provided by anonymity supporters, such as the moral damage resulting from disclosure or the possible link between disclosure and a {{decrease in the number of}} donors, should be also taken into account. However, these arguments require absolute empirical evidence, which is not currently conclusive. Alternatively, disclosure of the donors identity is consistent with the needs of donor families and with a major trend in family law supporting the right to know ones genetic origin, dissociated from <b>biological</b> and legal <b>parentage...</b>|$|R

50|$|Other main {{characters}} include Hank's friends and their families. Dale Gribble (voiced by Johnny Hardwick) is the Hills' chain-smoking and paranoid next-door neighbor and Hank's best friend. He owns his own pest control business, Dale's Dead Bug, {{and he is}} also a licensed bounty hunter and president of the Arlen Gun Club. Dale is married to Nancy Hicks-Gribble (voiced by Ashley Gardner), a weather girl—and later anchor woman—for the Channel 84 news. The only Gribble child, Joseph (voiced by Brittany Murphy; later Breckin Meyer) is the result of Nancy's 15-year-long affair with John Redcorn (voiced by Victor Aaron; later Jonathan Joss), a Native American healer. Dale never realizes that Redcorn is having an affair with his wife, nor does he ever question Joseph's obvious Native American features; rather, Dale considers Redcorn to be one of his best friends. Despite his <b>biological</b> <b>parentage,</b> Joseph is more influenced in temperament by Dale's personality. Joseph is Bobby's best friend, and the two often get into trouble as the result of their combined enthusiasm and naivety.|$|E
5000|$|Islamic law scholar Faisal Kutty {{argues that}} this report {{and a number}} of other {{developments}} in the area provide for some optimism that we may be at the cusp of a sea change in this area. Kutty argues that the belief that closed adoption, as practiced in the West, is the only acceptable form of permanent childcare is a significant obstacle to its acceptance among many Muslims. The situation is significantly different when we move to open adoptions, where there is not negation of the <b>biological</b> <b>parentage.</b> Kutty believes that there is sufficient basis in Islamic jurisprudence to argue for qualified support of adoptions and even international adoptions. He writes that it is undeniable that taking care of orphans and foundlings is a religious obligation and that the best interest of children has been a recurrent theme among the various juristic schools. Arguably one of the best ways to take care of these children is to place them in loving homes, provided that a child’s lineage is not intentionally negated or concealed. He argues that a reformed model [...] of Islamic adoptions will enable Muslims to fulfill this religious obligation while ensuring that the most vulnerable do not fall through technical cracks and will not be negatively impacted by formal rules that no longer serve their intended purposes.|$|E
40|$|Four studies {{investigated}} children's {{explanations for}} family resemblance and species-typical characteristics, under different conditions of <b>biological</b> <b>parentage</b> and rearing environment. Participating were 226 children between 3 and 11 years. Children Children {{were presented with}} a number of different tasks, some involving people and some domestic animals. Each task involved interviews in which children predicted what kinds, of physical and behavioral characteristics offspring would be most likely to demonstrate under normal <b>biological</b> <b>parentage</b> and rearing, adoptive rearing, inter-uterine transplant parentage and rearing with own species, or inter-uterine transplant parentage and rearing with transplant species. In all studies, particularly those involving non-human animals, there was a strong tendency for children of all ages to draw on essentialist explanations for their predictions. Among the youngest children (3 - 4 year olds), psychological intentional explanations were common. It was not until 6 to 7 years that explanations clearly began to refer to physical processes and putative biological mechanisms. The period between 4 and 6 years appeared to be a transitional phase where performance and explanations were more variable and seemed to be highly task-dependent. Biological-based, although often inaccurate, explanations for inheritance increased dramatically around 10 to 11 years. (Contains 11 references.)

Here we examine 233 published articles in which authors reported the suspected presence of one or more microsatellite null alleles, and we review how these purported nulls were detected and handled in the data analyses. We also employ computer simulations and analytical treatments to determine how microsatellite null alleles might impact molecular parentage analyses. The results indicate that whereas null alleles in frequencies typically reported in the literature introduce rather incon-sequential biases on average exclusion probabilities, they can introduce substantial errors into empirical assessments of specific mating events by leading to high frequencies of false parentage exclusions...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the {{lipoprotein}} lipase (LPL) gene {{are the most}} important cause of familial chylomicronemia with over 70 mutations being recorded to date. Thus far de novo mutations have not been described. Here we report on the molecular analysis of the family of a patient previously reported to be LPL deficient on the basis of compound heterozygosity for the Arg 243 His and Ile 225 Thr mutations, the latter being the first and only mutation identified in the loop region of LPL. Both parents of the propositus were screened for the presence of these two mutations to confirm their status as obligate heterozygotes and to determine the mutation allocation. Although paternal inheritance of the Arg 243 His allele could be established, maternal DNA did not show carrier status for the Ile 225 Thr substitution. An examination of maternity, using LPL restriction fragment length polymorphisms four polymorphic CA repeats and ApoE genotypes, was consistent with correct <b>biological</b> <b>parentage</b> for the propositus. Therefore, we conclude that the Ile 225 Thr mutation constitutes a de novo event, the first to be reported in the LPL gen...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSequencing of the mtDNA {{control region}} (385 or 695 bp) of 212  Lipizzans from eight studs {{revealed}} 37 haplotypes. Distribution of haplotypes among studs was biased, including many private haplotypes {{but only one}} haplotype was present in all the studs. According to historical data, numerous Lipizzan maternal lines originating from founder mares of different breeds have been established during the breed's history, so the broad genetic base of the Lipizzan maternal lines was expected. A comparison of Lipizzan sequences with 136 sequences of domestic- and wild-horses from GenBank showed a clustering of Lipizzan haplotypes {{in the majority of}} haplotype subgroups present in other domestic horses. We assume that haplotypes identical to haplotypes of early domesticated horses can be found in several Lipizzan maternal lines as well as in other breeds. Therefore, domestic horses could arise either from a single large population or from several populations provided there were strong migrations during the early phase after domestication. A comparison of Lipizzan haplotypes with 56 maternal lines (according to the pedigrees) showed a disagreement of <b>biological</b> <b>parentage</b> with pedigree data for at least 11 % of the Lipizzans. A distribution of haplotype-frequencies was unequal (0. 2 %- 26 %), mainly due to pedigree errors and haplotype sharing among founder mares...|$|E
40|$|There are {{few other}} areas in family law where incongruence between {{the legal and}} social {{positions}} is as evident as that concerning parenthood. Recent cases involving lesbian couples and known sperm donors serve to highlight the increasing tension between the respective roles of biology, intention and functional parenting in the attribution of legal parental status. As both legislative and case-law developments have shown, intention is central in some circumstances, but not in others. The main claim {{of this paper is}} that this ad hoc approach leads to incoherent and unsatisfactory law: instead of striving to identify a status, what we are really looking to do is to identify the people who assume responsibility for a child. Drawing upon recent case-law, this paper explores how a conceptual reform of the law could result in a principled framework which would place formally recognised intention at the heart of parental status in order to reconnect legal duty with social reality for as many children and parents as possible. Moreover, it would ensure that parental status would not be dictated by the mode of conception of the child (natural or assisted). The analysis identifies the objectives of reform before proposing a new model which, while recognising the social importance of the <b>biological</b> <b>parentage</b> link, would reserve legal status for functional parenthood. ...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis: Bastard Territory is a confessional human {{drama about}} a man – and a city – carving out an identity. Mixing wry humour, raw insight, a dash of Tennessee Williams and a killer 60 s and 70 s soundtrack, it’s a {{powerful}} and affecting yarn. Russell thought he’d made peace with his past, but the skeletons won’t stay in the closet – even if {{he came out of}} it long ago. It’s Darwin in 2001, and Russell and his boyfriend run The Tectonic Plate – a hip café, art gallery, and queer cabaret dive. Its walls are about to be shaken by some earth-shattering truths. PNG-born Russell came to the Territory with his adoptive white parents, but his boho mum shot through when he was eight.

40|$|Studies of a Japanese population, {{involving}} {{a total of}} 539, 170 locus tests distributed over 36 polypeptides, yielded three presumptive spontaneous mutations altering the electrophoretic mobility of the polypeptide. This corresponds to a mutation rate of 0. 6 X 10 (- 5) per locus per generation. The a priori probability that undetected discrepancies between legal and <b>biological</b> <b>parentage</b> might in our test system result in an apparent electrophoretic mutation in this population is calculated to be only 0. 3 X 10 (- 7) per locus per generation. Since electrophoresis only detects {{about half of the}} amino acid substitutions due to mutations of nucleotides, the corrected rate for mutations causing amino acid substitutions in polypeptides is 1. 2 X 10 (- 5) per locus per generation. With allowance for synonymous mutations and those resulting in stop codons, the total mutation rate for nucleotide changes in the exons encoding a polypeptide becomes approximately equal to 1. 8 X 10 (- 5) per locus per generation. When the present observations are combined with all of the other available data concerning mutation resulting in electrophoretic variants, the electrophoretic rate drops to 0. 3 X 10 (- 5) per locus per generation, the total locus rate drops to roughly 1. 0 X 10 (- 5), and the nucleotide rate drops to 1 X 10 (- 8). Even with this lower estimate, given approximately equal to 2 X 10 (9) nucleotides in the haploid genome and an average of 10 (3) exon nucleotides per polypeptide encoded, the implication, if these exon rates can be generalized, is of approximately equal to 20 nucleotide mutations per gamete per generation. This estimate of the frequency of "point" mutations does not include small duplications, rearrangements, or deletions resulting from unequal crossing-over, transcription errors, etc...|$|E
40|$|Humans have {{organs and}} limbs {{similar to those}} of other animals; we bear our young like other mammals; bone by bone, there is a precise {{correspondence}} between the skeletons of a chimpanzee and a human. But it does not take much reflection to notice the distinct uniqueness of our species. There is the bipedal gait and the enlarged brain. Much more conspicuous than the anatomical differences are the distinct behaviors and their outcomes. Humans have elaborate social and political institutions, codes of law, literature and art, ethics and religion; humans build roads and cities, travel by motorcars, ships and airplanes, and communicate by means of telephones, computers and televisions. I, first, outline what we currently know about the evolutionary history of humans for the last several million years, and identify anatomical traits that distinguish us from other animals. Next, I point out our two kinds of heredity, the biological and the cultural. Biological heredity is based on the transmission of genetic information, in humans very much the same as in other sexually reproducing organisms. But cultural inheritance is distinctively human, based on transmission of information by a teaching and learning process, which is, in principle, independent of <b>biological</b> <b>parentage.</b> The advent of cultural heredity ushered in cultural evolution, which transcends biological evolution. I, finally, explore ethical behavior as a model case of a distinctive human trait, and seek to ascertain the causal connections between biology and human ethics. My conclusions are that (1) moral reasoning, i. e., the proclivity to make ethical judgments by evaluating actions as either good or evil, is rooted in our biological nature; it is a necessary outcome of our exalted intelligence; but (2) the moral codes which guide our decisions as to which actions are good and which ones are evil, are products of culture, including social and religious traditions. This second conclusion contradicts those evolutionists and sociobiologists who claim that the morally good is simply that which is promoted by the process of biological evolution...|$|E
40|$|If {{over the}} last couple of decades, {{advances}} in reproductive medicine have helped many couples who are unable to conceive naturally, the initial aim was generally to favour conception using the couple's own gametes. However, the successive developments of artificial insemination and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) have provided us with alternative ways to conceive which no longer rely upon <b>biological</b> <b>parentage.</b> Today, a couple can conceive a child with gametes from a third party and can even adopt an embryo conceived by another couple. In such cases, it is necessary to reconcile the interests of all concerned (the infertile couple, the gamete or embryo donors and the child). Certain countries have adopted laws which impose donor anonymity which deny the child of any information on the donor, in the belief that this best assures the child's welfare. However, such a social choice is questioned by the increasing demand by children born through artificial insemination by donor, to remove anonymity. Such claims have been supported in certain countries who have adopted a principle of genetic transparency. This book is the fruit of rich debate and reflection between lawyers, doctors, psychoanalysts and sociologists during the first Workshop of the International Academic Network on Bioethics (IANB). Through a comparative approach, the chapters examine how the question of anonymity in sixteen different countries is dealt with - anonymity which may be absolute, relative or even non-existent. Despite diversity between legal systems, one thing is sure: the question of abolishing anonymity is one of immediate importance. The answer either unites or divides. But could it be any other way on a subject which goes to the heart of our social perceptions on individual identity, parentage and parenthood ? Created in 2007, the IANB's objective is to promote research through collaboration between academic representatives from different countries and cultures, all specialists in the field of biomedicine. Based upon a comparative approach of different legal systems, the work of the group analyses social choices in biomedicine through the different lenses of ethics, anthropology, philosophy and sociology. In this way, their research feeds into the elaboration and development of international regulation of biomedical practices and incidentally on achieving the balance between the respect for different cultures and the move towards a certain universality, supporting the harmonisation of laws. This new collection will therefore be indispensable for anyone seeking to understand the social implications of bioethics...|$|E
40|$|Parenthood, {{from a legal}} perspective, {{has always}} been {{perceived}} as a rather unambiguous concept in Swedish legislation. It is the biological parent {{of a child who}} should be given legal status as parent and thereby also all the rights and duties of a parent. In {{the first part of the}} thesis examines some of the reasons for studying the legislation concerning parenthood. The laws regulating the relationship between parent and child originate from laws enacted at the beginning of the twentieth century. One hundred years later, changing family patterns and the development of different techniques for assisted reproduction are only a few of the factors that puts legislation concerning parenthood in a new light. Of even greater importance is a changing view of the child and the ambition to always put the interests of the child first. It is submitted that the regulation concerning the attainment of legal status as parent must be re-examined, like any other legislation concerning children, in view of the best interest of the child. The second part of the thesis examines the grounds for legal status as parent according to applicable Swedish laws. Particular attention is given to the question of the extent to which biological kinship can be replaced as the basis for legal status and the reasons behind this. The third part of the thesis analyses the legal construction of parenthood. The various interests of parent and child that are met by the present legislation are clarified, in particular the interests of the child in this context. It is concluded that the child has several interests that should be satisfied when establishing legal status. A question discussed in this part of the thesis is whether it is possible to satisfy the child's various interest in this context, independently of one another and without having to change the child's legal family status. The fourth and final part of the thesis discusses legal parenthood and how the legislation could be formed in order to protect the interests of the child in a more effective manner than today. It is argued that the legal regulation of parenthood needs to be more flexible, allowing for the various interests that the child has in connection with parenthood to be met independently of one another. This means that there might be a need to let go of <b>biological</b> <b>parentage</b> as the model for legislation on parenthood. A child perhaps needs not two but several parents during childhood...|$|E
