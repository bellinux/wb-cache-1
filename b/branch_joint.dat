40|$|A miter joint connects two beams, {{typically}} of {{the same}} cross section, at an angle such that the longitudinal beam edges continue across the joint. When more than two beams meet in one point, like in a tree, we call this a <b>branching</b> <b>joint.</b> In a <b>branching</b> miter <b>joint,</b> the beams’ longitudinal edges match up properly. We survey some principles of <b>branching</b> miter <b>joints.</b> In particular, we treat joints where three beams with identical cross sections meet. These ternary miter joints {{can be used to}} construct various branching structures. We present two works of art that involve <b>branching</b> miter <b>joints...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{bio-inspired}} design strategy {{based on}} tree <b>branch</b> <b>joints</b> {{to improve the}} damage tolerance of co-cured composite T-joints. The design of tree <b>branch</b> <b>joints</b> at different length scales from the microstructural to the macro-length scale was investigated. X-ray computed tomography of a pine tree revealed three main features of tree <b>branch</b> <b>joints</b> which provide high structural ef?ciency and damage tolerance: integrated design with the branch embedded into {{the centre of the}} trunk; three-dimensional ?bril lay-up in the principal stress directions; and variable ?bril density to achieve iso-strain conditions through the joint connection. Research presented in this paper adapts the embedded structural feature of tree joints into a carbon/epoxy T-joint. The ?ange plies were embedded to 25 %, 50 % and 75 % of the depth of the skin of the composite T-joint to mimic the design of tree <b>branch</b> <b>joints.</b> Experimental testing revealed that the bio-inspired T-joint design with integrated adherends had increased normalised inelastic strain energy (de?ned as ductility), increased normalised absorbed strain energy to failure, and higher load-carrying capacity following damage initiation (damage tolerance) compared to a conventionally bonded T-joint. However, these improvements were achieved at the expense of earlier onset of damage initiation in the T-joints...|$|R

40|$|Petrographic {{studies of}} {{samples of the}} Rajmahal basalt reveal a variety of {{microscopic}} joints within phenocrysts, which seem to have developed {{under the influence of}} thermal stresses during cooling. The theoretical analysis shows that: thermal stresses develop in a system only under unsteady state of cooling, the stresses responsible for the development of joints are tensile in nature, and the magnitude of stresses increases with increasing rates of cooling. In order to understand the eects of cooling rate on the mode of jointing, analogue model exper-iments were performed by quenching melt lms of organic, crystalline materials under varying cooling conditions. In experiments, non-branching linear joints developed at relatively lower rates of cooling by a process of sub-critical crack propagation. On the other hand, at higher rates of cool-ing the mechanism of crack propagation was essentially supercritical leading to the development of <b>branching</b> <b>joints.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{biological}} {{principle of}} hierarchical (multi-scale level) design was {{used at the}} structural and laminate levels to design a novel carbon/epoxy T-joint with improved structural properties for potential use in light-weight aircraft structures. The bio-inspired structural modification mimics tree branch-trunk joints by embedding the stiffener flange into skin plies. This design concept results in increased fracture toughness due to crack branching and deflection. Simultaneously, bio-inspired ply angle optimisation was used to mimic the tailored arrangement of cellulose micro-fibrils observed in the wood cells contained within tree <b>branch</b> <b>joints.</b> The optimisation procedure minimises the interlaminar stress concentration in the T-joint radius bend and increases strength while maintaining similar global laminate stiffness properties. The hierarchical joint resulted in a significantly improved tensile strength compared to a conventionally designed T-joint. The new design additionally exhibited higher absorbed strain energy to failure load for bending and tension loading. Additionally, the hierarchical T-joint had a significantly reduced critical joint cross-sectional area (weight) due to the embedded design...|$|R
