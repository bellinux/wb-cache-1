50|$|There are {{two basic}} methods to produce {{animation}} directly on film. One starts with <b>blank</b> <b>film</b> stock, the other one with black (already developed) film. On <b>blank</b> <b>film</b> the artist can draw, paint, stamp, or even glue or tape objects. Black film (or any footage) can be scratched, etched, sanded, or punched. Any tool the artist finds useful {{may be used for}} this, and all techniques can be combined endlessly. The frame borders may be observed or completely ignored, found footage may be included, any existing image might be distorted by mechanical or chemical means. A third method takes place in a darkroom, using unexposed film that is exposed frame by frame. The artists places objects onto the fresh stock and then uses a small light beam to create the images. This third category of work has to be sent to a lab and processed, just like films created with a camera.|$|E

50|$|Technicolor re-emerged as a {{three-color process}} for {{cartoons}} in 1932 and live action in 1934. Using a different arrangement of a beam-splitter cube and color filters behind the lens, the camera simultaneously exposed three individual strips of black-and-white film, each one recording {{one-third of the}} spectrum, which allowed virtually the entire spectrum of colors to be reproduced. A printing matrix with a hardened gelatin relief image was made from each negative, and the three matrices transferred color dyes into a <b>blank</b> <b>film</b> to create the print.|$|E
5000|$|He {{took over}} the film {{industry}} {{at a time when}} it was going through major technological changes, and rapid expansion. The number of cinemas in the USSR almost quadrupled under his supervision, to around 30,000, and silent movies were supplanted by 'talkies'. The first soviet film with a full sound track was released in October 1931. He was also expected to end import of foreign equipment, and <b>blank</b> <b>film</b> when soviet afctories were not well equipped to supply demand, and he had to contend with tightening censorship and Stalin's personal obsession with cinema, which mad eit expedient to show new films to Stalin before they went on release, and in many cases to submit scripts to Stalin before shooting began. After visiting Hollywood, he also conceived the idea of creating a similar centre for the film industry at a spot near Odessa, where the climate and geography were similar to those of Hollywood and thus more amenable to year-round film-making. This vision extended to the building of an entire film community, to be called Kinograd—a highly expensive proposition. The output of soviet films certainly deteriorated in quantity under his supervision: only 35 new films were completed in 1933, compared with 148 in 1928; in 1935, of a planned 130 feature films, only 45 were completed; in 1936, only 46 of 165; in 1937—his final year—only 24 of 62.This may have been because he was operating under impossible conditions. Alexander Barmine, who worked with Shumyatsky in Tehran, found him [...] "gifted with astounding energy, capable of working all day and all night, eager and uncompromising... the stuff of which leaders are made" [...] and believed that his job as head of the film industry was made impossible by the political demands made on him. By contrast, Jay Leyda, an American student who worked with Sergei Eisenstein, claimed that on the day Shumyatsky was eventually sacked [...] "all of Moscow's film makers gave parties" [...] to celebrate.|$|E
40|$|Stearate anions were {{successfully}} intercalated into the layered double hydroxide Mg 4 Al 2 (OH) 12 CO 3. 3 H 2 O (LDH-CO 3) by several methods to form LDH-SA. The intercalation method which involved the acid-base reaction between emulsified stearic acid (SA) and the carbonate anions in aqueous media was studied {{for the first}} time. This method {{led to the formation}} of more LDH-SA than well known methods such as melting the carboxylic acid in the presence of the LDH, allowing the interlayer region to swell in the presence of glycerol and reconstructing the calcined LDH in the presence of aqueous sodium stearate. Other literature methods involve ion-exchange of Cl- in LDH-Cl with stearate in aqueous sodium stearate, usually under N 2 atmosphere. The methods developed in this study are more industrially viable because the more easily produced LDH-CO 3 is used and no N 2 atmosphere is necessary. The LDH-SA was successfully used to intercalate sodium polyvinyl sulphonate by an ion exchange with the intercalated stearate, without the need for a N 2 atmosphere. This method of production could be useful for the production of nanocomposites in general, for example anionic polymer chains (such as DNA) and anionic clays. The same intercalation reaction was allowed to take place in situ during the formation of dextrin-alginate-glycerol film solutions in water-ethanol media. The stearate intercalated as a bilayer in the interlayer region of the LDH. The SA to LDH ratio was varied from 100 % SA to 100 % LDH. Around the middle of the series a minimum water vapour permeability (WVP) was obtained, which corresponded to an 80 % reduction in WVP in comparison to the reference (<b>blank)</b> <b>film.</b> Around the middle of the series a maximum increase in Young’s modulus, corresponding to a 213 % increase in comparison to the <b>blank</b> <b>film,</b> was obtained.
