5|$|The {{accounting}} basis {{applied to}} fiduciary funds {{depends upon the}} needs of a specific fund. If the trust involves a business-like operation, accrual basis accounting would <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> show the fund's profitability. Accrual basis is also appropriate for trust funds using interest and dividends from invested principle amounts to pay for supported programs, because the profitability of those investments would be important.|$|E
5|$|New South Wales and Victoria {{had signed}} an {{agreement}} towards constructing bridges for railways over the Murray to serve the settlements on the northern side. In 1923, a report was released that recommended going ahead with the building of four bridges, one of those being the future Abbotsford Bridge. It was said a bridge in this area would benefit Curlwaa, Wentworth, and a proposed irrigation scheme to the north. The cost was estimated at £78,000. It had been considered that it might <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> combine these four bridges with locks, but this idea was rejected due to siting concerns.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{numbers of}} {{children}} show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, {{they appear to be}} on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.|$|E

5|$|Clan chiefs may {{wear their}} crest simpliciter, that is without being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers. It is more common, however, for a clan chiefs to wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's crest badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge, though {{this is a matter of}} personal preference.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E

5|$|Sometime {{after the}} December 1920 hearing {{requested}} by the ANA, {{the chairman of the}} U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore, became aware of the proposed congressional action, and decided to investigate. Moore, together with Commission member and Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, met with Mint Director Baker on May 26, 1921, and they agreed that it would <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> hold a design competition for the proposed dollar, {{under the auspices of the}} Commission. This was formalized on July 26 with the Commission's written recommendation to the Mint that a competition, open only to invited sculptors, be used to select designs. The winner of the competition was to receive $1,500 prize money, while all other participants would be given $100. On July 28, President Harding issued Executive Order 3524, requiring that coin designs be submitted to the Commission before approval by the Treasury Secretary. In early September, following the failure of the bill, Baker contacted Moore, putting the matter aside pending congressional action.|$|E

25|$|If the {{blocking}} or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the {{shear forces}} {{applied to the}} building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> add additional nails between the sill plate of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although this will require exposing the sill plate by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As the sill plate may be quite old and dry and substantial nails must be used, {{it may be necessary}} to pre-drill a hole for the nail in the old wood to avoid splitting. When the wall is opened for this purpose it may also <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> tie vertical wall elements into the foundation using specialty connectors and bolts glued with epoxy cement into holes drilled in the foundation.|$|E

25|$|Newton's method {{requires}} that the derivative be calculated directly. An analytical expression for the derivative may not be easily obtainable and could be expensive to evaluate. In these situations, it may <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> approximate the derivative by using the slope of a line through two nearby points on the function. Using this approximation would result in something like the secant method whose convergence is slower than that of Newton's method.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{remedies}} were suggested {{to be available}} in R v Taylor (1996) 14 CRNZ 426.

Machine-printed illustrated envelopes are a mainstay of the direct mail industry.|$|E

25|$|In menopausal women, sexual {{functioning}} can impact several {{dimensions of}} a woman’s life, including her physical, psychological, and mental well-being. During {{the onset of}} menopause, sexuality can be a critical issue in determining whether one begins to experience changes in their sexual response cycle. Both age— and menopause-related events can affect the integrity of a woman’s biological systems involved in the sexual response cycle, which include hormone environment, neuro-muscular substrates, and vascular supplies. Therefore, it can <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> make use of HRT, especially in women with low or declining quality of life due to sexual difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Both free-flow {{and demand}} {{regulators}} use mechanical feedback of the downstream pressure {{to control the}} opening of a valve which controls gas flow from the upstream, high-pressure side, to the downstream, low-pressure side of each stage.

Open circuit scuba regulators must also deliver against a variable ambient pressure. They must be robust and reliable, as they are life-support equipment which must function in a relatively hostile environment (sea water).|$|E
