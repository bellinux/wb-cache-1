5000|$|Double bevel or {{compound}} bevel — A <b>back</b> <b>bevel,</b> {{similar to}} a sabre or flat grind, is put on the blade behind the edge bevel (the bevel which is the foremost cutting surface). This <b>back</b> <b>bevel</b> keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than a single bevel, sharpness is sacrificed for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than a single bevel blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The shape of the bevel is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades. In practice, double bevels are common {{in a variety of}} edge angles and <b>back</b> <b>bevel</b> angles, and Western kitchen knives generally have a double bevel, with an edge angle of 14-16° (included angle of 28-32°) and a maximum of 40° as specified by International standard ISO 8442.1 (knives for the preparation of food).|$|E
50|$|The blade {{is assumed}} to be well shaped, with a clean {{accurate}} <b>bevel.</b> The <b>back</b> of the chisel is also flattened and cleaned up using the same grades of sandpaper to ensure a clean sharp edge where the <b>back</b> and <b>bevel</b> meet. Nicks, deep scratches, or excessive wear may call for shaping the profile on a grinder before beginning this method.|$|R

6000|$|... § I. We have {{hitherto}} {{considered the}} aperture as merely pierced in {{the thickness of}} the walls; and when its masonry is simple and the fillings of the aperture are unimportant, it may well remain so. But when the fillings are delicate and of value, {{as in the case of}} colored glass, finely wrought tracery, or sculpture, such as we shall often find occupying the tympanum of doorways, some protection becomes necessary against the run of the rain down the walls, and <b>back</b> by the <b>bevel</b> of the aperture to the joints or surface of the fillings.|$|R
50|$|The {{layout of}} the H-drive {{drivetrain}} contributed greatly to its low silhouette, agility and - an important consideration in any vehicle used in the reconnaissance role, an exceptionally quiet engine and running gear. Power was led forward to a centrally-located transfer box and single differential driving separate left and right hand shafts, each in turn running forwards and <b>back</b> to a <b>bevel</b> box powering each wheels. This extremely space-efficient layout resulted in a low-slung vehicle with a flat plate that allowed the Dingo to slide across uneven ground, but this feature made the Dingo extremely vulnerable to mines.|$|R
