40|$|Previous oil {{containment}} booms have an {{open top}} that allows natural gas to escape, and have significant oil leakage due to wave action. Also, a subsea pyramid oil trap exists, but cannot move relative to moving oil plumes from deepsea oil leaks. The solution is to have large, moveable oil traps. One version floats on the sea surface and has a flexible tarp cover and a lower weighted skirt to completely entrap the floating oil and natural gas. The device must have at least three sides with boats pulling at each apex, and sonar or other system to track the slowly moving oil plume, so that the boats can properly locate the booms. The oil trap device must also have a means for removal of the oil and the natural gas. A second design version has a flexible pyramid cover that is attached by <b>lines</b> to <b>ballast</b> on the ocean floor. This is similar to fixed, metal pyramid oil capture devices in the Santa Barbara Channel {{off the coast of}} California. The <b>ballast</b> <b>lines</b> for the improved design, however, would have winches that can move the pyramid to always be located above the oil and gas plume. A third design is a combination of the first two. It uses a submerged pyramid to trap oil, but has no anchor and uses boats to locate the trap. It has ballast weights located along the bottom of the tarp and/or at the corners of the trap. The improved floating oil-spill containment device has a large floating boom and weighted skirt surrounding the oil and gas entrapment area. The device is triangular (or more than three sides) and has a flexible tarp cover with a raised gas vent area. Boats pull on the apex of the triangles to maintain tension and to allow the device to move to optimum locations to trap oil and gas. The gas is retrieved from a higher buoyant part of the tarp, and oil is retrieved from the floating oil layer contained in the device. These devices can be operated in relatively severe weather, since waves will break over the devices without causing oil leaking. Also, natural gas is entrapped and can be retrieved. All designs can use sonar to locate the moving oil plume, and then be relocated by using boats or winches to move the oil trapping devices. These devices can be constructed of treated, non-permeable DuPont Kevlar cloth (or similar material) ...|$|R

He was present in Paris when the Versailles train crash occurred in 1842, and produced a statement concerning the facts for General Charles Pasley of the Railway Inspectorate. He also experienced a catastrophic failure of one of his viaducts built on the new Paris-Le Havre link[...] The viaduct was of stone and brick at Barentin near Rouen, and was the longest and highest on the line. It was 108 feet high, and consisted of 27 arches, each 50 feet wide, with a total length of over 1600 feet. A boy hauling <b>ballast</b> for the <b>line</b> up an adjoining hillside early that morning (about 6.00 am) saw one arch (the fifth on the Rouen side) collapse, and the rest followed suit.

40|$|Swedish {{transport}} administration initiated this Master Thesis {{project and}} {{the aim was to}} compare regulations for the design of high-speed railways from three European countries: France, Germany and Spain. The reason why this is of interest for the Swedish transport administration is the design of the first Swedish high-speed railway, called Ostlänken. Therefore, a literature study of the regulations and other literature regarding high-speed railway has been carried out. A basic description of railway components, slab track and ballasted tracks is presented. Ballasted embankments usually consist of a trackbed layer (ballast onto subballast), and the ultimate thickness of this layer is discussed, as {{there are a number of}} methods available to calculate the appropriate thickness, with a number of different design parameters. These design methods results in different trackbed thickness and choosing the “wrong” method might lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the trackbed layer. Constructing a ballastless railway line means that the ballast is replaced by another material, usually a slab made of reinforced concrete or asphalt, and the rail is cast onto this slab. Countries design their slab using different methods. Germany has constructed high-speed railway lines with a slab track solution, generally slabs with low flexible stiffness. France has until recently constructed their high-speed <b>line</b> <b>ballasted</b> but is now developing a new slab track technique, called NBT (New Ballastless Track) and Spain uses various methods. It is difficult to compare the regulations, however, there are some factors that at least begin to explain the differences between the countries: the frost hazard, the inherent ground quality, purpose with the railway (mixed traffic, solely passenger traffic, etc.), design parameters (life, axle load, etc.). Furthermore, the settlement requirements, soil classification and bearing capacity are factors that varies from country to country, but the origin for this variation is harder to detect...|$|R

On 3 April 1908, they issued a decree [...] "On the Commencement of the Construction of the Amur Railway by the Order of and at the Expense of the State". The construction itself took place in scarcely populated permafrost areas under harsh climatic conditions. Construction sites were divided into the western, middle, and eastern sections. In 1907-1913, they built the western section of the railway from Kuenga to Uryum. First, the engineers had to connect the Shilka and the Amur with the railroad under construction {{in order to be able}} to deliver material and workforce. They had to build a temporary road in the swampy middle section of the future Amur Railway for the purpose of delivering the <b>ballast</b> for the <b>line.</b> Often, the whole finished parts of the road would disappear into the swamps. In 1912, a talented engineer Alexander Liverovsky was put in charge of the construction of the eastern section of the Amur Railway. For the first time in railroad construction, earth-moving works were mechanised. The workers used ten excavators and several machines for mortar mixing and rock grinding. Also, they built a number of repair shops and sawmills, therefore there was no need to transport railroad ties and squared timber to construction sites. In 1914, the western and eastern sections of the Amur Railway came together at the Obluchye railway station, making it possible for trains to go through.|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} computation {{of forces}} and corresponding deformation of cages subjected to waves and current loading {{is critical to}} the design of mooring systems for fish farms. In the present work, a complete methodology describing the numerical modeling of net structures and its corresponding interaction with mooring lines and floating platforms has been developed. The effect of every element on the cage over the global response and the effective numerical representation of these components of a cage system are studied. The numerical model of cages is built and calculated using the commercial software OrcaFlex v 9. 6 a. In this software, an equivalent net model is created using an array of cylinders connected by buoys. This model has the same wet mass, axial stiffness and projected area as the prototype net, allowing for the accurate calculation of forces and deformations over the cage due to wave and current loading. A variable drag coefficient formulation is implemented in the software, based on the relative normal velocity between line elements and fluid. This drag coefficient is fed into the modified version of the Morison equation, which accounts for relative motion, to obtain the drag force on the netting using the cross flow principle. In addition, shielding effect is included in the calculations by using riser interaction models. Furthermore, blockage due to large deformations of flexible cages is also accounted for by the derivation of a semi empirical formulation for drag coefficient on Raschel nets. Careful validation of the present methodology is conducted by comparing numerical results with experimental published data. Validation is presented for a single cage, which includes a surface flexible collar, netting, <b>ballast</b> and mooring <b>lines.</b> Applied loads include current, regular waves and a combination of regular waves and current to evaluate interaction effects. The influence of wave kinematics stretching models on mooring line tension results is also analyzed. Additionally, calculations considering irregular waves and following current are performed for the completeness of the study. Further analyses consider the coupled response of a mooring/platform/cage system. The system intends to describe the interaction of a single cage and a feeder vessel installed in deep water. Effects of the location of the cage in the water column and the net selection on the dynamics of the platform are studied. The results are qualitatively compared against field measurements in a similar installation 6 miles offshore of Kona Hawaii. This study can directly be applied to the calculation of the coupled response of multiple technologies such as floating offshore wind turbines, wave energy conversion and offshore fish farming...|$|R
