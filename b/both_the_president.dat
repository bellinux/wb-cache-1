5|$|Following {{constitutional}} {{reforms in}} 1991, {{the office of}} President was transformed from an appointed to an elected post. Thus, <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and MPs are elected to their posts by the citizens of Singapore in separate elections.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mayor}} dies in office, resigns, or {{is unable to}} carry out his/her duties and he/she did not {{designate}} an acting mayor, {{the president of the}} Board of Supervisors becomes acting mayor until the full Board select a person to fill the vacancy and finish the previous mayoral term. (In the case that <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of the Board of Supervisors and the mayor are incapacitated, the order of succession is followed.) This has happened six times: James Otis died in office and was succeeded by George Hewston, Eugene Schmitz was removed and succeeded by Charles Boxton, Charles Boxton resigned and was succeeded by Edward Robeson Taylor, James Rolph resigned and was succeeded by Angelo Rossi, George Moscone was assassinated and was succeeded by Dianne Feinstein, and Gavin Newsom resigned and was succeeded by Ed Lee.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{in early}} 1993, when the teams in Arusha signed a full power sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF {{and other major}} opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until {{free and fair elections}} could be held. The agreement was reasonably equitable given the balance of power at the time and Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition and the RPF all accepted it; however, the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger scale killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole northwest of Rwanda and lasted for six days, with numerous houses burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed. Paul Kagame, reacting to stories brought to him first hand by survivors seeking refuge in rebel territory, announced that he was pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six month cease-fire.|$|E

25|$|By law, <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the Commission of Fine Arts had {{to approve}} the {{location}} and design of the memorial. Both approvals were given, {{and work on the}} foundation for the fountain began on June 18, 1913. Just over $3,000 was spent constructing the memorial fountain. Hastings and French donated their services.|$|E
25|$|Resentment also rose {{within the}} Greek Cypriot {{community}} because Turkish Cypriots {{had been given}} a larger share of governmental posts than the size of their population warranted. In accordance with the constitution 30% of civil service jobs were allocated to the Turkish community despite being only 18.3% of the population. Additionally, the position of vice president was reserved for the Turkish population, and <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and vice president were given veto power over crucial issues.|$|E
50|$|In November 2008, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of <b>the</b> club Lavdim Lusha {{and two of}} his {{brothers}} from the small town of Luz i Vogël made clear their ambitions of investing up to 400,000 euros into the club's stadium.

25|$|The President of the Czech Republic is {{the elected}} {{head of state}} of the Czech Republic and the {{commander-in-chief}} of the Military of the Czech Republic. Unlike counterparts in other Central European countries such as Austria and Hungary, who are generally considered figureheads, the Czech president has a considerable role in political affairs. Because many powers can only be exercised with the signatures of <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, responsibility over some political issues is effectively shared between the two offices.|$|E
25|$|The Vice President {{is elected}} {{in the same}} manner as, but {{separately}} from, the President. <b>Both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the Vice President are elected by direct plurality vote where the candidate who garners the highest number of votes, whether a majority or not, wins the election. While candidates usually run in tandem for the offices of President and Vice President, under their own political parties, it is possible and not unusual for candidates from different parties to be elected as President and Vice President.|$|E

25|$|The {{biggest concern}} for the yes {{campaign}} was whether turnout would reach the 50% required for the referendum to be valid. After {{the first day of}} voting turnout was only 30% and <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and Prime Minister appeared on TV to urge Lithuanians to vote. There was a surge in voting on the Sunday with many people voting after church services. Lithuanian supermarkets also had a campaign {{on the second day of}} voting, offering cheaper beer, chocolate and soap to those who showed they had voted. In the end there were queues outside some voting booths and turnout was over 60%, safely over the required level.|$|E
25|$|Following the war, Carter {{decided to}} move west in a hope the change would help restore both his health and his wealth.

The congressional delegates of both Kentucky and Tennessee provided support for his appointment. He did not receive the requested appointment, but was offered a position as Secretary of Arizona Territory. Carter accepted the offer and was commissioned on April 10, 1866.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the main}} antagonists of 24's final season, Season Eight, are {{depicted}} as Russian government leaders and Muslim puppets. During the same season, Omar Hassan, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of <b>the</b> fictional Islamic Republic of Kamistan, {{was trying to}} broker a peace treaty with the US {{when he was killed}} by opposing factions inside his own administration.

Currently, both AFD and MoD are headed by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. To coordinate military policy with diplomacy <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the Prime Minister are advised by a six-member advisory board, three Chiefs of Staff, which includes the head {{of each of the}} regular services, Principal Staff Officer of the Armed Forces Division, and Military Secretaries to the President and the Prime Minister.

25|$|The IAF C-130Js {{are used}} by special forces for {{combined}} Army-Air Force operations. India purchased six C-130Js; however one crashed at Gwalior on 28 March 2014 while on a training mission, killing all 5 on board and destroying the aircraft. The Antonov An-32, known in Indian service as the Sutlej (named for the Sutlej River), serves as a medium transport aircraft in the IAF. The aircraft is also used in bombing roles and para-dropping operations. The IAF currently operates 105 An-32s, {{all of which are}} being upgraded.

25|$|Within a few hours, the IFE and {{the polling}} station {{officials}} explained that between 8 and 10 ballots {{for the election}} to the Lower House had been incorrectly placed in the presidential ballot box (this could be seen because the ballots for the presidential, senatorial, and lower house elections were printed on different colored paper, to match {{the colors of the}} boxes). Article 231 of the COFIPE states that ballots placed in the incorrect box should be moved to the correct box. The president of the polling station ordered the ballots moved to the correct box, and all representatives present agreed to this. The video had been recorded by the representative of the Coalition, who also signed the report that explained it in the official tally sheet.

500|$|Eisenhower's {{official}} {{nomination for}} Radford came in mid-1953. Eisenhower was initially cautious about {{him because of}} his involvement in the inter-service rivalry and [...] "revolt" [...] in 1949. Radford's anticommunist views, however, as well as his knowledge of Asia and his support of Eisenhower's [...] "New Look" [...] defense policy, made him an attractive nominee, particularly among Republicans, to replace Omar Bradley. Eisenhower was also impressed with his [...] "intelligence, dedication, tenacity, and courage to speak his mind." [...] During his nomination, Radford indicated a changed outlook from the positions he had taken during the [...] "Revolt of the Admirals". As chairman, he was eventually popular with <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and Congress.|$|E

[...] In fact, President Eisenhower himself in January 1954 said that nobody understood the Bricker Amendment, but his position [...] "was clear; he opposed any amendment that would reduce the President's power to conduct foreign policy." [...] In {{his opposition to the}} Amendment, Eisenhower obtained the help of Senate Minority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, who persuaded Senator Walter F. George of Georgia to sponsor his own proposal in order to sap support from Senator Bricker's. The George Substitute introduced on January 27, 1954, especially infuriated Bricker since George also wanted limits on treaties.|$|E
500|$|The poem's {{themes are}} change, inclusion, responsibility, {{and role of}} <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the citizenry in {{establishing}} economic security. Its symbols, references to contemporary issues, and personification of nature has inspired critics to compare [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] with Frost's inaugural poem and with Clinton's inaugural address. It has been called Angelou's [...] "autobiographical poem", and has received mixed reviews. The popular press praised Clinton's choice of Angelou as inaugural poet, and her [...] "representiveness" [...] of the American people and its President. Critic Mary Jane Lupton said that [...] "Angelou's ultimate greatness will be attributed" [...] to the poem, and that Angelou's [...] "theatrical" [...] performance of it, using skills she learned as an actor and speaker, marked {{a return to the}} African-American oral tradition of speakers such as Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. Poetry critics, despite praising Angelou's recitation and performance, gave mostly negative reviews of the poem.|$|E

They also accused other Peronist leaders of corruption; but, ultimately, though many were prosecuted, none were convicted. The junta's first leader, Eduardo Lonardi, appointed a Civilian Advisory Board. However, its preference for a gradual approach to de-Perónization helped lead to Lonardi's ousting, though most of the board's recommendations stood <b>the</b> new <b>president's</b> scrutiny.|$|R
