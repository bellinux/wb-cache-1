500|$|The romance {{contains}} some 46 chansons, {{which can be}} separated into two groups, according to Hollier and Bloch. The first group contains sixteen [...] "aristocratic" [...] chansons courtoises {{on the topic of}} courtly love, attributed to specific trouvères or troubadours (including Gace Brulé, Le Chastelain de Couci, Vidame de Chartres, Jaufre Rudel, and Bernart de Ventadorn). A second group consists of thirty mostly anonymous songs of a more popular nature, such as three chansons de toile and three other ballads, two pastourelles, and twenty chansons à danser (dance songs). Incorporated also is a laisse of the chanson de geste Gerbert de Metz. Different scholars have slightly different counts; where Holier and <b>Block</b> <b>count</b> three ballads and three chanson de toiles, Maureen Barry McCann Boulton counts six chansons de toile; in her detailed investigation of the chansons she claims the poem contains forty-six chansons in eight different genres.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>block</b> <b>counting</b> {{process and the}} {{fixation}} line of exchangeable coalescents. Formulas for the infinitesimal rates of both processes are provided. It is shown that the <b>block</b> <b>counting</b> process is Siegmund dual to the fixation line. For exchangeable coalescents restricted {{to a sample of}} size n and with dust we provide a convergence result for the <b>block</b> <b>counting</b> process as n tends to infinity. The associated limiting process is related to the frequencies of singletons of the coalescent. Via duality we obtain an analog convergence result for the fixation line of exchangeable coalescents with dust. The Dirichlet coalescent and the Poisson-Dirichlet coalescent are studied in detail.

40|$|A {{spectral}} decomposition for the <b>block</b> <b>counting</b> {{process of the}} Bolthausen–Sznitman coalescent Martin Möhle ∗ Helmut Pitters† A {{spectral decomposition}} for the generator and the transition probabilities of the <b>block</b> <b>counting</b> process of the Bolthausen–Sznitman coalescent is derived. This de-composition {{is closely related to}} the Stirling numbers of the first and second kind. The proof is based on generating functions and exploits a certain factorization prop-erty of the Bolthausen–Sznitman coalescent. As an application we derive a formula for the hitting probability h(i, j) that the <b>block</b> <b>counting</b> process of the Bolthausen– Sznitman coalescent ever visits state j when started from state i ≥ j. Moreover, explicit formulas are derived for the moments and the distribution function of the absorption time τn of the Bolthausen–Sznitman coalescent started in a partition with n blocks. We provide an elementary proof for the well known convergence of τn − log logn in distribution to the standard Gumbel distribution. It is shown that the speed of this convergence is of order 1 / logn...|$|R

5000|$|While the WC fields sic are {{required}} to contain the actual lengths of the following info fields in words, if the receiving RT implements a feature called [...] "word count checking", then {{the length of the}} info field may be less than 32 times the <b>block</b> <b>count</b> value in the HS action word by up to 31 words. In effect, the last block of an HS message may vary in length from 1 to 32 words. If the receiving terminal does not implement word count checking then the length of the info field shall be the <b>block</b> <b>count</b> multiplied by 32. The standard does not indicate how the transmitting terminal is meant to know whether the receiving RT implements this feature or not; hence it may be assumed {{to be part of the}} system’s design.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike its PC equivalent, the RDB doesn't {{directly}} contain metadata {{for each}} partition. Instead {{it points to}} a linked list of partition blocks, which contain the actual partition data. The partition data includes the start, length, filesystem, boot priority, buffer memory type and [...] "flavor", though the latter was never used. Because there is no limitation in partition <b>block</b> <b>count,</b> {{there is no need}} to distinguish primary and extended types and all partitions are equal in stature and architecture.|$|E

50|$|Every {{block was}} inscribed with 23 lines of text with 14 {{characters}} per line. Therefore, each <b>block,</b> <b>counting</b> both sides, contained {{a total of}} 644 characters. The consistency of the style, and some sources, suggests that a single man carved the entire collection but it is now believed that a team of 30 men carved the Tripitaka.|$|R
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third <b>block</b> <b>counting</b> from the left, and the fourth <b>block</b> <b>counting</b> downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|R
50|$|On {{the same}} day, Colonel Schwerin also sent a company northwards towards Blaker to {{reinforce}} Count Mörner, but at Killingmo they went right {{on one of}} the Norwegian vanguards and choose to retreat back to Colonel Schwerin's headquarters at Haneborg. Prince Christian August had thereby managed to cut off Count Mörner and his troops from the Swedish 2nd Brigade, and by ordering two of his companies to entrenched themselves on the farms in Rakkestad, the Prince intended to <b>block</b> <b>Count</b> Mörner's ability to retreat.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of an RT to RT HS transfer, the BC sends an HS action word to the {{receiving}} HS RT, instructing it to receive the HS message with a specified <b>block</b> <b>count</b> value at the specified subaddress. The receiving RT will then reply on the LS channel with an LS status word indicating it received the HS action word. The BC will then, after an intermessage gap on the LS channel, send another HS action word to the transmitting HS RT, instructing it to transmit the message, normally with the same <b>block</b> <b>count</b> value, and from one of its subaddresses. The transmitting RT will then reply on the LS channel with an LS status word indicating it received the HS action word and completing the HS control format. The HS RT transmitting an HS message will then begin its transmission within a maximum time measured from the parity (last) bit of the transmit HS action word. This initialization time is specified in the slash sheets, though all those in the current, draft standard are 24 to 32 µS. If the receiving HS RT does not receive the start of the HS message within a specified (in the slash sheet) time, which should be sufficient {{for the duration of the}} HS control format and the initialization time of the transmitter, it is required to timeout.|$|E

40|$|Population size {{estimates}} represent indispensable {{tools for}} many research programs and for conservation or management issues. Mountain ungulates in open areas are often surveyed through ground counts that normally underestimate population size. While {{the use of}} sample counts is desirable, few studies have compared different probabilistic approaches to estimate population size in this taxon. We compared the size estimates of a male population of Alpine chamois using mark-resight and line transect sampling methods, while <b>block</b> <b>counts</b> were used to obtain the minimum number of males alive in the study area. Surveys were conducted within the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), in August–September 2013, using <b>block</b> <b>counts</b> along purposely selected trails and vantage points, mark-resight over 5 consecutive resightings from vantage points and trails, and line transect sampling along 12 transects repeated 8 times. <b>Block</b> <b>counts</b> yielded a minimum number of males alive in the population of n = 72 individuals. This value was greater than the upper bound of the 95 % confidence interval achieved using line transect sampling {n = 54, CV = 14 % [95 % CI (40, 71) ]} while mark-resight yielded a more realistic result of n = 93 individuals {CV = 18 % [95 % CI (63, 137) ]}. Our results suggest that line transect sampling performed poorly in the Alpine environment, leading to underestimates of population size, likely due to violations of some assumptions imposed by the rugged nature of the terrain. The mark-resight yielded lower precision, possibly due to {{the limited number of}} marked individuals and resighting occasions, but it provided robustness and accurate estimates as marks were evenly distributed among animals...|$|R

Further, the magnitude of transverse load from pressurization was changed in a controlled sequence {{as a function of}} <b>block</b> <b>count</b> or crack size so as to induce changes in load biaxiality whose effect may be discernible at both the microscopic and macroscopic level...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{decomposition}} {{seems to}} be the most effective circuit synthesis approach for look-up table (LUT) FPGAs, (C) PLDs and complex gates. In the functional decomposition that targets LUT FPGAs, the circuit is constructed by recursively decomposing a given function and its sub-functions until each of the resulting subfunctions can be directly implemented with a LUT. The choice of sub-functions constructed in this process decides the quality of the resulting multi-level circuit expressed in terms of the logic <b>block</b> <b>count</b> and speed. In this paper, we propose a new effective and efficient method for the sub-function construction, and we consider its application in our circuit synthesis tool that targets LUT-based FPGAs. The method is based on the information relationship measures. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to extremely fast and very small circuits. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a case for}} a hybrid configurable logic block that contains a mixture of LUTs and hardened multiplexers towards the goal of higher logic density and area reduction. Technology mapping optimizations, called MuxMap, that target the proposed architecture are implemented using {{a modified version of}} the mapper in the ABC logic synthesis tool.

Multiple hybrid configurable logic block architectures with varying MUX:LUT ratios are evaluated across three benchmark suites with both Quartus II and Odin-II front-end RTL synthesis tools.
