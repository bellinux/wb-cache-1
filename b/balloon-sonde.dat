40|$|Seven days {{of global}} high {{resolution}} middle atmosphere ozone profiles have been {{measured by the}} CRyogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere (CRISTA) in November 1994. Measurements cover the altitude range from 10 to 80 km and latitudes from 59 deg S to 64 deg N. An example of a global ozone map is presented and demonstrates {{the ability of the}} instrument to detect medium and even small scale structures. Comparisons with ECC- and Brewer Mast <b>balloon-sonde</b> underflights are discussed. Reasonable agreement between CRISTA and balloon-sondes is found especially in the altitude interval between about 19 km and 27 km...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the results of}} remote spectrophotometric and lidar measurements of the total ozone and nitrogen dioxide contents and temperature, obtained at the Siberian Lidar Station (SLS) of V. E. Zuev Institute of Atmospheric Optics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences (Tomsk: 56. 5 °N; 85. 0 °E) {{in comparison with the}} results of analogous satellite measurements. The ground-based measurements of the total ozone (TO) content are performed with the help of М- 124 ozonometer; and the measurements of the nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) content are carried out with automatic spectrophotometer. The groundbased lidar measurements of temperature are conducted on the basis of SLS measurement complex. These measurements are compared with data of <b>balloon-sonde</b> and satellite measurements. The satellite measurements are performed by the TOMS and IASI instrumentation...|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{have been}} looking at the {{connection}} between tropical biomass burning and ozone formation and long-range transport for roughly 15 years. One can see the linkage and transport patterns from satellite though aircraft and/or <b>balloon-sonde</b> profiles are required to observe the fine structure (ozone transport over thousands of km often happens in thin layers). In this review, I survey the pyrogenic ozone transport in the large oceanic basins - Indian Ocean, Pacific and Atlantic. Mechanistic complexities are discussed and examples shown from satellite, aircraft and soundings, including NASA results from TOMS, the GTE experiments and the SHADOZ sounding program. Experiments referred to include SAFARI- 92, TRACE-A, INDOEX, PEM-Tropics and TRACE-P. augmented by subsidence, a variable tropopause height, and lightning - even ozone pollution from the Indian Ocean has been implicated. Over the Indian Ocean, pollution interacts with convection and the monsoon cycle...|$|E
40|$|Balloons {{are unique}} tools for {{studying}} the atmosphere. In contrast to satellites providing a global view of the Earth's atmosphere at broad resolution, they allow investigating atmospheric processes at high resolution. Following the meteorological <b>balloon-sondes</b> {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, powerful vehicles have been designed using plastic films available since 1947. Since then a number of balloon platforms have been designed spanning from zero pressure balloons flying up to 40 km altitude, spherical or pumpkin super-pressure balloons and Infrared Montgolfier allowing long duration flights for several months, and tethered balloons {{for studying the}} lower atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the stellar}} {{occultation}} instrument GOMOS is compared with ozonesondes from the SHADOZ network. We only used nighttime O 3 profiles and a requirement selection at 8 Southern Hemisphere stations. 7 years of GOMOS datasets (GOPR 6. 0 cf and IPF 5. 0) and 11 years of <b>balloon-sondes</b> {{are used in}} this study. A monthly distribution of GOMOS O 3 mixing ratios is performed in the upper-troposphere and in the stratosphere (15 - 50 km). A comparison with SHADOZ {{is done in the}} altitude range from 15 km to 30 km. In the 21 - 30 km altitude range, a satisfactory agreement is observed between GOMOS and SHADOZ although some differences are observed depending on the station. The range for monthly differences is generally decreasing with increasing height and is within ± 15 %. It is found that the agreement between GOMOS and SHADOZ degrades below ~ 20 km. The median differences are nearly within ± 5 % particularly above 23 km. But a large positive bias is found below 21 km compared to SHADOZ...|$|R
40|$|One year of <b>balloon-sonde</b> {{profiles}} {{taken from}} the Southern Hemisphere ADditional OZonesondes (SHADOZ) archive have been compared with data from the Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) by integrating the balloon profiles to obtain total column ozone. The TOMS backscattered ultraviolet measurement loses sensitivity to ozone in the lowest five to ten kilometers of the atmosphere, limiting {{the accuracy of the}} TOMS measurement of tropospheric ozone. This is shown by the increased deviation between TOMS total ozone and the sonde total in the tropical Pacific, where tropospheric ozone is known to be lower than the tropical climatological average. The TOMS underestimate is further confirmed by the correlation of deviations between TOMS and the sondes with changes in lower tropospheric ozone. After allowing for the TOMS offset, the sondes appear to underestimate ozone by three to five percent. This is confirmed by a limited number of comparisons with Dobson data...|$|E
40|$|A new {{method is}} {{presented}} to determine vertical ozone profiles from measurements of spectral global (direct Sun plus upper hemisphere) irradiance in the ultraviolet. The method {{is similar to the}} widely used Umkehr technique, which inverts measurements of zenith sky radiance. The procedure was applied to measurements of a high-resolution spectroradiometer installed near the centre of the Greenland ice sheet. Retrieved profiles were validated with <b>balloon-sonde</b> observations and ozone profiles from the space-borne Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). Depending on altitude, the bias between retrieval results presented in this paper and MLS observations ranges between − 5 and + 3  %. The magnitude of this bias is comparable, if not smaller, to values reported in the literature for the standard Dobson Umkehr method. Total ozone columns (TOCs) calculated from the retrieved profiles agree to within 0. 7 ± 2. 0  % (± 1 σ) with TOCs measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on board the Aura satellite. The new method is called the Global-Umkehr method...|$|E
40|$|In August 1995 {{multiple}} {{instruments that}} measure the stratospheric ozone vertical distribution were intercompared at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, {{under the auspices}} of the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change. The instruments included two UV lidar systems, one from JPL and the other from Goddard Space Flight Center, ECC balloon-sondes, a ground-based microwave instrument, Umkehr measurements, and a new ground-based FTIR instrument. The MLS instrument on the UARS satellite provided correlative profiles of ozone, and there was one close overpass of the SAGE II instrument. The results show that much better consistency among instruments is being achieved than even a few years ago, usually to within the instrument uncertainties. The different measurement techniques in this comparison agree to within +/- 10 % at almost all altitudes, and in the 20 km to 45 km region most agreed within +/- 5 %. The results show that the current generation of lidars are capable of accurate measurement of the ozone profile to a maximum altitude of 50 km. SAGE agreed well with both lidar and <b>balloon-sonde</b> down to at least 17 km. The ground-based microwave measurement agreed with other measurements from 22 km to above 50 km. One minor source of disagreement continues to be the pressure-altitude conversion needed to compare a measurement of ozone density versus altitude with a measurement of ozone mixing ratio versus pressure...|$|E
40|$|Two {{issues in}} the {{treatment}} of tropical convection in general circulation models are examined. First, several studies have found significant gradients in clear sky longwave fluxes near large convective systems. Increased upper tropospheric moisture associated with deep convection may explain the reduction in the longwave emission. Similar local gradients are not apparent in measurements from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), an important data set for model validation. Thus the average cloud forcing and greenhouse effect derived from models and observations may differ systematically over warm tropical oceans. A comparison of ERBE fluxes with radiative calculations using coincident <b>balloon-sonde</b> atmospheric profiles indicates negligible systematic bias in the observations. The effect of convection on the clear sky fluxes may be localized to the edges of individual cloud systems. Second, the balance between shortwave and cloud forcing and longwave forcing is a persistent feature of tropical cloud systems in ERBE data. This cancellation effect has been used to diagnose problems in GCM (General Circulation Model) cloud fields on seasonal time scales. The daily record of net cloud radiative forcing is analyzed to determine the smallest spatial and temporal scales for the balance. The results show cancellation on periods as short as three days for regions smaller than 2. 5 by 2. 5 deg. The analysis indicates that the balance is primarily a local phenomenon characteristic of tropical convection. This is consistent with findings that the small cloud radiative forcing is due primarily to thick tropical cirrus. These results represent a particularly stringent test of convective parameterizations in GCM's with interactive ocean surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Following an {{exceptionally}} active winter, the 2002 Southern Hemisphere (SH) major warming occurred in late September. It {{was preceded by}} three minor warming events that occurred in late August and early September, and yielded vortex split and break-down over Antarctica. Ozone (O 3 and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) profiles obtained {{during that period of}} time (15 August – 4 October) by the Sub-Millimetre Radiometer (SMR) aboard the Odin satellite are assimilated into MOCAGE (Modélisation Isentrope du transport Mésoéchelle de l'Ozone Stratosphérique par Advection), a global three-dimensional chemistry transport model of Météo-France. The assimilated algorithm is a three-dimensional-FGAT built by the European Centre for Research and Advance Training in Scientific Computation (CERFACS) using the PALM (Projet d'Assimilation par Logiciel Multi-méthode) software. The assimilated O 3 and N 2 O profiles and isentropic distributions are compared to ground-based measurements (LIDAR and <b>balloon-sonde)</b> and to maps of advected potential vorticity (APV). The latter is computed by the MIMOSA (Modélisation Isentrope du transport Mésoéchelle de l'Ozone Stratosphérique par Advection) model, a high-resolution advection transport model, using meteorological fields from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It is found that O 3 concentrations retrieved by the MOCAGE–PALM assimilation system show a reasonably good agreement in the 20 – 28 km height range when compared with ground-based profiles. This altitude range corresponds to the intersection between the MOCAGE levels (0 – 28 km) and SMR O 3 retrievals (20 – 50 km). Moreover, comparison of N 2 O assimilated fields with MIMOSA APV maps indicates that the dramatic split and subsequent break-down of the polar vortex, as well as the associated mixing of mid- and low-latitude stratospheric air, are well resolved and pictured by MOCAGE–PALM. The present study demonstrates also that the tremendous dynamics and associated polar vortex deformations during the 2002 -austral-winter have modified ozone and nitrous oxide distributions not only at the vicinity of the polar vortex, but over topics and subtropics as well...|$|E
40|$|A new {{real-time}} Lagrangian {{diagnostic system}} for stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) developed for Environment Canada (EC) has been delivering daily archived data since 20 July 2010. The STE calculations are performed globally following the Lagrangian approach proposed in Bourqui (2006) using medium-range, high-resolution operational global weather forecasts. Following every weather forecast, trajectories are started from a dense three-dimensional grid covering the globe, and are calculated {{for six days}} of the forecast. All trajectories crossing either the dynamical tropopause (± 2 PVU) or the 380 K isentrope and having a residence time greater than 12 h are archived, and also used to calculate several diagnostics. This system provides daily global STE forecasts {{that can be used}} to guide field campaigns, among other applications. The archived data set offers unique high-resolution information on transport across the tropopause for both extra-tropical hemispheres and the tropics. This will be useful for improving our understanding of STE globally, and as a reference for the evaluation of lower-resolution models. This new data set is evaluated here against measurements taken during a balloon sonde campaign with daily launches from three stations in eastern Canada (Montreal, Egbert, and Walsingham) for the period from 12 July to 4 August 2010. The campaign found an unexpectedly high number of observed stratospheric intrusions: 79 % (38 %) of the profiles appear to show the presence of stratospheric air below 500 hPa (700 hPa). An objective identification algorithm developed for this study is used to identify layers in the <b>balloon-sonde</b> profiles affected by stratospheric air and to evaluate the Lagrangian STE forecasts. We find that the predictive skill for the overall intrusion depth is excellent for intrusions penetrating down to 300 and 500 hPa, while it becomes negligible for intrusions penetrating below 700 hPa. Nevertheless, the statistical representation of these deep intrusions is reasonable, with an average bias of 24 %. Evaluation of the skill at representing the detailed structures of the stratospheric intrusions shows good predictive skill down to 500 hPa, reduced predictive skill between 500 and 700 hPa, and none below. A significant low statistical bias of about 30 % is found in the layer between 500 to 700 hPa. However, analysis of missed events at one site, Montreal, shows that 70 % of them coincide with candidate clusters of trajectories that pass through Montreal, but that are too dispersed to be detected in the close neighbourhood of the station. This allows us to expect a negligible bias throughout the troposphere in the spatially averaged STE frequency derived from this data set, for example in climatological maps of STE mass fluxes...|$|E
