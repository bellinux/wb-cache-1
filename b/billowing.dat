40|$|Factors {{affecting}} the along-axis coherence length of Kelvin-Helmholtz <b>billows</b> are reviewed. Little {{is known of}} the processes which determine or limit this length. Laboratory experiments show that, as they develop, <b>billows</b> may be irregularly spaced, resulting in pairing along their length, or, more commonly, grow at different rates in patches which subsequently amalgamate. Both processes result in features described as 'knots', where neighbouring <b>billows</b> join. The tangling of <b>billow</b> vortices in the knots leads to local turbulence and mixing, often before turbulence develops at a smaller scale within the <b>billows</b> themselves. The axial coherence length of <b>billows</b> {{is limited to the}} along-axis distance between these knots. Such features in the atmosphere and the ocean have received little attention in spite of their possible bearing on clear-air turbulence and to heat and momentum transport. Observations of atmospheric <b>billows</b> suggest an axial coherence length which is of the same order as that found in the laboratory, about four <b>billow</b> wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} development of shear-induced overturning <b>billows</b> associated with breaking internal solitary waves is studied {{by means of a}} combined laboratory and numerical investigation. The waves are generated in the laboratory by a lock exchange mechanism and they are simulated numerically via a contour-advective semi-Lagrangian method. The properties of individual <b>billows</b> (maximum height attained, time of collapse, growth rate, speed, wavelength, Thorpe scale) are determined in each case, and the <b>billow</b> interaction processes are studied and classified. For broad flat waves, similar characteristics are seen to those in parallel shear flow, but, for waves not at the conjugate flow limit, <b>billow</b> characteristics are affected by the spatially varying wave-induced shear flow. Wave steepness and wave amplitude are shown to have a crucial influence on determining the type of interaction that occurs between <b>billows</b> and whether <b>billow</b> overturning can be arrested. Examples are given in which <b>billows</b> (i) evolve independently of one another, (ii) pair with one another, (iii) engulf/entrain one another and (iv) fail to completely overturn. It is shown that the vertical extent a <b>billow</b> can attain (and the associated Thorpe scale of the <b>billow)</b> is dependent on wave amplitude but that its value saturates once a given amplitude is reached. It {{is interesting to note that}} this amplitude is less than the conjugate flow limit amplitude. The number of <b>billows</b> that form on a wave is shown to be dependent on wavelength; shorter waves support fewer but larger <b>billows</b> than their long-wave counterparts for a given stratification.

5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating <b>billowing</b> clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 1925, Wright {{returned}} from eating {{dinner in the}} detached dining room when he noticed smoke <b>billowing</b> from his bedroom. By that time of night, most of the employees had returned home; only a driver and one apprentice were left in the complex. Unlike the first Taliesin fire, Wright {{was able to get}} help immediately. However, the fire quickly spread due to high winds. Despite the efforts of Wright and his neighbors to extinguish the flame, the living quarters of the second Taliesin were quickly destroyed. However, the workrooms where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared. According to Wright's autobiography, the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom. Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before noticing the fire. Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system, sparking the fire.|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{limitations}} {{due to the}} lack of cluster of instruments and coordinated measurements, our effort on the hypothesis of generation of the ‘λimage’ structure in the lidargram brings out an important parameter that should be addressed: the lifetime of deformed KH <b>billow.</b> Our investigation poses a question: Can the deformed KH <b>billow</b> have a few hours lifetime? As already discussed, Pfrommer et al. (2009) found clear evidence of KH <b>billows</b> in the MLT region using a high resolution Na lidar. However, they observed KH <b>billows</b> in the lidargram only for a few minutes. As described by Hecht et al. (2005), the lifetime of such KH <b>billows</b> is a few tens of minutes. Theoretical studies by Fritts et al. (1996) and Palmer et al. (1996) show that the lifetime and evolution of such KH <b>billows</b> and their subsequent dissipation are complex and far less understood.|$|R
30|$|In addition, the {{photographs}} {{indicated that the}} KH <b>billows</b> covered a horizontal domain that did not exceed 24  km streamwise and 6  km spanwise (i.e., less than twice their horizontal wavelength), indicating a very localized source. The complementary information provided by {{the photographs}} thus indicates that the time evolution revealed by the MU radar was dominated by the advection of <b>billows</b> at different stages of their evolution. They persisted over more than 8  min without noticeable deformation. Each <b>billow</b> forming the horizontal patch was likely not at the same stage of evolution: The first <b>billows</b> detected by the radar may have coincided with the earliest stage of the <b>billows,</b> {{at the edges of the}} patch, giving the appearance of growing KH <b>billows</b> in the radar images (see Fig.  2 between 06 : 45 and 07 : 00 LT). The radar did not show the real time evolution of the KH <b>billow</b> development (likely much slower than it can be deduced from the radar image if the apparent time evolution is interpreted as the time evolution of each KH structure). The radar observations are thus representative of their spatial distribution and do not provide information about their lifespan; the radar did not reveal the standard evolution of KH <b>billows</b> (i.e., wave amplification, breaking, mixing, possibly followed by the formation of a double-layer structure), but this evolution may have been confirmed if we were able to follow the KH <b>billows</b> in their motion with the background flow.|$|R

The French had begun to scuttle their vessels when the action had begun, but both were still afloat when Scharnhorst and Gneisenau began firing upon them and {{finished}} the two ships off. By now, most of the Papeete's inhabitants had fled and the town had caught fire from the German shelling, with two blocks of Papeete set alight. With the coal piles destroyed and the threat of mines in the harbor, von Spee saw no meaningful purpose in making a landing. Accordingly, the German admiral withdrew his ships from Papeete's harbor by 11:00. After leaving Papeete, the ships steamed out towards Nuku Hiva to meet Nürnberg, Titania, and colliers waiting there.|$|E

5|$|In April 1943 Graf Zeppelin {{was again}} towed eastward, first to Gotenhafen, {{then to the}} {{roadstead}} at Swinemünde and finally berthed at a back-water wharf in the Parnitz River, two miles (3km) from Stettin, {{where she had been}} briefly docked in 1941. There she languished {{for the next two years}} with only a 40-man custodial crew in attendance. When Red Army forces neared the city in April 1945, the ship's Kingston valves were opened, flooding her lower spaces and settling her firmly into the mud in shallow water. A ten-man engineering squad then rigged the vessel's interior with demolition and depth charges in order to hole the hull and destroy vital machinery. At 6pm on 25 April 1945, just as the Soviets entered Stettin, commander Wolfgang Kähler radioed the squad to detonate the explosives. Smoke <b>billowing</b> from the carrier's funnel confirmed the charges had gone off, rendering the ship useless to her new owners for many months to come.|$|E

5|$|Deserts {{are formed}} by {{weathering}} processes as large {{variations in temperature}} between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in <b>billowing</b> sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources {{of water in the}} form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.|$|E

There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature.

However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke <b>billowing</b> from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine.

30|$|In recent times, the Na lidar {{observations}} and investigations on {{the manifestation of}} the KH <b>billows</b> in the Na layer brought the attention among the researchers. A few observations of ‘C-type’ structures in the lidargram from different locations bring out the existence of KH <b>billows</b> in the Na layer (Kane et al. 2001; Sridharan et al. 2009). All the observations reveal that the lifetime of the structures is 30 min to 2 h. As explained by Clemesha et al. (2004), the occurrence of the ‘C-type’ structure in the lidargram {{is a result of}} wind-shear distortion of preexisting clouds of enhanced Na concentration. Kane et al. (2001) and Sridharan et al. (2009) suggested that KH <b>billows</b> play important role in the formation of ‘C-type’ structures that appeared in the lidargram. These observations indicate that the background wind and atmospheric conditions play crucial role in the evolution and sustenance of the KH <b>billows</b> in the MLT region. In the present case study, the KH <b>billow</b> has been hypothesized to be generated and deformed during 18 : 00 to 19 : 00 IST over Thiruvananthapuram. Further evolution and deformation of this KH <b>billow</b> was probably ceased due to the absence of strong wind shears. As a consequence, this KH <b>billow</b> is believed to get nearly ‘frozen-in’ the background wind and advected to Gadanki. In absence of the Na lidar measurements, the formation of KH <b>billow</b> over Thiruvananthapuram cannot be unambiguously established. Nevertheless, the wind observations over Thiruvananthapuram and the Na lidar observations over Gadanki provide credence to the proposition made in the present study. However, it remains to be confirmed whether favorable background conditions in the MLT region can help to sustain the KH <b>billows</b> for a few hours without significant decay. This communication poses an open question on the lifetime of KH <b>billows</b> in the MLT region. Further investigations including theoretical work along with systematic and coordinated measurements using cluster of instruments possibly can answer this.|$|R

The differences between our model and others include: the background field has no special initial configuration and there is no initial triggering mechanism needed in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region to excite the KH <b>billows.</b> However, the initial triggering mechanism is performed in the lower atmosphere through GW, which then propagate into the MLT region and form <b>billows.</b> The braid structures and overturning of KH <b>billows,</b> caused by nonlinear interactions between GWs and mean flow, can be resolved precisely by the model. These results support the findings in airglow studies that GWs propagating from below into the MLT region are important sources of KH <b>billows.</b> The onset of small scale waves and the wave energy transfer induce the shallower vertical wave number power spectral densities (PSD). However, most of the slopes are steeper than the expected kz&minus; 3 power law, which indicates that GWs with 10 km vertical wavelength are still a dominant mode. The results also show that the evolution of mean wind vary substantially between the different processes of GWs propagation.
