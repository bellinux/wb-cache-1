500|$|Senator David B. Hill of New York, a gold supporter, was next. As Hill {{moved to}} the podium, a {{reporter}} friend passed Bryan a note urging {{him to make a}} patriotic speech without hint of sectionalism; Bryan responded, [...] "You will not be disappointed." [...] Hill gave a calm speech defending the gold position, and swayed few delegates. He was followed by two other gold men, Senator William Vilas of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor William E. Russell. Vilas gave a lengthy defense of the Cleveland administration's policies, so long that Russell, fearing that Vilas' speech would cut into his time, asked that the time given to the gold proponents be extended by ten minutes. Bryan consented, on condition that his own time was extended by the same amount; this was agreed to. [...] "And I needed it for the speech I was to make." [...] Bryan later wrote, [...] "This was another unexpected bit of good fortune. I had never had such an opportunity <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and never expect to have again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lionsgate {{confirmed}} in March 2011 that about 30 actresses auditioned or read {{for the role}} of Katniss Everdeen, including Hailee Steinfeld, Abigail Breslin, Emma Roberts, Saoirse Ronan, Chloë Grace Moretz, Jodelle Ferland, Lyndsy Fonseca, Emily Browning, Shailene Woodley, and Kaya Scodelario. On March 16, 2011, it was announced that Jennifer Lawrence (who was at the time filming for [...] ) had landed the coveted role. Ross described Lawrence as having [...] "an incredible amount of self-assuredness, you got the sense that this girl knew exactly who she was. And then she came in and read for me and just knocked me out; I'd never seen an audition like that <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> It {{was one of those things}} where you just glimpse your whole movie in front of you." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 11, 1974, Coleman lost {{a bid for}} {{a no-hitter}} {{in the eighth inning}} when Gene Michael of the New York Yankees hit a one-out single. [...] By May 15, 1974, Coleman had a 6–1 record and {{appeared}} to be on track for the best season of his career. [...] However, he did not win another game for two months, and his performance dropped off markedly. [...] He finished the 1974 season with a 14–12 record and a 4.32 ERA in 41 starts. He walked an astounding 158 batters in 1974 (a Tigers single-season record) for a career high rate of 5.0/9 IP. [...] At the end of the 1974 season, Coleman said: [...] "It was really strange. [...] My arm felt better than it ever had <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> But I couldn't do it. [...] It {{was just one of those}} crazy things. At times I didn't have any idea what I was doing out there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, sir," [...] {{returned}} Caleb in a whisper. [...] "Never see him <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> A beautiful {{figure for}} a nut-cracker; quite a new model. With a screw-jaw opening {{down into his}} waistcoat, he'd be lovely." ...|$|R
60|$|Never <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life</b> had {{anything}} like this freedom from responsibility, from expense, come to me. So carefree, so beautiful was our life, that I woke each morning with a start of surprise to find its magic a reality. It was like the hospitality of oriental kings in the fairy stories of my childhood.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; please no, mamma! I've {{never seen}} a' aviator <b>before,</b> not <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and you promised me 'cross your heart, at Pasadena you did, I could see one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shocking!" [...] Charles exclaimed. [...] "Shocking! I never <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> beheld {{so strange}} an {{instance}} of complete insensibility to the claims of others!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{complete}} stranger," [...] Mr. Ascough agreed. [...] "I {{had never}} seen him <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I did a little trifling business for him in connection with his property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he declared, [...] "I like that. Why, I {{have never}} seen the girl <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> or anyone like her. Where do I come in, I should like to know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's so difficult------ I've never <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life</b> {{tried to}} get to the bottom of my mind. For one thing, I've not treated Willie properly. He--he counted on me. I know he did. I was his hope. I was a promised delight--{{something}}, something to crown life--better than anything he had ever had. And a secret pride. [...] . He lived upon me. I knew--when we two began to meet together, you and I------ It was a sort of treachery to him------" ...|$|R
2500|$|Castillo scored {{his first}} goal for Shakhtar while playing against SV Salzburg in the Champions League. He had only {{played in a}} few games for Shakhtar when, in a league match versus FC Naftovyk-Ukrnafta Okhtyrka, Shakhtar won a penalty kick. Castillo refused to give the ball to {{designated}} penalty kick-taker Cristiano Lucarelli and took the penalty himself, which was saved by the goalkeeper. Castillo was immediately substituted from the game. Coach Mircea Lucescu commented [...] "What Castillo did, from a professional point of view, I've {{never seen anything like}} it <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> whole <b>life.</b> There will be some measures taken against Castillo".|$|R
6000|$|... "Blair, she {{may make}} me see her faithlessness--and perhaps some strange unrest--some change that's {{seemed to come}} over everything. But she can't prove to me the death of {{anything}} outside of herself. She can't prove that any more than Mel Iden's confession proved her a wanton. It didn't. Not to me. Why, when Mel {{put her hand on}} my breast--on this medal--and looked at me--I had such a thrill as I never had <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Never!... Blair, it's not dead. That beautiful thing you mentioned--that spirit--that fire which burned so gloriously--it is not dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a bird, all right, Kid," [...] she {{admitted}} gratefully. [...] "I {{never had any}} furs on <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> But ain't Russian sables awful expensive? Seems to me I've heard they were." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{liked being}} with him. He was {{a type of}} person I had never met <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and one whom I {{thoroughly}} appreciated. I sat and watched him during an interval of the conversation.|$|E
60|$|NAPOLEON. Ouf! One cannot {{always be}} at one's best. Twice <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> I have lost my nerve and behaved like a poltroon. But I warn {{you not to}} judge my quality by these {{involuntary}} moments.|$|E
60|$|Well, as I was saying, in {{she comes}} to the supper rooms, and toffy enough she looked in her {{diamonds}} and furs, and as for haughtiness there wasn't a born Marchioness she couldn't have given points to. She comes straight up to my table and sits down. Her husband was with her, but he didn't seem to have much to say, except to repeat her orders. Of course I looked as if I'd never set eyes on her <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> though all {{the time she was}} a-pecking at the mayonnaise and a-sipping at the Giessler, I was thinking of the coffee-shop and of the ninepenny haddick and the pint of cocoa.|$|R
6000|$|... "My, but I {{did have}} a time of it! I ain't much good at story-tellin' but I reckon I told more stories this arternoon than I ever tole <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I told 'em that they was two of you, an' that the biggest one hed red hair, an' the little one was all pock-marked. Then they said you prob'ly wasn't the man at all, an' my! how they did swear at them two tramps fer gettin' 'em way out here on a wild-goose chase; but they're goin' to look fer you jes' the same in Olathe, only they won't find you there," [...] and she laughed, a bit nervously though.|$|R
60|$|I'd {{never heard}} a woman <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life</b> who could talk of love, who could lay bare and develop and touch with {{imagination}} all that mass of fine emotion every woman, it may be, hides. She had read of love, she had thought of love, a thousand sweet lyrics had sounded through her brain and left fine fragments in her memory; she poured it out, all of it, shamelessly, skilfully, for me. I cannot give any sense of that talk, I cannot even tell {{how much of the}} delight of it was the magic of her voice, the glow of her near presence. And always we walked swathed warmly through a chilly air, along dim, interminable greasy roads--with never a soul abroad it seemed to us, never a beast in the fields.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Everything changed!' He spoke sadly, as Ulysses {{might have}} done when his boat put in at Ithaca. 'Every darned thing {{different}} since I was here last. New waiter, head-waiter I never saw <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> different-coloured carpet--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{wanted me}} to {{identify}} some one whom I had certainly never seen <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and {{to tell you the}} truth, they were positively rude to me because I could not. Have you ever heard the name of Meysey Hill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give you my word of honor, I {{never heard}} of him <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life!</b> Don't be angry, Sir. I'm not {{offended}} with you." [...] He smiled, and took out his brier-wood pipe. [...] "Got a light?" [...] he asked, in the friendliest possible manner.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{convey to}} you the {{intolerable}} wretchedness and rebellion of my separation from Isabel. It seemed {{that in the past}} two years all my thoughts had spun commisures to Isabel's brain and I could think of nothing that did not lead me surely to the need of the one intimate I had found in the world. I came back to the House and the office and my home, I filled all my days with appointments and duty, and it did not save me in the least from a lonely emptiness such as I had never felt <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I had little sleep. In the daytime I did a hundred things, I even spoke in the House on two occasions, and by my own low standards spoke well, and it seemed to me that I was going about <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own brain like a hushed survivor in a house whose owner lies dead upstairs.|$|R
60|$|He {{was evidently}} {{one of the}} largest-sized gorillas. In the gloom of the forest he {{appeared}} to us to be above six feet high. His jet-black visage was working {{with an expression of}} rage that was fearfully satanic. His eyes glared horribly. The tuft of hair {{on the top of his}} head rose and fell with the working of his low wrinkled forehead in a manner that peculiarly enhanced the ferocity of his expression. His great hairy body seemed much too large for his misshapen legs, and his enormous arms much too long for the body. It was with the fists at the ends of those muscular arms that he beat upon his bulky chest, and produced the unaccountable sounds above referred to. As he stood there uttering roar upon roar--apparently with the view of screwing up his courage to attack us--displaying his great canine teeth, and advancing slowly, step by step, I felt a mingling of powerful emotions such as I had never felt <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and such as cannot by any possibility be adequately described.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait {{upon you}} in town," [...] I {{said to myself}} as I laid down the telegram. A great firm of solicitors would not wish to wait upon me unless they had {{something}} to tell me to my advantage and their own. Mrs. Strong must have left me some money. Possibly even I was her heir. More than once <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>my</b> luck had turned in this sudden way, why should it not happen again? But she was insane and could not appoint an heir! Why had not those fools of lawyers told me the facts instead of leaving me to the torment of this suspense? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better," [...] {{answered}} Spike. [...] "I never {{had such a}} whirl in her <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and I {{thought she was going}} to stop and pass the night there. That's the very spot on which `The Hussar' frigate was wrecked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You carry {{originality}} to quixoticism. I {{have met}} several men <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> whom I have suspected {{of such a}} thing, but I never heard any one confess it. This little domestic contretemps is then, I presume, disagreeable to you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a dear girl, Sophy!" [...] he said. [...] "Don't go just yet. I {{have never}} felt like it <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> but just now I don't {{want to be left}} alone. Send a boy for some clothes, and I will order some tea." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{believe that}} never <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> even amidst the terrors of {{childhood}} nights, have I suffered such a sensation of extreme horror as I did {{that moment in}} which I realized that I must lie bound and helpless while some horrid beast of prey crept upon me to devour me in that utter darkness of the Bandlu pits of Caspak. I reeked with cold sweat, and my flesh crawled--I could feel it crawl. If ever I came nearer to abject cowardice, I do not recall the instance; {{and yet it was}} not that I was afraid to die, for I had long since given myself up as lost--a few days of Caspak must impress anyone with the utter nothingness of life. The waters, the land, the air teem with it, and always it is being devoured by some other form of life. Life is the cheapest thing in Caspak, as it is the cheapest thing on earth and, doubtless, the cheapest cosmic production. No, I was not afraid to die; in fact, I prayed for death, that I might be relieved of the frightfulness of the interval of life which remained to me--the waiting, the awful waiting, for that fearsome beast to reach me and to strike.|$|R
6000|$|Still we {{came there}} somehow, and, forgetting my wounds, I tumbled from the horse, threw myself flat and drank and drank, more, I think, than ever I did <b>before.</b> Not <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life</b> have I tasted {{anything}} so delicious as was that long draught of water. When I had satisfied my thirst, I dipped {{my head and}} made shift to jerk my wounded arm into it, for its coolness seemed to still the pain. Presently Leo rose, the water running from his face and beard, and said--"What shall we do now? The river seems to be wide, over a hundred yards, and it is low, {{but there may be}} deep water in the middle. Shall we try to cross, in which case we might drown, or stop where we are till daylight and take our chance of the death-hounds?" ...|$|R
60|$|We turned, and, sure enough, {{there they}} were--three fantastic pirates armed with guns. We slackened our pace {{to let them}} come up, and in the {{meantime}} I got out my cargo of grapes and dropped them firmly but reluctantly into the shadows by the wayside. But I was not afraid. I only felt that it was not right to steal grapes. And all the more so when the owner was around--and not only around, but with his friends around also. The villains came up and searched a bundle Dr. Birch had in his hand, and scowled upon him when they found it had nothing in it but some holy rocks from Mars Hill, and these were not contraband. They evidently suspected him of playing some wretched fraud upon them, and seemed half inclined to scalp the party. But finally they dismissed us with a warning, couched in excellent Greek, I suppose, and dropped tranquilly in our wake. When they had gone three hundred yards they stopped, and we went on rejoiced. But behold, another armed rascal came out of the shadows and took their place, and followed us two hundred yards. Then he delivered us over to another miscreant, who emerged from some mysterious place, and he in turn to another! For {{a mile and a half}} our rear was guarded all the while by armed men. I never traveled in so much state <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{once for}} all, I'll {{tell you the}} facts. As I {{got out of the}} train a man I'd seen once <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> made an attack upon me, and before the police came up, I got a blow in the face. Now you know all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{astonished}} me," [...] he added. [...] "It went {{as straight}} {{to my heart}} as though you had smiled {{for the purpose of}} dazzling me. I felt as if I had never seen a smile <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I thought of it after I left you. It made me restless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, let me {{tell you}} this much, at least," [...] she confided. [...] "I have never <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> been so glad to hear any one say so.... And here we are at home, and there's Jimmy on the doorstep. What is it, Jimmy," [...] she asked, waving her hand.|$|E
5000|$|After {{his court}} appearance, Sohi was {{transferred}} to Gaya Central Prison {{in the city of}} Gaya, where he was kept in solitary confinement for the next 18 months. He was placed in a cell with a small window and no bed; he slept on a single blanket on the floor, using another to cover himself. “The food was horrible. A couple of chapatis in the morning. Some lentil stew in the evening with a couple of rotis. No vegetables or any meat.” Initially, Sohi said he felt dazed and without energy. “I was traumatized. I wasn’t in any right frame of mind.” After four months, his father and brother were allowed to visit. “My father was a very strong man. I had never seen <b>my</b> father cry <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> whole <b>life.</b> But I saw tears <b>in</b> <b>my</b> dad’s eyes. I saw the pain and the emotion in his eyes that I had never seen before. You forget the physical pain and the torture, but I will never forget that." [...] Sohi managed to maintain his reason by making friends with the prison guards, and got a message out to the local newspapers through one of them, announcing he was going on a hunger strike for better food and library privileges. After a week of fasting, Sohi's family were permitted to send him money, which he used to buy food from outside the prison; he was also allowed to use the prison library. [...] "I had no hope whatsoever that I would ever be able to get out,” he said. [...] "What kept me alive, what made a difference, was access to the library and access to the newspapers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By golly, I think you're right," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "It {{strikes me}} that way, now you speak of it. They ain't no games or tricks here, no cheatin' an' no lyin'. Them trees just stand up natural an' strong an' clean like young boys their first time <b>in</b> the ring <b>before</b> they've learned its rottenness an' how to {{double-cross}} an' lay down to the bettin' odds an' the fight-fans. Yep; it is brave. Say, Saxon, you see things, don't you?" [...] His pause was almost wistful, {{and he looked at}} her and studied her with a caressing softness that ran through her in resurgent thrills. [...] "D'ye know, I'd just like you to see me fight some time--a real fight, with something doin' every moment. I'd be proud to death to do it for you. An' I'd sure fight some with you lookin' on an' understandin'. That'd be a fight what is, take it from me. An' that's funny, too. I never wanted to fight <b>before</b> a woman <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> They squeal and screech an' don't understand. But you'd understand. It's dead open an' shut you would." ...|$|R
50|$|Later during September, 1777, Fairfax was {{detained}} in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. However, {{he wrote to}} his Washington, who sent him a pass to travel between the lines:For the past two years I have had a strong Desire to enter into Holy Orders than ever I had <b>before</b> tho' frequently <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>Life</b> have had the same, yet generally suffered worldly considerations to interfere. This Desire and the not finding myself at Liberty to concur in the Public measures make me very anxious to get to England, and I have been in Hopes of obtaining a Pass from the Congress to go to N: York for that Purpose. There has appeared to me but one Objection, and that is, the giving of Intelligence, but I would not only enter into Engagements in that respect if required but it may be considered that what I might say would be of little Consequence, but if of any would raher be in Favour of America because I really {{think that it would be}} the Interest of Great Britain to let her enjoy her Independence, for if successful in this Struggle which is very doubtful it might all be to do over again at another Time.|$|R
