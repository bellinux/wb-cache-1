50|$|<b>Beta-amylase</b> cuts starch into maltose units. This {{process is}} {{important}} in the digestion of starch and is also used in brewing, where amylase from the skin of seed grains is responsible for converting starch to maltose (Malting, Mashing).|$|E
50|$|This enzyme acts on starch, {{glycogen}} {{and related}} polysaccharides and oligosaccharides producing beta-maltose by an inversion. <b>Beta-amylase</b> {{is found in}} bacteria, fungi, and plants; bacteria and cereal sources are the most heat stable. Working from the non-reducing end, β-amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the second α-1,4 glycosidic bond, cleaving off two glucose units (maltose) at a time. During the ripening of fruit, β-amylase breaks starch into maltose, resulting in the sweet flavor of ripe fruit.|$|E
50|$|The 3D {{structure}} of a complex of soybean <b>beta-amylase</b> with an inhibitor (alpha-cyclodextrin) has been determined to 3.0A resolution by X-ray diffraction. The enzyme folds into large and small domains: the large domain has a (beta alpha)8 super-secondary structural core, while the smaller is formed from two long loops extending from the beta-3 and beta-4 strands of the (beta alpha)8 fold. The interface of the two domains, together with shorter loops from the (beta alpha)8 core, form a deep cleft, in which the inhibitor binds. Two maltose molecules also bind in the cleft, one sharing a binding site with alpha-cyclodextrin, and the other sitting more deeply in the cleft.|$|E
50|$|After the phosphorylation, {{the first}} {{degrading}} enzyme, <b>beta-amylase</b> (BAM) can attack the glucose chain at its non-reducing end. Maltose is released {{as the main}} product of starch degradation. If the glucose chain consists of three or fewer molecules, BAM cannot release maltose. A second enzyme, disproportionating enzyme-1 (DPE1), combines two maltotriose molecules. From this chain, a glucose molecule is released. Now, BAM can release another maltose molecule from the remaining chain. This cycle repeats until starch is degraded completely. If BAM comes close to the phosphorylated branching point of the glucose chain, {{it can no longer}} release maltose. In order for the phosphorylated chain to be degraded, the enzyme isoamylase (ISA) is required.|$|E

The enzymes used in the saccharification step are the amylolytic enzyme, <b>beta-amylase</b> (usually derived from Bacillus species) and the debranching enzyme, pullulanase (derived from Aerobacter species).

The oligosaccharide fractions were separated by multiple ascent paper chromatography into B 4, B 5, and B 6 groups;The action of <b>beta-amylase</b> on the panose coupled oligosaccharides has been studied. Fractions of the B 5 and B 6 groups were resistant to the action of <b>beta-amylase.</b> By the use of R-enzyme, it was concluded that the resistant B 5 was 0 - 0 -(0 - 0) - 0 -, and the resistant B 6 was 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - 0 -. There might have been a small amount of a resistant B 7 with the probable structure 0 - 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - 0 -. A measure of the rate of <b>beta-amylase</b> action on the various fractions has been made. The rate of enzyme action decreased considerably as the branch point (alpha- 1, 6 linkage) was approached;The action of <b>beta-amylase</b> on the isomaltose coupled oligosaccharides has been studied. Fractions of the B 4, B 5, and B 6 groups were resistant to the action of the enzyme. The resistant B 4 consisted mainly of 0 - 0 -(0 - 0) -, but could conceivably have contained 0 - 0 - 0 -(0) -. The resistant B 5 contained both 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - and 0 - 0 - 0 -(0 - 0) -. The resistant B 6 consisted of 0 - 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) -. One chain had an effect on the other as far as the action of the enzyme was concerned. The presence of a single glucose unit on the opposite chain was enough to make a resistant bond out of one which was formerly non-resistant. The rate of <b>beta-amylase</b> action on these fractions was also studied. Again the rate diminished as the branch point was approached;B 7 from the salivary amylase hydrolysis of amylopectin was separated by paper chromatography. This preparation consisted of a single oligosaccharide of known structure, 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - 0 - 0 -. Salivary amylase was capable of slowly hydrolyzing this B 7 to a B 5 and maltose, but the B 7 was apparently completely resistant to the action of beta-amylase;The rate of <b>beta-amylase</b> on sweet corn glycogen and maltoheptaose was studied. Two distinct phases of hydrolysis were evident for both of these substrates. The slow phase of each was comparable in rate to that of <b>beta-amylase</b> on B 5 from panose and B 4 from isomaltose. Evidence was presented which indicated the impracticality of attaining an absolute limit dextrin from a high molecular weight natural molecule such as glycogen or amylopectin...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the levels of the diastatic power enzymes (DPEs) <b>beta-amylase,</b> limit dextrinase, and alpha-amylase has previously been shown to predict barley malt fermentability. Using micromalted samples of barley from different genotypes and growing environments, it was demonstrated that both these factors were important in determining the level of DPEs in malt. In terms of genotypic effects, a trial of breeders’ lines and varieties showed substantial variation in the levels of total <b>beta-amylase</b> (means 455 – 914 U/g), total limit dextrinase (means 268 – 603 U/kg), and alpha-amylase (means 154 – 316 U/g). The application of gibberellin (GA) during malting resulted in substantial increases in the levels of total limit dextrinase and alpha-amylase {{and the extent of}} modification (KI). However, the level of total <b>beta-amylase</b> was relatively unchanged. It was also observed that the levels of total limit dextrinase and alpha-amylase and extent of KI generally were highly correlated (r » 0. 6 – 0. 7), which was attributed to the sensitivity of each of these malt quality factors to GA. The results are discussed in terms of their practical importance to barley breeders and maltsters seeking to supply malt that satisfies the malt fermentability requirements of their brewing customers.

40|$|A {{simplified}} procedure for {{the preparation of}} immobilized <b>beta-amylase</b> using non-purified extract from fresh sweet potato tubers is established in this paper, using differently activated agarose supports. <b>Beta-amylase</b> glutaraldehyde derivative was the preparation with best features, presenting improved temperature and pH stability and activity. The possibility of reusing the amylase was also shown, when this immobilized enzyme was fully active for five cycles of use. However, immobilization decreased enzyme activity to around 15 %. This seems to be mainly due to diffusion limitations of the starch inside the pores of the biocatalyst particles. A fifteen-fold increase in the Km was noticed, while the decrease of Vmax was only 30 % (10. 1 U mg- 1 protein and 7. 03 U mg- 1 protein for free and immobilized preparations, respectively). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} {{study of}} the five soybean <b>beta-amylase</b> X-ray structure reported so far revealed a peculiar conformational transition after substrate (or inhibitor) binding, which affects {{a segment of the}} beta-strand 6 (residues 341 - 343) in the (beta/alpha) 8 molecular scaffold. Backbone distortions that involve considerable changes in the phi and psi angles were observed, as well as two sharp rotamer transitions for the Thr 342 and Cys 343 side chains. These changes caused the outermost CA-layer (at the C-terminal side of the barrel), which is involved in the catalysis, to shrink. Our observations strongly suggest that the 341 FTC 343 residue conformations in the free enzyme are not optimal for protein stability. Furthermore, as a result of conformational transitions in the ligand-binding process, there is a negative enthalpy change for these residues (- 27 and - 34 kcal/mol, after substrate or inhibitor binding, respectively). These findings support the proposed "stability-function" hypothesis for proteins that recognize a ligand (Shoichet BK, Baase WA, Kuroki R, Matthews BW. 1995. A relationship between protein stability and protein function. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92 : 452 - 456). They are also in good agreement with other experimental results in the literature that describe the role of the 341 - 343 segment in <b>beta-amylase</b> activity. Site-directed mutagenesis focused on these residues could be useful for undertaking functional studies of <b>beta-amylase...</b>|$|E
40|$|The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is widely}} used to produce {{biopharmaceutical}} proteins. However, the limited capacity of the secretory pathway may reduce its productivity. Here, we increased the secretion of a heterologous <b>beta-amylase,</b> a model protein used for studying the protein secretory pathway in yeast, by moderately overexpressing SEC 16, which is involved in protein translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The moderate overexpression of SEC 16 increased <b>beta-amylase</b> secretion by generating more endoplasmic reticulum exit sites. The production of reactive oxygen species resulting from the heterologous <b>beta-amylase</b> production was reduced. A genome-wide expression analysis indicated decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress in the strain that moderately overexpressed SEC 16, which was consistent with a decreased volume of the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, fewer mitochondria were observed. Finally, the moderate overexpression of SEC 16 was shown to improve the secretion of two other recombinant proteins, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I and Rhizopus oryzae glucan- 1, 4 -beta-glucosidase, indicating that this mechanism is of general relevance. IMPORTANCE There is an increasing demand for recombinant proteins {{to be used as}} enzymes and pharmaceuticals. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a cell factory that {{is widely used}} to produce recombinant proteins.
