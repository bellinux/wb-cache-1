5|$|Heikkinen's {{interception}} of {{a forward}} pass {{proved to be}} the key break in a 70 win over Penn. He also blocked kicks for points after touchdown in one-point wins over Illinois (76) and Chicago (1312). Without Heikkinen’s <b>big</b> <b>plays</b> against Penn, Illinois and Chicago, the Wolverines likely would have been 152 instead of 44. Even in a 210 loss to Ohio State, Heikkinen blocked two kicks.|$|E
5|$|Following the punt, the {{two teams}} {{continued}} to trade possessions throughout the quarter. Defense dominated, and what few <b>big</b> <b>plays</b> occurred were either neutralized by penalties or stopped by incomplete passes or rushes for no gain. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech punted the ball twice and turned the ball over on downs once. Florida State punted the ball three times and had the ball when time ran out in the quarter. Neither team managed to score, and only twice did either team manage to penetrate into the opponent's territory. At halftime, the score remained tied, 33.|$|E
5|$|Iowa's scoring {{was fueled}} by four plays {{resulting}} in gains of more than 50 yards. Banks also rushed for 99 yards on 19 carries. Michigan's offense {{was fueled by}} the passing of Griese (15 of 26 for 165 yards) and the rushing of Thomas (129 yards on 20 carries) and Howard (81 yards on 13 first-half carries). On defense, Michigan maintained its season-long fourth quarter shutout and had allowed only nine points (on three field goals) {{in the third quarter}} through the first six games. Both defenses also came through with <b>big</b> <b>plays,</b> including a total of six interceptions, three each on Griese and Sherman.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's offense, led by quarterback Sean Glennon, {{began their}} first {{possession}} {{at their own}} 37-yard line. However, a sack, a tackle for loss, and an incomplete pass denied the Hokies' offense positive yardage and {{they were forced to}} punt. Tech punter Brent Bowden managed a 54-yard kick that forced the Eagles to start at their own 14-yard line, but three <b>big</b> <b>plays</b> of 16, 19, and 19yards drove the Eagles deep into Virginia Tech territory. As before, however, Virginia Tech's defense stiffened and Boston College was forced into a fourth down. Instead of attempting a long field goal, the Eagles instead attempted to convert the fourth down but were foiled by an incomplete pass.|$|E
5|$|Bama scored {{first with}} field goals of 49 and 34 yards from Leigh Tiffin {{to take an}} early 6–0 lead.

Following the recovery of a Ryan Williams fumble by Brian Selman deep in Hokie territory, the Tide retook the lead 9–7 on a 32-yard Tiffin field goal. Early in the second quarter, Antoine Hopkins intercepted a Greg McElroy pass. On the ensuing possession, Tech led 10–9 after a successful 28-yard Matt Waldron field goal. Alabama responded by driving 76 {{yards for a touchdown}} and a 16–10 lead, with the <b>big</b> <b>plays</b> coming on a 14-yard run by Mark Ingram, passes of 16 and 10 yards from McElroy to Julio Jones and the score coming on a 19-yard Roy Upchurch run. On the next Virginia Tech possession, three personal fouls and a pass interference penalty carried the Hokies downfield with Williams scoring on a one-yard touchdown run. The score remained 17–16 at the half after Tiffin missed a 36-yard field goal {{at the end of the}} second quarter.|$|E

25|$|The lead in {{this game}} changed several times, and several <b>big</b> <b>plays</b> kept the {{momentum}} swinging. With less than three minutes to go, Colorado took possession of the ball deep in its own territory trailing 31–27. Johnson led the team on a last-ditch drive. With about 40 seconds to go, he completed a pass to Colorado tight end Jon Boman who fell down just yards short of the goal line. Boman slipped due to the poor conditions of the field, which saw the Buffaloes slip on the turf repeatedly throughout the game. This play gave the Buffaloes a first down, but it led to immediate confusion because the Buffs were running a hurry-up offense.|$|E
25|$|With the Connecticut Huskies {{trailing}} by 8 {{points with}} less than 3 minutes to go, {{it looked as if}} the Duke Blue Devils were going to spoil Jim Calhoun's chance at a second national title. Connecticut's All-American center Emeka Okafor was limited to just 22 minutes because of early foul trouble, but he came up clutch with several <b>big</b> <b>plays</b> down the stretch and finished with 18 points and only 3 fouls. By contrast, all three of Duke's centers fouled out, including Shelden Williams, who committed his fifth foul with 3:04 to play. In addition, Duke went without a field goal for the last 4½ minutes until Chris Duhon's meaningless three-pointer at the buzzer. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was denied his 65th NCAA Tournament victory which would have tied him with Dean Smith for the all-time record. He later broke that record.|$|E
25|$|In a {{game that}} was full of <b>big</b> <b>plays,</b> Iowa did just enough to win on Homecoming weekend. Iowa scored three times on special teams, once on a blocked field goal, once on a blocked punt and once on a 51-yard Nate Kaeding field goal. But even a 95-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Brad Banks to Dallas Clark wasn't {{enough to keep the}} Boilermakers from making a comeback. Scoring on two rushing touchdowns in the 4th quarter, Purdue quickly turned a 10-point deficit into a four-point lead. And after Banks was sacked on 4th down with only 2:44 remaining, it seemed as if Purdue would escape with the victory. But the Boilermakers could do nothing with their three downs and had to punt the ball away. Banks wasted no time, running for a 44-yard gain to the Purdue 43 on the first play of the drive. Later, on 4th down from the Purdue seven-yard line, Banks connected with Clark once again, this time for the game-winning touchdown. Purdue had one last chance, but a late interception by Adolphus Shelton secured the Iowa victory.|$|E

25|$|Led by first-year {{head coach}} Gary Andersen, the Badgers entered the {{bowl with a}} nine win, three loss record. Headed into their final game, Wisconsin {{appeared}} on track to appear in a BCS Bowl, perhaps even the Rose Bowl, but after giving up numerous <b>big</b> <b>plays,</b> they were upset by the Penn State Nittany Lions. This ended their hopes of a BCS berth, though {{it turned out to}} be moot as Michigan State beat Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game, assuring Michigan State a trip to the Rose Bowl and virtually ensuring that the Big Ten's other potential BCS berth would go to the previously-ranked #2 Ohio State. Prior to their loss to Penn State, the Badgers had won six consecutive games after starting the season 3–2 with losses to Arizona State and Ohio State. The 2014 edition of the Capital One bowl marked the fourth time in the previous ten seasons that Wisconsin would play in Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium (the game had various names during the span).|$|E
25|$|As Don Imus {{had already}} been the morning show host at WNBC, WFAN left the show in place when they took over the frequency. WFAN's {{original}} morning show on 1050 was hosted by Greg Gumbel. The show was a straightforward sports show, but was not doing well in the ratings. At {{the time of the}} switch, sports talk radio was still an untested format with questionable prospects, and the idea of bringing on board a host that appealed to a broader audience would get more people to try the station out. WFAN also benefitted from the inertia from Imus's fans who were used to tuning into 660kHz on weekday mornings to listen. WFAN instantly took advantage of its Imus inheritance; for example, it featured a special live monologue by Imus character Billy Sol Hargus from Shea Stadium moments after taking over the 660 frequency. Imus slightly altered his show for his new employer, adding sports updates and replays of last night's <b>big</b> <b>plays.</b> Discussions of sports stories that crossed over to general interest were also featured on the program, although Imus also kept many of his regular comedy bits that were not sports-related.|$|E
25|$|Nate Davis {{passed for}} 326yards and four touchdowns, {{but it was}} the Cardinals’ defense that {{repeatedly}} came up with the <b>big</b> <b>plays</b> {{in the second half of}} a 35–23victory over the Midshipmen. Davis passed for 215yards in the first half, including touchdowns of 61yards to Dante Love on the second play of the game and 30yards to Briggs Orsbon late in the second quarter. Love, who tied a school record with his eleventh game of at least 100yards receiving, also rushed for a touchdown and caught a go-ahead 8yard touchdown pass from Davis midway through the third quarter. After Love’s second touchdown catch put Ball State ahead 28–23, Navy threatened to take the lead again late in the third period. Shun White, who set a Navy rushing record with 348yards and three touchdowns in the previous week, was stopped at the 3yard line, and quarterback Jarod Bryant, who ran for Navy’s first two touchdowns, was held for no gain on fourth down, giving the ball back to the Cardinals. Ball State then put the game out of reach with a 97-yard drive, scoring the clinching touchdown on a 35-yard pass from Davis to Darius Hill early in the final period. The game was nationally televised on ESPN and earned a 1.2 Nielsen rating, making it the best regular season national television rating for a Mid-American Conference home game since 2005.|$|E
50|$|A {{scoreless}} 3rd quarter saw the Badgers {{needing a}} <b>big</b> <b>play</b> in the 4th quarter.

After a Fresno State punt, Wisconsin got the <b>big</b> <b>play</b> they needed; RB John Clay broke several tackles and ran 72 {{yards for a touchdown}} to give Wisconsin a 24-21 lead. Fresno, stunned but not yet beaten, rallied and drove late in the 4th quarter for the tying field goal by Kevin Goessling. Wisconsin ran out the remaining clock and the game went to overtime.|$|R
