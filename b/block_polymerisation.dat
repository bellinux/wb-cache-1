Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary emphysema. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin.

40|$|Surface-active {{amphiphilic}} diblock copolymers, Si-EFS 14 and Si-EFS 71, {{consisting of}} a poly(dimethyl siloxane) <b>block</b> (degree of <b>polymerisation</b> 11) and a poly(4 -(triethyleneglycol monomethyl ether) - 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrafluorostyrene) block (average degree of polymerisation 14 and 71) were synthesised by ATRP. Films were prepared by incorporating each copolymer (4 wt%) into a PDMS matrix, which was then condensation cured. Bioassays were performed on the films using two barnacle species, Balanus amphitrite and Balanus improvisus, {{at different stages of}} their life cycles. The cyprids of B. improvisus settled on all test surfaces in higher numbers than those of B. amphitrite. However, the juveniles of B. improvisus were more easily removed from the films containing the copolymer Si-EFS 14 than from those containing the copolymer Si-EFS 71. An XPS analysis revealed that the near-surface region of copolymer Si-EFS 71 was enriched in oxyethylenic chains and became even more populated by these hydrophilic chains after the films were immersed in water...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the capability of}} retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells to phagocytose T lymphocytes and to further analyse the immunobiological consequences of this phagocytosis. METHODS: Human RPE cells pretreated or not by cytochalasin, a phagocytosis inhibitor, were co-cultured with T lymphocytes for different time points. Phagocytosis was investigated by optic microscopy, electron microscopy, and flow cytometry. T cell proliferation was measured by (3) H thymidine incorporation. RPE interleukin 1 beta mRNA expression was quantified by real time PCR. RESULTS: RPE cells phagocytose apoptotic and non-apoptotic T lymphocytes, in a time dependent manner. This is an active process mediated through actin <b>polymerisation,</b> <b>blocked</b> by cytochalasin E treatment. Inhibition of RPE cell phagocytosis capabilities within RPE-T cell co-cultures led to an increase of lectin induced T cell proliferation and an upregulation of interleukin 1 beta mRNA expression in RPE cells. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that T lymphocyte phagocytosis by RPE cells might, by decreasing {{the total number of}} T lymphocytes, removing apoptotic lymphocytes, and downregulating the expression of IL- 1 beta, participate in vivo in the induction and maintenance of the immune privilege of the eye, preventing the development of intraocular inflammation.

40|$|Transition metal {{mediated}} living {{radical polymerisation}} of butyl methacrylate {{has been demonstrated}} with a copper(I) halide N-alkyl- 2 -pyridylmethanimine ligands based catalyst. Optimum conditions {{were found to be}} with copper(I) chloride and N-octyl- 2 -pyridylmethanimine catalyst at 65 degrees C where conversions of 85 % were achieved with polymers of M-n = 8900 g mol(- 1) (theoretical = 8400 g mol(- 1)) and PDI = 1. 23. Both non-ionic and ionic surfactants were employed which were also made by living radical polymerisation. The non-ionic surfactant was a block copolymer of PMMA from a polyethyleneglycol macroinitiator (total M-n = 7600 g mol(- 1), PDI = 1. 20) and the ionic surfactant PDMEAMA-PMMA (total M-n = 8000 g mol(- 1), PDI = 1. 21) with the PDMEAMA block quaternized with MeI (13. 8 % 28. 4 % 47. 7 % and 100 %). A range of ligands were employed in the suspension polymerisation by varying the alkyl group on the ligand increasing the hydrophobicity (alkyl = propyl (PrMI), pentyl (PMI), octyl, (OMI), dodecyl (DMI) and octadecyl (ODMI)). The more hydrophobic ligands were found to be more effective due to lower partitioning into the aqueous phase. Block copolymers of P(EMA) -P(BMA) and P(MMA) -P(BMA) were prepared by first preparing macroinitiators via living radical polymerisation (M-n = 1600 g mol(- 1) (PDI = 1. 23) for P(EMA) and M-n = 1500 g mol(- 1) (PDI = 1. 22) for P(MMA)) and using them for initiation of BMA in suspension <b>polymerisation.</b> <b>Block</b> copolymers had Mn between 12, 800 and 13, 700 g mol(- 1) with PDI between 1. 33 and 1. 54. Block copolymer growth showed excellent linear first order kinetics wrt monomer and demonstrated characteristics expected of a living radical polymerisation. Particle sizes were measured by SEM and DLS with good agreement (1. 4 - 2. 8 mu m) and SEM showed spherical particles were formed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Molecularly {{imprinted}} polymers (MIPs) {{have been}} compared to natural antibodies in that they can specifically bind target compounds {{in a similar way}} that antibodies specifically bind to an antigen. The attraction of the MIPs technology is the ease of creating binding elements which are relatively cheap compared with the process of isolating natural antibodies. In this research monoterpenes, such as α-terpineol, were chosen to be the model compounds for investigating the molecular imprinting of small, poorly functionalised organic compounds. The conventional non-covalent approach was mainly used to synthesise these MIPs, but the sacrificial-spacer semi-covalent approach was also investigated. A less widely used method, porogen-imprinting - a variant of non-covalent imprinting - was adapted for α-terpineol. The latter novel terpene MIP appeared to specifically bind α-terpineol, by hydrogen bonding, so the polymer was characterised in detail. The main parameters which were altered for preparing non-covalent MIPs included the template (α-terpineol, (-) -menthol or trans-terpin); the functional monomer (methacrylic acid, 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate, bilirubin and phenol [for the semi-covalent MIP]); the cross-linking monomer (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, divinylbenzene and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate); and also the <b>polymerisation</b> method (<b>block</b> or precipitation <b>polymerisation).</b> The binding specificity and cross-reactivity for all the polymers were tested using a liquid batch-binding setup. The batch-binding setup required the detection of analyte that was not bound in order to calculate by difference the fraction of analyte bound to the polymer. Initially the terpenes were to be detected by a colorimetric method; however attempts to make the method sensitive and reliable were not successful. In comparison, gas chromatography was more reliable for the detection of terpenes and was used for the experiments presented in this thesis. 1 H-NMR studies of the interaction between α-terpineol and acetic acid (as a non-polymerisable analogue of methacrylic acid) were investigated as a basis for understanding the binding to the carboxyl functional group moiety employed in many of the non-covalent MIPs that were made. The interaction between (-) -menthol and phenol was also investigated because the phenol moiety was employed in the semi-covalent MIP. Only selected MIPs, which appeared to specifically bind the template, were physically characterised. This included optimising the batch-binding parameters, scanning electron microscopy imaging, surface area and pore radius analysis and in some cases Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy of the polymers...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{version of}} {{abstract}} differs slightly (is longer) from print copy version. Although iron deficiency {{is the largest}} nutritional disorder affecting the human population, few food products in daily use are fortified with adequate (25 % of daily requirements per serving) concentrations of iron. The interaction of iron with food components and the consequential deteriorative effects on colour and taste thwart its use as a fortificant of choice. Milk proteins, especially caseins, are a class of metallo-protein which chelate iron and prevent its interaction with food matrix. However, addition of high levels of iron to protein solutions causes precipitation. As iron and calcium bind to similar sites on the proteins in milk, the effect of calcium depletion on the iron-binding properties of the milk proteins was examined. A weakly acidic cation-exchange resin {{was used to remove}} three different levels i. e. 18 ‒ 22, 50 ‒ 55 and 68 – 72 % of calcium from milk, designated as low, medium and high CDM respectively. The depletion of calcium from milk by ion exchange affected its physico-chemical properties, with the extent being highly dependent on the level of calcium depletion. The integrity of the casein micelles was retained at up to ~ 20 % calcium depletion from normal milk, but there was substantial disintegration of the casein micelles at calcium depletion levels of > 50 %. Five levels of iron (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mM) were added to each of these calcium-depleted milks (CDM) and the resultant milks were analysed for particle size, microstructure and the distribution of protein and minerals between the colloidal and soluble phases. The properties of the milks with different calcium contents were variably affected by the addition of iron. In both normal milk and the low CDM, the majority (> 90 %) of the added iron bound to caseins within the casein micelles, minimally affecting the hydrodynamic diameter, ζ-potential and protein distribution. Protein solubility was adversely affected in the medium CDM, whereas most of the protein and the added iron were associated with the non-sedimentable phase in the high CDM. The high concentration (~ 20 mM) of ferric iron in the non-sedimentable phase of the high CDM (~ 70 % calcium depletion) presented a distinct advantage of the calcium depletion process over traditional processes for the iron fortification of milk systems. However, a reduction in aqueous phosphorus, in proportion to added iron, was observed in all milk systems. The addition of orthophosphate prevented aggregation and promoted the formation of small fibrous structure particles in calcium-depleted milk by reducing inter-particle iron bridging. In contrast, added orthophosphate promoted the formation larger unstable aggregates in calcium-depleted milk upon calcium re-addition. The differing effects of added orthophosphate on the iron and calcium-induced aggregation of proteins in calcium-depleted milk were related to the binding characteristic of respective cations. The inclusion of iron in the calcium-restored milk generated substantially smaller aggregates, which were promoted by the addition of orthophosphate. The presence of iron probably <b>blocked</b> the <b>polymerisation</b> pathway required for casein micelle structure formation but not the interaction of calcium with caseins. The effect of orthophosphate addition on the iron-induced aggregation of caseins in sodium caseinate was examined. The binding of iron at greater than equimolar concentration of organic phosphorus on caseins resulted in the precipitation of both the iron and caseins. In the presence of orthophosphate, however, higher concentrations of iron could be added to sodium caseinate solution (~ 6. 9 % by weight of casein) with little sedimentation of protein. The presence of orthophosphate prevented iron-induced casein precipitation in sodium caseinate solutions and also improved the solubility of iron. The formation of small aggregates upon iron addition to sodium caseinate solution containing orthophosphate was responsible for the high solubility of casein-iron complexes. The 31 P-NMR study, SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography analysis of the soluble casein-iron complexes revealed that a cluster of inorganic ferric phosphate was stabilised by caseins. The concentration of iron bound by caseins in the soluble form was at least 5 to 10 times higher than in previous studies, thus creating an opportunity to develop an iron ingredient for food fortification. The effect of exchanging the sequence of adding iron and orthophosphate to sodium caseinate solutions was examined. Surprisingly, the casein-iron precipitates (formed upon > 5 mM iron addition to sodium caseinate solutions) were redispersed upon orthophosphate addition. The added orthophosphate adsorbed onto the casein-iron precipitate. This adsorption displaced a part of the organic phosphorus (contributed by caseins) bound to iron and increased the surface negative charge on the casein-iron precipitate, which probably led to the redispersion of caseins and iron. The adsorption of orthophosphate occured on ferric hydroxide formed in the absence of casein, but does not solubilise iron, suggesting that the presence of caseins was critical for redispersion of the precipitate. Precipitate with higher protein content could redisperse greater concentrations of iron, while requiring lower orthophosphate content. Optimally four moles of iron could be solubilised by one mole of casein in these experiments. The adsorption of orthophosphate onto protein-iron complexes and its consequent solubilisation is a novel finding with a potential to create a new iron fortificant. Overall, this research highlights the important role that orthophosphate plays in the binding of iron to milk proteins. The soluble protein‒iron complexes created in this work could be used to fortify liquid food products. Moreover, two processes involving entirely different mechanisms for the formation of soluble protein‒iron complexes have been proposed, which has opened up a number of avenues for further research. The products and processes as an outcome of this research are protected by a patent, namely “Micronutrient fortification process and its usage”, issued by the New Zealand Patent Office on 24 June 2014...|$|R
