5|$|Children's {{entertainment}} is centred on play and is significant for their growth and learning. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> and many activities {{that appeal to}} them such as puppets, clowns, pantomimes and cartoons are also enjoyed <b>by</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ng {{notes that}} her children's {{stories have been}} {{generally}} well received. However, some educators disagree {{with the lack of}} an explicit moral message; Ng argues that her books have multiple interpretations: those by children and those <b>by</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some species make a {{hissing noise}} while other {{cockroaches}} make a chirping noise. The Madagascar hissing cockroach produces its sound through the modified spiracles {{on the fourth}} abdominal segment. Several different hisses are produced, including disturbance sounds, produced <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> and larger nymphs, and aggressive, courtship and copulatory sounds produced by adult males.|$|E

5|$|In the 1995 {{compilation}} Children and the Politics of Culture, anthropologist Vivienne Wee {{analyzed the}} perception of children <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> and how it supported the concept of children's rights. Wee wrote that in this model (which she called the European pattern), children were seen as defenseless, unadulterated, {{and in need of}} protection by authoritative adults. According to Wee, this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the United Nations Charter and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.|$|E
5|$|In {{the distant}} future, deadly solar flares force {{humanity}} to evacuate Earth on giant, nationalistic colony ships. The Doctor and Amy arrive on Starship UK, {{one of the}} last ships to leave and holding the population of the United Kingdom. Amy tends to a crying young girl ignored <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> while the Doctor, curious to the ship's engines, seeks the control room. He finds the room to be a false front, and encounters Liz 10, who seems to know him.|$|E
5|$|Lead affects {{every one}} of the body's organ systems, {{especially}} the nervous system, but also the bones and teeth, the kidneys, and the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems. Hearing loss and tooth decay have been linked to lead exposure, as have cataracts. Intrauterine and neonatal lead exposure promote tooth decay. Aside from the developmental effects unique to young children, the health effects experienced <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> are similar to those in children, although the thresholds are generally higher.|$|E

5|$|Plain milk was not {{consumed}} <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> {{except the}} poor or sick, being {{reserved for the}} very young or elderly, and then usually as buttermilk or whey. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack}} of technology to keep it from spoiling. Tea and coffee, both made from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages. However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The White Stag Leadership Development Program's methods {{address all}} of the areas the studies identified. Mentored and coached <b>by</b> <b>adults,</b> the youth staff develop, plan and {{implement}} the week-long summer camp programs. They develop skills in research, writing, planning, and evaluation. Using the outdoors, they practice learning activities, games, and outdoor skills required {{to live in a}} camping environment. They learn to get along with and other counsel youth from different backgrounds. They study eleven specific skills of leadership and practice presenting them to one another before summer camp, when they present these learning sessions to the participants. The youth, led and mentored <b>by</b> <b>adults,</b> work together with other youth they have never met, forming new relationships and learning to connect and cooperate. They learn basic group membership skills required in work life, like communication and planning, and plan and implement their leadership skills in their home community. They learn and practice problem-solving and counseling skills, how groups form and grow, and planning skills. They learn and rehearse various kinds of communications skills, how to represent their group—both with and without the group's input—and how to work effectively with others.|$|E
5|$|The bat is a hitting tool, {{traditionally}} {{made of a}} single, solid {{piece of}} wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> are typically around 34inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42inches (106 centimeters).|$|E

5|$|The female {{does not}} sing, but when on the wing, both sexes give a short cuick, cuick call, also used when chasing predators. Other calls include {{variations}} on a sharp chuck when alarmed, hisses given <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> when handled or chicks when disturbed, {{and an assortment of}} wuk, wuk, wuk, muffled oak, oak and murmurs given at the nest. Large young have a threat display with the mouth opened wide while hissing loudly.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a {{gold medal}} in the 9to11year-olds {{category}} of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. The Smarties award, which is voted for by children, made the book well-known within six months of publication, while most children's books have to wait for years. The following year, Philosopher's Stone won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children. It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated <b>by</b> <b>adults,</b> but did not win. Sandra Beckett comments that books which were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards– for example the literary establishment disdained the works of Roald Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the cast changes, the tone and pacing of the films was also matured and altered for comic effect. The films changed the petty crimes of the books into gruesome murders, that are often spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At {{the time of the}} films, Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance in the books was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend usually duped into another scheme. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults, Nancy in the films was often chastised <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> for her habit to go into mysteries, and she often found herself at odds with her father and the police.|$|E
5|$|Milk was an {{important}} source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh milk was not consumed <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack of}} technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead.|$|E
5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E

5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Pony and Cob is a {{group of}} four closelyrelated horse breeds {{including}} both pony and cob types, which originated in Wales in the United Kingdom. The four sections within the breed society for the Welsh breeds are primarily distinguished by height, and also by variations in type: the smallest Welsh Mountain Pony (Section A); the slightly taller but refined Welsh Pony of riding type (Section B) popular as a children's show mount; the small but stocky Welsh Pony of Cob Type (Section C), popular for riding and competitive driving; and the tallest, the Welsh Cob (Section D), which can be ridden <b>by</b> <b>adults.</b> Welsh ponies and cobs in all sections are known for their good temperament, hardiness, and free-moving gaits.|$|E
5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate <b>by</b> <b>adults</b> (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E
