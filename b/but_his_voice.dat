500|$|More {{than one}} hundred actors auditioned for the role, but only ten were taken seriously by the producers. Known actors such as Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees for the role as Agent Doggett. Both Phillips and Bochner were {{considered}} for the role, but the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. In an interview with, Chris Carter said [...] "I think {{it was something that}} we all talked about, but I wrote his voice. So, I think he was someone we all came up with together, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> came out of my head. But, it was something that was helped in a large degree by casting Robert Patrick." ...|$|E
500|$|Sinn Sisamouth (1932-1976) was a {{prolific}} singer-songwriter with a crooning voice {{that has been}} likened to that of Nat King Cole. He got his start singing on the radio while in medical school in his early 20s, and {{was admitted to the}} Royal Treasury's classical ensemble, with whom he performed at state functions. By the late-1950s and early-1960s {{he was one of the}} most popular musicians in the country. As a solo artist in the 1960s he performed with a rock band rather than traditional wind instrument backing, experimenting with combining Khmer music with Western sounds. Sometimes called the [...] "King of Khmer music", the Cambodian Elvis", or the [...] "golden voice", his lasting cultural impact is difficult to overstate. He was killed by execution squad during the genocide in 1976, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> remains one of the country's most recognizable.|$|E
500|$|At 08:24:38, Atta {{tried to}} make an {{announcement}} to the passengers, but pressed the wrong button and sent the message to Boston ARTCC. Air traffic controllers heard Atta announce, [...] "We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you'll be O.K. We are returning to the airport." [...] At 08:24:56, he announced [...] "Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If {{you try to make}} any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet." [...] As before, Atta thought he was speaking to only the passengers, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was picked up and recorded by air traffic controllers. After the transmissions by Atta and the inability to contact the airliner, air traffic controllers at Boston ARTCC realized the flight had been hijacked. At 08:26, the plane turned south. At 08:32, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, notified FAA headquarters.|$|E

60|$|The ruffian gasped, coughed, choked, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> blaspheming <b>voice</b> {{died away}} in a suffocating hiccough.|$|R

500|$|Many {{familiar}} voices {{inspired the}} animators in their {{creation of the}} characters and helped them shape their personalities. This use of familiar voices for key characters was a rarity in Disney's past films. The staff was shocked to hear that a wise cracking comedian, Phil Harris {{was going to be}} in a Kipling film. Disney suggested Harris after meeting him at a party. Harris improvised most of his lines, as he considered the scripted lines [...] "didn't feel natural". After Harris was cast, Disneyland Records president Jimmy Johnson suggested Disney to get Louis Prima as King Louie, as he [...] "felt that Louis would be great as foil". Walt also cast other prominent actors such as George Sanders as Shere Khan and Sebastian Cabot as Bagheera. Additionally, he cast regular Disney voices such as Sterling Holloway as Kaa, J. Pat O'Malley as Colonel Hathi and Buzzie the Vulture and Verna Felton as Hathi's wife. This was her last film before she died. David Bailey was originally cast as Mowgli, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> changed during production, leading Bailey to not fit the [...] "young innocence of Mowgli's character" [...] at which the producers were aiming. Thus director Wolfgang Reitherman cast his son Bruce, who had just voiced Christopher Robin in Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree. The animators shot footage of Bruce as a guide for the character's performance. Child actress Darlene Carr was going around singing in the studio when composers Sherman Brothers asked her to record a demo of [...] "My Own Home". Carr's performance impressed Disney enough for him to cast her as the role of the human girl.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} Mel Gibson {{as a guest}} voice. Scully {{had previously}} met him while writing jokes for a school fundraiser {{along with his wife}} Julie Thacker. Gibson and Daniel Stern were the hosts and needed jokes for the event. It turned out that Gibson was a fan of the show and watched it with his children. With that knowledge, it did not take Scully long to invite him to do a part. Gibson was willing to do the job and even came in on three separate occasions to do retakes – mostly because he knew his children would be watching. Unlike most guest voices, Gibson recorded the show along with the cast. On one occasion, it turned out that a joke written for Gibson actually did happen in real life. The writing staff wanted Gibson to say that he would urinate behind a dumpster, because it sounded like {{it would not be a}} classy thing to do for a movie star. He had, however, already done that during a couple of film premieres because he can feel trapped in a public toilet with a lot of fans. Gibson was surprised the writers knew about the story, but it turned out to be a coincidence. Otherwise, the episode frequently references films Gibson appeared in. After the studio cart crashes, Gibson says to Homer, [...] "I'm getting too old for this crap," [...] a reference to a line said by Danny Glover's character Roger Murtaugh to Gibson's character Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon film series. A poster for his film Braveheart is on the wall in the editing room and the Road Warrior car from the 1981 film Mad Max 2 is also featured. In addition to Gibson, Jack Burns guest starred in the episode, voicing a film studio executive named Edward Christian. His frequent use of the terms [...] "Huh?" [...] and [...] "You know what I mean?" [...] is a reference to a comedy routine performed by Burns and Avery Schreiber. The episode also features John Travolta, in whose private jet Gibson flies to Springfield, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was imitated by Dan Castellaneta.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} honorable {{discharge}} from the Army, Paxton auditioned for the Chad Mitchell Trio via publisher Milt Okun in 1960. [...] He initially received the part, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> did not blend well enough {{with those of the}} group members. However, after singing his song [...] "The Marvelous Toy" [...] for Okun, he became the first writer signed to Milt's music publishing company, Cherry Lane Music Publishing.|$|E
6000|$|... “This is tragic!” Felicia Moorsom whispered with feeling. Renouard’s lips twitched, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> level <b>voice</b> {{continued}} mercilessly.|$|R
60|$|He spoke {{somewhat}} like his former self for a moment, <b>but</b> soon <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> sank, for the life-blood was draining fast away.|$|R
60|$|Hutter did {{not take}} any steps, however, to {{ascertain}} whether he was obeyed or not; <b>but</b> dropping <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> a little, he pursued the discourse.|$|R
2500|$|The {{journalist}} David Halberstam {{wrote of}} Stevenson that [...] "he {{had played a}} historic role for his party, twice its presidential candidate, the first time running against impossible odds in 1952, {{at the height of}} the Korean War and McCarthyism, with the [...] party already decaying from the scandals of twenty years in power. Running against the great hero of the era, Dwight Eisenhower, Stevenson had lost, of course, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> had seemed special in that moment, a voice of rationality and elegance. In the process of defeat he had helped to salvage the party, giving it a new vitality and bringing to its fold a whole new generation of educated Americans, volunteers now in the political process, some very professional amateurs who would be masterly used by the Kennedys in 1960. If John and Robert Kennedy seemed to symbolize style in politics, much of that was derived directly from Stevenson. He had, at what should have been a particularly low point for the party, managed to keep it vibrant and vital, and to involve a new kind of people in politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard was {{bolstered by}} winning the Eisteddfod Prize and wanted to repeat his success. He chose to sing Sir Arthur Sullivan's [...] "Orpheus with his Lute" [...] (1866), which biographer Alpert thought [...] "a {{difficult}} composition". He requested {{the help of his}} schoolmaster, Philip Burton, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> cracked during their practice sessions. This incident marked the beginning of his association with Philip. Philip later recalled, [...] "His voice was tough to begin with but with constant practice it became memorably beautiful." [...] Richard made his first foray into theatre with a minor role in his school's production of the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw's The Apple Cart. He decided to leave school by the end of 1941 and work as a miner as Elfed was not fit for work due to illness. He worked for the local wartime Co-operative committee, handing out supplies in exchange for coupons. He also simultaneously considered other professions for his future, including boxing, religion and singing. It was also during this period that Richard took up smoking and drinking despite being underage.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is incredible," [...] said Bertram, [...] "incredible, incredible!" [...] <b>But,</b> nevertheless, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> showed plainly {{enough that}} the {{statement}} to him was not incredible.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{probably}} only from William, {{to say the}} ship is signalled," [...] said the Colonel, to quieten her; <b>but</b> <b>his</b> own <b>voice</b> trembled with anxiety.|$|R

60|$|The boatsmen thanked him, and Zackey {{was ordered}} off to fetch {{a jug of}} water; <b>but</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>voice</b> arrested him before he had gone a hundred yards.|$|R
60|$|He had {{endeavored}} to speak carelessly, <b>but</b> something in <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> betrayed him and Jernyngham laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes; <b>but</b> before <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> failed he {{was always}} cryin' out for the priest. He's a Catholic, sir, though I'm not wan meself and thinks he can't be saved unless he sees the priest." ...|$|R
60|$|Lister smiled, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> betrayed him, {{although}} {{he thought he}} used control.|$|E
60|$|He {{was a big}} man, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{seemed to}} have grown very small indeed.|$|E
60|$|His {{face was}} in shadow, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{answered}} for him. The man was Benjulia.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Mr. Gladman stood aghast at the other's coolness, <b>but</b> soon found <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Damn Snagsby!" [...] hissed Sir Isaac, <b>but</b> {{dropping}} <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{and drawing}} near to her. What <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> lost in height it gained in intensity. [...] "What I say is this, Ella, you oughtn't to have brought that old woman {{out into the}} garden at all----" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was some}} time later when the dory struck the side, and Moran clambered on board and entered the cabin. Jimmy could not see <b>his</b> face, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> gruff <b>voice</b> had an unusual tone.|$|R

50|$|The game marked Pierce Brosnan's fourth {{appearance}} as James Bond before {{the release of}} his fourth and final Bond film Die Another Day. His likeness was featured in the game, <b>but</b> not <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> which was provided by Maxwell Caulfield.|$|R
60|$|He {{had said}} {{so much with}} an {{infinite}} sadness, and I read a response {{in the eyes of}} more than one of his listeners, the guidwife weeping aloud. <b>But</b> now <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> rose, and he ended with a fiery vigour.|$|R
5000|$|Blagoj Nacoski as Ferrando. I’ve {{never heard}} of him before, but when he first opened his mouth, I was mesmerized. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> is so {{beautiful}} and creamy, it reminds me of whipped mascarpone. Although he sometimes was overshadowed by Drole’s energetic and passionate acting, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> gorgeous <b>voice</b> put him right back into the spotlight again. (FHL, 02.02.2006) ...|$|R
