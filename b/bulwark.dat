5|$|Defence {{spending}} {{had been}} heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets. By 1935, {{faced with a}} resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership (see German re-armament), he was convinced {{of the need for}} rearmament. Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force, realising that Britain's historical <b>bulwark,</b> the English Channel, was no defence against air power.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand was an {{advocate}} of increased federalism and widely believed to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom {{could have been a}} <b>bulwark</b> against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand was therefore perceived as a threat by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms was one of his motivations.|$|E

This trough is termed the hammock-nettings, and the hammocks are placed there to be well aired. In action the <b>bulwarks</b> serve to protect the crew from musketry.|$|R

5|$|Anderitum {{fell into}} ruin {{following}} {{the end of}} the Roman occupation but was reoccupied in 1066 by the Normans, for whom it became a key strategic <b>bulwark.</b> A stone keep and fortification was built within the Roman walls and faced several sieges. Although its garrison was twice starved into surrender, it was never successfully stormed. The castle was occupied more or less continuously until the 16th century, apart from a possible break in the early 13th century when it was slighted. It had been abandoned again by the late 16th century and remained a crumbling, partly overgrown ruin until it was acquired by the state in 1925.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the first millennium, the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, which led to the {{emergence}} of distinctive Kannada literary metres, and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture. The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, Hosapattana (later named Vijayanagara), {{on the banks of the}} Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. The empire rose as a <b>bulwark</b> against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries {{the castle}} {{continued}} to be maintained and modified; the seaward half of the castle {{was turned into a}} solid gun platform and additional accommodation was built for the fort's gunners. A <b>bulwark</b> was built {{on the east side of}} the castle and an additional gun battery was placed on the town's quay, just to the west. For most of the English Civil War of the 1640s it was held by Parliament; following the Restoration, it was refortified by Charles II in the 1670s.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{moved back}} onto the {{offensive}} in Europe in 1543, allying himself with Spain against France once again. Despite Henry's initial successes around Boulogne in northern France, King Charles and Francis made peace in 1544, leaving England exposed to an invasion by France, backed by her allies in Scotland. In response Henry issued another device in 1544 to improve the country's defences, particularly along the south coast. Work began on Southsea Castle in 1544 on Portsea Island to further protect the Solent, and on Sandown Castle the following year on the neighbouring Isle of Wight. Brownsea Castle in Dorset was begun in 1545, and Sharpenrode <b>Bulwark</b> was built opposite Hurst Castle from 1545 onwards.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to some strengthening, there were alterations {{to the air}} intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an inflatable lip to smooth the intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of these devices, so they were replaced with conventional suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS <b>Bulwark</b> in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The Kestrel became the prototype for pre-production Harriers.|$|E
5|$|Kapuli Pasha's successor, Kurshid Pasha, resumed the anti-Bedouin {{operations}} in Galilee in 1864 {{and sought to}} establish in the eastern Galilee four heavily armed forts as a <b>bulwark</b> against further raiding. Aqil entered into a conflict with the governor of Nablus {{and member of the}} Abd al-Hadi family, who tried to arrest Aqil. Kurshid Pasha dismissed Aqil {{by the end of the}} year. Fearing his arrest or death in light of the Ottomans' subsequent deployment of 200 Kurdish irregulars to Tiberias and the presence of military forces from Acre and Beirut in western Galilee, Aqil fled to Salt in the Balqa area of Transjordan.|$|E
5|$|When the {{requirement}} for the Apache had been formalised in the early 1990s, military doctrine assumed that a large conventional armoured assault from the Eastern Bloc was Britain's main threat. Following the collapse and break-up of the Soviet Union, the concepts of flexibility and rapid response took precedence. The UK's Strategic Defence Review called for Apaches to undertake amphibious attack missions, operating from the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, the Invincible class aircraft carriers and their successors, the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, and possibly the amphibious assault vessels HMS <b>Bulwark</b> and Albion. Each squadron equipped with the Apache should have eight operational aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{break with}} Rome {{incurred}} {{the threat of}} a large-scale French or Spanish invasion. To guard against this, in 1538, he began to build a chain of expensive, state-of-the-art defences, along Britain's southern and eastern coasts from Kent to Cornwall, largely built of material gained from the demolition of the monasteries. These were known as Henry VIII's Device Forts. He also strengthened existing coastal defence fortresses such as Dover Castle and, at Dover, Moat <b>Bulwark</b> and Archcliffe Fort, which he personally visited for a few months to supervise. Wolsey had many years before conducted the censuses required for an overhaul of the system of militia, but no reform resulted. In 1538–39, Cromwell overhauled the shire musters, but his work mainly served to demonstrate how inadequate they were in organisation. The building works, including that at Berwick, along with the reform of the militias and musters, were eventually finished under Queen Mary.|$|E
5|$|In 1250 or 1251, Mindaugas {{agreed to}} receive baptism and {{relinquish}} control over some lands in western Lithuania, {{in return for}} an acknowledgment by Pope Innocent IV as king. The Pope welcomed a Christian Lithuania as a <b>bulwark</b> against Mongol threats; in turn, Mindaugas sought papal intervention in the ongoing Lithuanian conflicts with the Christian orders. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the Holy See, {{rather than to the}} Archbishop of Riga. This autonomy was a welcome development. The precise date of Mindaugas's baptism is not known. His wife, two sons, and members of his court were baptized; Pope Innocent wrote later that a multitude of Mindaugas's subjects also received Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In 1264, the Mamluk sultan Baybars (r. 1260–1277) {{replaced}} the Ayyubid governor of al-Rahba {{with one of}} his mamluk officers from Egypt. Al-Rahba's garrison and its commander held a high place in the Mamluk military hierarchy. The fortress, along with and al-Bira to the north, emerged as the principal Mamluk <b>bulwark</b> against Mongol invasions of Syria's eastern frontier. It was the Mamluks' most important fortress along the Euphrates, supplanting Raqqa, which had been the traditional Muslim center in the Euphrates valley since the 10th century. A large population of refugees from areas ruled by the Mongols settled in al-Rahba as did many people from the adjacent, unfortified town of Mashhad al-Rahba (former site of Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk, modern-day Mayadin). It was also the terminal stop of the Mamluk barid (postal route) and an administrative center.|$|E

She departed Portsmouth on 24 March 1897, and arrived at Malta on 5 April. Royal Oak was relieved by the battleship <b>Bulwark</b> and departed the Mediterranean in May 1902. She arrived at Plymouth on 16 May, and at Portsmouth the following day, and paid off there on 6 June 1902. She soon moved to Chatham Dockyard for a refit, during which casemates were provided for her six-inch upper deck guns. On 16 February 1903, Royal Oak recommissioned at Portsmouth for service in the Home Fleet using part of the battleship Nile's crew as a nucleus. In the summer of 1903, she participated in combined exercises in the Atlantic involving the Home Fleet, Mediterranean, and Channel Fleets, {{as well as the}} Cruiser Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Tilbury Fort, {{also known}} {{historically}} as the Thermitage <b>Bulwark</b> and the West Tilbury Blockhouse, is an artillery fort {{on the north}} bank of the River Thames in England. The earliest version of the fort, comprising a small blockhouse with artillery covering the river, was constructed by King Henry VIII to protect London against attack from France {{as part of his}} Device programme. It was reinforced during the 1588 Spanish Armada invasion scare, after which it was reinforced with earthwork bastion, and Parliamentary forces used it to help secure the capital during the English Civil War of the 1640s. Following naval raids during the Anglo-Dutch Wars, the fort was enlarged by Sir Bernard de Gomme from 1670 onwards to form a star-shaped defensive work, with angular bastions, water-filled moats and two lines of guns facing onto the river.|$|E

This move had a huge impact on Muslims throughout the world as the Ottoman Sultan was revered as the Caliph of Islam and long considered by Indian Muslims as the final <b>bulwark</b> of Muslim power following the collapse of the Moghul empire in India. Overnight, Muslims serving under the British Army, such as the sepoys, faced an existential dilemma and their loyalty being torn between their ummah (community, brotherhood) and their British colonial superiors.|$|E
