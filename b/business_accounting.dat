25|$|Information Assurance (IA) is {{the process}} of getting the right {{information}} to the right people at the right time. IA adds business benefit through the use of Information Risk Management, Trust Management, Resilience, appropriate Architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized. It is strongly related to the field of information security, and also with business continuity. IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious hackers and code (e.g., viruses), IA practitioners consider corporate governance issues such as privacy, regulatory and standards compliance, auditing, business continuity, and disaster recovery as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in <b>business,</b> <b>accounting,</b> user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, security engineering, and criminology, in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of Information Risk Management.|$|E
500|$|Weber, {{like his}} {{colleague}} Werner Sombart, regarded economic calculation {{and especially the}} double-entry bookkeeping method of <b>business</b> <b>accounting,</b> {{as one of the}} most important forms of rationalisation associated with the development of modern capitalism. Weber's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to develop a critique of socialism as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently in order to satisfy human needs. Socialist intellectuals like Otto Neurath had realised that in a completely socialised economy, prices would not exist and central planners would have to resort to in-kind (rather than monetary) economic calculation. According to Weber, this type of coordination would be inefficient, especially because it would be incapable of solving the problem of imputation (i.e. of accurately determining the relative values of capital goods). Weber wrote that, under full socialism, ...|$|E

Shortly after the 1972 United States Presidential election, the Michigan Youth Politics Institute {{moved out of the}} space across the hall, and Elderly took over the entire basement of the building. [...] In 1975, it expanded into the mail order business. By 1982, Elderly Instruments had about 25employees but little available space, and so in the following year the owners bought an Independent Order of Odd Fellows building in Lansing, Michigan. After it was renovated for retail use, the company moved into it in January 1984, and in 1986 Werbin bought out McInturff to become the sole owner. In 1994, Elderly expanded again by buying adjacent building space that had once been a post office and a National Cash Register Company building. Around the same time, it began taking merchandise orders over its new web site. The company does not, however, sell merchandise through online auction sites such as eBay, unlike many other independent musical instrument retailers. Werbin notes that entering the Internet business was not much of a challenge for Elderly, as the staff was already experienced at taking and shipping orders for customers throughout the world. He also notes that, with its mail order and Internet <b>business</b> <b>accounting</b> for 6570 percent of its total revenue, Elderly would have experienced limited growth in Lansing had it not expanded into those markets.

Efforts to promote socialist transformation were to continue, but at a gradual pace and [...] "by appropriate forms." [...] Development aid continued to come primarily from the former Soviet Union and other Communist countries. [...] In 1978, Vietnam became fully integrated into the Communist world planning and development structure, and its five-year plans were coordinated with those of its Communist partners. Planned Soviet outlays for the 1986–90 period totaled some $11–13 billion. This aid and trade waned with {{the decline of the}} USSR, with the full cutoff occurring in 1991. [...] The country's new economic emphasis, Doi Moi, was instituted by Nguyễn Văn Linh following the sixth national party congress in 1986. [...] His plan included policy and structural reforms for a market-based economic system: price decontrol (liberalized prices), currency devaluation, private sector expansion by de-collectivizing agriculture, legal recognition of private business, new foreign investment laws, autonomy of state enterprises, <b>business</b> <b>accounting</b> methods, devolution of government decision-making in industry to enterprise level, and limiting government participation to macroeconomic issues.

2500|$|Farmland's founder, Howard A. Cowden, {{was born}} in 1893 on a southwestern Missouri farm settled by his grandfather. [...] Unlike other farms in his native Polk County, which {{averaged}} less than 100 acres in size, the Cowden farm at 500 acres {{was one of the}} largest. [...] Cowden believed strongly that farmers were at an economic disadvantage in the marketplace: they faced high interest rates on mortgages, paid high transportation costs, and had virtually no leverage in the pricing of their commodities. [...] He believed that farmers were faced with a [...] "take-it-or-leave-it" [...] proposition. [...] Cowden became active in the organization of agricultural cooperatives and in 1929 formed a new firm, Union Oil Company, which he organized as a cooperative under Missouri statutes. [...] Since Union Oil was intended as a regional enterprise, Cowden elected to establish headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. [...] By the end of its first year of operation, Union Oil served 22 local cooperatives and was supplied by Kanotex Corporation. [...] Union Oil became the first cooperative in the country to run an oil-compounding plant. [...] With the organization becoming involved {{in a wide range of}} products, it was decided in February 1935 to change the name to [...] "Consumers Cooperative Association" [...] (CCA). [...] CCA had 259 local cooperatives as members and was generating more than $2 million in annual revenues. [...] CCA established a grocery division in 1935 and soon the CO-OP label was applied to over 200 products. [...] To support its petroleum business, CCA built a refinery in Phillipsburg, Kansas. [...] When it became operational in 1939, the facility greatly increased the organization's income and led to a period of prosperity during the 1940s. [...] CCA became involved in a variety of other areas, including the production of flour and feed, the manufacture of household and electrical appliances, and the development of insurance and finance associations. [...] Of particular importance was the feed program, which in its first year generated more revenue than the grocery business did in its tenth year. [...] Another highly profitable business for CAA was fertilizer, which farmers began to use at an accelerated rate. [...] By 1958, CCA topped $100 million in annual revenues, ranked 327th among the Fortune 500, and was one of the largest cooperatives in America. [...] In many ways it was considered an industrial powerhouse, controlling a wide range of assets: oil wells, pipelines, refineries, grease and paint factories, feed mills, fertilizer works, warehouses, and a fleet of trucks. [...] Petroleum products continued to dominate the cooperative's <b>business,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 70 percent of revenues, but that percentage would dip below 50 percent over the next few years as fertilizer became an increasingly more important revenue stream. [...] The emphasis of CCA turned to the farm supply and service field, making the use of the word [...] "consumer" [...] in its title less appropriate. [...] The organization also faced mounting pressure to better serve farmers by engaging in the marketing of agricultural products, an area which CCA had intentionally avoided. [...] In 1958, the CCA Board agreed to become involved in marketing as opportunities might arise. [...] A year later the cooperative purchased the Crawford County Packing Company in Denison, Iowa, and entered the pork processing business, ultimately acquiring food manufacturing facilities throughout the Midwest. [...] During the course of developing its food processing capability, the cooperative sought to improve operating efficiencies, marketing strategies and the relationship with facility employees.|$|E
