5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E
5|$|Daara J, {{formed in}} 1997, was {{originally}} a trio {{that consisted of}} Faada Freddy, N'Dongo D and Lord Alajiiman. Lord Alajiiman performed and toured throughout {{the world with the}} group until 2008 when the group split. Since then, Alajiman evolves in a solo career while contributing {{to the development of the}} music sector in Senegal. Daara J was formed when all of its members were in high school, where they were studying accounting. The rappers were influenced by American hip hop artists such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa but also listened to their parents' music, which included artists such as Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, and musical styles which included Cuban music. Faada Freddy cites the group's major inspiration as Das EFX. Originally, the members took instrumentals of hip hop tracks from the United States and France to rap over. Later they purchased a drum machine, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> this equipment, a member of the group would have to imitate the other instruments in the song with his voice. Positive Black Soul, another Senegalese rap group, encouraged Daara J to record and perform.|$|E

25|$|Playing {{styles of}} {{individual}} bassoonists vary greatly; because of this, most advanced players {{will make their}} own reeds, in the process customizing them to their individual playing requirements.

25|$|Growth {{was slow}} (3%) in 2001 {{due to a}} {{combination}} of factors (a global recession, a series of bank failures, low coffee prices, and a drought), and in 2009 the economy actually contracted 1.5% in reaction to the 2008–2012 global recession). <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> the recessions, growth has averaged 3.4% between 2001 and 2011 (again, based on World Bank figures).|$|E

25|$|The WASPs were {{employed}} under the Civil Service program.

25|$|Black powder {{was also}} {{extensively}} used in railway construction. At first railways followed {{the contours of}} the land, or crossed low ground by means of bridges and viaducts, but later railways made extensive use of cuttings and tunnels. One 2400-ft stretch of the 5.4mi Box Tunnel on the Great Western Railway line between London and Bristol consumed a ton of gunpowder per week for over two years. The 12.9km long Mont Cenis Tunnel was completed in 13 years starting in 1857 <b>but,</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> black powder, progress was only 25cm a day until the invention of pneumatic drills sped up the work.|$|E
25|$|Later that week, the NDP, who had {{initially}} opposed the budget, opted to endorse Martin's {{proposal for a}} later election. The Liberals agreed to take corporate tax cuts out of the budget on April 26 in exchange for NDP support on votes of confidence, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> NDP support the Liberals still fell three votes short of a majority. However, a surprise defection of former Conservative leadership candidate Belinda Stronach to the Liberal party on May 17 changed {{the balance of power}} in the House.

25|$|Expansion {{continued}} into the third century AD, pushing the borders of viticulture beyond {{the areas of the}} holm oak to places such as Bordeaux in Aquitania and Burgundy, where the more marginal climate included wet, cold summers that might not produce a harvest each year. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> the risk of an occasional lost harvest, the continuing demand for wine among the Roman and native inhabitants of Gaul made the proposition of viticulture a lucrative endeavor. By the 6th century AD, vines were planted throughout Gaul including the Loire Valley, the Île-de-France (Paris Basin) which included the areas of modern-day Champagne, as well as Brittany.|$|E

25|$|When {{the monarchy}} was {{restored}} in 1660, theatres re-opened. Early {{interpretations of the}} play, from the late 17th to early 18th century, typically showed Prince Hamlet as a heroic figure. Critics responded to Hamlet {{in terms of the}} same dichotomy that shaped all responses to Shakespeare during the period. On the one hand, Shakespeare was seen as primitive and untutored, both in comparison to later English dramatists such as Fletcher and especially when measured against the neoclassical ideals of art brought back from France with the Restoration. On the other, Shakespeare remained popular not just with mass audiences <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> the very critics made uncomfortable by his ignorance of Aristotle's unities and decorum.|$|E
25|$|The club {{planned to}} bounce {{straight}} {{back in the}} 1912–13 season, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> a team of strong new players the team could only finish fifth. The formation of the Luton Town Supporters Club, who raised £60 during the season, helped the club to stem the financial losses. In 1914 the side finished second and were promoted back to the First Division, just as the First World War was about to begin. The 1914–15 season was the last complete season before competitive sport was mostly abandoned. Most war-time games were friendlies, but while Luton competed in the London Combination, Ernie Simms, who had been wounded during the war, achieved the feat of scoring 40 goals during 1916–17.|$|E

25|$|Mexican Central Authority {{officials}} {{discuss the}} Convention with the judiciary and attorneys, monitor proceedings, {{and provide the}} U.S. Embassy with updates on active case processing. However, the Mexican government dedicates limited resources to the Mexican Central Authority, including insufficient staff to handle the volume of cases.

U.S. Embassy officials meet monthly with Mexican Central Authority personnel to obtain updates on pending cases <b>but,</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> regular and continued embassy involvement, the Mexican Central Authority clearly is overburdened.

25|$|On 11 January 1962, Adelaide River {{was officially}} proclaimed a town. The gazetted area {{comprises}} 626.8ha.

The line was officially closed in 1981 along with the Adelaide River station, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> maintenance gangs withdrawn, the yard and facilities remained mostly intact. The 1888 bridge continued {{to be used as}} a river crossing to convey traffic on the Stuart Highway. A second crossing, this time dedicated to road transport, the Edwin Verburg Bridge, now carries the highway across the river. It was opened on 27 March 1980 by Chief Minister Paul Everingham. The bridge was named for the pioneering agriculturalist who established an early farm in the town.|$|E

Sicking has developed numerous “next generation” designs that have significantly reduced the risk of injury and fatality to motorists, from highway drivers to NASCAR racers. His first global success was the ET-2000, the first energy absorbing guardrail terminal – a device that sits over {{the end of a}} guardrail, flattening the guardrail when it is hit by a vehicle. The first study of the device showed that out of 400 crashes, there were three injuries and no fatalities—reducing the risk by a factor of 10. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> detailed research data and real-world results showing the product a success, Sicking says he gets the most satisfaction from a personal testimonial.|$|E
