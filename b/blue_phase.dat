5|$|Although <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> are of {{interest}} for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvin. Recently the stabilization of <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> over a temperature range of more than 60K including room temperature (260–326K) has been demonstrated. <b>Blue</b> <b>phases</b> stabilized at room temperature allow electro-optical switching with response times {{of the order of}} 10−4s.|$|R
40|$|Optical {{activity}} measurements {{have been}} performed on the smectic <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> (BPSm), which are {{a new kind of}} chiral liquid crystal. BPSm, exhibit both three-dimensional orientational order, like the classical <b>blue</b> <b>phases,</b> and smectic positional order. Thus, they can be viewed as the three-dimensional counterpart of the twist grain boundary phases. A comparison with the optical activity of the classical <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> is carried out, and an estimation of the BPSm lattice parameter is reported for the first time...|$|R
40|$|Smectic <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> (BPSm) are new mesophases of thermotropic liquid crystals, which {{exhibit a}} double {{geometrical}} frustration: {{the extension of}} chirality in three spatial dimensions like the classical <b>blue</b> <b>phases,</b> and helical twist competing with smectic order, as in the TGB phases. The existence of a quasi-long range smectic order in BPSm phases breaks the cubic symmetry of classical <b>blue</b> <b>phases.</b> The symmetries of these new phases have been determined by X-ray scattering and optical polarizing microscopy experiments.

With an isotropic dark state, <b>blue</b> <b>phase</b> LCDs show many interesting electro-optic performances. Presently, the driving voltage of <b>blue</b> <b>phase</b> LCs in IPS structures is still {{a little bit too}} high. To reduce the voltage, material engineering for developing high Kerr constant mixtures is critically important. Moreover, device design is also an effective way. With proper device structure design, the driving voltage can be largely reduced.|$|E

5000|$|Developed {{with a look}} at cost-efficiency, Samsung's <b>Blue</b> <b>Phase</b> mode {{does not}} require liquid crystal {{alignment}} layers, unlike today's most widely used TFT LCD modes such as Twisted Nematic (TN), In-Plane Switching (IPS) or Vertical Alignment (VA). The <b>Blue</b> <b>Phase</b> mode can make its own alignment layers, eliminating the need for any mechanical alignment and rubbing processes. This reduces the number of required manufacturing steps, resulting in savings on production costs. Additionally it has been claimed that <b>Blue</b> <b>Phase</b> panels would reduce the sensitivity of the liquid crystal layer to mechanical pressure which could impair the lateral uniformity of display (e.g. luminance, chromaticity).|$|E
40|$|In liquid crystals, if flexoelectric {{couplings}} between polar {{order and}} director gradients are strong enough, the uniform nematic phase can become unstable to {{formation of a}} modulated polar phase. Previous theories have predicted two types of modulation, twist-bend and splay-bend; the twist-bend phase {{has been found in}} recent experiments. Here, we investigate other types of modulation, using lattice simulations and Landau theory. In addition to twist-bend and splay-bend, we also find polar <b>blue</b> <b>phases,</b> with 2 D or 3 D modulations of both director and polar order. We compare polar <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> with chiral <b>blue</b> <b>phases,</b> and discuss opportunities for observing them experimentally...|$|R

5|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>phases</b> are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid <b>phase.</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>phases</b> have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|R

40|$|The Kossel diagram {{technique}} {{has been used}} {{in the study of the}} <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> of liquid crystals for some years. In this paper quantitative information extracted from Kossel diagrams of <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> one (BPI) and two (BPII) is presented. The method used provides absolute measurements of the lattice parameters in these <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> to an accuracy of about 1 %. The measurements reveal a distortion in the BPI structure which is not obvious from qualitative examination of the Kossel diagrams themselves. The equality of the cholesteric phase helical pitch at the transition to BPI and the BPI helical pitch at the transition to BPII is confirmed. The experimental technique involved the use of a high stability temperature controller, reflection microscope, high resolution CCD camera and image digitization system. The Kossel diagrams were calibrated using a reflecting diffraction grating and hence measurements of lattice parameters required only the use of a single wavelength of light...|$|R

40|$|The optical {{activity}} and light {{transmission of the}} <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> and isotropic phase of 42 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 -(2 -methylbutylphenyl) - 42 ̆ 7 -(2 -methylbutyl) - 4 -biphenylcarboxylate (CE 2) are investigated under high pressure. The temperature ranges of the first (BP I) and third (BP III) <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> show only the slightest change, if any, with increasing pressure. This {{is the first time}} BP III, a phase which is not understood at all, has been investigated under pressure. In addition, an alternative analysis to the one reported previously is reported which confirms that the pretransitional {{optical activity}} in the isotropic phase changes very slightly due to pressure, and even this small change seems to be due to small changes in pitch and index of refraction. Taken together, these observations indicate that high pressure has little effect on both the BP III phase and the transition to the isotropic phase in highly chiral systems, even though the BP III phase differs significantly from the other <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> and strong short range fluctuations make the transition appear continuous optically...|$|R

50|$|In a <b>blue</b> <b>phase</b> based LC-display for TV {{applications}} {{it is not}} {{the selective}} reflection of light according to the lattice pitch (Bragg reflection) that is used for display of visual information, but an external electric field induces a birefringence in the liquid crystal via the Kerr effect.

50|$|A <b>blue</b> <b>phase</b> mode LCD is {{a liquid}} crystal display (LCD) {{technology}} that uses highly twisted cholesteric phases in a <b>blue</b> <b>phase.</b> It was first proposed in 2007 to obtain a better display of moving images with, for example, frame rates of 100-120 Hz to improve the temporal response of LCDs. This operational mode for LCDs also does not require anisotropic alignment layers (e.g., rubbed polyimide) and thus theoretically simplifies the LCD manufacturing process.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, {{researchers}} from the Centre of Molecular Materials for Photonics and Electronics at the University of Cambridge reported their discovery of a class of blue-phase liquid crystals that remain stable over a range of temperatures as wide as 16-60 °C. The researchers showed that their ultrastable <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> {{could be used to}} switch the color of the reflected light by applying an electric field to the material, and that this could eventually be used to produce three-color (red, green, and blue) pixels for full-color displays. The new <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> are made from molecules in which two stiff, rod-like segments are linked by a flexible chain, and are believed to be stabilized due to flexoelectricity.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} static {{properties}} of cubic <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> by numerically minimising the three-dimensional, Landau-de Gennes free energy for a cholesteric liquid crystal {{close to the}} isotropic-cholesteric phase transition. Thus {{we are able to}} refine the powerful but approximate, semi-analytic frameworks that have been used previously. We obtain the equilibrium phase diagram and discuss it in relation to previous results. We find that the value of the chirality above which <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> appear is shifted by 20 % (towards experimentally more accessible regions) with respect to previous estimates. We also find that the region of stability of the O 5 structure [...] which has not been observed experimentally [...] shrinks, while that of BP I (O 8 -) increases thus giving the correct order of appearance of <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> at small chirality. We also study the approach to equilibrium starting from the infinite chirality solutions and we find that in some cases the disclination network has to assemble during the equilibration. In these situations disclinations are formed via the merging of isolated aligned defects. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures. Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

50|$|The defects {{that occur}} at regular {{distances}} in three spatial dimensions form a cubic lattice {{just as we}} know it from solid crystals. Blue phases are thus formed by a regular three-dimensional lattice of defects within a chiral liquid crystal. Since the spacings between the defects of a <b>blue</b> <b>phase</b> are in the range of the wavelength of light (several hundred nanometers), for certain wavelength ranges of the light reflected from the lattice constructive interference occurs (Bragg reflection) and the <b>blue</b> <b>phase</b> reflects colored light (note that only some of the blue phases actually reflect blue light).|$|E
40|$|Phase {{diagrams}} of {{chiral nematic}} liquid crystals are studied {{within the framework}} of a generalized Landau-Ginzburg-de Gennes theory. Using the parametrization of Grebel, Hornreich, and Shtrikman for the tensor order parameter Q, all relevant elastic terms are included for the helicoidal <b>phase</b> and the <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> of chiral nematic liquid crystals up to fourth order in Q and its gradient &# 8706;Q. The influence of the additional elastic terms on the phase diagrams of the chiral nematic phases is then investigated. The theory correctly describes the variation of the pitch with temperature and the induced biaxiality of the cholesteric phase. The results resolve the discrepancies encountered by Hornreich and Shtrikman in the comparison of experiment and theory. New features in the topology of the <b>phase</b> diagrams of <b>blue</b> <b>phases,</b> like re-entrant phase transitions, are predicted...|$|R
40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>phases</b> of cholesteric liquid {{crystals}} offer {{a spectacular}} example of naturally occurring disclination line networks. Here we numerically solve the hydrodynamic {{equations of motion}} to investigate the response of three types of <b>blue</b> <b>phases</b> to an imposed Poiseuille flow. We show that shear forces bend and twist and can unzip the disclination lines. Under gentle forcing the network opposes the flow and the apparent viscosity is significantly {{higher than that of}} an isotropic liquid. With increased forcing we find strong shear thinning corresponding to the disruption of the defect network. As the viscosity starts to drop, the imposed flow sets the network into motion. Disclinations break-up and re-form with their neighbours in the flow direction. This gives rise to oscillations in the time-dependent measurement of the average stress.

40|$|Colloidal {{structures}} in confined nematics offer novel routes for designing complex optical materials with micrometer and submicrometre functionality. In this paper, we review {{some of our}} recently assembled colloidal structures that form in confined nematic cells. We present effective elastic binding via nematic distortion as a mechanism for the assembly of two-dimensional colloidal crystals of elastic dipoles and elastic quadrupoles. We introduce entangled colloids as novel types of structures, where particles are topologically bound by delocalised defect loops, producing robust and possibly chiral structures. The concept of hierarchical assembly is demonstrated in colloids with particles of various scales. In cholesteric <b>blue</b> <b>phases,</b> the assembly of three-dimensional colloidal crystals is shown based on naturally occurring three-dimensional arrays of trapping sites produced by <b>blue</b> <b>phases.</b> © 2011 Taylor and Francis...|$|R
