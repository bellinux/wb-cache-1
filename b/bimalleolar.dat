5000|$|On X-rays, {{there can}} be a {{fracture}} of the medial malleolus, the lateral malleolus, or of the anterior/posterior margin of the distal tibia. The posterior margin (known as the posterior malleolus) is much more frequently injured than the anterior aspect of the distal tibia. If both the lateral and medial malleoli are broken, this is called a <b>bimalleolar</b> fracture (some of them are called Pott's fractures). If the posterior malleolus is also fractured, this is called a trimalleolar fracture.|$|E
5000|$|Pott's fracture, {{also known}} as Pott's {{syndrome}} I and Dupuytren fracture, is an archaic term loosely applied {{to a variety of}} <b>bimalleolar</b> ankle fractures. [...] The injury is caused by a combined abduction external rotation from an eversion force. This action strains the sturdy medial (deltoid) ligament of the ankle, often tearing off the medial malleolus due to its strong attachment. The talus then moves laterally, shearing off the lateral malleolus or, more commonly, breaking the fibula superior to the tibiofibular syndesmosis. If the tibia is carried anteriorly, the posterior margin of the distal end of the tibia is also sheared off by the talus. A fractured fibula in addition to detaching the medial malleolus will tear the tibiofibular syndesmosis. The combined fracture of the medial malleolus, lateral malleolus, and the posterior margin of the distal end of the tibia is known as a [...] "trimalleolar fracture." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the frequency of}} deltoid ligament injury in <b>bimalleolar</b> supination-external rotation type fractures and {{whether there is a}} correlation between the size of the fractured medial malleolus and deltoid ligament injury. Methods: Twenty six consecutive patients underwent magnetic resonance exams after clinical and radiographic diagnosis of <b>bimalleolar</b> supination-external rotation type ankle fractures. Results: Thirteen patients (50 %) presented deltoid ligament injury associated to <b>bimalleolar</b> ankle fracture. Partial injury was present in seven (26. 9 %) patients and total injury in six (23. 1 %). Regarding medial fragment size, the average was 2. 88 cm in the absence of deltoid ligament injury. Partial injuries presented 1. 93 cm and total 2. 1 cm on average. Conclusion: Deltoid ligament injury was present in 50 % of <b>bimalleolar</b> ankle fractures.

When <b>bimalleolar</b> fractures were created in cadavera the talus could be anatomically re-positioned only when the lateral malleolus was accu-rately reduced. Fifty-three patients with <b>bimalleolar</b> fractures were treated by anatomically fixing the lat-eral malleolus with a four-hole plate. There was an anatomical reduction of the talus and medial malleolus in each instance {{and there were no}} late cases of de-generative arthritis when these patients were followed for from six months to nine years.

The <b>bimalleolar</b> plane generally makes a smaller angle (a) with the bicondylar plane than does the plane of the posterior tibial surface (A). However, posterior displacement of the fibula (broken lines) increases the angle of external tibiofibular torsion as measured between the bicondylar and <b>bimalleolar</b> planes. deformity is {{at the level of the}} ankle, or in the tibia itself, the axis of the tibiotalar articulation is internally rotated in respect to the axis of the knee.

30|$|Other {{measurements}} {{of importance to}} diagnose, preoperative planning and postoperative evaluation are the talar tilt, the talocrural angle and the <b>bimalleolar</b> angle. The talar tilt represents the angle between {{the line of the}} tibial plafond and the line of surface of the talar dome. In a normal ankle joint, these lines should be parallel [8, 15, 23, 28, 29]. The talocrural angle describes the angle between the line of the tibial plafond and the line through the tips of the malleoli. If the difference of this angle is ≥ 3 ° between the injured and the contralateral ankle, a fibular shortening is present [8, 23, 29]. The <b>bimalleolar</b> angle is described by the line connecting the malleolar tips and a vertical line following the fibular intramedular space, immediately superior of the ankle joint. Difference of 2.5 ° or greater between both sides suggests fibular shortening [23, 30]. Roberts et al. showed that the change of the <b>bimalleolar</b> angle with 1 ° represents 1  mm fibular shortening or lengthening after corrective osteotomy [22, 23].|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Aim: The aim of {{the study}} is to compare {{immediate}} weight bearing with below-knee cast or immobilization with plaster splint in 6 weeks in patients after operative treatment for ankle <b>bimalleolar</b> fractures. Methods: Fifty-three patients with ankle <b>bimalleolar</b> fractures were treated operatively in 2005 to 2010 and then were randomly allocated to two groups. Immediately weight bearing in a below-knee cast (26 patients) and immobilization in a plaster splint for the first six postoperative weeks (27 patients). A mean age 37. 9 (min 17; max 72).

40|$|Background: The {{stability}} of the ankle joint is pro-vided by the medial and lateral malleoli and ligaments. Recent studies of cadaveric ankles have demonstrated that injury to the medial structures of the ankle is nec-essary to allow lateral subluxation of the talus after fracture. However, cadaveric models are limited by the fracture pattern chosen for the model. We sought to investigate the competency of the deltoid ligament in vivo in patients with an operatively treated <b>bimalleolar</b> ankle fracture. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with a <b>bimalleolar</b> ankle fracture were evaluated. In each patient, the me-dial malleolus was anatomically reduced and fixed.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{outcome of}} 25 patients with <b>bimalleolar</b> fractures of the ankle was assessed ten to fourteen years following their fractures using the Phillips scoring system. All patients had undergone open reduction and anatomical internal fixation (as described in their operative {{notes in the}} medical records). 52 % of patients had a good or excellent overall outcome while 24 % had a poor overall outcome. This study has the longest follow-up period (10 to 14 years) {{to date on the}} outcomes of internal fixation of <b>bimalleolar</b> ankle fractures and demonstrates a higher percentage of poorer outcomes than has been previously described. This trend appears to be predictable as other studies with shorter term follow-up have already established a trend of increasing radiological evidence of post-traumatic arthritis with successively longer-term outcome reports...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ankle {{fracture}} fixation {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly performed orthopaedic procedures. Although the results are generally favourable, complications are not uncommon, particularly in the case of surgical site infec-tions. These have considerable impact on both postoperative morbidity and healthcare costs. The purpose of this study was to determine the infection rate following ankle fracture fixation and elucidate variables in their causation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 50 consecutive patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. The study group consisted of 26 females and 24 males with an average age of 43 (Range 16 - 82) years. Results: Problems with superficial infections were noted in seven patients and deep infections in five. Of the latter, four patients underwent further surgery including two that had their metal work removed. With use of the Fisher’s exact test we determined that only smoking and a <b>bimalleolar</b> fracture pattern were significant variables, having p-values of 0. 02 and 0. 04 respectively.

30|$|<b>Bimalleolar</b> and trimalleolar {{fractures}} {{are extremely}} common in skeletal traumatology. Surgical treatment of these lesions is usually recommended {{when they are}} displaced, {{in order to obtain}} an adequate reduction and a stable internal fixation, and to avoid early degenerative disease of the ankle [2 – 4]. Conservative treatment is considered only in undisplaced fractures. Some authors report good results with surgical treatment and early mobilization of the ankle joint [5 – 8]; however, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no papers have been published on the application of continuous passive motion (CPM) to the ankle immediately after surgery. In this study, we compared two series of 22 patients each, with displaced <b>bimalleolar</b> and trimalleolar fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation and followed up at least 10  years after the injury. In the first series, after the operation, a continuous passive motion machine had been applied to the ankle, whereas in the second series, after surgery, the operated ankle joint had been immobilized in a splint or a cast. The aim of our study was to compare the clinical and radiographic results observed at follow-up in two series of patients who had been treated surgically using two different protocols.|$|E

No prospective running gait analyses have previously been performed in military settings. Aim: We aimed to identify biomechanical gait factors and anthropometric variables {{associated with increased}} risk of TSF. Methods: 1065 Royal Marines recruits were assessed in week- 2 of training. Bilateral plantar pressure and 3 D lower limb kinematics were obtained for barefoot running at 3. 6 m. s- 1, providing dynamic arch index, peak heel pressure and lower limb joint angles. Age, <b>bimalleolar</b> breadth, calf girth, passive hip internal/external range of motion and body mass index (BMI) were also recorded. Ten recruits who sustained a TSF during training were compared with 120 recruits who completed training injury-free using a binary logistic regression model to identify injury risk factors. Results: Four variables significantly (p< 0. 05) predicted increased risk of TSF (odds ratios and 95 % CI) : smaller <b>bimalleolar</b> width (0. 73, 0. 58 - 0. 93), lower BMI (0. 56, 0. 33 - 0. 95), greater peak heel pressure (1. 25, 1. 07 - 1. 46) and lower range of tibial rotation (0. 78, 0. 63 - 0. 96).

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} intra-rater and inter-rater {{reliability}} for measuring tibial torsion measurements by a radiographic method using three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction (3 D-CT) and {{to compare the}} physical measures to those of 3 D-CT. Method The study included 33 children who presented with intoeing gait. Tibial torsion was measured by 3 D-CT. Distal reference point was the <b>bimalleolar</b> axis. Proximal reference points were the transtibial axis and posterior condylar axis. Physical measurements included thigh-foot angle (TFA) and <b>bimalleolar</b> angle (BMA). 3 D-CT measurement and physical measurement were performed twice at both lower extremities by each rater. The intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were calculated by intraclass correlation coefficiency (ICC). The relationship between radiological and physical examination was calculated by Spearman correlation coefficient. Results The 3 D-CT measures for tibial torsion were reliable within individual raters and between different raters. However, physical measures for tibial torsion were reliable within an individual rater but not reliable between raters. The 3 D-CT measures by any proximal reference axis were more reliable within a rater and between raters than physical measurements. There was no significant impact introduced by {{the selection of the}} proximal reference axis. The correlation coefficiency between 3 D-CT and physical measurement methods was low.

40|$|Majority of {{paediatric}} flat {{feet are}} flexible and asymptomatic; less than 0. 1 % of all flat feet are rigid. If {{these can be}} diagnosed and managed early, then various complications can be prevented and they will remain asymptomatic. This {{study was conducted to}} analyse the ankle rotational mal-alignments in the natural course of flexible flat foot in children. Seventy-six patients of flexible flat foot and one hundred controls were included in this study. The height of foot arches was judged clinically by inspecting the height of the medial arch and by measuring the arch index on weight-bearing podograms. Tibial torsion and <b>bimalleolar</b> angle were assessed in all subjects. Tibial torsion was assessed in the first twenty subjects (ten cases and ten controls) both by clinical methods (foot-thigh angle) and CT. As no statistical difference in the two methods was observed, tibial torsion was measured by clinical methods only in the remaining subjects. <b>Bimalleolar</b> angle was measured on weight-bearing podograms in all subjects. For a minimum of two years, cases were followed up regularly with a standard conservative protocol and the height of the arches observed. Majority of cases of flexible flat foot were found to have increased tibial torsion and increased foot-bimalleolar angle (high talar spin). The severity of collapse of the medial arch and the response to conservative treatment was found to correlate with these rotational mal-alignments of the ankle.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Ankle {{fracture}} fixation {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly performed orthopaedic procedures. Although the results are generally favourable, complications are not uncommon, particularly in the case of surgical site infections. These have considerable impact on both postoperative morbidity and healthcare costs. Paradoxically, there is a paucity of literature studying patients who sustain them and therefore little is known about ways such occurrences can be minimised. The purpose of this study was to determine the infection rate following ankle fracture fixation and elucidate variables in their causation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 50 consecutive patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. The study group consisted of 26 females and 24 males with an average age of 43 (Range 16 - 82) years. Results: Problems with superficial infections were noted in seven patients and deep infections in five.

With use of the Fisher’s exact test we determined that only smoking and a <b>bimalleolar</b> fracture pattern were significant variables, having p-values of 0. 02 and 0. 04 respectively. Conclusion: We recommend that patients with ankle fractures who either have a history of smoking and/or <b>bimalleolar</b> injury be counselled about the potential risk of infection and its implications on their functional recovery. The ability to identify patients at risk of such problems highlights the need for caution during the perioperative period so that care strategies may be altered to facilitate recovery...|$|E

30|$|From {{a pool of}} 45 {{patients}} with a unilateral <b>bimalleolar</b> or trimalleolar fracture, treated surgically between 1990 and 1995 at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of the University of Rome “Tor Vergata,” we extracted 28 patients in whom we had applied a continuous passive motion machine to the operated ankle immediately after surgery. In all 28 patients, we had obtained an anatomical reduction that was very stable to passively exerted flexion-extension movements. The remaining 17 cases had been considered unsuitable for CPM {{at the end of}} surgery because they had shown movements at the fracture site when the ankle was moved. All 28 patients were invited to our hospital for a clinical and radiographical evaluation: four could not be located, while two declined {{to participate in the study}} because they judged their follow-up useless, owing to the absence of any symptoms in the ankle. The remaining 22 patients made up the first series of patients. A comparative series of another 22 patients was selected from a different pool of 53 patients operated on between 1985 and 1990 in whom the operated ankle had been immobilized in a splint or in a cast after surgery. From this second pool of patients, we selected 32 fractures for which at surgery we had obtained an anatomical reduction and a stable internal fixation. We excluded the unstable fractures, evaluated at the end of surgery, from this second series. Ten patients either could not be located or declined to participate in the study, and the remaining 22 made up the second series of patients. The two series of patients were not randomized since the first series had been treated after 1990, whereas the second series had been treated before that date. In the first series of patients, 13 were female and 9 were male. Their age at injury ranged from 20 to 62  years, with an average of 41.8  years. The right ankle was involved in 15 cases and the left ankle in 7. There were 8 <b>bimalleolar</b> fractures and 14 trimalleolar fractures. In 4 cases the fracture of the fibula was below the syndesmosis (Weber A), in 6 cases it was at the level of the syndesmosis (Weber B), whereas in 12 cases it was above the syndesmosis (Weber C).

40|$|Purpose: In this study, {{the results}} of 2 {{different}} sugical treatment methods used in <b>bimalleolar</b> ankle fractures in osteoprotic patients older than 70 have been assessed. Methods: 38 fractures of 38 patients- 24 female and 14 male, with an avarege age of 74 (70 - 81) - were assessed who were hospitalized between 1994 - 2000 because of <b>bimalleolar</b> ankle fracture. The mean of Singh Indexes of the patients was 2. 1 / 6 (1 / 6 - 3 / 6). The cause of the fracture in all patients was simply falling down. In 17 of the patients, osteosynthesis was obtained by laterally plating for lateral malleolus and cancellous or malleolar screws for medial malleolus (Group I), and in 21 it was obtained by posteriorly plating for lateral malleolus and tension band technique for medial malleolus (Group II). Results: The average follow-up period was 52 (18 - 90) months. In Group I, the avarage immobilization in cast was 6 (4 - 9) weeks, the radiological bone union was 11 (8 - 13) weeks, resuming former activity level took 20 weeks, average loss of 7 ∞(0 - 10) dorsiflexion, and 8 ∞(0 - 15) flexion were observed, and 7 patients were identified to require a walking stick. Due to irritation on the skin, 4 patients required early removal {{of some of the}} screws. In contrast, in Group II the avarage immobilization in cast was 8 weeks (7 - 10), the radiological bone union 11 (8 - 14) weeks, resuming former activity level took 18 weeks, average loss of 5 ∞(0 - 8) dorsiflexion, and 5 ∞(0 - 8) flexion were observed, and 7 patients were identified to require a walking stick. Conclusion: In this type of fractures, along with the joint acommodation the surgical treatment also allows patients resume social activity in a shorter period of time. However the insufficiency of the bone structure makes it hard to obtain this purpose. Possible complications enforce having more control on surgical rehabilitation. Posterior plating and tension band technique is far more beneficial due to their biomechanical characteristics. Therefore it is a method to be preferred in the case of osteoporotic patients...|$|E
