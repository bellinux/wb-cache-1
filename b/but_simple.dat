5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable reviews at launch. Reviewers {{noted the}} precision and craft of its game design. Reviewers compared Videoball to other games including the South Asian board game Carrom, and {{a cross between}} Asteroids (1979) and Rocket League (2015). GameSpot reviewer wrote that Videoball was the 2016 equivalent of Rocket League, in that both had idiosyncratic concepts and little prior anticipation, <b>but</b> <b>simple</b> and fun gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Like other thyreophorans, Scelidosaurus was herbivorous. However, {{while some}} later ornithischian groups possessed teeth capable of {{grinding}} plant material, Scelidosaurus had smaller, less complex leaf-shaped teeth suitable for cropping vegetation and jaws capable of only vertical movement, {{due to a}} short jaw joint. Paul Barrett concluded that Scelidosaurus fed with a puncture-crush system of tooth-on-tooth action, with a precise <b>but</b> <b>simple</b> up-and-down jaw movement, in which the food was mashed between the inner side of the upper teeth and the outer side of the lower teeth, without the teeth actually touching each other as shown by very long vertical wear facets on the lower teeth alone.|$|E
5|$|Tupaia miocenica is {{a fossil}} treeshrew from the Miocene of Thailand. Known {{only from a}} single tooth, an upper first or second molar, it is among the few known fossil treeshrews. With a length of 3.57mm, the tooth is large for a treeshrew. At the back lingual corner (the side of the tongue), the tooth shows a small cusp, the hypocone, that is {{separated}} from the protocone {{in front of it}} by a narrow valley. The condition of the hypocone distinguishes this species from various other treeshrews. In addition, the presence of a well-developed <b>but</b> <b>simple</b> mesostyle (a small cuspule) is distinctive.|$|E
5|$|Under the Royal Assent Act 1967, {{royal assent}} can be {{granted by the}} {{sovereign}} in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, <b>but</b> <b>simple</b> statement to the house, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly {{for the purpose of}} receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992, with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by the wording of the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by the wording of the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act ("... And forasmuch as We cannot at this time be present in the Higher House of Our said Parliament being the accustomed place for giving Our Royal Assent...").|$|E

Through continuous experimentation, he worked {{out a way to}} make an effective <b>but</b> <b>simple</b> form of compensation balance. At the same time, he discovered a simple modification to his helical balance spring that let develop concentrically and, also, confer the property of isochronism on the oscillating balance. Not only this, but adjustments to the compensation balance and the balance spring could be carried out in a simple, calculated way. These were the main subjects of the patent, which he took out in 1782.|$|E
25|$|Inferring {{horizontal}} {{gene transfer}} through computational identification of HGT events relies upon {{the investigation of}} sequence composition or evolutionary history of genes. Sequence composition-based ("parametric") methods search for deviations from the genomic average whereas evolutionary history-based ("phylogenetic") approaches identify genes whose evolutionary history significantly {{differs from that of}} the host species. The evaluation and benchmarking of HGT inference methods typically rely upon simulated genomes, for which the true history is known. On real data, different methods tend to infer different HGT events, and as a result {{it can be difficult to}} ascertain all <b>but</b> <b>simple</b> and clear-cut HGT events.|$|E
