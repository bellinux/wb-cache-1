50|$|The almost ten-year {{difference}} between {{the installation of the}} first high pressure boilers and this final one results in differences between them. For instance, boiler 15 already came equipped with naphtha injectors (in the others, these were added progressively), the conveyor belt is lower, the control table is more advanced in registering and reading the boiler’s operational data, the <b>boiler</b> <b>dust</b> (ash) pan has six coal hoppers to expel <b>boiler</b> <b>dust</b> and coal (in the other there were only three), and it is also slightly larger in size.|$|E
50|$|The hardest {{jobs were}} those {{involving}} coal burning, {{both in the}} boiler room and in the <b>boiler</b> <b>dust</b> (ash) room, with workers having to endure extremely high temperatures due to the coal burning inside the boilers, the dust originating from combustion and the deafening noise throughout the entire work shift. Even so, it was the boiler room that occupied the largest amount of workers and had {{the greatest number of}} different tasks. It was here that the chief technical Engineer, technical engineers, head operators, sub-head operators, operators, stokers and workers (<b>boiler</b> <b>dust</b> extraction), all endured extremely harsh working conditions, especially the latter.|$|E
50|$|The boiler is {{fundamentally}} {{made up of}} 3 circuits: water/steam, air/smoke and <b>boiler</b> <b>dust</b> (ash). Each circuit’s function is indispensable and complementary to the others. The water/steam circuit’s function was to transform the liquid water into steam; the air/smoke circuit was of great importance, since the better or worse use of the circuit {{was reflected in the}} variation in the boiler’s output; and finally, the ash circuit, from where unburned coal and ash resulting from the boiler’s combustion were recovered.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{carried out}} on real gases testified {{to the possibility of}} intensifying the denitrifica-tion of flue gas from coal <b>dust</b> and grate <b>boilers.</b> This was done through the activities aiming at nitro-gen oxides removal within the burning zone due to urea injection.

30|$|The {{simulated}} {{dust concentration}} at the boiler outlet was 4.5 g/Nm 3 at 12 % CO 2. This is {{in agreement with}} the results reported in the literature. For wood-fired boilers, Buonicore and Davis [18] reported a value of 3, 000 mg/Nm 3, whilst De Kock and Yap [19] reported that the <b>boiler</b> flue gas <b>dust</b> loads varied from 1490 to 4300 mg/Nm 3. These results were not corrected for carbon dioxide; hence, the dust load could have been higher after 12 % CO 2 correction. Furthermore, it can be seen from Figure 3 that even a small difference in dust collection efficiency can make a significant difference in dust concentration. For example, at 95 % efficiency, the dust concentration is 0.225 g/Nm 3, whereas at 90 % efficiency, which is lower, the dust concentration is 0.450 g/Nm 3. The latter result will not comply with the Clean Air Regulation of 1978 at 0.4 g/Nm 3.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce dust {{emissions}} during start-up (heat-up) of the Roasters, and during operation of the calcine preparation and transport equipment, a suction ventilation system was installed using a TWO stage filtration plant, consisting of a dedustable bag filter system followed by a nondedustable high efficiency sub-micron particulate airfilter. The adherence to a clean gas dust content of 1 mg/m 3 can be monitored by a continuous measurement Sigrist-Photometer, the data stored on computer and the plant condition evaluated. The chutes of the waste heat <b>boilers,</b> in the <b>dust</b> removel area, are lined with refractory bricks and also partly insulated in {{order to reduce}} thermal air currents. Through removal of hot areas and also the complete enclosure of the roasters, the diffuse dust emissions could be greatly reduced. The waste heat boiler tube bundle cleaning devices were converted to a more effective and virtually dust free operation. Comprehensive measurement of emissions and immissions have accompanied the various steps described. (orig.)

40|$|The {{conversion}} of black liquor to white liquor {{is carried out}} in the chemical recovery system, which is made up of several units; in two of them, i. e. the recovery boiler and the rotary kiln, sintering plays an important role. To study what influences sintering of recovery <b>boiler</b> <b>dust,</b> several dusts of different compositions were heat treated and their sintering behaviour examined. Sintering was measured as the reduction of the specific surface area. It was shown that, besides temperature and sintering time, the first melting temperature of the dust strongly influences the degree of sintering. The lower the first melting temperature, the lower the specific surface area. The reduction of the specific surface area with time was found to agree with the German Munir equation. It is important, for several reasons, to know what influences sintering of reburned lime mud in the rotary kiln. Different kinds of experiments were run. First, a quartz glass tube reactor was used to reburn lime mud of different compositions in different sintering atmospheres. It was found that the degree of sintering depends on the compound the lime mud was doped with. Generally speaking, a higher concentration of the foreign compound resulted in a higher degree of sintering. The results suggest that the melting point of the doped solid influences the sintering process as well, with more sintering for low melting point solids. It was also shown that carbon dioxide in the sintering atmosphere strongly effects sintering. Even small amounts enhanced the sintering behaviour significantly and, at partial pressures of carbon dioxide corresponding to equilibrium, the reduction of the specific surface area was very rapid. The German Munir equation was used as a base to develop models that describe the reduction of the specific surface area as functions of time, temperature, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and concentration of the different doping compounds. Pellets formed either of lime mud or reburned lime mud were heat treated in a muffle furnace and their strength was measured. It was shown that not only the temperature and time but also the compact pressure markedly influence the strength of the pellets. Also, when forming pellets out of already calcined lime mud, the pellets became much stronger. Finally, lime mud was reburned in a pilot scale rotary kiln. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the sintering atmosphere was varied, and it could thereby be seen how the specific surface area depends on the residual carbonate. Two different lime muds were used, and they showed different behaviours. The first reached a minimum in specific surface area at about 10 weight-% of residual carbonate, whilst for the second, the specific surface area decreased with increasing residual carbonate over the whole range investigated. Rings and balls were formed, and the strength of the balls increased with increasing residual carbonate...|$|E
40|$|Copper {{smelting}} {{with the}} Outokumpu flash smelting process generates {{significant amounts of}} SO 2 -rich off-gas and flue dust. From the smelting unit, gases with a dust load are directed into a heat recovery boiler (also known as a waste heat boiler). In the radiation section temperature decreases, sulphates become thermodynamically stable, and the sulphation of oxidic dust particles commences. Releasing heat may {{lead to an increase}} in particle temperatures, softening of the sulphated particles, and the formation of dust accretions on the heat transfer surfaces. Decreased heat transfer efficiency and blockages of the gas flow paths may cause severe operational problems. To maintain stable boiler operation, sulphation behaviour has to be well understood, but only scant published data concerning dust sulphation reactions is available. The objective of this work was to gain basic knowledge of the sulphation behaviour of dust components to ascertain that boiler design and operation can be carried out so that sulphate formation takes place in a controlled manner. The reactions of synthetic Cu 2 O and CuO (mainly 37 - 53  µm) and a partially oxidised copper matte were studied experimentally with the aim of arriving at a better understanding of dust sulphation in industrial heat recovery boilers. The parameters in the laboratory-scale experiments were gas composition (20 - 60  vol-% SO 2, 2. 5 - 10  vol-% O 2), temperature (560 - 660  °C), reaction time, and particle size. Standard chemical analysis and scanning electron microscopy with EDS were utilised when examining the samples. Sulphate formation was found to be sensitive to gas composition and temperature. Also particle size and surface morphology have significant effects on the sulphation rate. On the basis of the experimental results the temperature range for effective sulphation of pure cuprous oxide is narrow; the optimal sulphate formation temperature lies between 580 - 640  °C, depending on the gas composition. An increase in oxygen concentration expands the favourable temperature range and lowers the most optimal sulphate formation temperature; on the contrary an increase in sulphur dioxide concentration raises the favourable sulphation temperature. On the basis of the present experiments pure cupric oxide behaves like cuprous oxide, but the conversion degrees are slightly lower and there is not such a clear enhance in the sulphation rate at a certain temperature. Fine, heterogeneous partially oxidised matte reacts significantly faster compared to synthetic oxides. The reason for more effective sulphation is suggested to be the smaller particle size and more detailed morphology (larger specific surface area). In the heat recovery <b>boiler</b> <b>dust</b> particles must have a sufficient residence time in the gas phase at a correct temperature range to allow the dust particles to reach complete conversion in the radiation section before they enter the boiler convection section and come into contact with the convection tube banks. Enough oxygen has to be supplied to the appropriate zone to ensure effective sulphation at the right place. Also, mixing of the oxygen must be efficient. reviewe...|$|E
30|$|The {{path with}} the largest trans-boundary PM 2.5 (4.39  kt) is the one related to {{emissions}} from all sectors embodied in the output of China’s manufacture sector at Step 3, purchased by China’s manufacture sector at Step 2 to meet the final demand requirements from Korea’s manufacture sector at Step 0. Not surprisingly, from the production side, the sources of all top 10 paths of trans-boundary PM 2.5 emission among the three countries are sectors from China, mainly manufacture (5 paths) and metals (5 paths) sectors. From the consumption side, Korea’s manufacture (3 paths), Japan’s manufacture (3 paths) and Japan’s residential activities sector (1 path) induced most trans-boundary PM 2.5 emissions. If viewed considering China separately, in the production process, PM 2.5 emissions from construction and supply of power, heat and water sectors were quite large, but these sectors {{did not participate in}} trans-boundary PM 2.5 emission to a proportional large extent. The high emission level of these sectors was a result of their high domestic emission intensity, rather than the final requirements from Japan or Korea. However, the final requirements of manufacture and residential activities of Japan and Korea induced a robust amount of PM 2.5 emission of China’s manufacture and metals sector, which contributed significantly to the emission level of Japan and Korea. If measured from the production attribution, these emissions would be relocated and {{become a part of the}} responsibility of China. Japan and Korea have been benefited from such emission leakages. The abatement duty of these relocated emissions should be performed both by producers from China and consumers from Japan and Korea. On the other hand, China has been the net importer in China–Japan trade or China–Korea trade, especially in manufacture (JPN, 46.07 %; KOR, 48.20 %) and chemical products sectors (JPN, 13.77 %; 25.06 %). However, few embodied PM 2.5 emissions were imported in these two sectors. In order to mitigate the PM 2.5 emission in East Asia, China should learn from the existed experience of Japan and Korea, not only by importing the direct emission abatement technology (e.g., more efficient electrostatic precipitator or bag precipitator for <b>boilers</b> to control <b>dust,</b> PM 10 and PM 2.5), but also by upgrading the current production technology to follow the Japan or Korea pattern in these sectors.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was {{to take a closer}} look at {{problems}} connected to combustion of energy grain in a systematic way. The work was restricted to appliances of 100 - 400 kW. Eight users of energy grain were interviewed about there experiences. The majority had smaller problems, besides from relatively many running-in problems, presumably because the instructions for installation and operation were insufficient. Shutdowns were rare and caused by sintering. Burning other cereals than oat often led to sintering. Corrosion is avoided by keeping the flue gas temperature high. Measurements were performed on three boilers for energy grain. Measured carbon monoxide was 70 - 900 mg/Nm 3, OGC 0 - 28 mg/Nm 3, nitrogen oxides 490 - 945 mg/Nm 3 and dust 160 - 440 mg/Nm 3. All emissions were higher compared to pellets. Sulphur dioxide and hydrochloric acid were estimated from fuel analysis, and were higher than from combustion of wood. Energy grain does not contribute to global warming and have good properties in the form of high heating value, relatively high density and the grain has a size and form easy to combust. The Swedish Board of Housing, Building and Planning prescribes maximum allowed levels of OGC. The boilers studied in this project had emission well below these limits. For boilers < 500 kW, there are no legislations or recommendation that restrict emissions of dust, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxides or hydrochloric acid. The lack of legislation/recommendations makes it difficult to judge whether the emissions are acceptable or not. Today, boilers for energy grain are designed to give low emissions of unburned components and not optimised for low emissions of nitrogen oxides. By changing the design of the burner (it was equipped with three steps with air holes) the emissions were reduced by 27 % without an increase of unburned components. The objective with the steps was to divide the combustion into two zones: one with deficit of oxygen and one rich with oxygen. It is probable possible to reduce the emission even more by dividing the combustion in an even more sophisticated way. Measurements in three different <b>boilers</b> showed that <b>dust</b> emission from one of the boilers that used modulating power regulation was substantially lower than from the other two that were controlled by an on-off thermostat. This may be explained by higher degree of ash pulled by the gas flow at high power, or by lower temperature in the glow bed at low power. However, more data is required to draw general conclusions. Emissions of dust, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide or hydrochloric acid constitute an obstacle for a considerable expansion of energy grain and similar fuels; because the emission will be paid attention to if they increase, especially if they increase in connection to densely populated areas. Therefore, a continuous increase of combustion of energy crops should be accompanied by continuous improvements of combustion technique to reduce the emissions...|$|R
