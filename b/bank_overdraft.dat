5|$|Houlding died in 1902, and in 1905 the {{ownership}} of the club was restructured. Of the existing 3,000 shares, 2,000 were held by the Houlding family. The club owed a debt of £10,000 to Houlding, and a further £5,000 <b>bank</b> <b>overdraft</b> was guaranteed by his family. The family offered {{to give up the}} 2,000 shares and wipe out the debt, if the club relieved them of the bank loan guarantee. The board agreed, and a new share issue was released in 1906 with 15,000 shares available for £1 each. Following the share issue, McKenna became chairman of the club.|$|E

2500|$|Despite their {{defensive}} frailties, {{the club}} escaped relegation, with Jimmy Hampson's 32 goals being enough to secure First Division football {{for at least}} one more season. Also, a [...] "£10,000 goal" [...] from Albert Watson occurred in the final match, a 2–2 draw at home to Manchester City. The equaliser by the half-back was said to be worth at least that amount as it secured the club's short-term future with the guarantee of large attendances for the next twelve months. Finances were still an immediate concern, however, with the club now possessing a <b>bank</b> <b>overdraft</b> of over ₤17,000.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{options are}} {{available}} to most payday loan customers.

[...] The Pew Charitable Trusts found in 2013 their study on {{the ways in which}} users pay off payday loans that borrowers often took a payday loan to avoid one of these alternatives, only to turn to one of them to pay off the payday loan.|$|E

40|$|Notwithstanding the {{expansion}} of higher education across the OECD, there continues to be concern about the levels of participation amongst those from disadvantaged backgrounds. In response to this, {{a new form of}} financial support for students from low-income families, the 'opportunity bursary', was introduced for a limited period in England from 2001 / 02. Surveys of two cohorts of opportunity-bursary applicants were carried out and these suggested possible psychological, behavioural and economic impacts. Fewer opportunity-bursary recipients than non-recipients reported that part-time work had interfered with their studies and more reported that the bursary had made them less worried about meeting the costs of going to university.

40|$|Despite a dozen studies, {{the welfare}} effects of payday credit are still debatable.

We find some evidence that Ch. 13 bankruptcy rates decrease after payday credit bans, but where we find that, we also find that complaints against lenders and debt collectors increase. The welfare implications of these offsetting movements are unclear. Our most robust finding is that returned check numbers and overdraft fee income at banks increase after payday credit bans. Bouncing a check may cost more than a payday loan, so {{this finding suggests that}} payday credit access helps households avoid costlier alternatives. While our findings obviously do not settle the welfare debate over payday lending, we hope they resolve it to some extent it by illuminating how households rearrange their financial affairs when payday loan supply changes...|$|R

40|$|Using the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption (HFCS) data, {{this paper}} {{identifies}} the key differences in borrowing behaviour between core and peripheral nations. As such, {{we focus on}} non-collateralized debt such as credit card loans, <b>bank</b> <b>overdrafts</b> {{and other forms of}} non-collateralized debt, which reflect daily borrowing behaviour more closely than does mortgage debt. We examine the differences in levels and prevalence of these debts, and break down these differences into two major components: financial perceptions and the economic environment. We aim to explain to what extent these influences contribute to the differences in debt ownership and levels of holding between core and peripheral countries in Europe. We found that differences in financial perceptions do contribute to the differences in debt in a significant way, while the economic environment contributes little to this outcome. Households in the European periphery are much more conducive to debt if they have the same financial perceptions as those in the core countries in Europe...|$|R
