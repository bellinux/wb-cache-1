50|$|General purpose molding compounds, {{engineering}} molding {{compounds and}} sheet molding compounds {{are the primary}} forms of phenolic composites. Phenolics are also used as the matrix binder with Honeycomb core. Phenolics find use in many electrical applications such as breaker boxes, <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> materials and most recently in combination with various reinforcements in the molding of an engine block-head assembly, called the polimotor. Phenolics may be processed by the various common techniques, including compression, transfer and injection molding.|$|E
50|$|The master {{cylinder}} is located behind the driver’s side dashboard {{mounted on the}} vacuum booster. The pressure inside of the {{master cylinder}} is created by a primary and secondary piston. These are pushed by the output rod of the vacuum booster to compress fluid within its primary and secondary chambers (hydraulic pressure). The hydraulic pressure is translated through the <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> to the <b>brake</b> calipers. When the brake fluid is pushed through the <b>brake</b> <b>lines,</b> the master cylinder chambers are replenished by the reservoir (attached {{to the top of}} the master cylinder).|$|R
50|$|In {{light of}} the above, it is {{reasonable}} to ask why rubber brake hose is used at all, instead of always using braided stainless steel hose. The most typical reason is cost, but also use case. Braided stainless steel hose is typically more expensive than rubber. When the cost difference is extrapolated across hundreds or thousands of units, it is quite compelling to opt for the rubber option, especially when the use case exhibits that the operator will not need or want the additional capabilities offered by a brake system equipped with braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines.</b> It thus stands to reason that braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> are typically only seen on upmarket motor vehicles such as hot-rods and supercars, or on race-prepped vehicles such as those used in Formula One and touring car series. Braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> are a common aftermarket upgrade, purchased and installed after a vehicle is initially purchased.|$|R
50|$|On February 8, 2009, Toyota {{announced}} a recall of approximately 7,300 early 2010 model year 4-cylinder Camrys {{due to the}} possibility of the power steering hose rubbing into the front <b>brake</b> <b>line</b> which may cause a brake fluid leak.|$|R
50|$|The Tempest line, {{including}} the GTO, was restyled for the 1965 model year, adding 3.1 {{in to the}} overall length while retaining the same wheelbase and interior dimensions. It had Pontiac's characteristic vertically stacked quad headlights. Overall weight increased about 100 lb. The <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> area increased nearly 15%. Heavy-duty shocks were standard, as was a stronger front antisway bar. The dashboard design was changed, and an optional rally gauge cluster ($86.08) added a more legible tachometer and oil pressure gauge. An additional option was a breakerless transistor ignition.|$|E
5000|$|The {{motoring}} correspondent of The Times {{claimed that}} any previous Hawk owner would be [...] "astonished" [...] by the Mark VI's 20 per cent more powerful engine's ability to effortlessly swing the car along at 70 mph. Cold starting was very good. The engine {{was not always}} so willing to start when cold. The tyres were inclined to squeal on not very sharp corners taken at {{any more than a}} modest speed. The <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> area is now 40 per cent more than on the Mark V. The driver's windscreen wiper is badly located.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{automobile}} {{drum brake}} {{was first used}} in a car made by Maybach in 1900, although the principle was only later patented in 1902 by Louis Renault. He used woven asbestos lining for the drum <b>brake</b> <b>lining,</b> as no alternative dissipated heat like the asbestos lining, though Maybach had used a less sophisticated drum brake. In the first drum brakes, levers and rods or cables operated the shoes mechanically. From the mid-1930s, oil pressure in a small wheel cylinder and pistons (as in the picture) operated the brakes, though some vehicles continued with purely mechanical systems for decades. Some designs have two wheel cylinders.|$|E
25|$|A {{line lock}} is a {{temporary}} parking brake that makes use of the vehicles standard hydraulic brakes. Often used for off road conditions stopping on steep grades. By trapping hydraulic pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>lines,</b> all four wheels can be locked.|$|R
50|$|A pure brake by wire {{system would}} {{eliminate}} the need for hydraulics completely by using motors to actuate calipers, in comparison to the currently existing technology where the system is designed to provide braking effort by building hydraulic pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{the tests}} the vehicle brake {{for which the}} {{replacement}} linings are designed is installed in an inertia dynamometer instrumented for continuous recording of rotative speed, <b>brake</b> torque, <b>brake</b> <b>line</b> pressure, number of rotations after brake application, braking time, and brake rotor temperature.|$|R
5000|$|Brake fade and rotor warping can {{be reduced}} through proper braking technique; when running down a long {{downgrade}} that would require braking simply select a lower gear (for automatic transmissions this may necessitate a brief application of the throttle after selecting the gear). Also, periodic, rather than continuous application of the brakes {{will allow them to}} cool between applications. Continuous light application of the brakes can be particularly destructive in both wear and adding heat to the brake system. Finally, new brakes are prone to a phenomenon termed [...] "green fade", where resin on the brake pad evaporates at the high temperatures involved in heavy braking and the resulting pressurised gas forces the <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> away from the disk, reducing friction [...] - conflicting with [...] "Factors contributing to fade" [...] above.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reduction}} of friction termed brake fade is caused {{when the temperature}} reaches the [...] "kneepoint" [...] on the temperature-friction curve and gas builds up between disc and pad. All <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> is cured under mechanical pressure following a heating and cooling curve backstroke, heating the friction material up to 450 F to [...] "cure" [...] (cross-link) the phenolic resin thermoset polymers: There is no melting of the binding resins, because phenolic resins are thermoset, not thermoplastic. In this form of fade, the brake pedal feels firm but there is reduced stopping ability. Fade can also be caused by the brake fluid boiling, with attendant release of compressible gases. In this type of fade, the brake pedal feels [...] "spongy". This condition is worsened when there are contaminants in the fluid, such as water, which most types of brake fluids are prone to absorbing to varying degrees. For this reason brake fluid replacement is standard maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|Elva {{produced}} a single-seater car for Formula Junior events, the FJ 100, initially supplied with a front-mounted B.M.C. 'A' series engine in a tubular steel chassis. [...] "Elva Cars, Ltd., new Formula Junior powered by an untuned BMC 'A' Series 948cc engine. The price of this 970 lb. car is $2,725 in England. Wheelbase: 84", tread: 48", <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> area: 163" [...] sq. The 15" [...] wheels are cast magnesium. Independent suspension {{front and rear}} with transverse wishbones, coil springs, and telescopic shock absorbers. The car is 12 feet, four inches long." [...] Bill de Selincourt won a race at Cadours, France, in an Elva-B.M.C. FJ on September 6, 1959. Nichols switched to a two-stroke DKW engine supplied by Gerhard Mitter. In 1959 Peter Arundell won the John Davy Trophy at the Boxing Day Brands Hatch meeting driving an Elva-D.K.W. [...] "Orders poured in for the Elva but when the 1960 season commenced Lotus and Cooper had things under control and disillusioned Elva owners watched the rear-engined car disappearing round corners, knowing they had backed the wrong horse." [...] Sporadic success continued for Elva {{in the early part}} of that year, with Jim Hall winning at Sebring and Loyer at Montlhéry.|$|E

5000|$|The first ETD use is {{attributed}} to Florida East Coast Railway in 1969, soon after which other Class I railroads began using ETD's as well. By the mid-1980s they were common equipment. [...] Early models {{were little more than}} a <b>brake</b> <b>line</b> connection / termination, a battery and flashing tail light. As their use became more widespread through the 1980s, ETD's were equipped with radio telemetry transmitters to send brake pressure data to a receiver in the locomotive. To reduce the cost of battery replacements, ambient light sensors were added so the flashing light on the ETD would illuminate only during dusk and after dark. Later models have a small turbine-powered electrical generator using air pressure from the <b>brake</b> <b>line</b> to power the ETD's radio and sensors.|$|R
