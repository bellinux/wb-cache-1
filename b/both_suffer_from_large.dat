40|$|Greece and Italy {{initiated}} {{efforts to}} improve public debt management and develop their domestic debt markets respectively in the late 1970 s and mid- 1980 s. At that time, <b>both</b> countries <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>large</b> and rapidly growing public debt, excessive reliance on short-term bills held by commercial banks, a strong preference of households to save in bank deposits, and a weak presence of institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds). Continuing large fiscal deficits, high levels of interest rates and inflation, and serious policy credibility problems impeded the use of long-term instruments. The authors provide {{a detailed analysis of}} the characteristics of the instruments that were used in these two countries, their pace of issuance, and their impact on the composition of public debt. The authors note that the main Greco-Roman lesson for developing and transition countries concerns the transition from an excessive reliance on short-term Treasury bills, held by captive banks, to a liquid market with long-term instruments held, and actively traded, by long-term institutional investors. The transition required moving gradually to medium-term instruments, experimenting with innovation, and targeting households and foreign investors, while taking steps to establish policy credibility by lowering fiscal deficits and inflation. When reliance on captive sources of finance was substantially reduced and policy credibility was established, both countries focused on developing active money markets and liquid secondary markets with benchmark issues of fixed-rate long-term securities. They ultimately succeeded in developing active professional markets, using modern practices, targeting well-established European institutional investors, and integrating into the highly sophisticated euro markets. However, integration into the euro markets was the culmination of a prolonged effort of modernization and adaptation and was greatly facilitated by their strong political commitment to achieve economic convergence and join the euro zone.

40|$|In {{order to}} probe the helium {{distribution}} in porous amorphous coatings of silicon grown by magnetron, we present an extraction method of the Helium signal obtained from STEM-EELS spectrum images [1]. The goal {{of the work is}} to get a rough estimation of the Helium pressure inside the pores and correlate this to the deposition parameters. For this we modified the procedure described by Walsh [2] and David et al. [3] and integrated this in MATLAB. With our present architecture it is possible to read in images in dm 3 format recorded on a with DigiScan by Gatan and undergo several data treatment. For our purpose we selected centering the zero loss peak and integrating it, deconvolution, fitting of the plasmon intensity with one narrow peak at ≈ 23 eV attributed to the Silicon bulk plasmon and a wider one at ≈ 24 to 25 eV to adapt contributions from surface oxide layer and carbon contamination, and fitting of the residual intensity arsing from the He-K edge at ≈ 22 eV with a gaussian. Part of the procedure is visualized in Figure 2, which shows two spectra from the same spectrum image one at the matrix position (Figure 2 (a)) and the other at the pore center (Figure 2 (b)). The spectra were are already deconvoluted and the fit to the Silicon plasmon is plotted red and the fit for the SiO 2 and the carbon contamination is plotted green. For both positions the fit is satisfactory and for the pore position and also the residual signal around 22 eV is well described by the gaussian fit. The procedure allows to plot maps of all fitting parameters and also to extract EFTEM images. Figure 1 shows (a) thickness map (b) the gaussian integral and (c) the gaussian peak position for a selected spectrum image of a single pore. The Helium density can be derived in two ways, from the ratio of the Helium K-edge intensity/ to the ZLP-intensity and by the energy shift of the edge position. <b>Both</b> methods <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>large</b> errors around 30 % so the cross check is an advantage. We will complete our results by additional tomography experiments and correlate them to compositional depth profiles measured with Rutherford backscattering...|$|R
40|$|Arctic {{operations}} are mostly {{carried out in}} seas covered in ice. For these operations, both DNV GL and IACS provide regulations for classification of ships. Interaction with ice is difficult to determine, as it could occur in many different ways. The ice vary both spatial and temporal, hence each individual interaction are distinct. The strength of sea ice depends on; ice temperature, porosity, salinity, and load direction. The main scope of this Master s thesis is to study the behaviour of two plate fields located in the bow region of ice-going vessels, applying measurements of sea ice for load prediction. Uni-axial compression tests and parametric measures have been conducted by UNIS and prediction of ice loads are discussed in papers by Leira et al. (2009), Løset et al. (2006) and Riska (2011). This Master s thesis presents sea ice theory down to a molecular level. Applying both theory and measurements, the flexural strength of both level ice and ridged ice were predicted. Further, the flexural strengths were applied in estimation of empirical contact pressures. These pressures were compared to pressures obtained from regulations provided by DNV GL and IACS, by conducting an assessment of a local plate field in the bow region. The assessment of the local plate field proved the dimensioning based on regulations to be a minimum requirement. The findings stated that regulations from DNV GL in general provide less contact pressure than similar regulations from IACS. Additionally, {{it was found that}} the empirical contact pressure model was able to give a simplified estimate of one interaction with ice, as ice have large temporal and spatial variations. For the plate model located in the stem area, an empirical ridge ice pressure was applied and the boundary conditions were assessed. The model applied one fixed and three spring modelled boundaries. Findings from the assessment indicated the spring-modelled boundary to approach the behaviour of a fixed condition, as the spring stiffness was increased. Further, the modelling of the boundaries was only able to account for warping of the supportive frames. <b>Both</b> models <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>large</b> permanent deformations and entered the non-linear behaviour region, as the applied pressures had a high magnitude. Additionally, the stiffeners providing support for the plates <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>both</b> plastic hinges and warping...|$|R
40|$|As {{shown by}} the Phoenix Mars Lander's Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP), contact {{measurements}} of thermal conductivity and diffusivity (using a modified flux-plate or line-source heat-pulse method) are constrained {{by a number of}} factors. Robotic resources must be used to place the probe, making them unavailable for other operations {{for the duration of the}} measurement. The range of placement is also limited by mobility, particularly in the case of a lander. Placement is also subject to irregularities in contact quality, resulting in non-repeatable heat transfer to the material under test. Most important from a scientific perspective, the varieties of materials which can be measured are limited to unconsolidated or weakly-cohesive regolith materials, rocks, and ices being too hard for nominal insertion strengths. Accurately measuring thermal properties in the laboratory requires significant experimental finesse, involving sample preparation, controlled and repeatable procedures, and, practically, instrumentation much more voluminous than the sample being tested (heater plates, insulation, temperature sensors). Remote measurements (infrared images from orbiting spacecraft) can reveal composite properties like thermal inertia, but <b>suffer</b> <b>both</b> <b>from</b> a <b>large</b> footprint (low spatial resolution) and convolution of the thermal properties of a potentially layered medium. In situ measurement techniques (the Phoenix TECP is the only robotic measurement of thermal properties to date) <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> problems of placement range, placement quality, occupation of robotic resources, and the ability to only measure materials of low mechanical strength. A spacecraft needs the ability to perform a non-contact thermal properties measurement in situ. Essential components include low power consumption, leveraging of existing or highly-developed flight technologies, and mechanical simplicity. This new in situ method, by virtue of its being non-contact, bypasses all of these problems. The use of photons to both excite and measure the thermal response of any surface material to a high resolution (estimated footprint = 10 square centimeters) is a generational leap in physical properties measurements. The proposed method consists of spot-heating the surface of a material with a low (less than 1 W) power laser. This produces a moderate (5 - 10 K) temperature increase in the material...|$|R
40|$|Systems-level {{studies of}} {{biological}} systems rely on observations taken at a resolution {{lower than the}} essential unit of biology, the cell. Recent technical advances in DNA sequencing have enabled measurements of the transcriptomes in single cells excised from their environment, but it remains a daunting technical problem to reconstruct in situ gene expression patterns from sequencing data. In this thesis I develop methods for the routine, quantitative in situ measurement of gene expression using fluorescence microscopy. The number of molecular species that can be measured simultaneously by fluorescence microscopy {{is limited by the}} pallet of spectrally distinct fluorophores. Thus, fluorescence microscopy is traditionally limited to the simultaneous measurement of only five labeled biomolecules at a time. The two methods described in this thesis, super-resolution barcoding and temporal barcoding, represent strategies for overcoming this limitation to monitor expression of many genes in a single cell. Super-resolution barcoding employs optical super-resolution microscopy (SRM) and combinatorial labeling via-smFISH (single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization) to uniquely label individual mRNA species with distinct barcodes resolvable at nanometer resolution. This method dramatically increases the optical space in a cell, allowing a large numbers of barcodes to be visualized simultaneously. As a proof of principle this technology was used to study the S. cerevisiae calcium stress response. The second method, sequential barcoding, reads out a temporal barcode through multiple rounds of oligonucleotide hybridization to the same mRNA. The multiplexing capacity of sequential barcoding increases exponentially with the number of rounds of hybridization, allowing over a hundred genes to be profiled in only a few rounds of hybridization. The utility of sequential barcoding was further demonstrated by adapting this method to study gene expression in mammalian tissues. Mammalian tissues <b>suffer</b> <b>both</b> <b>from</b> a <b>large</b> amount of auto-fluorescence and light scattering, making detection of smFISH probes on mRNA difficult. An amplified single molecule detection technology, smHCR (single molecule hairpin chain reaction), was developed to allow for the quantification of mRNA in tissue. This technology is demonstrated in combination with light sheet microscopy and background reducing tissue clearing technology, enabling whole-organ sequential barcoding to monitor in situ gene expression directly in intact mammalian tissue. The methods presented in this thesis, specifically sequential barcoding and smHCR, enable multiplexed transcriptional observations in any tissue of interest. These technologies will serve as a general platform for future transcriptomic studies of complex tissues. </p...|$|R
