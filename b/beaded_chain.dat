40|$|We {{describe}} theoretically and validate experimentally {{the mechanism}} of formation of capillary bridges during pulling a <b>beaded</b> <b>chain</b> out from a liquid with a planar surface. There {{are two types of}} capillary bridges present in this system, namely the sphere-planar liquid surface bridge initially formed between the spherical bead leaving the liquid bath and the original bulk planar liquid surface, and the sphere-sphere capillary bridge formed between neighbouring beads in the part of the chain above the liquid surface. During pulling the chain out of the liquid, the sphere-planar liquid surface bridge transforms into the sphere-sphere bridge. We show that for monodisperse spherical beads comprising the chain, this morphological phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous. The transition is continuous when the diameter of the spherical beads is larger than the capillary length. Otherwise, the transition is discontinuous, likewise the capillary force acting on the chain. Comment: 10 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{provides}} a comprehensive, high-resolution structural {{analysis of the}} central-pair microtubule apparatus of sperm flagella. It describes the arrangement of several microtubule-associated "sheath " components and suggests, contrary to previous thinking, that microtubules are structurally asymmetric. The two microtubules of the central pair are different in several respects: the C tubule bears a single row of 18 -nm-long sheath projections with an axial periodicity of 16 nm, whereas the C, tubule possesses rows of 9 -nm globular sheath components with an axial repeat of 32 nm. The lumen of the C tubule always appears completely filled with electron-dense material; that of the C, tubule is frequently hollow. The C tubule also possesses a series of <b>beaded</b> <b>chains</b> arranged around the microtubule; the <b>beaded</b> <b>chains</b> are composed of globular subunits 7. 5 - 10 nm in diameter and appear to function in the pairing of the C, and C tubules. These findings indicate: that the <b>beaded</b> <b>chains</b> are not helical, but assume the form of lock washers arranged with a 16 -nm axial periodicity on the microtubule; and that the lattice of tubulin dimers in the C tubule is not helically symmetric, but that there are seams between certain pairs of protofilaments.

40|$|The {{membrane}} vesicle (<b>beaded</b> <b>chain)</b> {{portion of}} the mesosomes and peripheral (ghost) membrane of Bacillus subtilis were obtained by protoplast lysis and separated by differential and sucrose gradient centrifugation. Electron microscopy revealed that both fractions were satisfactorily homogeneous. Comparison of the two membrane preparations showed that they were similar with respect to total protein, total phosphorus, and lipid-soluble phosphorus content. Their protein patterns on acrylamide gel electrophreograms did not differ significantly. A possible point of distinction was revealed by a difference spectrum analysis of their cytochromes. The two preparations showed clear quantitative differences in all five of the enzyme activities assayed. Acrylamide gel electrophreograms of peripheral membrane stained for malate dehydrogenase showed four weak isozyme bands, whereas electrophreograms of mesosome membranes exhibited a single strong peak. (A survey of published data on enzymes in mesosome fractions shows a marked lack of correspondence between different species of bacteria.) Comparison of 3 H-acetate incorporation into the two membrane fractions showed that both were labeled at the same rate. Similarly, 35 SO 4 was taken up by both fractions at a comparable rate and was chased from both comparably. Lipid and protein labeling thus indicates that mesosome vesicle membrane is not a precursor or special growing point of peripheral membrane...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{correlate}} glenohumeral translation in the anterior/posterior direction with medial {{and lateral}} {{rotation of the}} humerus. In addition, {{the length of the}} anterior and posterior component of the glenohumeral capsuloligamentous complex was varied in order to gain insight into the contribution of each component to limiting translation. All measurements were made with the humerus positioned at 90 degrees of abduction and 0 degrees of flexion/ extension. METHODS: Six fresh cadaveric shoulders were used. Each scapula was mounted in a cement pot to rest it in its correct anatomical position. Seven tests were carried out on each shoulder. A series of measurements of translation of the humerus in the anterior direction and posterior direction were taken at 20 degrees intervals of lateral rotation and then at 20 degrees intervals of medial rotation until the limit of lateral or medial rotation had clearly been reached (test 1). The capsuloligamentous complex was then incised and a <b>beaded</b> <b>chain</b> and catches were sutured across the joint to mimic the capsuloligamentous complex at different lengths (tests 2 to 7). RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: (a) When the glenohumeral capsuloligamentous complex is intact, the humerus translates maximally in the glenoid (between 20 and 30 mm) when the humerus is between 40 degrees and 100 degrees of lateral rotation. (b) As the glenohumeral capsuloligamentous complex increases in length, so does the extent of translation. (c) In medial rotation, the length of the posterior capsule, rather than the length of the anterior capsule, has the greater effect on anterior/posterior translation. (d) In lateral rotation the length of the anterior capsule, rather than the length of the posterior capsule, has the greater effect on anterior/posterior translation. (e) The glenohumeral ligamentous complex acts more as a cuff, enclosing the joint, rather than as a sling, as is commonly thought. ...|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by extensive cerebral amyloid deposition. Amyloid deposits associated with damaged neuropil and blood vessels contain abundant fibrils formed by the amyloid β-protein (Aβ). Fibrils, both in vitro and in vivo, are neurotoxic. For this reason, substantial effort has been expended to develop therapeutic approaches to control Aβ production and amyloidogenesis. Achievement of the latter goal is facilitated by a rigorous mechanistic understanding of the fibrillogenesis process. Recently, we discovered a novel intermediate in the pathway of Aβ fibril formation, the amyloid protofibril (Walsh, D. M., Lomakin, A., Benedek, G. B., Condron, M. M., and Teplow, D. B. (1997) J. Biol Chem. 272, 22364 - 22372). We report here results of studies of the assembly, structure, and biological activity of these polymers. We find that protofibrils: 1) are in equilibrium with low molecular weight Aβ (monomeric or dimeric); 2) have a secondary structure characteristic of amyloid fibrils; 3) appear as <b>beaded</b> <b>chains</b> in rotary shadowed preparations examined electron microscopically; 4) give rise to mature amyloid-like fibrils; and 5) affect the normal metabolism of cultured neurons.
