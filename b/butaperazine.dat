50|$|<b>Butaperazine</b> (Repoise, Tyrylen) is {{a typical}} {{antipsychotic}} of the phenothiazine class.|$|E
40|$|Oral {{administration}} of <b>butaperazine</b> (40 mg per kilogram) to rats increased dopamine turnover, {{as measured by}} elevation of striatal and mesolimbic concentrations of homovanillic acid and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphen-ylacetic acid, for 24 to 48 hours. Initially, this dose of <b>butaperazine</b> inhibited stereotyped behavior in response to subcutaneous {{administration of}} apomorphine, but this effect was reversed at 12 hours. Later, animals had normal or exaggerated responses to apomorphine. The data suggest that at the critical 20 - to 28 -hour period after <b>butaperazine</b> administration, when most human acute dystonic reactions occur, normal or supersensitive cerebral dopamine receptors are exposed to an excessive synaptic release of dopamine. This {{may be responsible for}} the drug-induced dystonia...|$|E
40|$|Trifluoperazine dihydrochloride, <b>butaperazine</b> dimaleate, {{promethazine}} hydrochloride, diethazine hydrochloride, prochlorperazine maleate and chlorpromazine hydrochloride {{were studied}} as redox indicators in titrns. of hydroquinone, Metol and ascorbic acid with chloramine-T. The end points obtained are sharper than with conventional indicators. The molar absorptivities of the oxidized indicators are reported. Simple but accurate methods for the detn. of hydroquinone and Metol are described. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|Promethazine hydrochloride, {{prochlorperazine}} maleate, <b>butaperazine</b> dimaleate, and trifluoroperazine dihydrochloride {{are proposed}} as redox indicators in the cerimetric titrn. of Fe(II), Mo(V), U(IV), hydroquinone, Metol, and ascorbic acid in H 2 SO 4, HCl, and HOAc media. They give sharp and reversible color {{changes at the}} equivalence point. They have certain advantages over the existing redox indicators in cerimetry. Their transition potentials are reported.

40|$|<b>Butaperazine</b> dimaleate forms a red 1 : 1 complex with Pd (II) in HCl-NaOAc buffer. The complex shows {{absorption}} max. at 490 nm with {{molar absorptivity}} 3. 5 Ã� 103 L mol- 1 cm- 1. Beer's law is valid at 0. 2 - 17. 0 Î¼ g/mL. The method {{was used in}} spectrophotometric detn. of Pd. The accuracy of the detn. was â�¼ 2 %. The effects of interfering ions were studied.

40|$|<b>Butaperazine</b> dimaleate, trifluoroperazine dihydrochloride, {{diethazine}} hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride, prochloroperazine maleate, and chlorpromazine hydrochloride {{were used}} as redox indicators in the macro- and microtitrn. of hydroquinone, Metol, and ascorbic acid with N-bromosuccinimide in aq. HCl, H 2 SO 4, and AcOH contg. KBr. Sharp reversible color changes at the equivalence point were obtained. A titrimetric method for the detn. of hydroquinone, Metol, and ascorbic acid and a potentiometric method for the detn. of Metol were described. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|Rh(III) {{forms an}} orange-red 1 : 1 complex with <b>butaperazine</b> dimaleinate at room temp. in AcONa-HCl buffer soln. contg. CuSO 4 and ascorbic acid.

Sandell's {{sensitivity of the}} reaction is 0. 042 Î¼g/cm 2 and the molar absorptivity is 2. 44 Ã� 103 L mol- 1 cm- 1.

40|$|Diethazine, trifluoperazine, promethazine, and {{chlorpromazine}} hydrochlorides, <b>butaperazine</b> dimaleate, and prochlorperazine maleate {{were studied}} as indicators in the BrO 3 - titrn. of quinol, metol, and ascorbic acid. Their formal potentials were detd. They {{are superior to}} p-ethoxychrysoidine and 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol as indicators because they give sharper and brighter end points, the end point color is more stable, and a slight excess of BrO 3 - after the equivalence point does not destroy the color. In all the BrO 3 - titrns. of quinol, metol, and ascorbic acid, these indicators gave results accurate to Â± 0. 2 %. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid {{spectrophotometric}} method for the detn. of 6 phenothiazines {{is based on}} the formation of a colored compd. between molybdophosphoric acid (I) and phenothiazines. The IR and ESR spectra of the colored compds. showed that I oxidizes phenothiazines to a radical cation with which it then forms a colored compd. Absorbances were detd. at 510 nm for triflupromazine [146 - 54 - 3] and trifluperazine [117 - 89 - 5], at 525 nm for <b>butaperazine</b> [653 - 03 - 2], profenamine [522 - 00 - 9], and mepazine [60 - 89 - 9] and 540 nm for perphenazine [58 - 39 - 9].

40|$|Micro amts. {{of blood}} were {{detected}} in urine spectrophotometrically by using 6 different phenothiazines. The oxidized phenothiazine soln. (0. 2 mL) was mixed on a porcelain spot plate with 0. 3 mL HOAc, 0. 1 mL boiled and cooled urine, and 0. 1 mL H 2 O 2. The {{appearance of a}} pink or red color {{was regarded as a}} pos. result. Prochlorperazine dimaleate and chlorpromazine-HCl were more sensitive than the other 4 phenothiazines, and all phenothiazines, except <b>butaperazine</b> dimaleate, were more sensitive than benzidine and o-tolidine. Various substances likely to be found in pathol. urine samples were examd. for interference, and only vitamin C gave false neg. results. However, vitamin C was destroyed by boiling the urine. The method is more reproducible than the amidopyrine method, and 0. 4 - 0. 7 Î¼L blood could be detected. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
