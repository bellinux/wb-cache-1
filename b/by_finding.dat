5|$|In the laboratory, the {{strength}} of this interaction can be measured <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting temperature (also called Tm value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.|$|E
5|$|Matrix {{calculations}} can be often {{performed with}} different techniques. Many {{problems can be}} solved by both direct algorithms or iterative approaches. For example, the eigenvectors of a square matrix can be obtained <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> a sequence of vectors xn converging to an eigenvector when n tends to infinity.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E

5|$|The basic story {{elements}} unfold as the protagonist, Tim, {{attempts to}} rescue a princess from a monster. Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations and motivations. The game features traditional aspects of the platform genre while integrating various powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} maximal {{directed}} pseudoforests on n vertices, allowing self-loops, is nn, because for each vertex there are n possible endpoints for the outgoing edge. André Joyal used this fact {{to provide a}} bijective proof of Cayley's formula, {{that the number of}} undirected trees on n nodes is n'n2, <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> a bijection between maximal directed pseudoforests and undirected trees with two distinguished nodes. If self-loops are not allowed, the number of maximal directed pseudoforests is instead (n1)n.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{nature of}} this species means that juveniles can only acquire a territory <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> a vacant area or replacing a dead adult. In Europe, young birds almost always move to unoccupied habitat, but in the larger territories of Siberia most live within the breeding range of an adult pair.|$|E

5|$|The series {{concerns}} Phineas's {{attempts to}} avoid boredom <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> {{something new to}} do for each day of his summer vacation. His sister's name is Candace Flynn, who tries to reveal their outrageous creations, but to no avail. He does this with his less-talkative stepbrother Ferb, and often with many other neighborhood children. The activities they devise usually involve outlandish contraptions, including roller coasters, haunted houses, roller rinks, and a backyard beach etc. which Phineas designs and Ferb builds.|$|E
5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who had {{a horrible}} appearance, was missing a finger, or had {{appendages}} {{similar to those of}} an animal was believed to be a vampire. A person who died alone and unseen would become a vampire, likewise if a corpse swelled or turned black before burial. Dogs, cats, plants or even agricultural tools could become vampires; pumpkins or melons kept in the house too long would start to move, make noises or show blood. According to the late Serbian ethnologist Tatomir Vukanović, Roma people in Kosovo believed that vampires were invisible to most people, but could be seen by a twin brother and sister born on a Saturday who wore their clothes inside out. Likewise, a settlement could be protected <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> twins who could also see the vampire outdoors at night, who would have to flee immediately after they spotted it.|$|E
50|$|The area of San Lazzar {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since ancient times, as testified <b>by</b> <b>findings</b> from the Stone Age (stone implements) and the Bronze Age; along with nearby Castenaso, it witnessed a flourishing Villanovian civilization.|$|R

5|$|Banjo and Kazooie are {{occasionally}} {{aided by}} their friend Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman who can use magical powers to transform them into several creatures like a termite, a pumpkin, a bee, a walrus, and a crocodile. These transformations {{have their own}} special features and allow the player to access areas that were previously inaccessible. For instance, the walrus can resist the effects of icy-cold water. Mumbo Tokens that are scattered throughout the game allow the transformation process. The game also includes cheats that the player can unlock <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> Gruntilda's spellbook, Cheato.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control the titular protagonist, Crash, as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them. Crash will lose a life if he is hit by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. Crash can protect himself by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> extra life items or by collecting 100 Wumpa Fruit.|$|E
5|$|DayZ {{attempts}} to portray a realistic scenario within the gameplay, {{with the environment}} having different effects on the player. A character may receive bone fractures from damage to their legs, go into shock from bullet wounds or zombie bites, receive infections from zombies or diseased players, or faint due to low blood pressure. Thirst and hunger must be kept under control <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> sustenance in either cities or the wilderness, with body temperature playing a key part in the character's survival. The game focuses on surviving and the human elements of a zombie apocalypse by forcing the player to acknowledge basic human needs like thirst, hunger and shelter. These mechanics require the player to focus on immediate goals before they can consider long-term strategies.|$|E

5|$|During his adventure, Headdy {{will find}} power-ups which change {{the design and}} {{function}} of his head. These 17 power-ups range from increasing damage, such as spinning fireballs around his head, to providing invincibility, restoring health, increasing speed, etc. Some of these power-ups last for only a short time. Other than heads, the player can also find health restoratives, extra points, and extra lives throughout the levels. <b>By</b> <b>finding</b> the Liberty Head, players can enter a Bonus Stage in which the player must shoot basketballs into the correct hoops.|$|E
5|$|During {{its opening}} weekend, the film topped {{the box office}} with $110.3 million, setting an opening weekend record among Pixar films (surpassed <b>by</b> <b>Finding</b> Dory), films {{released}} in June (surpassed by Man of Steel and later Jurassic World), and G-rated films. The film also achieved the second largest opening weekend among animated films and the fourth largest opening weekend among 2010 films. Its average of $27,385 per venue is the second highest for a G-rated film and the third highest for an animated feature. Its opening week gross (Friday through Thursday) of $167.6 million is the second largest among animated films, the second largest among 2010 films, and the twenty-third largest of all time. It also achieved the largest 10-day gross among 2010 films. It topped the box office for two consecutive weekends.|$|E
5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points {{for each of the}} three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all three lines (Figure6).|$|E
50|$|Winona Site is {{an archaeological}} site in Coconino County {{in the state}} of Arizona, within the Coconino National Forest. It is located near Sunset Crater, which erupted in 1066. Cultural changes {{following}} this eruption are evidenced <b>by</b> <b>findings</b> at this site.|$|R
5000|$|A new {{hypothesis}} {{explains a}} greater range of parietal lobe lesion <b>findings</b> <b>by</b> proposing {{that the role}} of the parietal lobe is in the subjective experience of vividness and confidence in memories. [...] This hypothesis is supported <b>by</b> <b>findings</b> that lesions on the parietal lobe cause the perception that memories lack vividness, and give patients the feeling that their confidence in their memories is compromised.|$|R
30|$|Two {{kinds of}} {{evidence}} supported {{the validity of}} the WPAI. First, convergent validity was supported <b>by</b> <b>findings</b> of higher scores on WPAI domains, particularly presenteeism, OWI, and activity impairment, being associated with lower scores on measures of HRQoL and with higher scores on indices of disease activity – that is, worse scores on WPAI domains were associated with worse scores on health status and disease activity, as expected. Second, known-groups validity was supported <b>by</b> <b>findings</b> that WPAI scores were substantially higher for patients with worse disease activity and more severe symptoms, again as expected. Divergent validity was not examined in this review, {{due to a lack of}} relevant data from identified sources.|$|R
5|$|In 1958, at a {{performance}} of The Diary of Anne Frank in Vienna, Simon Wiesenthal was challenged {{by a group of}} protesters who asserted that Anne Frank had never existed, and who challenged Wiesenthal to prove her existence <b>by</b> <b>finding</b> the man who had arrested her. Wiesenthal indeed began searching for Karl Silberbauer and found him in 1963. When interviewed, Silberbauer admitted his role, and identified Anne Frank from a photograph as one of the people arrested. Silberbauer provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. His statement corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank.|$|E
5|$|In Escape from Butcher Bay, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} Richard B. Riddick and {{attempts}} {{to break out of}} Butcher Bay prison. The game incorporates elements from video game genres such as first-person shooter, adventure and stealth, and is played primarily from a first-person perspective, though the camera switches to a third-person perspective during certain scenes. Unlike many first-person shooters, the game contains no head-up display; on-screen cues are limited to flashes when a new weapon is selected, and small, white boxes that display the player character's health when damage is taken. Health can be replenished in designated areas throughout the game. <b>By</b> <b>finding</b> cigarette packs hidden in levels, the player can unlock concept art and video files.|$|E
