40|$|The Natref Oil Refinery in Sasolburg, South Africa, {{experienced}} refractory {{problems in}} the combustion chamber of the Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) since start-up (Figure 1). Even though the SRU was at all times operated within the temperature range of 1250 - 1750 °C (as measured on the original thermocouples and the pyrometer), they experienced refractory failures, {{which can only be}} accounted for by temperatures in excess of 1850 °C. It was concluded that the available temperature indication was not an accurate reflection of the actual temperature in the combustion chamber. Three new sets of temperature measurement were installed in order to better understand the temperature profile in the combustion chamber (each set consists of two thermocouples and one pyrometer). Furthermore, An ASPEN-based simulation was used to set up a neural network to predict the combustion chamber temperature based on three input variables, namely the oxygen enrichment level, the ratio of sour water stripper offgas to acid gas, as well as the amount of acid gas bypassed to the second chamber of the reaction furnace. The reaction furnace was found to be operated at an average temperature of 1400 °C during normal operation. This temperature is substantially higher than the normal recommended 1250 °C for Claus combustion chambers. The neural network was connected to the Natref DCS and successfully proved that during the start-up of the SRU in 2006 a temperature in excess of 2000 °C was reached inside the combustion chamber, explaining the refractory failure and subsequent shutdown of the unit. In order to establish which temperature measurement should be used for control purposes during normal operation, the 9 temperature measurements over the length of the combustion chamber were compared to the neural network temperatures. All the other thermocouples (T 1 - T 6) were found to underpredict the ASPEN simulated temperature. Furthermore, the response of these thermocouples was much slower than that of the pyrometers. With the exception of the <b>burner</b> <b>box</b> pyrometer, P 1, all the pyrometers also underpredicted the ASPEN simulated temperature. The response of the pyrometers was, however, much faster and showed the strongest linear correlation with regards to the adiabatic flame temperature. The reason for the underprediction can be ascribed to heat losses in the combustion chamber. The middle pyrometer, P 2, gave the smallest deviation between measured and predicted temperature values of only 28 °C on average and should be used as the main control point with regards to temperature.

50|$|The four boilers have single divided {{furnaces}} {{and assisted}} circulation. Each has a {{maximum continuous rating}} of 1565 t/h (3,450,000 lb/h) and a design efficiency of 90.75%. Built by International Combustion, the design is similar in many respects {{to that of the}} now redundant 550 MW ICL boiler at Thorpe Marsh which had two furnaces with centre division walls. There are six stages of superheat and three stages of reheat in each boiler, with superheat and reheat stages mixed in position. As a result of operating experience on boilers of this size at Thorpe Marsh it was found that higher superheat temperatures and larger pressure drops than the design figures occurred in the boiler. New materials had to be employed for the superheat sections and the tube paths redesigned as a result. The boilers are 53.65 m (176 ft) high and the main suspension girders span 27.43 m (90 ft). The total downward thermal expansion is about 228 to 305 mm (9 to 12 in). The superheater output is at 569 °C 2,400 psi (165.5 bar). The reheater has inlet and outlet temperatures of 364 and 569 °C with an inlet pressure of 592 psi (40.82 bar) and steam flow of 1243 t/h (2,740,000 lb/h). The single steam drum weighs 162.6 tonne (160 tons). The furnace is tangentially fired with eight <b>burner</b> <b>boxes,</b> each with six burners, together with oil <b>burners</b> in each <b>box</b> for lighting up. Steam temperature control is by electrically operated tilting burners and by electro-hydraulically operated spray desuperheaters, giving a control range of 70 to 100% of the maximum continuous rating. There are four desuperheaters for each of the superheater and reheater circuits. The economisers have a heating surface of 44,970 m² (484,000 sq ft). There are two forced and two induced draught Davidson fans per boiler. The f.d. fans are driven by constant speed 1,300 hp motors at 596 rpm and are rated at 11,380 m³/min (402,000 (cu ft)/min). A saving in the overall size of the boiler house building, which measures 259.69 m (852 ft) long, 44.2 m (145 ft) wide and 60.05 m (197 ft) high, was achieved by arranging the pulverised fuel mills in two rows between adjacent boilers instead of in a line {{along the length of the}} boiler house as usual. This meant that coal conveyors at right angles to the trunk conveyor had to be installed for each line of mills, but the cost of these was more than offset by the saving in capital on the building. There are six roller type mills per boiler, each powered by a direct coupled 635 hp motor at 985 rpm The coal is fed to the mills by Lopulco chain feeders with induction regulator speed controllers.|$|R
50|$|After {{being turned}} down by every major Hollywood studio, English decided to develop the project as an {{independent}} film and approached Victoria Pearman, the president of Mick Jagger's production company, Jagged Films, who agreed to produce the film for Picturehouse. Pearman offered some plot suggestions, and English put {{the finishing touches on}} the seventh and final draft of the script. Upon the film's completion, it was shown to executives at Warner Bros., which had absorbed Picturehouse in the interim. Unimpressed, they put the film on the back <b>burner</b> until the <b>box</b> office success of Sex and the City convinced them there was an audience for an all-female film.|$|R
