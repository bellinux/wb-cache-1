40|$|Summary for non-specialistsTo {{correctly}} {{assess the}} demography-related risks facing public finances in the EU {{over the next}} couple of decades and establish adequate policy responses to the demographic, social and economic developments, it is essential to devise a reliable method to estimate future health care expenditure. To tackle this issue, the European Commission and the Economic Policy Committee projected future public health care expenditure in all EU Member States over the period 2007 - 2060. A unique internationally comparable database has been established and a model built allowing to project health care spending in a common, coherent framework of macroeconomic variables. The model incorporates the most recent developments in demography and epidemiology and draws on new insights from health economics, allowing the comparison of the challenges facing both individual countries' health care systems and European society in its entirety.

40|$|Since late 2003 in Senegal, {{voluntary}} tests, ARVs and CD 4 counts {{have been}} provided free of charge by the State {{within the framework of}} public health services. Debate now focuses on expanding free access to other components of care (consultations, hospitalizations, complementary exams for opportunistic infections). A preliminary study assessed the supplementary cost needed to fund all care and appraised this measure's impact on the national program. Direct costs for treatment were calculated using two different methods: (1) by calculating total expenditures for a sample of 299 patients over a 22 -month period (July 2003 to April 2005) treated by HAART (2 NRTI + 1 PI or NNRTI); and (2) by assessing the theoretical costs necessary to apply the national treatment protocols. Furthermore, national <b>budgetary</b> <b>projections</b> were analyzed to estimate possible margins available to officials. In 2006, the total cost of medical care for someone taking ARVs falls around 412 € per year; 84 % of the cost covers the price of ARVs and reagents for CD 4 counts. The total annual cost of medical care for a PLWHA who does not need ARV drugs is approximately 40 € per year, with 90 % of this amount covering biological exams. Projections concerning changes in the number of PLWHA and treatment needs and analysis of budget estimations for 2007 - 2011 demonstrate that supplementary costs incurred by complete free access could be easily covered without disrupting the proposed funding plan. Complete free access for medical care for all PLWHA in the country is therefore economically feasible; what remains is to define this decision's integration into the current paying health system without causing disturbances that render the decision ineffective.

Results show the effects of policy change on the main agricultural product markets for a ten-year horizon.

Accession supports orientation toward crop production, for which Central and East European countries (CEECs) become important net exporters. Livestock production would also benefit from accession, with beef and pork most likely to exhibit appreciable growth, driven by higher, postaccession prices. Production growth in the dairy sector is more limited under the accession scenario than under the baseline, due to milk quota introduction. Scenario results indicate that, in the aggregate, CEEC agriculture has less favorable growth potential if it remains outside the European Union and retains the policy instruments in place before accession. ...|$|R

Our <b>projections,</b> {{which are based on}} the macroeconomic and fiscal models developed at the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, suggest that the current path of fiscal policy is not sustainable. Substantial increases in the government´s fiscal surplus are needed in order to return to a regime in which the debt-to-GDP ratio will stabilize in several decades. Our base case analysis suggests that stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio at 45 percent by the year 2030 would require a 1. 8 percent of GDP reduction in the fiscal deficit, effective immediately. This assumes that the social security reforms introduced in the last Congress are enacted. If they are not, the required adjustment in the fiscal deficit is several percentage points greater.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} decade, {{pharmaceutical}} spending {{for patients with}} attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been escalating internationally. Objectives First, to estimate future trends of ADHD-related drug expenditures {{from the perspectives of}} the statutory health insurance (SHI; Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung, GKV) in Germany and the National Health Service (NHS) in England, respectively, for children and adolescents age 6 to 18 years. Second, to evaluate the budgetary impact on individual prescribers (child and adolescent psychiatrists and pediatricians treating patients with ADHD) in Germany. Methods A model was developed to predict plausible scenarios of future pharmaceutical expenditures for treatment of ADHD. Model inputs were derived from demographic and epidemiological data, a literature review of past spending trends, and an analysis of new pharmaceutical products in development for ADHD. Only products in clinical development phase III or later were considered. Uncertainty was addressed by way of scenario analysis. For each jurisdiction, five scenarios used different assumptions of future diagnosis prevalence, treatment prevalence, rates of adoption and unit costs of novel drugs, and treatment intensity. Results Annual ADHD pharmacotherapy expenditures for children and adolescents will further increase and may exceed € 310 m (D; E: ₤ 78 m) in 2012 (2002 : ~€ 21. 8 m; ~₤ 7. 0 m). During this period, overall drug spending by individual physicians may increase 2. 3 - to 9. 5 -fold, resulting from the multiplicative effects of four variables: increased number of diagnosed cases, growing acceptance and intensity of pharmacotherapy, and higher unit costs of novel medications. Discussion Even for an extreme low case scenario, a more than six-fold increase of pharmaceutical spending for children and adolescents is predicted over the decade from 2002 to 2012, from the perspectives of both the NHS in England and the GKV in Germany. This <b>budgetary</b> impact <b>projection</b> represents a partial analysis only because other expenditures are likely to rise as well, for instance those associated with physician services, including diagnosis and psychosocial treatment. Further to this, by definition budgetary impact analyses have little to nothing to say about clinical appropriateness and about value of money. Conclusion Providers of care for children and adolescents with ADHD should anticipate serious challenges related to the cost-effectiveness of interventions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cryptococcal {{meningitis}} is a {{major cause}} of mortality and morbidity in countries with high HIV prevalence, primarily affecting patients whose CD 4 are < = 100 cells/μl. Routine Cryptococcal Antigen (CrAg) screening is thus recommended in the South African HIV treatment guidelines for all patients with CD 4 counts < = 100 cells/μl, followed by pre-emptive anti-fungal therapy where CrAg results are positive. A laboratory-based reflexed CrAg screening approach, using a Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) on remnant EDTA CD 4 blood samples, was piloted at three CD 4 laboratories. This study aimed to assess the cost-per-result of laboratory-based reflexed CrAg screening at one pilot CD 4 referral laboratory. CD 4 test volumes from 2014 were extracted to estimate percentage of CD 4 < = 100 cells/μl. Daily average volumes were derived, assuming 12 months per/year and 21. 73 working days per/month. Costing analyses were undertaken using Microsoft Excel and Stata with a provider prospective. The cost-per-result was estimated using a bottom-up method, inclusive of test kits and consumables (reagents), laboratory equipment and technical effort costs. The ZAR/$ exchange of 14. 696 /$ 1 was used, where applicable. One-way sensitivity analyses on the cost-per-result were conducted for possible error rates (3 %- 8 %, reductions or increases in reagent costs as well as test volumes (ranging from - 60 % to + 60 %). The pilot CD 4 laboratory performed 267000 CD 4 tests in 2014; ~ 9. 3 % (27500) reported CD 4 < = 100 cells/μl, equivalent to 106 CrAg tests performed daily. A batch of 30 -tests could be performed in 1. 6 hours, including preparation and analysis time. A cost-per-result of $ 4. 28 was reported, with reagents contributing $ 3. 11 (72. 8 %), while technical effort and laboratory equipment overheads contributed $ 1. 17 (27. 2 %) and $ 0. 03 (< 1 %) respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses including increasing or decreasing test volumes by 60 % revealed a cost-per-result range of $ 3. 84 to $ 6. 03.

Much {{remains to be done}} to improve data reliability, particularly with respect to reporting of foreign-financed projects, but processes are in place to establish sustainable improvements in accounts reconciliation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the merits of}} the British budget management system that was inherited in Anglophone African countries and which has changed substantially in the United Kingdom since the 1960 s. It considers whether the disappointing budgetary performance in Africa is due to weaknesses in the inherited British system, other external influences, or domestic developments. It finds that all three factors {{have played a role in}} the widespread problems with budget management systems. Reforms in institutional arrangements are needed, especially in budget execution. Technical reforms will be ineffective unless there are concomitant changes to enhance accountability, improve governance, and increase compliance.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the factors {{that have to be}} {{considered}} when designing an aggregate expenditure ceiling. It is argued that expenditure ceilings are effective in promoting fiscal discipline and sustainability, but that a number of trade-offs have to be made when setting up a fiscal framework that will survive in a politically charged environment. The paper illustrates the discussion with a case study of medium-term aggregate expenditure ceilings in three countries: Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden.

40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} Observance of Standards and Codes on Fiscal Transparency for the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. Equatorial Guinea needs to improve {{transparency}} {{in many of}} the important elements of the Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency, but a basis is being established to implement key fiscal transparency practices. An improved legal framework for fiscal management, in harmony with regional partners, has been put in place, notably through the 2003 Public Finance Law and the 2004 Tax Code. The authorities at the highest level have also indicated their commitment to improving fiscal transparency.

40|$|Several {{features}} of Tanzania''s budget system find {{their roots in}} the arrangements inherited from the United Kingdom. These include a legal framework that emphasizes accountability; a cabinet of ministers with strong budget decision-making powers; a parliament with very limited budget powers; and a similar external audit organization. In both countries, budget execution is decentralized to individual ministries, with accounting officers responsible to a parliamentary accounts committee. These similarities are blended with contrasts, including in Tanzania: a presidential system of government, one dominant political party, a written constitution, and some fragmentation in central budget decision-making within the executive.
