50|$|The Kootenay International Junior Hockey League {{was founded}} in 1966 as the West Kootenay Junior Hockey League. Five teams joined the league {{in its first year}} and started play in the 1967-68 season. They {{included}} the Trail Jr. Smoke Eaters, the Nelson Plaza Oilers, the Castlegar Apollos, the Grand <b>Forks</b> <b>Border</b> Bruins, and the Rossland Warriors. The Smoke Eaters won the inaugural league championship, advancing to the provincial championship. The next year, Castlegar would withdraw from the league, leaving only four teams. In 1971-72, the Spokane Valley Kings and Cranbrook Colts joined the league, raising the quantity of teams to six, and incorporating an American team for the first time. Furthermore, the Nelson Plaza Oilers were renamed the Nelson Leafs. For 1972-73, the league was rebranded the Kootenay International Junior Hockey League. In this season, the Kimberley Knights joined the league, while the Grand <b>Forks</b> <b>Border</b> Bruins took a leave of absence. In 1973-74 the league expanded again, incorporating a Fernie-based team. The league did not expand for many years after this point, during a period dominated by the Colts. The next expansion occurred in 1976-77, when the Creston Clippers and the Castlegar Rebels joined the league, and the Rebels won the league championship in their debut season.

40|$|The optic tecta of surgically {{produced}} three-eyed tadpoles were chronically {{exposed to}} the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist aminophosphonovaleric acid (APV), or to NMDA itself, to assess the influence of NMDA receptor/channels on the eye-specific segregation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) terminals that occurs whenever two retinas innervate one tectal lobe. Exposure of the tectum to the active isomer of APV produces desegregation of the RGC terminals without blocking electrical activity in the afferents or altering their terminal arbor morphology. Exposure to the inactive isomer of APV causes no perturbation of the normal stripe pattern. APV-induced desegregation is completely reversible within 2 weeks of removal of the APV. In addition, exposure of the optic tectum to NMDA results in stripes with sharper <b>borders</b> and fewer <b>forks</b> and fusions than untreated animals.

50|$|SR 86 was {{originally}} designated in 1930, between Willcox and Bowie.

From 1927 to 1960, {{the remainder of the}} bypass between the Arizona <b>border</b> and Road <b>Forks,</b> New Mexico was served by New Mexico State Road 14. SR 86 was further extended through Tucson and the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation to Ajo in 1943. SR 85 was extended south from Ajo to Lukeville in 1955, establishing a concurrency with SR 86 to Why. In 1970, SR 86 had its eastern end truncated to US 89 (later I-19 Business) in Tucson after being replaced by I-10 between Tucson and New Mexico. In 1991, the concurrency with SR 85 between Ajo and Why was removed, truncating the western end of SR 86 to Why.

5|$|The largest fire in {{the park}} was the North Fork fire, {{both in terms of}} damage to {{structures}} and of area burned. The fire started on July 22 when a man cutting timber dropped his cigarette in Caribou-Targhee National Forest just outside the park's western <b>border.</b> The North <b>Fork</b> fire was the only major fire that was fought from the beginning since it started after the prescribed fire policy was halted on July 15. The fire spread towards the northeast {{and by the end of}} the first week of August was threatening Madison Junction and nearby campground facilities. The fire then raced towards Norris Junction on August 20. Firefighters there used water and foam to keep the structures from being consumed by the blaze. The fire continued its eastward advance along the Yellowstone Plateau and on August 25 reached visitor facilities at Canyon, where land management agencies and the U.S. military put forth enormous efforts to protect structures. The eastern flank of the fire calmed down for several days, then down-sloping winds off the Yellowstone Plateau forced flames along the west side of the fire towards the town of West Yellowstone, Montana. There, private citizens assisted assigned personnel in soaking hundreds of acres of forestland to protect both the town and an electrical power substation. The fire burned a substantial section of forest along the Madison River valley.|$|R

The following seasons, the Rockets gradually dropped further in the standings as the East Division expanded, finishing third in 1993-94, fourth in 1994-95, and fifth in 1995-96. The following season, the Rockets improved greatly, finishing second in the newly renamed Eddie Mountain Division, with a record of 22-18-1, behind only the Columbia Valley Rockies. The following season, the Rockets dropped to third, with a record of 26-24-0, behind Columbia Valley and the Revelstoke Grizzlies. In 1998-99, the Rockets would finish last in the Eddie Mountain Division, and third last in the league, ahead of only the Spokane Braves and Grand <b>Forks</b> <b>Border</b> Bruins overall. Their form dropped further in 1999-00, finishing with a record of 9-35-2, last in the Eddie Mountain Division. The following year the Rockets struggled again, missing the playoffs for a third consecutive year. In 2001-02, however, the Rockets qualified for the playoffs {{due to the fact that}} every team in the Eddie Mountain Division made the playoffs that season, and lost 4-0 to the Rockies in the first round.

40|$|The Bear River is the single-most {{important}} {{contributor of}} stream {{flow to the}} closed-basin Great Salt Lake, and represents the only future potential for additional storage capacity (i. e., water development) in northern Utah and the Wasatch front. Originating in the western Uinta Mountains of Utah, the Bear River flows into Wyoming, back into Utah, then Wyoming again, before crossing into southeastern Idaho and entering Utah one last time before terminating in the right arm of the Great Salt Lake. Not surprisingly, water management during the settlement period on the Bear is complex and diversions and flow-through not readily quantified or monitored. Despite the Bear River’s importance for rural, urban, and wildlife (Bear River Migratory Refuge) water delivery, we lack sufficient understanding outside the historical record of the potential variability in stream flow for this River. As {{part of a larger}} effort to understand regional hydroclimatic variability, the Wasatch Dendroclimatology Research Group has undertaken a massive effort to collect paleoclimate proxies (i. e., tree rings) that characterize precipitation and stream flow. Over two-dozen tree-ring chronologies were screened as predictors of Bear River stream flow for two gages the Utah-Wyoming <b>border,</b> and Smith’s <b>Fork.</b> These gages were selected based on their length and relatively unaltered flow regimes. Preliminary regression models explained over 60 % of the variability in historical stream flows, and resulting reconstructions extended ~ 600 and ~ 400 years for Utah-Wyoming and Smith’s Fork, respectively. While the gages were separated by only ~ 60 km there were substantial high-frequency differences in the flow regimes over the past 400 years. Conversely, as expected there were strong similarities in low-frequency variability that likely reflected the region’s dominant weather patterns, which deliver the majority of precipitation from the west during the winter. While the 1930 s drought (1936) and the early 2000 s drought (2004) served as the drought-of-record for Bear Lake, (downstream from both gages) there were multiple instances of longer and more intense droughts in the paleoclimate record. The longer record provides additional insight for water management planning, and may help to portend future water shortages. Comparison of Bear River stream flow to recent reconstructions of the Logan River, Weber River, and the Great Salt Lake level provided a larger context for intra-regional precipitation variability. While low-frequency patterns appeared coherent, there were important differences in year-to-year variability across a latitudinal gradient, which we hypothesized were, at least in part, driven by an intransient teleconnection to the central Pacific (i. e., El Nino-Southern Oscillation). Additionally, overall similarity in mutli-decadal variability among the reconstruction data sets was correlated to climate forcing from the north Pacific...|$|R
