40|$|Carcases {{from the}} Beef CRC animals {{slaughtered}} until July 1997 were sectioned into 17 primal cuts and trimmed to retail specifications to allow retail beef yield percent to be computed. Animals from later kills {{had only a}} limited bone-out in which 9 cuts trimmed to wholesale specifications were weighed. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop an equation that uses hot carcase weight and a reduced set of wholesale primal cut weights to accura ely predict retail beef yield percent. Separate analyses were performed for temperate and tropically adapted breeds, and for pasture and grain finished carcases. Prediction models were investigated using all possible combinations of cuts. Mean square errors were used to determine the best subset of cuts. Only 4 primal cuts (<b>blade,</b> <b>eye</b> round, tenderloin, and topside) and the carcase weight appeared in the final equation which resulted in predicted retail beef yield with a genetic correlation of 0. 92 with actual retail beef yield...|$|E

5|$|True to its name, the winghead shark's cephalofoil {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} long, narrow, and gently swept-back blades. The width of the cephalofoil is equal to 40–50% of the shark's total length. The front of the cephalofoil has a slight indentation in the middle and a gentle bump on each side in front of the nostrils. Each nostril is roughly twice as long as the width of the mouth and extends along almost the entire leading margin of each <b>blade.</b> The circular <b>eyes,</b> located at the forward outer corners of the cephalofoil, are equipped with protective nictitating membranes. The relatively small, arched mouth contains 15–16 upper and 14 lower tooth rows on each side, and sometimes also a single row of tiny teeth at the upper and/or lower symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are small and smooth-edged, with angled triangular cusps. Five pairs of gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin origins.|$|R
50|$|Soon, Jothi asks Arul to {{join his}} gang and meet him at a secluded place. When Arul waits for the {{opportunity}} to gun down Jothi, he gets beaten up by his men. It is then revealed that Usha (Hansika Motwani), his neighbour who has a huge crush on him, had been secretly recording videos of him on her phone, for her to admire. But her phone is stolen and it falls into the hands of Jothi's men. They find whom Arul has been meeting and dealing with so far and they come to know that he is also an undercover cop. As a result, Arul's bosses Bharathi and Benjamin are assassinated by Jothi's men. Jothi and his men then beat Arul savagely and keep him bound in a harbour and ask him the whereabouts of Sharma's remaining 900 kg of heroin. Arul whispers the location and as Jothi comes closer to hear him, Arul spits out a <b>blade</b> at Jothi's <b>eye.</b> When all his men are distracted momentarily, Arul escapes from his captors and kills them leaving Jothi alone and arrests him. Since nobody alive has seen Jothi in person, his arrest is unavoidable and no political influence will work out anymore.|$|R
40|$|Beef {{prime rib}} is a {{delicacy}} cooked at low temperatures for long period and extended hot holding prior to consumption. Due {{to the potential}} survival and outgrowth of foodborne pathogens, this process may pose a public health risk. Considering {{an increase in the}} availability of non-intact beef, the microbial safety of the preparation of prime rib from intact and mechanically tenderized beef was evaluated. In the first study, lethality of the prime rib (from intact and non-intact, blade tenderized beef) cooking process to Salmonella spp. was evaluated. Boneless beef rib eye was surface inoculated with a five-strain cocktail of Salmonella spp. to obtain ca. 5. 9 log CFU/g. The inoculated blade tenderized subprimals were passed with the fat side facing the blades to prepare non-intact beef rib eye. The subprimals were seared for 15 min at 260 °C, cooked at 121 °C to internal temperatures of either 37. 8 or 48. 9 °C and held at 60 °C for up to 8 h. The searing of <b>blade</b> tenderized rib <b>eye</b> resulted in 0. 63 log CFU/g reduction in Salmonella spp. and cooking to internal temperatures of 37. 8 and 48. 9 °C resulted in 2. 86 and 3. 58 log CFU/g reduction in Salmonella spp., respectively. Subsequent holding of the blade tenderized prime rib at an oven temperature of 60 °C for 8 h resulted in an increase of 1. 99 log CFU/g in Salmonella spp. population. Thermal processing of intact rib eye resulted in 5. 22 and 5. 54 log CFU/g reduction of Salmonella spp. population after cooking to 37. 8 and 48. 9 °C respectively. Subsequent holding at 60 °C during 8 h resulted in an increase in Salmonella spp. population of 1. 07 and 0. 44 log CFU/g, respectively. In the second study, the growth of C. perfringens during hot holding and cooling was evaluated. Ground rib eye was dispensed in 5 -g pouches, inoculated to obtain 2. 5 spores/g of C. perfringens, and vacuum-packaged. C. perfringens spores were heat activated and the pouches with the inoculated meat were held at 43 or 49 °C. Hot holding of inoculated rib eye resulted in germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens spores by 6. 5 and 6. 05 log CFU/g. Abusive cooling of cooked prime rib from 57. 2 to 5 °C within 6, 9, 12, and 15 h resulted in C. perfringens spore germination and outgrowth by 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8, and 2. 2 log CFU/g respectively. Use of non-intact rib eye can pose an enhanced risk of foodborne illness when prime rib is cooked to low end point temperatures, held for extended periods of times at these low temperatures, and cooled at slow rates.
