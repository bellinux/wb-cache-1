40|$|Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{networks}} work on {{the presumption}} that all nodes in the network are connectable. However, NAT boxes and firewalls prevent connections to many nodes on the Internet. For UDP based protocols, the UDP hole-punching technique has been proposed to mitigate this problem. This paper presents {{a study of the}} efficacy of UDP <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> on the Internet {{in the context of an}} actual P 2 P network. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has provided similar measurements. Our results show that UDP <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> is an effective method to increase the connectability of peers on the Internet: approximately 64 % of all peers are behind a NAT box or firewall which should allow <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> to work, and more than 80 % of <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> attempts between these peers succeed.

However, when used with modulation schemes such as {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the resulting polar drive signals suffer from expanded bandwidth.

This paper theoretically analyses the <b>hole</b> <b>punch</b> method and quantifies adjacent channel interference (ACI) and the error vector magnitude (EVM) caused by the ensuing distortion.
