From the first of its 900-odd pages, I knew, and my friends at the University of Sussex knew, that this was something else. We talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue. Imagine that: young male students more interested in a book than in gooseberry tart and custard.|$|E
500|$|Four Jeremy {{letters were}} written at about 1910 to Drew Fayle who thought Jeremy should marry. In one letter, Sir Isaac {{promises}} Master Fayle {{a piece of}} wedding cake should Jeremy marry and, in another letter, Ptolemy writes that Jeremy's parties [...] "would be much more agreeable {{if there were a}} lady to preside at the table." [...] Jeremy writes in the third letter: [...] "When I <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> sprigged waistcoat & my maroon tail-coat I had hopes ... but I am alone ... if there were a 'Mrs. Jeremy Fisher' she might object to snails. It is some satisfaction {{to be able to have}} as much water & mud in the house as a person likes." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his playing}} career, Maxwell {{received}} several offers to turn professional. [...] the National Hockey Association's Toronto Blueshirts offered him $1,500 {{to join their}} team, while representatives of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association made an offer of $1,800 the following season. [...] He turned both offers down, preferring to remain an amateur. His feelings on what constituted an amateur player were so strong that he quit playing hockey following the 1915 Allan Cup as {{the nature of the}} senior game at the time failed to meet his expectations: [...] "When I played, I <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> own skates and boots. When I found out some of the others were getting paid, I quit." ...|$|E

500|$|Spacey said Meek was [...] "not a hired writer" [...] on Beyond the Sea. [...] "He {{turned in}} a draft, {{but it was a}} draft based on earlier {{material}} based on my own screenplays," [...] Spacey commented. Meek said he was hired by producer Harvey Friedman, a friend who stood up at his wedding and helped connect him with Spacey, with whom he claims to have produced 12 drafts, including one that was reported by Variety to have received a greenlight from MGM in early 2003. [...] "He <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> material and then acted like I didn't exist," [...] Meek explained. [...] "I'm not saying I'm Rembrandt, but it's like someone buying a painting and then scratching the name off of it and putting their own there." ...|$|E
500|$|Brett Ratner {{was hired}} to direct in September 2002, {{originally}} expressing an interest in casting an unknown for the lead role, while filming was to start sometime in late 2003. Christopher Reeve joined as project consultant, citing Tom Welling, who portrayed the teenage Clark Kent in Smallville, as an ideal candidate. Reeve added [...] "the character {{is more important than}} the actor who plays him, because it is an enduring mythology. It definitely should be an unknown." [...] Ratner approached Josh Hartnett, Jude Law, Paul Walker and Brendan Fraser for Superman, but conceded that finding a famous actor for the title role had proven difficult because of contractual obligations to appear in sequels. [...] "No star wants to sign that, but as much as I've told Jude and Josh my vision for the movie, I've warned them of the consequences of being Superman. They'll live this character for 10 years because I'm telling one story over three movies and plan to direct all three if the first is as successful as everyone suspects." [...] Hartnett in particular was offered $100million for a three-picture deal. Walker explained that [...] "I could have made a gazillion dollars on that franchise. I could probably have <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> own fleet of jets or my own island. You know what? I don't need it." [...] David Boreanaz, Victor Webster and Ashton Kutcher auditioned, along with Keri Russell as Lois Lane, but Kutcher decided not to pursue the role, citing scheduling conflicts with That '70s Show, the Superman curse and fear of typecasting, while Boreanaz had to back out due to obligations with Angel. James Marsden stated in a 2006 interview that at one point he was approached by Ratner. Although it was never formally announced, Matt Bomer confirmed he was in the running for the lead role, being Ratner's preferred choice at the time. Bomer would later voice the character in the 2013 animated film [...] Amy Adams had also auditioned for Lois Lane, and would eventually win the role eight years later when she was cast in Man of Steel.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Saatchi, who {{was best}} known as the most high-profile, high-spending {{collector}} of contemporary British art, <b>bought</b> <b>My</b> Bed (1998) for £150,000 ($248,000) from Lehmann Maupin's [...] "Every Part of Me's Bleeding," [...] the exhibition that won the artist a nomination for the 1999 Turner Prize. In 2013, on the occasion of a Christie's London sale that raised a total of 3.1million pounds ($5million) in aid of the Saatchi Gallery's policy of free entry, To Meet My Past (2002) sold for $778,900, establishing a new record for the artist. At another Christie's auction in 2014, My Bed was sold to White Cube founding director Jay Jopling for 2.5million pounds, including buyer's commission, once again to benefit the Saatchi Gallery's foundation. It was estimated that the price of My Bed would sell between 800,000 and 1.2 million pounds. Before the sale, Emin said that [...] "what I would really love is that someone did buy it and they donated it to the Tate." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1951, Foley {{was pleased}} when the popular Andrews Sisters (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) flew from Hollywood to Nashville {{to join him}} for a two-day {{recording}} session, both acts hoping to repeat the previous successes that the sisters enjoyed when they teamed with Burl Ives in 1947 and Ernest Tubb in 1949, producing both folk and country hits. While the results proved to be less popular, the ten tunes recorded were vocally well-executed and received {{a good deal of}} play on the country radio stations. The songs included the rhythmic [...] "Satins and Lace," [...] the rockabilly-flavored novelty [...] "Where Is Your Wandering Mother Tonight?," [...] a very slow rendering of the forlorn hillbilly classic [...] "Bury Me Beneath the Willow," [...] two duets by Foley and Patty Andrews, and two country gospel favorites: [...] "It Is No Secret (What God Can Do)" [...] and [...] "He <b>Bought</b> <b>My</b> Soul at Calvary." ...|$|E
2500|$|The former cabinet-maker did not {{restrict}} {{himself to}} the income from the Lord Mayor of London. In fact, his famous words: [...] "What do you think I <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> place for, but {{to make the most}} of it?" [...] used to justify his crimes, describe the readiness with which he embraced his [...] "duties". Not being the first to use the position as a form of legal theft, he regularised the practice. He had probably acted as a middleman or receiver between thieves and victims several years before taking the post, otherwise it would be difficult to explain his familiarity with London's underworld. He made full use of his authority as a leverage to build or extend his thief-taking business and stayed as a middleman in it. Hitchen managed to regulate about 2000 thieves and organise for them to steal and fence the stolen merchandise through him, a practice pickpockets would find more profitable or less dangerous than going to a pawnbroker, since most desperate victims of the theft were ready to pay a fee negotiated by the [...] "finder" [...] (Hitchen) for the return of their stolen items.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson {{wanted to}} {{purchase}} the Ford GT after admiring its inspiration, the Ford GT40 race cars of the 1960s. Clarkson was able to secure {{a place on the}} shortlist for the few cars that would be imported to Britain to official customers, only through knowing Ford's head of PR through a previous job. After waiting years and facing an increased price, he found many technical problems with the car. After [...] "the most miserable month's motoring possible," [...] he returned it to Ford for a full refund. After a short period, including asking Top Gear fans for advice over the Internet, he bought back his GT. He called it [...] "the most unreliable car ever made", because he was never able to complete a return journey with it. In 2006, Clarkson ordered a Gallardo Spyder and sold the Ford GT to make way for it. In August 2008, he sold the Gallardo because [...] "idiots in Peugeots kept trying to race [...] in it". In October, he announced that he had sold his Volvo XC90. In January 2009, in a review of the car printed in The Times, he wrote: [...] "I’ve just <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> third Volvo XC90 in a row and the simple fact is this: it takes six children to school in the morning." ...|$|E
