5|$|Nansen's {{farthest}} north record {{lasted for}} just over five years. On 24 April 1900 {{a party of}} three from an Italian expedition led by the Duke of the Abruzzi reached 86°34′N, having left Franz Josef Land with dogs and sledges on 11 March. The party <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back; one of their support groups of three men vanished entirely.|$|E
5|$|Charlie has <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{into his}} new flat in London {{when his father}} dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy. The factory makes good quality men's shoes, {{but they are not}} stylish and not cheap, and the market for them is drying up. Charlie is {{determined}} to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), the session got interrupted shortly after it had started, as Felipe Nasr came to a halt at the exit of the tunnel, caused by an engine failure. A red flag came out while the car was cleared off the track. When the running resumed, all drivers except for the two at Force India went out on the ultrasoft tyres to set their first lap times. Max Verstappen was the last to set a representative time, but touched the guardrail at the swimming pool chicane and crashed into the wall, causing another red flag period. As the session got back under way, it were the two Manor cars of Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein, as well as Jolyon Palmer and Marcus Ericsson who joined Nasr and Verstappen on the sidelines, as they were eliminated. Kevin Magnussen meanwhile <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> into Q2, but was under investigation for exiting the pit lane while it was closed.|$|E
2500|$|Under Omani Arabs Zanzibar became East Africa's main slave port, {{with as many}} as 50,000 enslaved Africans {{passing through}} every year during the 19th century. Some historians {{estimate}} that between 11 and 18 million African slaves crossed the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Sahara Desert from 650 to 1900 AD. Eduard Rüppell described the losses of Sudanese slaves being transported on foot to Egypt: [...] "after the Daftardar bey's 1822 campaign in the southern Nuba mountains, nearly 40,000 slaves were captured. However, through bad treatment, disease and desert travel <b>barely</b> 5000 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to Egypt.." ...|$|R
50|$|Théodred {{offers the}} Rangers Saeradan and Radanir help in rescuing their captive friends and avenging the betrayal. The player and Rohirrim storm {{the village of}} traitors and rescue many Rangers, {{including}} Halbarad and the sons of Elrond. Yet they are still outnumbered - {{the leader of the}} traitorous clan gloats over Ranger's weaknesses and allows them to leave, telling them to spread the tale of how the Falcon-clan beat them. Of almost 60 named Rangers <b>barely</b> 30 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> out alive: Halbarad takes an oath to avenge the traitors and proclaims himself in eternal debt to Théodred, before planning the next move.|$|R
50|$|Speaking of her {{teaching}} career in high school, she always broke from tradition {{and followed her}} own creative approach to her work, like preparing materials {{way out of the}} text books, taking after school lessons and designing unconventional science labs. The results that followed always proved outstanding: one hundred percent students sailed through exams when <b>barely</b> forty percent <b>made</b> <b>it</b> before she taught the class. And this miracle indeed happened in a school at South Bronx, considered one of the poorest congressional districts in New York.|$|R
5|$|The Yankees {{scored the}} first {{run of the}} game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth solo home run into the right field bleachers. In the {{following}} half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3–1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell just <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base. All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.|$|E
5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason {{trying to find out}} which veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed to be set as the team got lost in the Houston Astrodome when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes trying to find their way out, and <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out with solid defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began to set in. They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense {{spent a lot of time}} on the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency of the offense to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving their offense the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the season, Coca-Cola {{struggled}} throughout the conference due to its depleted lineup but had its share of surprising wins over Red Bull and Sta. Lucia among others. The Tigers <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the wildcard phase with a 5-13 record.|$|E

She achieved All American status in both events as a freshman in 1984. ASU alumni Ria Stalman and Leslie Deniz went on to take gold and silver in the discus at the 1984 Olympics. Still <b>barely</b> 18, Kaaiawahia <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the Olympic Trials at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum just 30 miles (50 km) from Fullerton. Her final throw was estimated to be about 56 feet (over 17 meters), which would have been enough to qualify for the Olympics, but the throw was ruled a foul. The third slot went to another Southern California star Ramona Pagel with a [...] Kaaiawahia's best was [...] in fifth place.|$|R
500|$|In late May 1879, the Republican-leaning Cincinnati Gazette {{reported}} on Blackburn's alleged plot to infect northern cities with yellow fever during the Civil War, apparently {{the first time}} the incident had been reported in Kentucky. The newspaper formed a special department {{for the sole purpose of}} investigating the claims against Blackburn and published a daily column in which it related the department's findings. In the wake of the Gazettes investigation, other Northern newspapers, including the Canton Repository, Cleveland Herald, and Philadelphia Press, derided Kentuckians for even considering the election of Blackburn (who they nicknamed [...] "Dr. Blackvomit"). The scandal gained more traction nationally than in Kentucky. Blackburn did not respond to the accusations, and Kentucky Republicans <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> mention of <b>it,</b> knowing that the northern press in general and the Cincinnati Gazette in particular were widely distrusted in the state. Kentucky newspaper editor Henry Watterson opined that most Kentuckians already knew about Blackburn's Civil War activities and either explicitly approved of them or were apathetic about events that had occurred a decade and a half earlier.|$|R

25|$|The Board {{ultimately}} {{ruled that}} Sullenberger {{had made the}} correct decision, reasoning that the checklist for dual-engine failure is designed for higher altitudes, when pilots {{have more time to}} deal with the situation, and that while simulations showed that the plane might have just <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to LaGuardia, those scenarios assumed an instant decision to do so, with no time allowed for assessing the situation.|$|E
25|$|After forcing Cleveland to punt on {{the opening}} drive of overtime, Elway led the Broncos 60 yards to set up Karlis' game winning 33-yard field goal. The key play of the drive was a 28-yard {{completion}} to Steve Watson on third down and 12 at midfield. Two carries by Sammy Winder then moved {{the ball to the}} 16-yard line where Karlis made his game winning kick, which <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> inside the left upright.|$|E
5000|$|Though not as {{successful}} as the [...] "Nightshift" [...] single, two other tracks from the album were released. Regarded as an out-of-the-ordinary track for the Commodores, [...] "Animal Instinct", with Orange on lead vocals, was released almost six months after [...] "Nightshift", and reached #23 on the R&B charts, and only #43 on the pop charts.The single, [...] "Janet," [...] <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> Billboard's Top 100 and never <b>made</b> <b>it</b> into the R&B top 50.

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{ruled that}} Sullenberger made the correct {{decision}} in {{landing on the}} river instead of attempting return to LaGuardia because the normal procedures for engine loss are designed for cruising altitudes, not immediately after takeoff. Simulations showed that Flight 1549 could have <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to LaGuardia had that maneuver begun immediately after the bird strike, but this scenario completely neglects {{the time needed to}} understand what had happened and assess the situation.|$|E
25|$|The 1977–1978 team {{literally}} {{saved the}} franchise from bankruptcy and oblivion. Managed by Rene Lacheman, and {{provided with a}} powerful lineup that featured Ron LeFlore, Jim Dwyer, Kurt Bevacqua and José Manuel Morales in the 1-4 spots, the team <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the playoffs, to consequently sweep the semi-final and final series. The final game for the series had Mayagüez beat the coincidentally named Bayamón Cowboys with a score of 18-2. The team eventually made it to Mazatlán, Mexico, where it won the 1978 Caribbean World Series.|$|E

Garcia spent {{the next few weeks}} sleeping where friends would allow, eventually using his car as a home. Through Grant, Garcia met Dave McQueen in February, who, after hearing Garcia perform some blues, introduced him to local people and to the Chateau, a rooming house located near Stanford University which was then a popular hangout.|$|E

25|$|Operation Queen was {{not able}} to meet its {{sophisticated}} goals. At the beginning of the offensive, Allied planners envisioned for the offensive to be just a staging point for a deep penetration over the Rur into Germany to the Rhine. After one month of heavy fighting the Americans had <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the Rur. No bridgehead over the river had been made, the Germans still held some portions west of the river and the important Rur dams were still in German hands, threatening any further offensive operations. Even without knowing the upcoming German offensive, Allied planners estimated the earliest date for a large thrust into Germany for mid-January.|$|E
25|$|The {{fight was}} signed for May 22, 1993, and was staged at RFK Stadium in Washington, DC. Ferguson {{came into the}} fight below 230 pounds {{for the first time}} in years and was {{considered}} to be in the best shape of his career. Because the IBF did not consider Ferguson to be a legitimate contender, they would not sanction the defense for Bowe and only the WBA and lineal championships were on the line. Ferguson thought he had a legitimate chance to knock the champion out, but Bowe disregarded his boasts. Ferguson was knocked down toward the end of the first round and <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to his feet at the bell, then was dropped again as the second round began and knocked out.|$|E
25|$|In a tight Sweet Sixteen contest, the top-seeded Tar Heels <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the Regional Finals. The entire {{game was}} officiated closely—the first {{television}} timeout came after Villanova garnered its fifth personal foul, and two phantom fouls {{led to the}} disqualification from the game of North Carolina star Raymond Felton with under five minutes left. Fifth-seeded Villanova stuck with UNC despite falling behind 64-54 with 3:45 left in the game. The Wildcats stormed back to cut the lead to 66-63. With eleven seconds left Allan Ray drove the lane, received contact as he made a basket, but was called for a travel on the play. On the ensuing possession, Villanova immediately fouled. Rashad McCants then made a free throw to seal the North Carolina victory.|$|E

25|$|Feeling {{confident}} in his army after defeating the Union at Second Bull Run, Lee {{embarked on an}} invasion of the north that was stopped by McClellan at the bloody Battle of Antietam. Despite this, McClellan was relieved from command for refusing to pursue Lee's crippled army. The next commander, General Ambrose Burnside, suffered a humiliating defeat by Lee's smaller army at the Battle of Fredericksburg late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, while losing his top aide, Stonewall Jackson. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause war-weariness in the North. In perhaps the turning point of the war, Lee's army was badly beaten at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3, 1863, and <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to Virginia.|$|E

Soon afterward, Koniecpolski was defeated by the Tatars near Orynin, where he committed the mistake of pursuing the enemy against overwhelming odds and <b>barely</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> out of the battle alive.

25|$|On 23 June, Villaret and Vignolo sailed from Limassol, {{with two}} war galleys {{and four other}} vessels, {{carrying}} a force of 35 Knights, six Levantine horsement, and 500 foot soldiers. To them were added some Genoese ships. The expedition first put in at Kastellorizo, whence Vignolo went ahead to reconnoitre Rhodes. The locals were warned, however, by a Greek serving the Order, and Vignolo <b>barely</b> escaped and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to rendezvous with Villaret. In the meantime, two Knights with fifty men had captured the castle of Kos, but were evicted again by Byzantine reinforcements. The allies then sailed to Rhodes. The chronicles of Amadi and Bustron provide the most detailed account of subsequent events: a first assault on the city of Rhodes by land and sea failed, but on 20 September, the Hospitallers captured the (probably deserted) Feraklos Castle on the island's eastern coast. Five days later they launched another unsuccessful attack on the city, which resisted until November. On 11 November, they took the citadel of Filerimos (ancient Ialysos) through the treason of a local Greek; the garrison of 300 Turks was massacred.|$|R
