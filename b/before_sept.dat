40|$|Trois contes are {{the only}} tales in Flaubert's work. But when he was young, he sopke {{repeatedly}} of his planto write the oriental tale in his letters and he wrote the draft, Les Sept fils du Derviche : le conte de desert. In view of that, we will explore the relation of these two tales. At first, we find that Flaubert wrote {{the first version of}} a novel La Tentation de Saint Antoine just <b>before</b> Les <b>Sept</b> fils du Derviche, and La Tentation de Saint Antoine before Trois contes. So this visionary story is considered to have affected two tales. In addition to that, some characters in Les Sept fils du Derviche are seen in each tale of the Trois contes. For example, Saint Julian is similar to Iban who is a spirituarist. From the viewpoint of bourgeois life, the family of Aubain in Un coeur simple is analogous to that of Zeïn, and Aulus, roman emperor as famous devourer in Hérodias to Hassan. Given the above points, we can consider that Trois contes aren’t the small sketches suddenly written for the reason that Flaubert couldn’t continue writing his grand roman, Bouvard et Pecuchet, but that they belong to the school of the works as La Tentation de Saint Antoine and L’Education sentimentale, to which he applied his whole life...|$|R

This theory says news produced by and about core countries dominates news about the periphery. It therefore would predict a shift in the balance of news flow in response to Sept. 11, because an event with such significance to the United States and its interests around the world would tend to make coverage more “U. S. centric” and reporting on other countries would be marginalized or pushed out of the news flow. Statistical analysis of the number of news stories about more than 150 countries published in elite newspapers over a two-year period found support for the theorized view that Third World coverage was adversely affected after Sept. 11, which can be interpreted as evidence of structural imperialism having an impact on news flow...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} which material and technique were the best for bonding 3 x 3 lingual retainer. One hundred and five bovine mandibular incisors were used, to which contention bars with a standardized size of 7 mm were bonded to the lingual surface. Initially all teeth received prophylaxis with pumice stone and water. After this they were randomly divided into seven groups, denominated and characterized as follows: Group (1) bars bonded with Transbond XT in accordance with the manufacturerÕs instructions; (2) Tooth surface etching with self-etching agent Transbond (SEPT) followed by bonding with Transbond XT; (3) Bonding with Transbond Plus Color Change (TPCC) without adhesive; (4) Bonding with TPCC + SEPT; (5) Bonding with restorative composite Z 100 + adhesive Prime Bond, (6) Z 100 without adhesive and (7) Z 100 + <b>SEPT.</b> <b>Before</b> bonding in Groups 1, 3, 5 and 6 the lingual surface was etched with 37 % phosphoric acid for 20 seconds, followed by washing and drying. After bonding the mechanical tests were performed in a Universal mechanical test machine. The values obtained were submitted to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and afterwards to the Tukey test (p< 0. 05). We observed absence of statistical differences among Groups 1, 2, 5 and 7 and among Groups 3, 4, 5 and 6 (p< 0. 05). Group 1 presented the highest bond strength value and Group 6 the lowest. It could be concluded that where bonding of lingual retainer is concerned; the best material to use is Transbond XT irrespective of the etching method, followed by composite Z 100 etched with SEPT.

The experiment was conducted at Clarksville Horticultural Experimental Station (Michigan State Univ.) on 9 -year-old ‘Imperial Gala’ apple trees on M- 9 (n = 36). During the summer (20 June) after June drop, yield was adjusted according to different number of fruit per trunk cross sectional area (TCSA) to obtain three crop load levels: high (13. 5 fruit/TCSA), medium (7. 1 fruit/TCSA), and low (2. 1 fruit/TCSA). Each crop load level was defoliated (25 %) three times during the season (8 July, 25 and 19 Aug.) leaving three thinned trees for each level of crop load un-defoliated as control treatment. Spur canopy daily assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), internal CO 2 concentration (Ci), fruit growth and shoot length were measured at weekly intervals after crop load adjustment until harvest, and 1 week <b>before</b> harvest (14 <b>Sept.),</b> Chl and nitrogen leaf content was also determined. A in high cropping trees was not affected by defoliation at any time, however in medium and low cropping trees there was an increase from 5 % to 20 % at each time after 3 days from defoliation. A was higher during the season (from 10 to 18 %) in high cropping trees than in medium and low cropping trees. The total Chl and nitrogen was lower in low cropping trees than in medium and high cropping trees and not affected by defoliation, as well as total yield, fruit diameter and shoot length. Results reveal compensation capacity of spur leaves subtending the fruits in medium and low cropping trees. This indicates that leaf photosynthesis compensation to leaf damage occurs without reduction in fruit diameter or total yield per tree...|$|R

We correlated HRs for overall survival and PFS, weighted by sample size or by precision of the HR estimate, assuming fixed and random effects. We did sensitivity analyses according to presence of crossover, trial size, and dacarbazine dose. FINDINGS: After screening 1649 reports and meeting abstracts published <b>before</b> <b>Sept</b> 8, 2013, we identified 12 eligible randomised trials that enrolled 4416 patients with metastatic melanoma.
