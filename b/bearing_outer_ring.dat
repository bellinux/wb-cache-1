40|$|In {{cooperation}} with SKF, {{a research project}} was started on the dynamics of ball bearings. The research is motivated by the demand for silent bearings in noise sensitive applications, especially in the household appliance and automotive industry. The investigations should bring a clear understanding {{about the role of}} the bearing in the application with respect to the design, the quality and the way it is mounted. The dynamic behaviour of a ball bearing application is studied by means of predictive modelling. The application consists of a flexible shaft supported by two deep groove ball bearings mounted in flexible housings. The housings, the shaft and the bearing outer rings are modelled with the finite element method. To solve the equations of motion by means of time integration, the large finite element models are reduced with component mode synthesis (CMS). To account for the flexibility of the <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> a new CMS method has been developed (reference [1. ]).

40|$|This thesis {{incorporates}} {{an array}} of Contact Potential Difference (CPD) sensors to measure and monitor the degree of skew in the rolling elements of a spherical roller bearing. Skewing is the motion of a roller as it turns about an axis normal to the roller race interface. Roller skew is generated {{as part of the}} kinematic effects of roller bearings. Skew monitoring is important for bearing design as it is an indirect measure of bearing life. 	For the purpose of this thesis, roller skew was measured utilizing multiple pairs of CPD probes located around the bearings outer raceway at varying points of the loading zone. These CPD probes are not in direct contact with the rollers, but in close proximity to their surface (through the <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>ring).</b> The skew angle measured is related to different operating conditions such as applied load, shaft speed, and lubrication. 	The pair of CPD probes detected a signal as the roller surface passed by and the phase difference between the two distinct signals measured the skew angles in the range of 0. 016 to 1. 10. The shaft is rotated both clockwise and counterclockwise to capture any probe misalignment which was in the range of 0. 5 up to 2. 0. This thesis also provides a model for the probe signal as a spherical roller surface passes the probe surface. M. S.

40|$|Roller {{bearings}} are {{the most}} widely used and easily damaged mechanical parts in rotating machinery. Their running state directly affects rotating machinery performance. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) easily occurs illusive component and mode mixing problem. From the view of feature extraction, a new feature extraction method based on integrating ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the correlation coefficient method, and Hilbert transform is proposed to extract fault features and identify fault states for motor bearings in this paper. In the proposed feature extraction method, the EEMD is used to decompose the vibration signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different frequency components. Then the correlation coefficient method is used to select the IMF components with the largest correlation coefficient, which are carried out with the Hilbert transform. The obtained corresponding envelope spectra are analyzed to extract the fault feature frequency and identify the fault state by comparing with the theoretical value. Finally, the fault signal transmission performance of vibration signals of the bearing inner ring and outer ring at the drive end and fan end are deeply studied. The experimental results show that the proposed feature extraction method can effectively eliminate the influence of the mode mixing and extract the fault feature frequency, and the energy of the vibration signal in the <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> at the fan end is lost during the transmission of the vibration signal.

40|$|A lagrangian {{formulation}} {{is presented}} {{for the total}} dynamic stiffness and damping matrices of a rigid rotor carrying noncentral rigid disk and supported on angular contact ball bearings (ACBBs). The bearing dynamic stiffness/damping marix is derived {{in terms of the}} bearing motions (displacements/rotations) and then the principal of virtual work is used to transfer it from the bearing location to the rotor mass center to obtain the total dynamic stiffness/damping matrix. The bearing analyses take into account the bearing nonlinearities, cage rotation and bearing axial preload. The coefficients of these time-dependent matrices are presented analytically. The equations of motion of a rigid rotor-ACBBs assembly are derived using Lagrange's equation. The proposed analyses on deriving the bearing stiffness matrix are verified against existing bearing analyses of SKF researchers that, in turn, were verified using both SKF softwares/experiments and we obtained typical agreements. The presented total stiffness matrix is applied to a typical grinding machine spindle studied experimentally by other researchers and excellent agreements are obtained between our analytical eigenvalues and the experimental ones. The effect of using the total full stiffness matrix versus using the total diagonal stiffness matrix on the natural frequencies and dynamic response of the rigid rotor-bearings system is studied. It is found that using the diagonal matrix affects natural frequencies values (except the axial frequency) and response amplitudes and pattern and causes important vibration tones to be missig from the response spectrum. Therefore it is recommended to use the full total stiffness matrix and not the diagonal matrix in the design/vibration analysis of these rotating machines. For a machine spindle-ACBBs assembly under mass unbalnce and a horizontal force at the spindle cutting nose when the bearing time-varying stiffness matrix (bearing cage rotation is considered) is used, the peak-to-valley variation in time domain of the stiffness matrix elements becomes significant compared to its counterpart when the bearing standard stiffness matrix (bearing cage rotation is neglected) is used. The vibration spectrum of the time-varying matrix case is marked by tones at <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> ball passing frequency, rotating unbalnce frequency and combination compared to spectrum of the standard stiffness matrix case which is marked by only the rotating unbalnce frequency. Therfore, it is highly recomended to model bearing stiffness matrix to be a time-dependent...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} silent rolling bearing applications, such as {{electric}} motors and gearboxes, {{has resulted in}} an investigation of viscoelastic bearing supports. By placing a thin viscoelastic layer between the <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> and the surrounding structure, vibrations of the shaft-bearing arrangement can be isolated and damped {{in such a way}} that the radiated sound power is reduced. The ultimate goal of this research was to develop a design strategy for viscoelastic bearing supports resulting in an effective noise reduction. This thesis describes the dynamic and acoustic behaviour of rolling bearing applications with viscoelastic bearing supports. Ultimately, the investigations cover a wide range of aspects in mechanical engineering: (1) the description of viscoelastic material behaviour; (2) development of a new Component Mode Synthesis method for viscoelastic components; (3) experimental investigations into the mechanical properties of viscoelastic materials; (4) development of advanced structural models of rotor dynamics applications; (5) numerical and experimental investigations of the dynamic and acoustic behaviour of an electric motor; (6) development of a design strategy for noise reduction by viscoelastic bearing supports In the present research, elastic components, like the shaft or the housing, and the viscoelastic support are modelled with the finite element method. In addition, the models are reduced by Component Mode Synthesis to save computation time. Viscoelasticity is described by a generalised Maxwell representation suitable for both time and frequency domain analyses. Viscoelastic materials are measured on a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer to obtain the frequency dependent stiffness and damping characteristics. The viscoelastic modelling approach is succesfully validated at a component level with sandwich rings. The results showed that a significant amount of damping can be created by the viscoelastic layer. As a next step, numerical and experimental studies were performed on a rotor dynamics test rig. A clear vibration reduction was achieved with viscoelastic supports, especially for high running speeds. Subsequently, the dynamic and acoustic behaviour of a running electric motor was analysed. The acoustic analysis was based on the boundary element method using so-called radiation modes. The agreement between experimental and numerical results was satisfactory in the noisiest frequency range from 1000 to 2500 Hz. It was found that the sound power level of the electric motor can be reduced by 3 to 5 dB(A) with a viscoelastic bearing support. Finally, a strategy is proposed for designing noise reducing viscoelastic bearing supports. A set of qualitative design rules and a more quantitative design approach are presented...|$|E
