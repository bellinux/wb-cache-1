50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> can be flighty and {{difficult}} to catch, especially in estuaries and harbors. From 300 to 500 million tons of <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> have been caught annually since the mid 1980s, without many fluctuations from month-to-month catches. <b>Blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> are caught for both commercial and private use, for food as well as bait for tuna and other fish.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{are often}} mistaken for chub mackerel. In fact, <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> were {{believed}} to be a subspecies of chub mackerel until the late 1980s. Though they are both in the same genus (Scomber), <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> set themselves apart by differing structural genes than those of the chub mackerel. Other, more obvious, characteristics set these two apart, like the longer anal spine of the <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and the amount of the first dorsal spines. Mackerels have a round body that narrows into the tail after the second dorsal fin, similar to a tuna fish.The <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> is known as a voracious and indiscriminate feeder, and they devour microscopic plankton and krill, live anchovy, engulf dead cut bait, and strike readily on lures and other flies. When in a school and in a feeding frenzy, they will strike at nonfood items such as cigarette butts and even bare hooks. While relatively small in size, pound for pound, mackerel score high for their fighting ability.Blue mackerel are carnivores, eating smaller fish in their same region of the upper layer of the ocean, the pelagic zone. Due to their eating habits and their diurnal lifestyles, <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> have adapted a higher sensitivity in their retinas, allowing better eyesight even during the night to catch their prey. Another adaptation of blue mackerels is their eye size. They typically have larger eyes than herbivores in their same region.|$|E
50|$|Incubation periods {{range from}} three to eight days. Periods are shorter when the {{temperature}} is higher, and longer when the temperature is lower. In the East China Sea, <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> spawn between February and May, when the water temperatures are ideal. In New South Wales, most spawning occurs 10 km off of the northern shore, in waters that are 100 to 125 m deep. The Eastern Australian Current can carry eggs and larvae away from the original spawning grounds, broadening {{the area in which}} <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> are located. However, egg and larvae probability of surviving decreases the further they are carried by the current. A mature <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> is considered to be over 310 mm long. Mackerel can live up to seven years and grow up to 50 cm long, but are most commonly found to be between one and three years of age. Counting the marks on otoliths determines the age of <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the lives}} of these mackerel, they tend to stay in areas within a few degrees of 10 °C in {{tropical}} to subtropical waters.

50|$|While {{mackerel}} {{are often}} used as cat food, they have a strong-tasting meat which is best for consumption if smoked, grilled, or broiled. The Pacific <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel,</b> while easy to fillet and skin, {{can be difficult to}} debone and care must be taken not to damage the soft flesh. <b>Blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> are used as meat binders and as main meat entrees. After being freeze-dried, the protein is extractable and put into other meat products to keep the meat and seasonings tightly together.

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} evaluates the {{suitability}} of the Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM) for stock assessment of <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Scomber australasicus and assesses methodological options for future applications. In southern Australia, estimates of mean daily egg production were higher for CalifornianVertical EggTow (CalVET) nets than bongo nets, and in easternAustralia, were higher in October 2003 than July 2004. Estimates of spawning area for southernAustralia were three times higher for bongo nets than CalVET nets. Similar estimates of spawning area were obtained using standard (manual) gridding and natural neighbour methods. Large samples and reliable estimates of all adult parameters were obtained for southern Australia. Relatively few spawning adults were collected off eastern Australia. Preliminary best estimates of spawning biomass for southern and eastern Australia were 56 228 t and 29 578 t, respectively, with most estimates within the ranges of 45 000 – 68 000 t and 20 000 – 40 000 t respectively. The DEPM is suitable for stock assessment of S. australasicus. Several technical refinements are required to enhance future applications, including: genetic techniques for identifying early stage eggs; a temperature–egg development key; improved methods for sampling adults off eastern Australia; and measurements of the degeneration rates of post-ovulatory follicles at several temperatures...|$|E

40|$|Entrainment and {{transport}} of larval fish assemblages by the East Australian Current (EAC) were examined from the coastal waters of northern New South Wales (NSW) {{to the western}} Tasman Front, via the separa-tion of the EAC from the coast, during the austral spring of 2004. Shore-normal transects from the coast to the EAC off northern NSW revealed an inner shelf assemblage of near-shore families (Clupeidae, Engra-ulidae, Platycephalidae and Triglidae), an EAC assemblage dominated by Myctophidae and Gonos-tomatidae, and a broadly distributed assemblage over the continental shelf dominated by Scombridae and Carangidae. Further south and after the EAC had separated from the coast, we observed a western Tas-man Front assemblage of inner shelf and shelf families (Clupeidae, Engraulidae, Serranidae, Scombridae, Carangidae, Bothidae and Macroramphosidae). The abundance of these families declined with distance from the coast. Surprisingly, there was no distinctive or abundant larval fish assemblage in the chlorophyll-and zooplankton-enriched waters of the Tasman Sea. Water type properties (temperature-salinity, T-S), the larval fish assemblages and family-specific T-S signa-tures revealed the western Tasman Front to be an entrained mix of EAC and coastal water types.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the fate of}} larval fish assemblages after the East Australian Current (EAC) had separated from the coast and larval fish were advected eastward along the Tasman Front. There {{was no difference in}} the assemblages at four stations as the EAC meandered from the continental shelf to 220 km eastward. At a fifth station, we sampled a submesoscale, frontal eddy that had formed at the EAC separation zone 11 d earlier and had entrained shelf water. Zooplankton biomass was greater within the eddy compared to the adjacent shelf. The larval fish assemblage in the eddy was significantly different from all other stations. There was an order of magnitude greater abundance of three species characteristic of the shelf: sardine (Sardinops sagax; Clupeidae), <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber australasicus; Scombridae), and yellowtail scad (Trachurus novaezelandiae; Carangidae), which were also significantly larger than larvae from a station on the adjacent shelf. In particular, S. sagax in the eddy were, 5 mm longer and, 10 d older, although growth rates were similar. Larval retention in the eddy was inferred from the co-occurrence of small and large larvae of all three species compared to the adjacent shelf. The EAC is only 20 – 30 km from the inner-shelf water, where frontal eddies may facilitate three stages of successful recruitment: entrainment, enrichment, and retention.

40|$|Physical {{processes}} of the East Australian Current (EAC) drives upwelling, entrains coastal water, and forms the western Tasman Front (wTF); creating a mosaic of water types, eddies and potential transport routes for larvae along south eastern Australia. Entrainment and advection of larval fish assemblages by the EAC were examined, from the inner shelf waters to the wTF, during spring of 2004. Water type properties, the larval fish assemblages and family specific T-S signatures revealed the wTF to be an entrained mix of EAC and coastal water. We found an abundance of sardine (Sardinops sagax), <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber australasicus) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) entrained and retained in the wTF. During spring of 2006 we sampled a cyclonic frontal eddy that had formed at the EAC separation. In the eddy, S. sagax, S. australasicus and Trachurus novaezelandiae were more abundant and larger than the adjacent shelf. Larval retention and improved survival in the eddy were inferred from the co-occurrence of small and large larvae of all three species compared to the shelf. Frontal cyclonic eddies of all boundary currents are a regular occurrence and demonstrate the potential for entrainment of larval fish from continental shelf spawning areas. Frontal eddies propagate slower than the mean flow of the EAC, decreasing larval advection rates, and potentially sustain planktonic communities through eddy uplift. Their duration is often sufficient for individuals to complete their larval phase and presumably recruit back to the coast. We examined the spatial distribution of S. sagax larvae off New South Wales (NSW) {{in relation to the}} major spawning areas previously identified in shelf waters of south east Queensland and northern NSW (27 - 29 °S). Spawning was observed to extend further south - to at least the EAC separation zone - based on the occurrence of newly hatched larvae. The Pre-flexion (excluding newly hatched) and flexion larvae were found throughout all habitats, including the wTF, while post-flexion larvae were primarily found in the wTF. The co-occurrence of all larval stages (less newly hatched) suggests the wTF is a retention area. Otolith microchemistry identified sardine larvae in the wTF originated from north and mid coast NSW. Both direct and indirect transport routes advected larvae to the wTF. The larval transport is similar to that described for sardine in the Kuroshio Extension, suggesting that larvae in the wTF may recruit back to the coast...|$|E

It is an economically important resource in the Macaronesian islands of Azores, Madeira and Canaries, but despite its fishery value and ecological importance, fluctuations in the landings are difficult to explain since studies regarding the population dynamics, stocks structure, fish movements and habitat connectivity are inexistent. Moreover, genetic methods that can act as a complementary tool for stock identification and population dynamics have never been applied to this species. The <b>blue</b> jack <b>mackerel</b> was sampled by artisanal fleets in the Islands of Azores, Madeira and Canaries, and at the Portuguese mainland - Matosinhos, Peniche and Portimão -during the spring-summer of 2013.

Prevalence of the adult Caligus chiastos on tuna within a day of arrival at the ranching site was 10 %; prevalence then increased significantly and peaked almost 25 days later to 75 %; by harvest (after a further 18 – 28 days), prevalence decreased significantly to 0 %. We collected and examined a total of 502 wild fishes outside T. maccoyii sea cages, comprising 307 Degen&# 039;s leatherjackets (Thamnaconus degeni), 136 yellowtail horse mackerel (Trachurus novaezelandiae), 31 sand trevally (Pseudocaranx wrighti), 10 West Australian salmon (Arripis truttacea), 6 Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni), and a single <b>blue</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber australasicus) and pilchard (Sardinops sagax); we also examined an additional 10 pilchards that were collected from the centre of Spencer Gulf and stored fresh in a T. maccoyii feed bin.

40|$|The seafood {{processing}} industry {{has to deal}} with the considerable intrinsic variability that occurs within a population of harvested fish. Processors need to know the nature of the raw material before the techniques of chilling, freezing, smoking or canning can be correctly applied. The aim of this work was to determine the physicochemical parameters and microbiological quality of Mediterranean horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus) muscle during the year and the consequent advantages or disadvantages in processing the raw material. The seasonal intrinsic variability of the North Aegean Sea Mediterranean horse mackerel (T. mediterraneus) population have been studied from monthly samples taken from the Greek purse-seine fishery over a four-year period (2001 - 2005). The length and weight frequency distributions differed significantly by season, the highest mean lengths and weights attained in spring and the lowest in autumn. Length-weight relationships were determined on a monthly and annual basis and there were found monthly variations on the allometry coefficient. The differences between the coefficient obtained for annual data and the coefficients for each month were not significant in 50 % of the cases. The b values obtained both in this study and some of the previously reported in the Mediterranean Sea and other Greek waters were compared, showing basic similarities and minor spatial variation. The seasonal cycle in Mediterranean horse mackerel condition appears {{to be related to the}} reproductive cycle of the fish. Values of muscle yield ranged between 23. 33 % and 33. 07 % (mean value: 28. 48 ± 2. 49 %), but variations within seasons were not significant. A total of 360 samples were examined (30 samples per month) during two years (November 2001 - November 2003) in order to determine the chemical composition and the microbiological quality of Mediterranean horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus) muscle during the year. Fish were caught in the coastal waters of Chalkidiki peninsula (North Greece). Proximate composition of the muscle during the year resulted in: water 76. 8 ± 1. 39 %, proteins 20. 3 ± 0. 68 %, fat 1. 3 ± 1. 08 % and ash 1. 5 ± 0. 08 %. In March, April and May an increase in fat content of the muscle (2. 5 %, 2. 8 % and 2. 1 % respectively) and a decrease in water content of the muscle (below 75. 9 %) were observed. On the contrary, fat content showed a decrease in September and October (0. 4 % and 0. 6 % respectively), while water content of the muscle increased during these months (78. 2 % and 77. 6 % respectively). The protein content of the muscle remained at high values, while the ash content was almost constant during the year. The mean value of muscle pH was 6. 38 ± 0. 16; extreme values (7) of muscle pH were not observed. Total Viable Bacteria, Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp. were used as microbial indices to evaluate the microbiological quality of the muscle. Mean counts of Total Viable Bacteria, Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp. during the year were: 4. 01 ± 0. 38 log 10 cfu/g, 2. 37 ± 0. 43 log 10 cfu/g and 3. 34 ± 0. 27 log 10 cfu/g respectively. The variations of the values within seasons are minimal and significant homogeneity in the chemical composition and microbiological quality of Mediterranean horse mackerel muscle is observed. This is an important advantage in processing of the raw material. Sensory, physicοchemical and microbiological analyses were carried out on Mediterranean horse <b>mackerel</b> and <b>blue</b> jack <b>mackerel</b> in order to determine quality changes during storage in ice. Sensory results indicated that whole Mediterranean horse <b>mackerel</b> and <b>blue</b> jack <b>mackerel</b> used in this trial had a shelf-life of 10 and 7 days respectively. Fishtester and Fishchecker measurements showed that the quality of <b>blue</b> jack <b>mackerel</b> had deteriorated more rapidly. The pH of Mediterranean horse mackerel muscle was consistently lower than the pH of <b>blue</b> jack <b>mackerel</b> muscle during the storage period. The pH values of both species muscle increased gradually with time and pH value equal to 7 had almost coincided with the end of shelf-life. Bacterial loads in both fish species muscle remained rather low prior to day 10 (< 6 log 10 cfu/g). The longer shelf-life of Mediterranean horse mackerel as determined by sensory evaluation was not reflected in microbiological results suggesting that the difference was due to lower rate of autolysis rather than to reduced microbial activity. The quality changes of Mediterranean horse mackerel muscle kept under vacuum during 20 months of frozen storage at - 18 °C were studied. Analyses included physicochemical and chemical changes, lipid hydrolysis and oxidation damage, and sensory acceptance. Attribute scores (appearance, texture, odor, flavor) were found to be at a level of acceptance during almost 16 months. Water holding capacity decreased significantly over the first eight months of frozen storage while pH values did not lead to good correlation with the storage time. Lipid hydrolysis developed gradually up to 8 months while free fatty acids remained relative constant between 10 and 18 months [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} diet of the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) in several {{islands of the}} Azores during 1994, based on the {{analysis}} of 777 food pellets. The diet of Common Terns {{was based on a}} few species of small pelagic fish. Trumpet Fish (Macroramphosus spp.) dominated the. diet in terms of both frequency of occurrence (84 %) and numerical frequency (69 %). This species, together with Boarfish (Capros aper), <b>Blue</b> Jack <b>Mackerel</b> (Trachurus picturatus) and lantern fish (Families Myctophidae, Sternoptychidae, Diretmidae), accounted for more than 96 % of the prey taken by Common Terns on all the islands. Insects occurred in 10 % of all pellets analyzed and were present in almost 15 % of the pellets from Corvo. Lantern fish represented an important fraction of the diet of Common Terns in the Azores and included several species previously undescribed as prey of seabirds in the region. Comparisons with dietary data obtained in subsequent years showed little inter- annual variability in the frequency of abundance of the main prey species, except for the lantern fish, which exhibited a higher frequency Of Occurrence in 199...|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by William Orville Ayres in 1855 {{based on the}} holotype specimen taken from San Francisco Bay, California. He named the species Caranx symmetricus, correctly identifying {{its relationship to the}} jacks, but incorporating it into what was later found to be the wrong genus. The fish was redescribed in 1944 under a different name, Decapterus polyaspis, from a specimen caught in Oregon, which under the ICZN rules classifies as a junior synonym, and it is therefore discarded. In 1983, C. symmetricus was transferred to Trachurus symmetricus by William N. Eschmeyer and Earl Herald. The species has twice been treated as a subspecies; once as Trachurus picturatus symmetricus (a subspecies of the <b>blue</b> jack <b>mackerel),</b> and the second more commonly used subspecies of Trachurus symmetricus symmetricus. For many years, the latter was accepted as a valid combination, with Trachurus symmetricus murphyi considered to be a southern subspecies population. Mitochondrial DNA analysis has now confirmed these subspecies to be separate species, with T. s. murphyi now simply Trachurus murphyi, the Inca scad. The divergence time of these two species was deemed relatively recent, at around 250 000 years ago.|$|R
