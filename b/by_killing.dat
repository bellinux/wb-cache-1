5|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's concept, {{gameplay}} and addictiveness. The intensity {{of trying to}} keep the reaper alive was highlighted by some reviewers, such as saving the reaper's life <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> a large number of Cuties.

5|$|Cytotoxic drugs {{inhibit the}} immune {{response}} <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> dividing cells such as activated T cells.

5|$|Extracts of the puffball {{have strong}} {{antitumor}} activity in mouse models attributable to protein-bound polysaccharides, the compounds calvatan, craniformin, and a tautomer of rubroflavin. Calvatan {{is thought to}} act by stimulating the immune response, rather than <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> cells. Craniformin, originally reported in 1997, is an azoformamide compound. Three sterol compounds have been identified from the fungus: ergosta-4,6,8(14), 22-tetraene-3-one, ergosta-7,22-diene-3-ol, and ergosterol peroxide.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins by}} {{summarizing}} Soul Reavers ending: Raziel confronts Kain in Nosgoth's wasteland, and pursues {{him through a}} portal leading to the past. Moebius, {{the leader of a}} vampire-hunting crusade in this age, coerces Raziel to re-embrace his former heritage as a Sarafan vampire hunter <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> Kain. Though Raziel is initially eager to do so, his enthusiasm wanes over time as he witnesses the ruthlessness of Moebius's soldiers. Kain, who is destined to die at Raziel's hands in this era, implores Raziel to thwart fate and instead facilitate his quest to restore the Pillars. After he learns that Moebius serves The Elder God, and that he has thus been duped, Raziel faces a decision: indulge his lust for vengeance but submit to fate <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> Kain, or defy his cohorts and exercise his free will by exerting mercy.|$|E
5|$|The player's {{health is}} {{represented}} by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies. If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one life and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets. The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels. Points can also be scored <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition {{can be found in}} hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered. The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its ports the player can only save between levels.|$|E

Witwer reports this to the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess, but Burgess responds <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> Witwer using Anderton's gun.

5|$|A peasant soldier named Li Zicheng mutinied {{with his}} fellow {{soldiers}} in western Shaanxi in the early 1630s after the Ming government failed to ship much-needed supplies there. In 1634 he was captured by a Ming general and released only on the terms that he return to service. The agreement soon broke down when a local magistrate had thirty-six of his fellow rebels executed; Li's troops retaliated <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> the officials and continued to lead a rebellion based in Rongyang, central Henan province by 1635. By the 1640s, an ex-soldier and rival to Li – Zhang Xianzhong (1606–47) – had created a firm rebel base in Chengdu, Sichuan, while Li's center of power was in Hubei with extended influence over Shaanxi and Henan.|$|E
5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> the infected cell and its close neighbours.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{news about}} the stolen ammunition, Colonel Stone prepares his regiment for battle. From their cell, the captives see the outmatched Bengal Lancers deployed to assault Khan's fortress. They manage to escape and ultimately destroy the ammunition tower, and young Stone redeems himself <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> Khan with a dagger. With their ammunition gone and headquarters in ruins {{as a result of}} the battle, the remaining rebels surrender. However, McGregor, who was mainly responsible for the destruction of the ammunition tower, is killed in the assault. To recognize their battlefield bravery and military effort, Forsythe and Lieutenant Stone are awarded the Distinguished Service Order and McGregor posthumously receives the prestigious Victoria Cross, with McGregor's horse awarded the medal on his behalf.|$|E

Senator Ellen Nadeer, {{the leader of the}} Humans First political movement, later speaks out against S.H.I.E.L.D. She then receives a report from the Watchdogs, whom she is working with, while her brother is trapped within an Inhuman Terrigen cocoon.|$|E
5|$|Bounty Hunter: A new mode {{introduced}} in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters <b>by</b> <b>killing</b> them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E
5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic.

Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
