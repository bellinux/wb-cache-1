Many problems in P {{are known to be}} hard if their input is given as circuit or Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (OBDD). Nevertheless, in practical areas like CAD and Model Checking, symbolic algorithms using <b>functional</b> <b>operations</b> on OBDD-represented data are well-established. Their theoretical analysis has mostly been restricted to the number <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> <b>operations</b> yet. We show that Pcomplete problems have no symbolic algorithms using a polylogarithmic number <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> <b>operations,</b> unless P=NC. Moreover, we complement PSPACE-hardness results for problems on OBDD-represented inputs by fixed-parameter intractability results, where the OBDD width serves as the fixed parameter. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} use of electronic service has invented a new term Service-Oriented Architecture. In a typical distributed environment consisting of many independent devices and services, it is practically required to apply a framework of dynamically combining service. The goal in developing such a framework is to add variety <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> <b>operations</b> as well as interaction among services, share data of software modules, and force devices and services working together in a coordinated fashion. This paper proposes a dynamic service combination framework coupled with a Service Broker for Jini, and explains how to achieve the behavior coordination of services. The major contributions of this paper are: first, the concept of combined service is abstracted {{into a number of}} cooperative services; second, it provides a programming framework that allows us not only to combine services dynamically but also to generate the combined service automatically. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCombination {{of formal}} and semi-formal methods {{is more and}} more {{required}} to produce specifications that can be, on the one hand, understood and thus validated by both designers and users and, on the other hand, precise enough to be verified by formal methods. This motivates our aim to use these complementary paradigms {{in order to deal with}} security aspects of information systems. This paper presents a methodology to specify access control policies starting with a set of graphical diagrams: UML for the functional model, SecureUML for static access control and ASTD for dynamic access control. These diagrams are then translated into a set of B machines. Finally, we present the formal specification of an access control filter that coordinates the different kinds of access control rules and the specification <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> <b>operations.</b> The goal <b>of</b> such B specifications is to rigorously check the access control policy of an information system taking advantage of tools from the B method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Graphs can be {{represented}} symbolically by the Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (OBDD) of their characteristic function. To solve problems in such implicitly given graphs, specialized symbolic algorithms are needed which are restricted to the use <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> <b>operations</b> offered by the OBDD data structure. In this paper, a symbolic algorithm for the all-pairs shortest-paths (APSP) problem in loopless directed graphs with strictly positive integral edge weights is presented. It requires Θ (log 2 (NB)) OBDD-operations to obtain the lengths and edges of all shortest paths in graphs with N nodes and maximum edge weight B. It is proved that runtime and space usage are polylogarithmic w. r. t. N and B on graph sequences with characteristic bounded-width functions. This convenient property is closed under certain graph composition operations. Moreover, an alternative symbolic approach for general integral edge weights is sketched which does not behave efficiently on general graph sequences with bounded-width functions. Finally, two variants of theAPSPproblemarebrieflydiscussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Graphs can be {{represented}} symbolically by the Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (OBDD) of their characteristic function. To solve problems in such implicitly given graphs, specialized symbolic algorithms are needed which are restricted to the use <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> <b>operations</b> offered by the OBDD data structure. In this paper, two symbolic algorithms for the single-source shortest-path problem with nonnegative positive integral edge weights are presented which represent symbolic versions of Dijkstra’s algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm. They execute O (N ·log(NB)) resp. O (NM·log(NB)) OBDD-operations to obtain the shortest paths in a graph with N nodes, M edges, and maximum edge weight B. Despite the larger worst-case bound, the symbolic Bellman-Ford-approach is expected to behave much better on structured graphs because {{it is able to}} handle updates of node distances effectively in parallel. Hence, both algorithms have been studied in experiments on random, grid, and threshold graphs with different weight functions. These studies support the assumption that the Dijkstra-approach behaves efficient w. r. t. space usage, while the Bellman-Ford-approach is dominant w. r. t. runtime. ...|$|R
40|$|Various brain {{structural}} and functional {{features such as}} cytoarchitecture, topographic mapping, gyral/sulcal anatomy, and anatomical and functional connectivity {{have been used in}} human brain parcellation. However, the fine-grained intrinsic genetic architecture of the cortex remains unknown. In the present study, we parcellated specific regions of the cortex into subregions based on genetic correlations (i. e., shared genetic influences) between the surface area of each pair of cortical locations within the seed region. The genetic correlations were estimated by comparing the correlations of the surface area between monozygotic and dizygotic twins using bivariate twin models. Our genetic subdivisions of diverse brain regions were reproducible across 2 independent datasets and corresponded closely to fine-grained functional specializations. Furthermore, subregional genetic correlation profiles were generally consistent with functional connectivity patterns. Our findings indicate that the magnitude of the genetic covariance in brain anatomy could be used to delineate the <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> subregions <b>of</b> the brain and may be of value in the next generation human brain atlas...|$|R

40|$|There are no {{standards}} how {{to measure}} the functional visual field with visual task at fovea in practical work. In this paper, an experimental paradigm is proposed to evaluate the <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> visual field (FVF) among ambiguous background where one can recognize the target marks in practical work with visual task. The term functional visual field (FVF) is generally used implying that peripheral performance depends not only upon retinal sensitivity but also upon {{the nature of the}} perceptual task. However, since such fields vary greatly with respect to shape difference among target and background noise, density of background noise, etc., {{it is very difficult to}} measure the boundaries exactly. In the proposed experimental paradigm, a target mark appears under the unique background noise. The subject must push the button in right hand, when one can recognize the target mark. On the other hand, the subject must put the fixation mark on by the button in left hand when the fixation mark disappears. Several kinds of marks are used to measure FVF. Since the distance of the target index as a visual stimulus from fixation point means the strength of stimuli, there are <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> FVF between the shorter and longer distances that correspond to the weaker and stronger stimuli. From these points of views, a procedure to measure the <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> FVF by staircase method is proposed where th...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} Critical Systems Heuristics to the problem <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> siloing.

Thus, the need to align functional activities may be viewed as a question of practical reasoning. A case is presented of a New Zealand snack-foods manufacturer. It is found that where there is evidence <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> siloing, there is also significant conflict between the planning system <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> the <b>functional</b> groups, viz Ulrich’s heuristics.

It is expected that such phenomena will be observed much more often in the future due to the ongoing miniaturisation of hardware structures. In this thesis we want to tackle {{the question of how}} system software should be designed in the event of such faults, and which fault tolerance features it should provide for highest reliability. We also show how the system software interacts with the hardware to tolerate these faults. In a first step, we analyse and further develop the theory of fault tolerance to understand the different ways how to increase the reliability of a system. Ultimately, the key is to use redundancy in all its different appearances. We we revise and further develop the general algorithm of fault tolerance (GAFT) with its three main processes hardware testing, preparation for recovery and the recovery procedure as our approach to the design of a fault tolerant system. For each of the three processes, we analyse the requirements and properties theoretically and give possible implementation scenarios. Based on the theoretical results, we derive an Oberon based programming language with direct support of the three processes of GAFT. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, we analyse a simulator based proof of concept implementation of a novel fault tolerant processor architecture (ERRIC) and its newly developed runtime system feature wise and performance wise.
