500|$|A 2010 paper {{written by}} Karli June Cerankowski and Megan Milks, titled New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice, {{suggests}} that asexuality {{may be somewhat}} of a question in itself for the studies of gender and sexuality. Cerankowski and Milks have suggested that asexuality raises many more questions than it resolves, such as how a person could abstain from having sex, which is generally accepted by society {{to be the most}} basic of instincts. Their New Orientations paper states that society has deemed [...] " [...] female sexuality as empowered or repressed. The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenets of pro-sex feminism [...] already defined as repressive or anti-sex sexualities." [...] In addition to accepting self-identification as asexual, the Asexual Visibility and Education Network has formulated asexuality as a biologically-determined orientation. This formula, if dissected scientifically and proven, would support researcher Simon LeVay's <b>blind</b> <b>study</b> of the hypothalamus in gay men, women, and straight men, which indicates that there is a biological difference between straight men and gay men.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Seventy-eight {{dogs with}} pain from hip {{dysplasia}} {{participated in a}} six-month placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial of gold bead implantation. In the present, non-blinded study, 73 of these dogs were followed for an additional 18 months to evaluate the long-term pain-relieving effect of gold bead implantation. The recently-published results of the six month period revealed that 30 of the 36 dogs (83 %) in the gold implantation group showed significant improvement (p = 0. 02), included improved mobility and reduction in the signs of pain, compared to the placebo group (60 % improvement). In the long-term two-year follow-up study, 66 of the 73 dogs had gold implantation and seven dogs continued as a control group. The 32 dogs in the original placebo group had gold beads implanted and were followed for a further 18 months. A certified veterinary acupuncturist used the same procedure to insert the gold beads as in the <b>blinded</b> <b>study,</b> and the owners completed {{the same type of}} detailed questionnaires. As in the <b>blinded</b> <b>study,</b> one investigator was responsible for all the assessments of each dog. The present study revealed that the pain-relieving effect of gold bead implantation observed in the <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> continued throughout the two-year follow-up period. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{sought to}} assess the {{occurrence}} of events after <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> drug discontinuation and transition to open-label vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in ARISTOTLE. METHODS: At the end of ARISTOTLE, <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> drug was stopped, and open-label VKA was recommended. For patients completing the trial on <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> drug, a 2 -day bridging period with apixaban or apixaban placebo was recommended (while beginning open-label VKA). Outcomes were assessed during the 30 days after stopping <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> drug. RESULTS: Of the 6, 809 patients in the apixaban group and 6, 588 in the warfarin group who completed the trial on study drug, there were 21 strokes or systemic emboli (4. 02 %/year) and 26 major bleeding (4. 97 %/year) events in the apixaban group (transitioning to VKA) and 5 strokes or systemic emboli (0. 99 %/year) and 10 major bleeding (1. 97 %/year) events in the warfarin group (continuing on VKA), {{with most of the}} imbalance between groups being after the first week. Similar results were seen in the first 30 days of the trial where warfarin-naive patients starting warfarin had a higher rate of stroke or systemic emboli (5. 41 %/year) than warfarin-experienced patients (1. 42 %/year), a pattern not seen when starting apixaban. No similar increase in events with apixaban versus warfarin was seen during temporary or permanent study drug discontinuation during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: The excess in thrombotic and bleeding events in the apixaban group after study drug discontinuation appears to be related to an increased risk associated with the initiation of a VKA rather than a direct effect of apixaban. Whether >/= 2 days of apixaban bridging improves outcomes during VKA transition is unknown and deserves further evaluation...|$|R
