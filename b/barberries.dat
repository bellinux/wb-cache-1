25|$|William, the {{youngest}} of the surviving Hazlitt children, was born in Mitre Lane, Maidstone, in 1778. In 1780, when he was two, his family began a nomadic lifestyle that was to last several years. From Maidstone his father took them to Bandon, County Cork, Ireland; and from Bandon in 1783 to the United States, where the elder Hazlitt preached, lectured, and sought a ministerial call to a liberal congregation. His efforts to obtain a post did not meet with success, although he did exert a certain influence on the founding of the first Unitarian church in Boston. In 1786â€“87 the family returned to England and settled in Wem, in Shropshire. Hazlitt would remember little of his years in America, save the taste of <b>barberries.</b>|$|E

60|$|With {{respect to}} {{variations}} due to reversion, {{there is a}} similar difference between plants propagated from buds and seeds. Many varieties can be propagated securely by buds, but generally or invariably revert to their parent-forms by seed. So, also, hybridised plants can be multiplied to any extent by buds, but are continually liable to reversion by seed,--that is, {{to the loss of}} their hybrid or intermediate character. I can offer no satisfactory explanation of these facts. Plants with variegated leaves, phloxes with striped flowers, <b>barberries</b> with seedless fruit, can all be securely propagated by buds taken from the stem or branches; but buds from the roots of these plants almost invariably lose their character and revert to their former condition. This latter fact is also inexplicable, unless buds developed from the roots are as distinct from those on the stem, as is one bud on the stem from another, and we know that these latter behave like independent organisms.|$|E

6000|$|The one {{grain of}} comfort that Olive {{extracted}} from the terrors that pressed upon her was that now she knew the worst; she knew it since Verena had told her, after so long and so ominous a reticence, of the detestable episode at Cambridge. That seemed to her the worst, {{because it had been}} thunder in a clear sky; the incident had sprung from a quarter from which, months before, all symptoms appeared to have vanished. Though Verena had now done all she could to make up for her perfidious silence by repeating everything that passed between them as she sat with Mr. Ransom in Monadnoc Place or strolled with him through the colleges, it imposed itself upon Olive that that occasion was the key of all that had happened since, that he had then obtained an irremediable hold upon her. If Verena had spoken at the time, she would never have let her go to New York; the sole compensation for that hideous mistake was that the girl, recognising it to the full, evidently deemed now that she couldn't be communicative enough. There were certain afternoons in August, long, beautiful and terrible, when one felt that the summer was rounding its curve, and the rustle of the full-leaved trees in the slanting golden light, in the breeze that ought to be delicious, seemed the voice of the coming autumn, of the warnings and dangers of life--portentous, insufferable hours when, as she sat under the softly swaying vine-leaves of the trellis with Miss Birdseye and tried, in order to still her nerves, to read something aloud to her guest, the sound of her own quavering voice made her think more of that baleful day at Cambridge than even of the fact that at that very moment Verena was [...] "off" [...] with Mr. Ransom--had gone to take the little daily walk with him to which it had been arranged that their enjoyment of each other's society should be reduced. Arranged, I say; but that is not exactly the word to describe the compromise arrived at by a kind of tacit exchange of tearful entreaty and tightened grasp, after Ransom had made it definite to Verena that he was indeed going to stay a month and she had promised that she would not resort to base evasions, to flight (which would avail her nothing, he notified her), but would give him a chance, would listen to him a few minutes every day. He had insisted that the few minutes should be an hour, and the way to spend it was obvious. They wandered along the waterside to a rocky, shrub-covered point, which made a walk of just the right duration. Here all the homely languor of the region, the mild, fragrant Cape-quality, the sweetness of white sands, quiet waters, low promontories where there were paths among the <b>barberries</b> and tidal pools gleamed in the sunset--here all the spirit of a ripe summer afternoon seemed to hang in the air. There were wood-walks too; they sometimes followed bosky uplands, where accident had grouped the trees with odd effects of [...] "style," [...] and where in grassy intervals and fragrant nooks of rest they came out upon sudden patches of Arcady. In such places Verena listened to her companion with her watch in her hand, and she wondered, very sincerely, how he could care for a girl who made the conditions of courtship so odious. He had recognised, of course, at the very first, that he could not inflict himself again upon Miss Chancellor, and after that awkward morning-call I have described he did not again, for the first three weeks of his stay at Marmion, penetrate into the cottage whose back windows overlooked the deserted shipyard. Olive, as may be imagined, made, on this occasion, no protest for the sake of being ladylike or of preventing him from putting her apparently in the wrong. The situation between them was too grim; it was war to the knife, {{it was a question of}} which should pull hardest. So Verena took a tryst with the young man as if she had been a maid-servant and Basil Ransom a [...] "follower." [...] They met a little way from the house; beyond it, outside the village.|$|E

We decided {{to assess the}} preventive role of aqueous extract of Berberis Integerrima root on the serum levels of glucose, insulin, and lipid profile in Streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: Forty male rats were divided into 5 groups as follows: 1 - normal (N); 2 -â€Šnormal + <b>barberry</b> (N+B) (they received <b>barberry</b> root extract for 6 weeks); 3 - diabetic (D) (they received STZ, 65 mg/kg BW /i. p.); 4 - diabetic + <b>barberry</b> before (D+Bb) (they received <b>barberry</b> root extract for 3 weeks before STZ injection and continued for another three weeks); and 5 - diabetic + <b>barberry</b> after (D+Ba) (three days after STZ injection, they received <b>barberry</b> root extract for 3 weeks). The experimental groups received <b>barberry</b> root extract (500 mg/kg bw) intra gastric by gavage for 6 weeks and the experimental period for each rat was 6 weeks. Results: Diabetic rats showed {{a significant increase in}} serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, and food intake as well as a decrease in HDL-C, body weight and serum insulin, compared to the other groups. Administration of the <b>barberry</b> root extract in diabetic rats restored these changes towards normal to some extent. Conclusion: In this study, for the first time, we showed that the administration of the <b>barberry</b> root extract before diabetes induction resulted in better amelioration in the serum levels of glucose, insulin, and lipid profile, compared to the group receiving it after induction: this indicates that the <b>barberry</b> root extract can play both a preventive and a therapeutic role in such patients...|$|R
