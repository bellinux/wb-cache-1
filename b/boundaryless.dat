40|$|This study {{explored}} protean and <b>boundaryless</b> career {{attitudes in}} a sample of New Zealand workers. Recent changes to both organisational and societal structures have significantly altered how careers are acted out. Employees are now required to be flexible and adaptable, and can no longer rely on organisations to manage their career development. Individuals have had to become more open to networking and collaboration across organisational boundaries, and to working for multiple employers. These changes have resulted in two key career models emerging in the research – the protean career and the <b>boundaryless</b> career. The protean career is conceptualised as involving a self-directed approach to career management combined with a values-driven approach to career management. The <b>boundaryless</b> career is conceptualised as involving both a <b>boundaryless</b> mindset,i. e. wanting to work across organisational boundaries, and a mobility preference,i. e. the desire to work for more than one employer. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how demographic and personality variables relate to protean and <b>boundaryless</b> career attitudes in New Zealand workers. Measures of the protean career attitude and the <b>boundaryless</b> career attitude were included in a survey, along with demographic variables, personality variables and career variables. The survey was sent to 1300 New Zealand workers via four organisations and 226 completed responses were received. Overall, demographic variables were found to relate less strongly to protean and <b>boundaryless</b> career attitudes than was expected. Education level was found to be the most predictive demographic variable, while age and gender were related only to one of the protean career attitudes. Overall, proactive personality was found to be the strongest predictor of three out of the four career attitudes. Supplementary analyses found that individuals on a casual employment contract had higher levels of one of the <b>boundaryless</b> career attitudes (<b>boundaryless</b> mindset) than those on a permanent contract, and there were some differences between employment sector groups on one of the <b>boundaryless</b> career attitudes (<b>boundaryless</b> mindset) and one of the protean career attitudes (self-directed career management). Values-driven career management was negatively correlated with employer, occupational and geographic mobility, and no other relationships were found between any of the career attitudes and mobility. This research has significantly added to our understanding of protean and <b>boundaryless</b> career attitudes in the New Zealand context. The findings highlight that protean and <b>boundaryless</b> careers are made up of separate but related constructs that are associated with demographic and personality variables in distinct ways. In particular, this study has shown that while differences between genders have been assumed to exist, such differences do not necessarily occur. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of education were shown to be more likely to hold certain protean and <b>boundaryless</b> career attitudes. This study highlighted that mobility is not synonymous with protean and <b>boundaryless</b> careers as has been previously assumed in the literature. It has addressed a number of key areas that were highlighted as needing further research, such as potential gender differences in career attitudes,and it has also opened up several areas for future exploration...|$|E
40|$|The <b>boundaryless</b> {{career has}} become a remarkably popular, albeit contentious, concept, with various {{academics}} and practitioners offering cautionary notes concerning the {{lack of understanding of}} boundary less career implications. This thesis argues that the <b>boundaryless</b> career concept is theoretically and empirically under-developed with regard to the impact of such careers, particularly those in what literature appears to consider 'non-professional' occupations. Beginning with a review of existing <b>boundaryless</b> career literature, this thesis moves on to introduce the notion of dairy farming as a <b>boundaryless</b> career and provides an insight into the impact such a career can have. Observations and interviews are then combined to produce an ethnographic case study of the experiences of the Culverden community with the findings being presented in three sections - individual, family and community. The discussion of each of these sections partially supports prevailing literature by confirming the existence of a number of positive aspects of <b>boundaryless</b> careers. At the same time however, these discussions identify a number of negative aspects associated with this type of career. The limitations of existing research are thus highlighted through confirming that career literature neglects the potential impacts of the positive aspects it regularly refers to, and almost entirely overlooks potential impacts of the negative aspects of <b>boundaryless</b> careers. This thesis therefore has not only theoretical significance through contributing to existing literature by providing insight into both the positive and negative impacts of <b>boundaryless</b> careers from not only an individual perspective, but also a family and community perspective, but also practical significance in that it provides an awareness of the potential implications of the <b>boundaryless</b> nature of dairy farming which may aid in the development of strategies to address problems and simultaneously take advantage of the opportunities created by the <b>boundaryless</b> nature of dairy farming. In this way, this thesis has the potential to {{play a crucial role in}} the maintenance of a cohesive, sustainable rural community...|$|E

The aim of the present paper is twofold: First, we want to empirically investigate the relationship between protean and <b>boundaryless</b> career attitudes and subjective (i. e., career satisfaction and success in comparison with colleagues) and objective (i. e., promotions and salary) career success. Second, we want to integrate research on protean and <b>boundaryless</b> career attitudes with research on predictors of career success. We analyze the career attitudes-career success relationship with a sample of 116 professionals. Our findings suggest that components of the protean career attitude are rather more related with subjective career success and that components of the <b>boundaryless</b> career attitude are more related with objective career success.

We believe that the <b>Boundaryless</b> Datacenter is increasingly becoming indispensable to a business to drive agility and provide foundation to their digital journeys. The development of the automobile industry illustrates the point well. In the 1960 s, the industry was concentrated in the US. This included ancillary organizations and equipment suppliers. As demands on the industry were placed to reduce costs, sourcing extended to low cost geos in far ung places like Japan and then Korea. In several instances, some part of the manufacturing activity itself moved outside the US, with only the marketing and sales function left to be fully managed locally.

40|$|Orientation: The {{concepts}} of the Protean Career and the <b>Boundaryless</b> Career show potential as frameworks for research and practice {{in the contemporary world}} of work. Briscoe, Hall and DeMuth (2006) developed the Protean and <b>Boundaryless</b> Career Attitude Scales, which consist of the Self-Directed Career Management, Values Driven, <b>Boundaryless</b> Mindset and Mobility Preference subscales. However, the standardisation and replication studies conducted by Briscoe et al., left some questions unanswered in terms of the psychometric properties of the subscales. Research purpose: This study examines the psychometric properties of the Protean and <b>Boundaryless</b> Career Attitude Scales with the aim of clarifying the structure of the scales, examining the quality of the items and evaluating the measurement precision of the scales. Research design, approach and method: Responses of adults to the items of the Protean and <b>Boundaryless</b> Career Attitude Scales were analysed with factor analytic and Rasch item response model techniques. Main findings: Factor and Rasch analyses revealed that three of the four postulated dimensions were replicated, but the Values Driven dimension split into two factors. Misfitting items were identified and sources of their misfit were uncovered. The Rasch analysis showed that three of the four subscales provide most of their psychometric information at the lower ends of their respective latent traits (where relatively few persons are located). Hence, the trait estimates of persons with low scores are more precise than those of persons with high scores. Practical/managerial implications: Overall, the quality of the Protean and <b>Boundaryless</b> Career Attitude Scales is satisfactory, but some aspects that may be improved are identified. Researchers may use at least three of the four subscales with confidence, but more work is possibly needed on the Values Driven subscale. Contribution/value-add: The study provides researchers with information on the psychometric properties of the Protean and <b>Boundaryless</b> Career Attitude Scales. The study also highlights ways in which the scales may be improved. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the <b>boundaryless</b> career, a concept {{developed}} within the United States, also applies within a French context.

This study aims to fill these gaps by examining the effects of emotional and social competencies on <b>boundaryless</b> career and on objective career success. By analyzing a sample of 142 managers over a period of eight years, we found evidence that emotional competencies positively influence the propensity of an individual to undertake physical career mobility and that career advancements are related to the possession of social competencies and depend on the adoption of <b>boundaryless</b> career paths.
