40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the {{variation of the}} dynamic characteristics of a spindle with the change of <b>bearing</b> <b>preload.</b> The correlations between the variation of <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> and fundamental modal parameters were first examined by conducting vibration tests on physical spindle units. Experimental measurements show that the dynamic compliance and damping ratio associated with the dominating modes were affected to vary with variation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>preload.</b> When the <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> was slightly deviated from a standard value, the modal frequency and damping ability also vary to different extent, which further enable the spindle to perform with different compliance. For the spindle used in this study, a standard preload value set on bearings would enable the spindle to behave a higher stiffness as compared with others with a preload variation. This characteristic can be served as a reference to examine the variation of <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> of spindle in assemblage or operation.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> or endplay on gearbox noise and vibrations was investigated using a test gearbox {{consisting of a}} helical gear pair, shafts, tapered roller bearings, and housing. Vibration measurements were carried out at 140 Nm and 400 Nm torque, with 0. 15 mm and 0 mm bearing endplay, and 0. 15 mm <b>bearing</b> <b>preload.</b> The {{results show that the}} bearing endplay or preload influences the gearbox vibrations. For the test gearbox, it seems that in comparison with endplay, <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> decreases vibrations at speeds below 2000 rpm and increases vibrations at speeds over 2000 rpm.

40|$|Abstract: Dynamic {{stability}} of machine tool spindle during operations {{is dependent on}} many parameters including the spindle speed, <b>bearing</b> <b>preload,</b> and thermal effect. In this article, a finite element-based model of spindle is presented, which uses the Timoshenko beam theory to obtain the frequency response of the spindle at the tool tip. The effects of the <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> and temperature rising on the stability characteristics of themilling systemare therefore investigated. It {{was found that the}} temperature rising has the same effects on the critical cutting depth as on thefirst natural frequencyof themilling system. This result verifies the fact that the critical cutting depth has close relationship with the first nature frequency of the milling system. On conditions that the temperature rising varies with the spindle rotational speed, the increment of the lowest critical cutting depth shifts with the spindle rotational speed. The above conclusions help to predict the {{stability of}} milling system under temperature rising situations for better controlling the machining process...|$|E
40|$|In many {{spacecraft}} applications, {{mechanisms are}} required to perform precision pointing operations or to sometimes dither about or track a moving object. These mechanisms perform in a predictable and repeatable manner in benign temperature environments. Severe thermal gradients experienced in actual space applications however, cause assemblies to expand and contract around their bearings. This results in unpredictable changes in <b>bearing</b> <b>preload,</b> and hence bearing friction. This becomes a limitation for servos controlling pointing accuracy. Likewise, uncontrollable vibrations may couple into fixed preload (hence, fixed stiffness) mechanisms and limit pointing accuracy. Consequently, a complex problem faced today is how to design mechanisms that remain insensitive to changing thermal and vibrational spacecraft environments. Research presented involves the simplified modeling and test results of an actuator module that used piezoelectrically preload controlled bearings. The feasibility of actively controlling <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> was demonstrated. Because bearing friction is related to preload, a thermally active system designed with aluminum components and a 440 C bearing, was friction tested at temperatures ranging from 0 to 70 C (32 to 158 F). Effectiveness of the translators were demonstrated by mapping a controllable friction range throughout tested temperatures. It was learned that constant preload for this system could be maintained over an approximate 44 C (79 F) temperature span. From testing, it was also discovered that at the more deviate temperatures, expansions were so large that radial clearances were taken up and the duplex bearing became radially preloaded. Thus, active control of <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> is feasible but may be limited by inherent geometry constraints and materials used in the system...|$|E

These stronglink switches use rolling element bearings which contain a lubricant consisting of low molecular weight polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fragments. Ozone-depleting solvents are used in both the manufacture and application of this lubricant. An alternate bearing lubrication for stronglink switches is needed that will provide long-term chemical stability, low migration and consistent performance. Candidates that were evaluated include bearings with sputtered MoS{sub 2 } on the races and retainers, bearings with TiC-coated balls, and bearings with Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } balls and steel races. These candidates were compared to the lubricants currently used which are bearings lubricated with PTFE fragments of low molecular weight in a fluorocarbon solvent. The candidates were also compared to bearings lubricated with a diester oil which is representative of bearing lubricants used in industrial applications.

This condition can be achieved by separating the bearing parts with a coherent film of fluid known as an elastohydrodynamic film.

A contra-rotating bearing test apparatus was designed and manufactured for a 115 mm bore roller bearing.

Aerospace industry is {{the first and most}} successful in implementing HSM due to its use of aluminum and their very large size of parts which require very long machining time. ^ The main objective of this thesis is to develop a finite element dynamic model to characterize the mechanical and thermal influence on the dynamic behavior of the spindle-bearing system for high-speed end milling. The finite element spindle dynamic model is validated via a state-of-the-art high speed spindle/milling test bed. In particular, several systematic tests are also developed to enable the measurement of system natural frequencies at high speeds while the spindle is rotating at very high speeds. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, we conclude that: (1) System stiffness increases as the front <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> increases. (2) When the high-speed spindle is under appropriate cooling and lubrication conditions, the thermal preload of the spindle bearing increases due to its radial thermal expansions, resulting in higher bearing stiffness. (3) The system is softened due to the centrifugal effects of the spindle shaft when the <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> is kept constant. (4) The centrifugal effects are more significant to the system dynamics than the gyroscopic effects. (5) The system is softened mainly due to centrifugal effects of spindle shaft, instead of bearings. ^ The above results can be applied to lobe diagram for regenerative stability analysis, in which the centrifugal effects must be considered in the evaluation of a system 2 ̆ 7 s transfer function. It can also be applied to review the centrifugal effects based on the cutter receptance. This analysis is useful to assist the use of ISO 1940 / 1 standard.

This paper {{describes}} how a serious field vibration problem {{on a high}} speed centrifugal compressor using tilting pad bearings was identified, following the introduction in the plant of simple methods of vibration recording and analysis, as being due to fractional frequency whirl at around 40 % of the running speed. A clear correlation was discovered between the vibration behavior and the bearing clearance. This correlation is shown to match closely the predictions of a theoretical study {{of the effect of}} bearing geometry (clearance and preload) on the stability of the particular rotor/bearing system, when a commonly used empirical criterion for stability is employed, namely that the logarithmic decrement of the system should be at least 0. 25 for instability to be avoided. The study shows that adequate stability could only be achieved in this particular system for bearings lying within a limited range of clearance and preload. Tight clearance, high <b>preload</b> <b>bearings</b> or loose clearance, negative <b>preload</b> <b>bearings</b> both give instability, and variations in bearing dimensions between nominally identical units are shown to be capable of moving the system from the stable to the unstable zone. The vibration problems have now been overcome by proper pad selection aimed at achieving an optimum <b>bearing</b> clearance and <b>preload</b> of about 7 mils and 0. 15, respectively. The marginal stability in this machine is associated {{with the fact that the}} shaft first critical speed is about 44 % of the full running speed, while machines of the same type, but with stiffer shafts giving a critical speed of about 55 % of the running speed, have been free of instability problems. To provide a long term solution to the problem, and to cater for some increase of the maximum running speed in the future, stiffer rotors are being manufactured for the machines to raise the rigid bearing first critical speed to 57 % of the current maximum running speed. In future purchase specifications for high pressure compressors a stability analysis will be requested for machines having a rigid bearing critical less than 60 % of the maximum running speed, which will be required to demonstrate a logarithmic decrement of not less than 0. 4 over the full possible range of bearing geometries, allowing for shaft, housing and pad tolerances, and wear.
