40|$|AIM: To {{survey the}} use made of {{laboratory}} services for urgent tests and clinicians' attitudes to near patient testing. METHODS: A questionnaire {{was sent to}} clinicians working in acute hospitals within Trent and North West Thames Regions. RESULTS: 197 replies were received. Most demand came from intensive care units. Overall, clinicians requested a median of six urgent tests a day. Blood glucose and dip stick urine testing were the most commonly performed bedside tests, but 41 % of clinicians did not use ward testing. The most frequently cited indication for <b>bedside</b> <b>testing</b> was the need for speed. 85 % of clinicians trusted results obtained in their central hospital laboratory, {{but there was an}} almost equal division between those who did (34 %) {{and those who did not}} (38 %) trust the results from near patient testing. A slightly larger proportion indicated they would accept responsibility (44 %) for results obtained on the ward than would not (35 %). Most staff indicated that better transport to the laboratory would remove the need for near patient testing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians have demonstrated an apparent need for rapid response testing but there is a strong preference for rapid transport systems and central laboratory analysis rather than <b>bedside</b> <b>testing</b> as a solution to this problem.

40|$|Background :  Provider {{initiated}} {{testing and}} counselling (PITC) {{is recommended for}} all inpatients in Malawi if {{they have not been}} tested in the previous 3 months. However testing rates remain low among children. We audited the effect of implementing a bedside diagnostic HIV testing service to determine if it would improve testing rates amongst paediatric inpatients. Methods :  We audited the existing HIV testing service to determine the numbers of children being tested for HIV. This was followed by the introduction of a bedside diagnostic service followed by re-audit. <b>Bedside</b> <b>testing</b> was facilitated by health systems strengthening measures including identification of suitable counsellors, appropriate supervision and remuneration. Results :  In the initial audit in March-April 2014, 85 (63 %) of 135 children had documented HIV tests [...] Following implementation of the bedside HIV testing service, there was {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of children whose HIV status was known. On re-audit in July 2015, 110 (94. 8 %) of 116 children had documented HIV tests (p< 0. 001). Of those with documented tests, 94. 5 % had been tested within the last 3 -months compared to 61 % in 2014.
