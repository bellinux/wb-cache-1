5|$|Polikarpov began {{preliminary}} design of two updated {{versions of the}} I-185 design in February 1943. The I-187 had a M-71F engine of 1,640kW (2,200hp), a <b>bubble</b> <b>canopy,</b> four 20mm cannons, eight RS-82 rockets and an estimated maximum speed of 710km/h (441mph). The I-188 used an improved M-90 engine with 1,552kW (2,080hp) and used the same armament as the I-187, although the fuselage was slimmer {{than that of the}} I-187 because of the slimmer engine.|$|E
5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate <b>bubble</b> <b>canopy</b> provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E

25|$|The {{individual}} cockpits {{were covered}} with independent <b>bubble</b> <b>canopies,</b> although the aircraft was most often flown solo, with a flat hatch replacing the rear canopy to reduce aerodynamic drag.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features a}} cantilever wing, a T-tail, a two-seat side-by-side enclosed cockpit under a <b>bubble</b> <b>canopy,</b> fixed tricycle or {{conventional landing gear}} with a steerable tail wheel and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|E
25|$|The KR200 {{incorporated}} several features {{unique to}} the KR line and its four-wheeled derivative, the FMR Tg500. Externally, the narrow body, the transparent acrylic <b>bubble</b> <b>canopy</b> and low stance were among the more obvious features.|$|E
25|$|Most F7F-2Ns were {{modified}} to control drones for combat training, and these gained bubble canopies over the rear cockpit for the drone controller. An F7F-2D used for pilot transitioning {{also had a}} rear sliding, <b>bubble</b> <b>canopy.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Bateleur {{features}} a delta wing layout with a canard. The wing is a cantilever low-wing design. The aircraft also features two-seats-in-tandem under separate <b>bubble</b> <b>canopies,</b> fixed or optionally retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} and a single engine in pusher configuration. The light-sport version will have fixed landing gear as that category's rules require and a gross weight of 600 kg.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{mounted a}} pair of Allison V-1710-125 liquid-cooled V-12 engines behind the crew's cabin, each driving one of the twin propellers. Air intakes were in the wing leading edge. The landing gear was tricycle and a full, four surface cruciform tail was fitted, whose ventral fin/rudder unit prevented the coaxial propellers from striking the ground. The pilot and co-pilot sat under twin <b>bubble</b> <b>canopies,</b> and the bombardier sat in the extreme front behind a plexiglass nose.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to <b>bubble</b> <b>canopies,</b> some aircraft, {{such as the}} P-40 Warhawk, {{featured}} a hybrid flush canopy design, combining a narrow rear fuselage with a glass enclosure conforming {{to the shape of}} a full-width fuselage - these often had a pair of recessed panels (one per side, behind the openable canopy) in the dorsal [...] "turtledeck" [...] structure, faired-in with framed glazing that was flush to the fuselage surface. This provided increased visibility while still allowing a pilot to keep the canopy closed for greater performance. Examples of such [...] "recessed" [...] rear vision designs were the [...] "greenhouse"-canopied original F4U-1 Corsair as well as the P-40.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is type {{certified to}} European Aviation Safety Agency CS22 standards. It features a cantilever mid-wing, a two-seats-in-tandem enclosed cockpit under a large <b>bubble</b> <b>canopy</b> and fixed monowheel gear {{with a small}} nosewheel and a tail caster.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} model Storm 300 {{features a}} cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a <b>bubble</b> <b>canopy,</b> fixed {{conventional landing gear}} or optionally tricycle landing gear, both with wheel pants, and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is based}} upon the Rutan Long-EZ.

50|$|Of the Cyclone's stylistic features, the <b>bubble</b> top <b>canopy</b> was {{the most}} prominent. Silver coated for UV protection, the canopy {{automatically}} opened along with the sliding electrically operated doors. The canopy could also be stowed in the rear compartment, where it rested on a special air-bag base.|$|R
2500|$|The Mk XVI was {{the same}} as the Mk IX in nearly all respects except for the engine, a Merlin 266. The Merlin 266 was the Merlin 66 and was built under licence in the USA by the Packard Motor Company. The [...] "2" [...] was added as a prefix in order to avoid {{confusion}} with the engines, as they required different tooling. All Mk XVI aircraft produced were of the Low-Altitude Fighter (LF) variety. This was not determined by the length of the wings (clipped wings were fitted to most LF Spitfires), but by the engine, which had been optimised for low-altitude operation. All production Mk XVIs had clipped wings for low altitude work and were fitted with the rear fuselage fuel tanks with a combined capacity of 75 gal. Many XVIs featured cut-down rear fuselages with <b>bubble</b> <b>canopies.</b> On these aircraft the rear fuselage tank capacity was limited to 66 gal.|$|R
2500|$|The engines were {{developments}} of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel K.26, later renamed Peregrine. The first prototype, L6844, used long exhaust ducts that were channelled through the wings and fuel tanks, exiting at the wing's trailing edge. This configuration was quickly changed to more conventional, external exhausts after Westland's Chief test pilot Harald Penrose nearly lost control when an exhaust duct broke and heat-fractured an aileron control rod. The engines were cooled by ducted radiators, which were set into the leading edges of the wing centre-sections to reduce drag. The airframe was built mainly of stressed-skin duraluminium, {{with the exception of}} the rear-fuselage, which used a magnesium alloy stressed skin. With the pilot sitting high under one of the world's first full <b>bubble</b> <b>canopies</b> and the low and forward location of the wing, all round visibility was good (except for directly over the nose). Four 20mm cannon were mounted in the nose; the 600lb/minute fire rate made it the most heavily armed fighter aircraft of its era. The clustering of the weapons also meant that there were no convergence problems as with wing-mounted guns. Hopes were so high for the design that it remained [...] "top secret" [...] for much of its development, although it had already been mentioned in the French press.|$|R
25|$|The Zephyr was {{designed}} {{to comply with the}} Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight rules.

25|$|The Pulsar was a {{development}} of the Star-Lite Aircraft Star Lite and features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration open cockpit under a <b>bubble</b> <b>canopy,</b> fixed tricycle landing gear or optionally conventional landing gear with wheel pants and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was designed to}} comply with the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight rules and US light-sport aircraft rules.

2500|$|The Coccinelle's {{fuselage}} has {{a rectangular}} section throughout and its profile is straight edged except under the engine, where it curves upwards. The side-by-side seats {{are ahead of}} the wing leading edge and largely enclosed under a one piece, rear hinged, part <b>bubble</b> type <b>canopy.</b> Behind this are further transparencies which can vary from builder to builder but extend rearwards a little way into the wing. [...] Most Coccinelles have a tail wheel undercarriage with front wheels on thin, steel cantilever legs, though a tricycle undercarriage is an option. Some builders have added spats.|$|R
40|$|IBISCA-Panama ("Investigating the BIodiversity of Soil and Canopy Arthropods", Panama module) {{represents}} a large-scale research initiative {{to quantify the}} spatial distribution of arthropod biodiversity in a Neotropical forest, {{using a combination of}} (1) international collaboration, (2) a set of common research questions, and (3) an integrated experimental design. Here, we present the rationale of the programme, describe the study sites, and outline field protocols. In the San Lorenzo Protected Area of Panama, twelve 20 x 20 m sites, all less than 2 km apart, were surveyed for plants and arthropods, from the ground to the upper canopy. Access to the canopy and its fauna was facilitated by fogging, single-rope techniques and a variety of devices such as a canopy crane, the "SolVin-Bretzel" canopy raft, the <b>canopy</b> <b>bubble</b> and Ikos. IBISCA-Panama represented the first attempt to combine these complementary techniques of canopy access in a large-scale investigation. Such techniques provided spatial replication during initial field work performed in September-October 2003. Temporal replication across seasons consisted of subsequent field work of varying intensity during dry, early wet and late wet periods in 2004. Arthropods were surveyed using 14 different protocols targeting the soil, litter, understorey, mid-canopy and upper canopy habitats. These protocols included: WINKLER sifting; BERLESE-TULLGREN; hand-collecting of galls and social insects; fogging; beating; woodrearing; baits; and various types of traps such as pitfall, small and large flight-interception, sticky, light, and Malaise traps. Currently, analyses of arthropod distribution in this forest concentrate on a set of 63 focal taxa representing different phylogenies and lifehistories. IBISCA-Panama may be considered as a model for largescale research programmes targeting invertebrate biodiversity. Its collaborative modus operandi can be applied to answer a variety of pressing ecological questions related to forest biodiversity, as evidenced by the recent development of further IBISCA programmes {{in other parts of the}} world.

5000|$|After {{he retired}} from the {{military}} he was involved in a great number of films. This came as a result of work being done on the film 633 Squadron (1964). Running into difficulty getting aircraft for the project, one of the production people working on the film was asked about if there was anyone familiar with Mosquitos available, and Mahaddie's name came up. He ended up acquiring 11 Mosquitos for the picture, and the aircrews to fly them. He soon became known amongst the film industry as a resource, both in consulting in the realism in their portrayals of the RAF and in the procurement of aircraft, maintenance teams and aircrew for their films. After filming of 633 Squadron was completed Mahaddie purchased one of the aircraft, Mosquito RS712. He used it to fly back and forth to various locations before selling it 8 years later in 1972. Other films Mahaddie worked on include Operation Crossbow (1965) and Mosquito Squadron, the 1969 sequel to 633 Squadron. He also worked on the James Bond film You Only Live Twice (1967). Here he asked Ken Wallis, a former RAF Wing Commander and the designer of an autogyro, to demonstrate his machine for the movie's producer. Said Wallis [...] "The next thing I knew the late Group Captain Hamish Mahaddie, the famous RAF Pathfinder chap, who was the aviation consultant for EON Productions, was on the phone asking me to bring one of my Autogyros down to Pinewood Studios. He said, [...] "It’s to do with a Bond movie." [...] Mahaddie said to Wallis afterwards it was the most dramatic thing. [...] "You started the engine up and it made a terrible noise that echoed round all the buildings. Off the breaks and away you disappeared in a cloud of dust headed straight for the railway sleepers. When out of the dust you came and flew straight up into the blue sky, you were in the Bond movie." [...] Mahaddie ended up giving Wallis' autogyro its nickname. Part of an old RAF tradition was to refer to anyone in the RAF with the last name of Wallace or Wallis as [...] "Nellie", {{after the turn of the}} century stage singer Nellie Wallace. Thus, on the James Bond set Wallis' autogyro came to be known as [...] "Little Nellie".Among his other consulting projects Mahaddie also worked on the television series Pathfinders, the movies The Heroes of Telemark (1965), Patton (1970) a A Bridge Too Far (1977) and Soldier of Orange (1977). However, by far and away Mahaddie's most remarkable work was on the film Battle Of Britain (1969). The film was the endeavor of producer Ben Fisz, a Polish ex-patriot who had flown with the RAF as a Spitfire pilot during the war. The film was to be shot in Panavision in full color, making all archived film materials taken during the war unacceptable. Twenty years after the war, it was not certain that the aircraft could be located and gathered together for the film. It was thought the German aircraft did not even exist. In the fall of 1965 Fisz met with Mahaddie to ask if he could find aircraft to form an [...] "RAF" [...] and [...] "Luftwaffe" [...] that would be convincing on the screen. In the next few weeks Mahaddie located 160 Spitfires worldwide, with 107 in England, many of these mounted on struts for displays outside airfields. Hurricanes were harder to come by, but 3 flying aircraft were eventually obtained. It would take Mahaddie two and a half years to assemble his RAF and Luftwaffe from all corners of the globe. He managed to persuade the RAF to lend many of its non-flight worthy aircraft as static airfield dressing. In addition to this he obtained 9 airworthy Spitfires and 3 airworthy Hurricanes, but all but one of the airworthy Spitfires obtained were later models, with <b>bubble</b> <b>canopies</b> other visual differences. RAF Henlow was the film's base of operations for the restoration and modification of the Hurricanes and Spitfires, and it was here that the various marks of Spitfire were converted to resemble the 1940 variants in use during the Battle of Britain. Mahaddie's big coup was finding the Spanish Air Force were still using licence built Heinkel 111 bombers as transports and Messerschmitt 109 fighters as trainers, ironically with Rolls-Royce engines. He persuaded the Spanish air force to co-operate in the filming of Battle Of Britain. This enabled the film to have its spectacular dogfight sequences, using real aircraft in a real sky, flown by capable pilots well versed in the aggressive use of their aircraft. In all he acquired the use of 115 aircraft. In addition, maintaining a large fleet of vintage aircraft and keeping them all serviceable for the filming schedule was a mammoth task in itself. Here he was aided by the hard work and expertise of John Simpson and his civilian engineers at Simpson Aero Services, Elstree. Simpson Aero Services was one of the first civilian aircraft maintenance companies to specialise in the maintaining and operation of warbird-style aeroplanes. This was before the interest in airworthy Second World War aircraft had yet to become commonplace. John Tubby Simpson was an expert on the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, and was to be seen during the duration of filming travelling all over the UK in order to get unserviceable parts repaired and back on the film's fleet of ageing fighters. It was also apparent that a group of experienced pilots would be needed to fly the aircraft. Mahaddie asked the Ministry of Defence if a select group of pilots could be seconded to the film company, the pilots preferably coming from the Central Flying School. After some deliberation the Ministry of Defence came up with a list of ten flying instructors, all of whom had many hours experience of fighter type aircraft. They were led by Wing Commander George Elliot from RAF HQ Flying Training Command.|$|R
