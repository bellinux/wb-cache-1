5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the <b>back</b> <b>muscles</b> improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{acquisition}} of Coveleski, combined with winning the 1924 World Series, the Washington Senators were considered favorites to win the AL in 1925. During his first season in Washington, Coveleski bounced back from his 1924 season, and by mid-July, critics regarded his success as the biggest surprise in baseball; Cleveland considered him to be past his best. He won 20 games and lost five that year, and his ERA of 2.84 led the AL. Coveleski also finished 12th in MVP voting that year. The Senators won the AL and were to face the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1925 World Series, but Coveleski suffered from sore <b>back</b> <b>muscles</b> late in the season. Coveleski pitched two games in the World Series. In game two, he faced Vic Aldridge in a pitcher's duel; the teams were tied at one apiece in the eighth inning, but a Pittsburgh home run led to a 3–2 loss. Aldridge and Coveleski faced off again in game five, and Coveleski allowed four runs in under seven innings, leading to a 6–3 Pirates win. The Senators lost the series in seven games, and he finished with a 3.77 ERA, five walks, three strikeouts, {{and two of the}} Senators' four losses.|$|E
25|$|For {{the lower}} basses {{it takes a}} lot more control to turn quickly. Cleaning turns for a bassline can be rather easy. They should lead with the {{shoulder}} {{at the start of the}} turn and lock the other direction on a specified count. Setting a check-point can help. For instance, one should be flat front on count two of the turn. However, note that the turn should be smooth and not jerky. A common problem may result from not stopping the weight of the drum at the end of the turn and letting the momentum get the better of the player. The solution to that problem involves tightening the core (abdominals and <b>back</b> <b>muscles).</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of a 10 -week dynamic back extension training programme and its effects on <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength, <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> endurance and spinal range of motion (ROM) for healthy young females. Seventy-three young females (age: 19. 32 ± 1. 80 years, height: 158. 89 ± 4. 71 cm, body weight: 55. 67 ± 6. 30 kg) volunteered for the study. Prior to the training period, all participants completed anthropometric measurements, <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength and endurance test, lateral bending and spinal ROM measurements. After measurements, the participants were divided into two groups. The exercise group (N: 35) performed the dynamic back extension exercise 3 days per week for 10 weeks. The control group (N: 38) did not participate in any type of exercise. The mixed design ANOVA (group x time) was used to determine the difference in pre- and post-training values. The present findings show that there were significant differences between pre-training and post-training values for <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength and spinal ROM in the exercise group. Following the dynamic strength training programme, <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength and spine ROM values except flexion of the lumbar 5 -sacrum 1 (L 5 -S 1) segment of the exercise group showed a significant increase when compared with the pre test values. The control group did not show any significant changes when compared with the pre-training values. The results demonstrate that the 10 -week dynamic strength training programme was effective for spinal extension ROM and <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength, but there was no change in <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> endurance. In this context, this programme could potentially be used to prevent the decrease of spinal ROM as well as provide an increase in the fitness parameters of healthy individuals...|$|R

Sometimes these are in secluded areas or dangerous neighborhoods, which account for a number of deaths due to drivers being targeted by thieves for their valuable cargo, money, and property, or for the truck and trailer themselves. Drivers of trucks towing flatbed trailers are responsible for securing and strapping down their cargo (which often involves climbing onto the cargo itself), and if the load requires tarping necessitates climbing on the load to spread out tarps. Tarps can weigh up to 200lbs each and the cargo can require up to 3 tarps per load which account for a number of deaths and injuries from falling. Drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, which can cause strain on the <b>back</b> <b>muscles.</b> Some drivers are responsible for unloading their cargo, which can lead to many back strains and sprains due to overexertion and improper lifting techniques. If the cab of the truck is not appropriate for the driver's size, the driver can lose visibility and easy access to the controls and be at higher risk for accidents.|$|E

[...] The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as retractors. [...] With McKinley in a weakened condition, Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet; his work was complicated by the fact that the President was obese. [...] The surgeon made an incision in the President's skin, and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh. [...] He probed with his finger and hand, finding damage to the digestive system—the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound. [...] Mann sewed up both holes in the organ, but could not find the bullet itself; he concluded it had lodged in the President's <b>back</b> <b>muscles.</b> [...] He later wrote, [...] "A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm." [...] A primitive X-ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done little good.

40|$|With {{aging of}} society, {{clarification}} {{of the relationship}} between QOL and abnormal posture in the elderly may allow improvement of QOL through any preventive methods and training. However, sagittal balance has not been studied widely and most studies have focused on postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis. In this report, we provide the first evaluation of the simultaneous effects of degenerative changes on radiograph, spinal range of motion (ROM), sagittal balance, and <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength, and examine the influence of these effects on QOL of the middle-aged and elderly male subjects. The subjects were 100 Japanese males who underwent a basic health checkup. Lumbar lateral radiograph, sagittal balance and spinal mobility determined with SpinalMouse® and <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength were measured. The thoracic/lumbar angle ratio (T/L ratio) was used as an index of sagittal balance. SF- 36 physical component summary (PCS) scores showed a significant negative correlation with age (r = − 0. 377), osteophyte score (r = − 0. 246) and T/L ratio (r = − 0. 214), and a significant positive correlation with lumbar lordosis angle (r =  0. 271), thoracic ROM (r =  0. 282), and <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength (r =  0. 549). Multiple regression analysis indicated that thoracic spinal ROM (r =  0. 254, p <  0. 01) and <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength (r =  0. 488, p <  0. 0001) were significantly associated with SF- 36 PCS (R 2  =  0. 403).

Chronic low back pain has been known to be associated with high fat content of multifidus as one of the <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> groups. 1) Patients Background: The prediction of lumbar <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> degeneration is important because chronic low back pain and spino-pelvic imbalance have been known to be related to it. However, gender difference should be considered because there are different qual-ity and volume of muscles between genders. The {{purpose of this study was}} to search for clinical and radiological factors to predict the degree of lumbar <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> degeneration according to gender difference. Methods: We reviewed 112 patients (44 men and 68 women) with spinal stenosis who underwent a decompressive surgery be-tween 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2011. Degrees of lumbar <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> degeneration were classified into three categories by the fatty infiltration at each L 3 – 4 disc level on the axial view of T 1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The causes of back pain are largely unknown but it seems plausible that some physical factors such as <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength, <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> endurance and aerobic capacity {{may play a role}} in its development, in particular in the early years. Objectives: The objectives of this review were to investigate in childhood and adolescence 1) if muscular strength in trunk extension is associated with back pain, 2) if muscular endurance in trunk extension is associated with back pain and 3) if aerobic capacity is associated with back pain. Design: Three systematic critical literature reviews with one meta-analysis. Methods: Systematic searches were made in June 2014 in PubMed, Embase and SportDiscus including longitudinal, retrospective or cross-sectional studies on back pain for subjects < 20 years. Articles were accepted if they were written in French or English. The review process followed the AMSTAR recommendations. The possibility of conducting a meta-analysis was assessed for each research question. Results: Four articles were included for the first objective, four for the second and three for the last. None of the included articles found an association between <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> strength in extension and back pain. For the second objective, a protective association between <b>back</b> <b>muscle</b> endurance in extension and back pain was found, later confirmed in a meta-analysis (OR = 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 58 - 0. 98).

2500|$|A major {{effect of}} {{long-term}} weightlessness involves {{the loss of}} bone and muscle mass.

In a weightless environment, astronauts put almost no weight on the <b>back</b> <b>muscles</b> or leg muscles used for standing up. [...] Those muscles then start to weaken and eventually get smaller. Consequently, some muscles atrophy rapidly, and without regular exercise astronauts can lose up to 20% of their muscle mass in just 5 to 11 days The types of muscle fibre prominent in muscles also change. Slow twitch endurance fibres used to maintain posture are replaced by fast twitch rapidly contracting fibres that are insufficient for any heavy labour. Advances in research on exercise, hormone supplements and medication may help maintain muscle and body mass.|$|E

This is required for show ring western riding and preferred in dressage, especially at the upper levels. Sitting the trot gives the rider optimum control, because he or she can use the seat and weight to ask the horse to make upward or downward transitions, turns, and/or to decrease or increase impulsion. It is also a test of equitation by proving that the rider can quietly move with the horse. The jog, which is the preferred gait of western horses, is generally smoother and less-bouncy than the working and extended trot of the English-style horse. [...] Sitting can be very tiring for the rider, especially if performed by riders who have not built up their stomach and <b>back</b> <b>muscles,</b> or if riders are on an extremely powerful mount with a big trot. To sit the trot, there is a slight forward and back movement of the lower back and stomach as the rider's hips follow both the up and down and side-to-side motion of the horse. To absorb the impact of the trot, the rider relaxes through the hips and the stomach and lower back, as well as the legs. The rider's upper body remains upright and quiet. The rider's hands remain steady. [...] The lower legs remain relaxed and only come into play when the rider gives a leg aid. If a rider cannot sit the trot and is bounced around, the rising trot is preferable, because not only is the rider uncomfortable, the constant slamming of the rider onto the horse is uncomfortable for the horse. As a result, it will hollow its back and stiffen its movement.|$|E
