5|$|As {{foreseen}} by Secretary Laird, {{fallout from}} the incursion was quick in coming on the campuses of America's universities, as protests erupted against {{what was perceived as}} an expansion of the conflict into yet another country. On 4 May the unrest escalated to violence when Ohio National Guardsmen shot and killed four unarmed students (two of whom were not protesters) during the Kent State shootings. Two days later, at the University at Buffalo, police wounded four more demonstrators. On 15 May city and state police killed two and wounded twelve at Jackson State College (now Jackson State University) in Jackson, Mississippi. Earlier, on 8 May 100,000 protesters had gathered in Washington and another 150,000 in San Francisco on only ten days notice. Nationwide, 30 ROTC buildings went up in flames or were bombed while 26 schools witnessed violent clashes <b>between</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> police. National Guard units were mobilized on 21 campuses in 16 states. The student strike spread nationwide, involving more than four million students and 450 universities, colleges and high schools in mostly peaceful protests and walkouts.|$|E

40|$|Michael Moore 2 ̆ 7 s {{theory of}} {{transactional}} distance, {{developed in the}} age of correspondence schools, contributed greatly to theory building in distance education. The theory needs revision, however, when applied to web-based learning environments, specifically by defining transactional distance to include students 2 ̆ 7 relationships with other elements in the learning environment that prohibit their active engagement with learning. The new theoretical model of transactional distance has four dimensions: transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>student</b> (TDSS), transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> teacher (TDST), transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> content (TDSC), <b>and</b> transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> interface: online course management system (TDSI). A preliminary item pool of more than 200 items to measure the constructs of TD, TDST, TDSS, TDSC, and TDSI was generated and sent to a panel of experts for review. Items that the reviewers considered weak or very weak in terms of relevance to the constructs and/or clarity and conciseness were eliminated. After a pilot test and further revisions, the proposed scale of transactional distance was administered to a sample of 100 college students. Confirmatory factor analyses and exploratory analyses indicated that the measurement models, especially after modifications, possessed good fit for the data, and the modified scales possessed factorial validity. Reliability analyses indicated that the scales possessed strong internal consistency, with Cronbach alpha coefficients ranging from 0. 8169 to 0. 9530. Structural equation modeling procedures tested for the causal relationship between the four dimensions <b>and</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 general sense of transactional distance in web-based courses. Results indicate that the proposed model of transactional distance is acceptable. The strongest factor that affected students 2 ̆ 7 sense of transactional distance and engagement with learning was found to be transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> (TDSS), followed by transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> teacher (TDST), and then by transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> content (TDSC). The findings have implications {{for the development of a}} revised theory of transactional distance in online education, and provide strong support for constructivist learning theories and social learning theories, reinforcing the importance of establishing learning communities in online learning environments...|$|R

40|$|Framed {{against a}} {{backdrop}} of complex intergroup dynamics and the legacies created for foreign language education, the current article tests three hypotheses which explore the efficacy of direct contact encounters <b>between</b> Japanese university <b>students</b> <b>and</b> ‘idealized’ native-speaker English teachers. As antecedents to positive language learning outcomes, attention is given to student self-reported measures of pre-contact <b>and</b> post-contact anxiety, <b>student</b> appraisals of teacher desirability, and perceptions of distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> teacher. Drawn from 132 in- dividual contact encounters experienced by 22 students, the data indicates that significant dif- ferences between pre-contact and post-contact measures were only observable in relation to students' self-reported feelings of anxiety. Moreover, while more localized assessments were found to be significant in relation to teacher appraisals and perceptions of distance, these were limited to either pre-contact or post-contact measures. The outcomes are discussed in relation to the teaching of English as Foreign Language (EFL), the role of social interaction <b>between</b> <b>student</b> <b>and</b> teacher, and the significance of culture...|$|R
