5|$|Hamilton's Report on a National Bank was a {{projection}} {{from the first}} Report on the Public Credit. Although Hamilton had been forming ideas of a national bank as early as 1779, he gathered ideas in various ways over the past eleven years. These included theories from Adam Smith, extensive studies on the Bank of England, the blunders of the Bank of North America and his experience in establishing the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York. He also used American records from James Wilson, Pelatiah Webster, Gouverneur Morris, and from his assistant Treasury secretary Tench Coxe.|$|E

5|$|Discontinuing {{his studies}} before graduating when the college closed its doors during British {{occupation}} of the city, Hamilton {{played a major role}} in the American Revolutionary War. At the start of the war in 1775, he joined a militia company. In early 1776, he raised a provincial artillery company, to which he was appointed captain. He soon became the senior aide to General Washington, the American forces' commander-in-chief. Hamilton was dispatched by Washington on numerous missions to convey plans to his generals. After the war, Hamilton was elected as a representative to the Congress of the Confederation from New York. He resigned to practice law, and founded the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York.|$|E
5|$|In 1784, {{he founded}} the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York which {{became one of the}} longest {{operating}} banks in American history, it stayed in business for over 220 years before it merged with another bank in 2007. Hamilton was {{one of the men who}} restored King's College, which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War, as Columbia College. Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation, he played a major leadership role at the Annapolis Convention in 1786. He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention, and in doing so brought his longtime desire to have a more powerful, more financially independent federal government one step closer to reality.|$|E

5|$|Neal has won {{re-election}} in every term since. Former Springfield mayor Theodore Dimauro, reflecting sentiments that Neal had {{an unfair advantage}} in the previous election, ran as a challenger in the 1990 Democratic primary. Dimauro's campaign was sullied by a false rumor he spread about the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> England's financial situation, and Neal won the primary easily. He was unopposed in the general election, winning 68 percent of the vote. In 1992 his popularity was threatened by the House banking scandal, {{in which he had}} made dozens of unpenalized overdrafts at the House Bank. After narrowly defeating two Democratic opponents, he was challenged by Republican Anthony W. Ravosa, Jr., and Independent Thomas R. Sheehan. Neal won with 53 percent of the vote.|$|E

After riding overland from north east Victoria, Kelly {{and his gang}} in a brazen move captured two local policemen and stole their uniforms. Impersonating the police, they then proceeded to rob the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> South Wales and held the town captive for several days. While in Jerilderie, he sought to have his manifesto published, the famous Jerilderie letter, a rambling 8,000 word condemnation of the colonial administration in Victoria and specifically {{the treatment of the}} Irish.
