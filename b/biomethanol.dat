40|$|The present article {{deals with}} the techno-economic {{assessment}} of the hybrid steam reforming (HSR) process of glycerol (obtained via transesterification) together with natural gas to produce <b>biomethanol</b> via the synthesis gas route. In this techno-economic assessment, a model is developed in the UniSim Design Suite process simulator using different glycerol amounts up to 54 % (on a carbon basis) together with natural gas to produce synthesis gas at reforming conditions of 900 °C, S/C 3. The techno-economic analysis shows that at the current market scenario (Oct–Dec 2012) with a natural gas price of 0. 2 €/Nm 3 and with an assumed glycerol price of 200 €/tonne, {{the average cost of}} <b>biomethanol</b> is estimated as 433 €/tonne for a feed of 54 wt % of glycerol (on a carbon basis) with natural gas, which is 75 €/tonne higher than for the methanol obtained via only natural gas steam reforming. It is concluded that <b>biomethanol</b> from a HSR process becomes more attractive when the natural gas price exceeds 0. 45 €/Nm 3 or when glycerol is available at lesser than 90 €/tonne. Splitting the production capacity in methanol and <b>biomethanol</b> according to the feed composition would result in a price of 358 €/tonne and 470 – 500 €/tonne of methanol and <b>biomethanol,</b> respectively, depending on the amount of glycerol in the feed.

40|$|Biomass {{conversion}} {{technologies that}} produce energy and reduce carbon emissions {{have become more}} feasible to develop. This paper analyzes the potential of converting biomass into <b>biomethanol</b> at forest management units experiencing three forest management practices (community-based forest management (CBFM), plantation forest (PF), and natural production forest (NPF)). Dry aboveground biomass collected varied considerably: 0. 26 – 2. 16 [*]Mg/ha/year (CBFM), 8. 08 – 8. 35 [*]Mg/ha/year (NPF), and 36. 48 – 63. 55 [*]Mg/ha/year (PF). If 5 % of the biomass was shifted to produce <b>biomethanol</b> for electricity production, the NPF and PF could provide continuous power to 138 and 2, 762 households, respectively. Dedicating 5 % of the biomass was not a viable option from one CBFM unit. However, if all biomasses were converted, the CBFM could provide electricity to 19 – 27 households.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess and {{calculate}} the potential impacts of climate change on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction potentials of combined production of whole corn bioethanol and stover <b>biomethanol,</b> and whole soybean biodiesel and stalk <b>biomethanol.</b> Both fuels are used as substitutes to conventional fossil-based fuels. The product system includes energy crop (feedstock) production and transportation, biofuels processing, and biofuels distribution to service station. Methods The methodology is underpinned by life cycle thinking. Crop system model and life cycle assessment (LCA) model are linked in the analysis. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer – crop system model (DSSAT-CSM) is used to simulate biomass and grain yield under different future climate scenarios generated using a combination of temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO 2. Historical weather data for Gainesville, Florida, are obtained for the baseline period (1981 – 1990). Daily minimum and maximum air temperatures are projected to increase by + 2. 0, + 3. 0, + 4. 0, and + 5. 0 °C, precipitation is projected to change by ± 20, 10, and 5 %, and atmospheric CO 2 concentration is projected to increase by + 70, + 210, and + 350 ppm. All projections are made throughout the growing season. GaBi 4. 4 is used as primary LCA modelling software using crop yield data inputs from the DSSAT-CSM software. The models representation of the physical processes inventory (background unit processes) is constructed using the ecoinvent life cycle inventory database v 2. 0. Results and discussion Under current baseline climate condition, net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions savings per hectare from corn-integrated <b>biomethanol</b> synthesis (CIBM) and soybean-integrated <b>biomethanol</b> synthesis (SIBM) were calculated as − 8, 573. 31 and − 3, 441 kg CO 2 -eq. ha− 1 yr− 1, respectively. However, models predictions suggest that these potential GHG emissions savings would be impacted by changing climate ranging from negative to positive depending on the crop and biofuel type, and climate scenario. Increased atmospheric level of CO 2 tends to minimise the negative impacts of increased temperature. Conclusions While policy measures are being put in place for the use of renewable biofuels driven by the desire to reduce GHG emissions from the use of conventional fossil fuels, climate change would also have impacts on the potential GHG emissions reductions resulting from the use of these renewable biofuels. However, the magnitude of the impact largely depends on the biofuel processing technology and the energy crop (feedstock) type...|$|E

30|$|Bioethanol, <b>biomethanol,</b> biodiesel, etc. {{known as}} {{biofuels}} are an {{alternative energy source}} that will likely become more prevalent in the future (Nigam and Singh 2011). In the past, bioethanol has been made from plants that produced high amounts of natural sugar—such as sugar cane or corn. Unfortunately, the increased demand for these products increases the competition and therefore the price of food products from these sources. Cellulose {{is one of the}} most abundant polysaccharide in the nature. Its sources include agricultural and forestry residues, portion of municipal solid waste, and herbaceous and woody crops (Lynd et al. 1991). Bioethanol from cellulose, is therefore a very promising avenue of biofuel as it does not compete with food products (Kemppainen and Shonnard 2005; Sticklen 2008). Producing ethanol from cellulose usually contains two steps. First, the hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose; and second, its fermentation to ethanol. Although the first process can be performed by either chemical or enzymatic process, the later one is preferred because it is cleaner and the process can be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions easily (such as pH, temperature, etc.) (Mabee and Saddler 2010).|$|E

The FDM, therefore, is able to catalyze redox reactions independent of exogenous cofactor addition, rendering the enzyme powerful for industrial applications. Currently, only one enzyme of this type has been characterized enzymatically. Furthermore, only one additional DNA-sequence with high homology to FDM has been published. In this work, we identified a new variant of a formaldehyde dismutase gene (fdm) in the Pseudomonas putida J 3 strain. To isolate and characterize the enzyme, we developed a simplified method for its purification. This purification is based on a C-terminal 6 xHis-tag, which enables functional expression of the enzyme in E. coli and a one-step purification method. In addition, we tested several expression systems for optimal yields and combined this with co-expression of the chaperonins GroESL. Using this simplified and rapid method, we are now able to produce sufficient material in reproducible quality and quantity for application tests with the enzyme.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a new model-based integrated process design and control (IPDC) methodology for heat exchanger networks (HENs). Many methods for HENs synthesis have been developed over the past decades, which aim to provide HENs designs that yield a reasonable trade-off between capital and operating costs. However, in most of HENs synthesis activities, the sole consideration in solution derivation is about design cost. Process operational issue especially controllability is frequently not a concern in the process design. As a result, the controllability of a designed HEN may be questionable. Industrial practice has made it clear that process controllability should be considered during process synthesis. The HENs design can be further improved to ensure that the design is more cost efficient and controllable. This can be achieved by developing a new model-based IPDC methodology, which includes cost optimality and controllability aspects at the early HEN design stage. Here, the IPDC problem for HENs which is typically formulated as a mathematical programming (optimization with constraints) problem is solved by decomposing it into four sequential hierarchical stages: (i) target selection, (ii) HEN design analysis, (iii) controllability analysis, and (iv) optimal selection and verification. In Stage 1, the minimum utility target for both external heat and cold utilities of the whole process plant is selected at the pinch point by using stream temperature versus enthalpy plot (STEP) concept.

There is a growing interest for biodiesel production from algae because of its higher yield non-edible oil production and its fast growth that does not compete for land with food production. About 50 % of algae weight is oil that this lipid oil {{can be used to make}} biodiesel. Algae is capable of yielding 30 times more oil per acre than the crops currently used in biodiesel production. Processes for biodiesel production from algae-oil are similar to food and non-food crops derived biodiesel processes. Because of disadvantages of fossil fuels, renewable energy sources are getting importance for sustainable energy development and environmental protection. Among the renewable sources, Iran has high biofuel energy potential. The Iranian government is considerable attention to the utilization of renewable energy, especially biofuels. Iran has enough land in order to algae cultivation that does not compete with food production.

40|$|Reducing {{anthropogenic}} GHG emissions globally is a {{key driver}} {{for the development of}} renewable energy sources. A key route towards achieving this is to replace fossil-based fuels with renewable and low carbon energy technologies such as biofuels from energy crops. Cereals and oil-seed crops such as corn, wheat, and soybean are the main feedstocks primarily used for biofuels production and the key characteristics of these crops are high biomass and energy yield per ha. However, there are concerns about the availability and sustainability of these crops for biofuels production {{in the face of a}} changing climate since crop productivity is inherently sensitive to climate. Therefore, an understanding of the impacts of climate change on energy crops production as feedstocks for biofuels production and their potential for life cycle GHG emissions reductions is crucial for making decisions on future biofuels production. This thesis examined potential climate change impacts on the productivity of two major biofuel crops: corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max) in Gainesville, USA and one major biofuel crop: wheat (Triticum spp.) in Rothamsted, UK. The overall objective was to calculate the potential impacts of combined changes in climate variables: surface air temperature (T), precipitation (P), and atmospheric concentration of CO 2 ([CO 2]) on life cycle GHG emissions savings of biofuels from corn, soybean, and wheat. The methodology was underpinned by life cycle thinking. Life cycle assessment (LCA) models linked to cropping system models (CSM) were used in the analysis. In assessing the impact of climate change on corn, wheat, and soybean crops yields, two applications of the CERES (Crop-Environment Resource Synthesis) model: CERES-Wheat (for wheat) and CERES-Maize (for corn), and CROPGRO (Crop Growth) model application: CROPGRO-Soybean of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT-CSM) v 4. 0. 2. 0 model were used using observed weather data from the baseline (1981 - 1990) period for each study site. These models describe, based on daily data, the basic biophysical processes taking place at the soil-plant-atmosphere interface as a response to the variability of different processes such as: photosynthesis, specific phenological phases, evapotranspiration, and water dynamics in soil. Compared with the baseline, T was projected to increase by + 1. 5, + 2, + 2. 5, + 3, + 3. 5, + 4, + 4. 5, and + 5 oC, P was projected to change by ± 5, ± 10, ± 15, and ± 20 %, and [CO 2] was projected to increase by + 70, + 140, + 210, + 280, and + 350 ppm for Gainesville, USA. For Rothamsted, UK, T was projected to increase by + 0. 5, + 1. 5, + 2. 5, + 3. 5, and + 4. 5 oC, P was projected to change by ± 10, and ± 20 %, and [CO 2] was projected to increase by + 70, + 210, and + 350 ppm. Simulated yields output (grain/seeds and biomass) from the CSM models were used as inputs into the LCA models. Potential life cycle GHG emissions savings were calculated for corn-based biofuels: corn bioethanol (CBE), corn integrated <b>biomethanol</b> (CIBM), and corn integrated bioelectricity (CIBE); soybean-based biofuels: soybean biodiesel (SBD), soybean integrated <b>biomethanol</b> (SIBM), and soybean integrated bioelectricity (SIBE); wheat-based biofuels: wheat bioethanol (WBE), wheat integrated <b>biomethanol</b> (WIBM), and wheat integrated bioelectricity (WIBE). Results indicated that under the baseline (1981 - 1990) scenario, production and use of CBE, CIBM, CIBE, SBD, SIBM, SIBE, WBE, WIBM, and WIBE could save - 4743. 32 kg CO 2 -equiv. ha- 1, - 8573. 31 kg CO 2 -equiv. ha- 1, and - 10996. 7 kg CO 2 -equiv. ha- 1, - 2655. 41 kg CO 2 -equiv. ha- 1, - 3441. 1 kg CO 2 -equiv. ha- 1, and - 1350. 04 kg CO 2 -equiv ha- 1, - 2776. 1 kg CO 2 -equiv. ha- 1, - 500. 87 kg CO 2 -equiv. ha- 1 and - 4648. 93 kg CO 2 -equiv. ha- 1 respectively, of the total life cycle GHG emissions of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O for the production and utilization of an energetically equivalent amount of fossil-based fuel counterpart, which they displaced. However, model predictions of future life cycle GHG emissions savings for both crops showed that the responses of corn, soybean, and wheat to simultaneous changes in T, P, and [CO 2] were different under different climate change scenarios. In the future period life cycle GHG emissions savings of corn-based biofuels was predicted to decline in all cases ranging from - 4. 2 % to - 46. 1 %, - 2. 6 % to - 37. 7 %, and - 1. 6 % to - 33. 4 % for CBE, CIBM, and CIBE, respectively compared with the baseline (1981 - 1990) period. In contrast, model predictions showed that life cycle GHG emissions savings of wheat-based biofuels would increase under all climate change scenarios ranging from + 2. 5 % to + 33. 5 %, + 0. 1 % to + 37. 8 %, and + 1. 0 % to + 34. 4 % for WBE, WIBM, and WIBE, respectively. On the other hand, the life cycle GHG emissions savings of soybean-based biofuels was predicted to increase by + 0. 22 % to + 27 %, + 0. 1 % to 28 %, and + 0. 1 % to + 31. 6 % for SBD, SIBM, and SIBE, respectively under some climate change scenarios (e. g., [CO 2] = 680; P = + 20 %; and T = + 1. 5 oC scenario) and also decline by - 0. 7 % to - 60. 8 %, - 0. 1 % to - 44. 6 %, and - 0. 1 % to - 82. 6 % for SBD, SIBM, and SIBE, respectively under some climate change scenarios (e. g., [CO 2] = 400; P = - 20 %; and T = + 5 oC scenario). These results revealed that the potential impacts of climate change on energy crops productivity and net life cycle GHG emissions savings could be very large and diverse, and that the anticipated life cycle GHG emissions reductions of biofuels would not be the same in the future...|$|E

This can be attributed in large part to the MARPOL (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) regulations in place since the 1970 s and progressively more stringent emission standards subsequently introduced by national legislators. This exploratory report gives an overview of the marine sector, including market share, emission related issues, fuel standards and present legislation. It then considers different alternative fuels, engine types and the introduction of alternative fuels. Low sulphur grade diesel fuels which are available at a higher price than traditional fuel, and possibility of using a scrubber to reduce emissions such as oxides of sulphur (SOx) on ships that run on traditional fuels are also discussed. The report then reviews biofuels such as <b>biomethanol,</b> dimethyl ether (DME), biodiesel, hydrogenation derived renewable diesel (HDRD) and algal biofuel. Of these, methanol has been put into commercial use, although so far derived from fossil sources, to fuel the large Stena Germanica ferry in the Baltic Sea. Among the gaseous fuels, LNG (liquefied natural gas), Bio-LNG and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) have been discussed. The report also considers electricity (battery operated), FT-diesel (Fischer-Tropsch diesel), pyrolysis oil, hydrogen in combination with fuel cells, solar power and wind energy as potential alternatives. At the moment, LNG and methanol seem to be the most promising alternatives with good market supply infrastructure in place. The sustainability of producing the alternative fuels and safety concerns has also been reported in the respective sections and also in reviews of some LCAs (life cycle assessments). The report concludes with future recommendations to not only utilise the expertise available at JRC in developing testing standards for the new fuels, but also to assist in formulation of policies that will direct the present positive momentum in the shipping industry as it is doing for the road transport sector.

40|$|Biofuels are a {{developing}} kind of fuel whose origin is biomass. Among them, many {{different kind of}} fuels can be found: bioethanol, biobutanol, biodiesel, vegetable oils, <b>biomethanol,</b> pyrolysis oils, biogas, and biohydrogen. This thesis work {{is focused on the}} production of biodiesel, which can be used in diesel engines as a substitute for mineral diesel. Biodiesel is obtained from different kinds of oils, both from vegetable and animal sources. However, vegetable oils are preferred because they tend to be liquid at room temperature. The process to obtain biodiesel implies first a reaction between the oil and an alcohol, using a catalyst and then a sedimentation, where the biodiesel and the glycerol, the two products that are obtained, can be separated because of their difference in density. After the separation, raw biodiesel is obtained and a treatment with either water bubbling or dry cleaning products is needed to obtain the product which will be ready to use. Many methods are available for the production of biodiesel, most of them require heat for the transesterification reaction, which converts the oil into biodiesel. Apart from that, in many cases biodiesel is produced by big companies or by individuals but using complicated and expensive installations. This work is an attempt to develop a way of producing biodiesel without any use of external heat, using a simple procedure which could be used by people with a low knowledge of chemistry or chemical processes. It also seeks to set an example on how biodiesel can be easily made by oneself without the use of any industrial systems, with a low budget and limited need of supervision over the process. In order to achieve that, many trials were undertaken, introducing changes in the different parameters that are responsible for the changes in the final product. Among them, changes in the amount and type of catalyst, the way the catalyst is added, the type of oil used, the time of reaction and the temperature were made. Apart from that, different types of cleaning were tried, starting by water cleaning and then using powder type products, Magnesol, D-Sol and Aerogel. A centrifuge was also tried to test its utility when separating impurities from liquids or different liquid phases. The results of the different trials were analysed using various tests, the most important being the 3 : 27 test, the solubility test, the soap titration and pH measurements. To sum up, it could be said that the investigation was a success, since it was proved that biodiesel can be made without the use of any external heat with both alkali and acid catalysts, as well as with different ways of adding the catalyst. As for the cleaning, good results were obtained with both dry products and water cleaning, since the soap content of the biodiesel was reduced in both cases. Apart from that, the centrifuge proved to be valid to eliminate impurities from raw oil...|$|E
