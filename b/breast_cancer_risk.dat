5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risk,</b> and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Breast</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{the most}} common {{invasive}} cancer in women in the world. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a carcinogenic component of cigarette smoke and grilled meat, was related to expression of enzymes involved in several epithelial malignancies including <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Understanding the association of exposure to B[a]P and <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> may inform potential disease preventive measures. The objective of this systematic review was to assess from epidemiological studies the relationship between the exposure to and the risks and development of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in humans. Study design: A systematic search using keywords in PubMed (1990 - 2014), CNKI (1994 - 2014) and Google Scholar databases was carried out to identify eligible epidemiological studies on the association between the exposure to B[alP and <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> published during 1990 - 2014. Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and included in this review. All nine included studies used case-control design, with B[a]P exposure mainly proxied by benzo(a) pyrene diolepoxide (BPDE) and dietary consumption of B[a]P-rich food. Of these, seven found a significant positive association between B[a]P exposure and <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risks,</b> after adjustment for age, family history of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> smoking, ethnicity, alcohol use and parity in most studies. Discussion: Discuss the potential reason for inconsistence, the possible biological pathways explaining the role of B[a]P in the development of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> limitations of the studies and the public health implication from this review. Conclusion: A positive association between B[a]P exposure and <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> was suggestive from the systematic review. However given the limited number of studies included, further prospective cohort studies in humans as well as molecular/animal studies are warranted to explore the impact of B[a]P on the development of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> to inform evidence based preventive measures against <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

40|$|When {{trying to}} predict <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> screening, {{it may be}} {{important}} to understand the relationships between perceived <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> and worries about getting <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> This study examines the extent to which women’s worries about <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> correlate with perceptions of both absolute (assessment of own) and comparative (self versus other) 10 -year and lifetime risks. As part of a larger randomized intervention trial concerning hormone replacement therapy, 581 women participated in a telephone baseline survey to assess their perceptions of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> and worries. Worries about getting <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in the next 10 years and in one’s lifetime were related positively to both absolute and comparative 10 -year and lifetime risks. The magnitude of these relationships did not differ by time frame. Worry about <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> is a function of both how a woman views her own risk and how she compares her risk with that of other women. Some practitioners may encourage women to get screened for <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> by using emotional appeals, such as heightening women’s worries about <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> by using <b>risk</b> information. Our data suggest that they should give careful consideration how best to combine, if at all, information about absolute and comparative risks. For example, if the motivation to screen is based on a sequential assessment of risk beginning with comparative and then absolute risk, creating communications that heighten perceived risk on both of these risk dimensions may be needed to evoke sufficient worry to initiate <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> screening...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Low-risk <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> {{susceptibility}} alleles or SNPs confer {{only modest}} <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> ranging from just over 1. 0 to 1. 3 fold. Yet, they are common among most populations and therefore {{are involved in}} the development of essentially all <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b> The mechanism by which the low-risk SNPs confer <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> is currently unclear. The <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> association consortium BCAC has hypothesized that the low-risk SNPs modulate expression levels of nearby located genes. Methods Genotypes of five low-risk SNPs were determined for 40 human <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cell lines, by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic templates. We have analyzed expression of the four genes that are located nearby the low-risk SNPs, by using real-time RT-PCR and Human Exon microarrays. Results The SNP genotypes and additional phenotypic data on the <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cell lines are presented. We did not detect any effect of the SNP genotypes on expression levels of the nearby-located genes MAP 3 K 1, FGFR 2, TNRC 9 and LSP 1. Conclusion The SNP genotypes provide a base line for functional studies in a well-characterized cohort of 40 human <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cell lines. Our expression analyses suggest that a putative disease mechanism through gene expression modulation is not operative in <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cell lines. </p...|$|R
40|$|IMPORTANCE E-cadherin (CDH 1) is {{a cancer}} {{predisposition}} gene mutated in families meeting clinically defined hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Reliable estimates of <b>cancer</b> <b>risk</b> and spectrum in germline mutation carriers {{are essential for}} management. For families without CDH 1 mutations, genetic-based risk stratification has not been possible, resulting in limited clinical options. OBJECTIVES To derive accurate estimates of gastric and <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> in CDH 1 mutation carriers and determine if germline mutations in other genes are associated with HDGC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Testing for CDH 1 germline mutationswas performed on 183 index cases meeting clinical criteria for HDGC. Penetrance was derived from 75 mutation-positive families from within this and other cohorts, comprising 3858 probands (353 with gastric cancer and 89 with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer).</b> Germline DNA from 144 HDGC probands lacking CDH 1 mutations was screened using multiplexed targeted sequencing for 55 cancer-associated genes.

25|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the risks and benefits associated with oophorectomy in the BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population are different than those for the general population. Prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is an important option for the high-risk population to consider. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations who undergo salpingo-oophorectomy have lower all-cause mortality rates than women in the same population who do not undergo this procedure. In addition, RRSO has been shown to decrease mortality specific to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Women who undergo RRSO are also at a lower risk for developing ovarian cancer and first occurrence breast cancer. Specifically, RRSO provides BRCA1 mutation carriers with no prior breast cancer a 70% reduction of ovarian cancer risk. BRCA1 mutation carriers with prior breast cancer can benefit from an 85% reduction. High-risk women who have not had prior breast cancer can benefit from a 37% (BRCA1 mutation) and 64% (BRCA2 mutation) reduction of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risk.</b> These benefits are important to highlight, as they are unique to this BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population.|$|E
25|$|Data exist {{from both}} {{observational}} and randomized clinical trials regarding {{the association between}} menopausal hormone replacement therapy (menopausal HRT) and breast cancer. The largest meta-analysis (1997) of data from 51 observational studies, indicated a relative {{risk of breast cancer}} of 1.35 for women who had used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a randomized controlled trial, which randomized more than 16,000 postmenopausal women to receive combined hormone therapy or placebo, was halted early (2002) because health risks exceeded benefits. One of the adverse outcomes prompting closure was a significant increase in both total and invasive breast cancers (hazard ratio = 1.24) in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years. HRT-related breast cancers had adverse prognostic characteristics (more advanced stages and larger tumors) compared with cancers occurring in the placebo group, and HRT was also associated with a substantial increase in abnormal mammograms. Short-term use of hormones for treatment of menopausal symptoms appears to confer little or no <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risk.</b> A correlation was found between the use of hormonal contraceptives and subsequent reliance on hormone replacement therapy.|$|E

We examined how these presentations individually and jointly affected women’s perceived lifetime <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>risks.</b> Overall, providing risk estimates either as a range of risks or as a point estimate lowered women’s perceived lifetime risks compared with women who did not get information presented this way shortly after receipt of this information relative to baseline. At the 6 month follow-up, perceptions of lifetime risks generally returned to their baseline values. Overall, women viewed their risk feedback, whether presented as a point estimate or as a range of risks, as equally credible, trustworthy, accurate, and personally relevant. These results suggest that women evaluate risk feedback containing either point estimates or range of risks as equally acceptable. Both formats lead to short-term reductions in perceived risk (i. e., greater accuracy) ...|$|R
