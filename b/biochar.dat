40|$|It {{is known}} that {{properties}} of activated <b>biochars</b> are tightly associated {{with those of the}} original feedstock as well as pyrolysis and activation conditions. This study examined two feedstock types, pine wood shavings and chicken litter, to produce <b>biochars</b> at two different pyrolysis temperatures and subsequently activated by steam, acid or base. In order to measure activation efficiency, all materials were characterized for their properties and ability to remediate two well-known heavy metals of concern: copper and arsenic. Base activated <b>biochars</b> were superior in arsenic adsorption, to acid or steam activated samples, but increase in adsorption was not significant to warrant use. For wood <b>biochars,</b> significant increases of surface functionality as related to oxygen bearing groups and surface charge were observed upon acid activation which led to increased copper ion adsorption. However, oxygen bearing functionalities were not sufficient to explain why chicken litter <b>biochars</b> and steam activated <b>biochars</b> appeared to be significantly superior to wood shavings in positively charged metal ion adsorption.

To distinguish the effects of porosity from the effects of hydrophobicity, we compared uptake of water to uptake of ethanol (which is completely wetting and not affected by hydrophobic materials). For both feedstocks, low temperature <b>biochars</b> took up less water than high temperature <b>biochars</b> but the same amount of ethanol, suggesting that differences in water uptake based on production temperature reflect differences in surface hydrophobicity, not porosity. Conversely, Douglas fir <b>biochars</b> took up more water than hazelnut shell <b>biochars</b> due to greater porosity. Thus, designing <b>biochars</b> for water holding applications requires two considerations: (a) creating sufficient porosity through feedstock selection, and (b) determining a production temperature that reduces hydrophobicity to an acceptable level...|$|R

25|$|<b>Biochar</b> is {{charcoal}} {{produced at}} relatively low temperatures from a biomass {{of wood and}} leafy plant materials in an environment with very low or no oxygen. Amending soil with <b>biochar</b> has been observed to increase the activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Tests of high porosity materials such as zeolite, activated carbon, and charcoal show that microbial growth substantially improves with charcoal. It may be that small pieces of charcoal migrate within the soil, providing a habitat for bacteria that decompose the biomass in the surface ground cover. This process may have {{an essential role in}} terra preta's self-propagation; a virtuous cycle develops as the fungus spreads from the charcoal, fixing additional carbon, stabilizing the soil with glomalin, and increasing nutrient availability for nearby plants. Many other agents contribute, from earthworms to humans as well as the charring process.|$|E

We attribute this existing underestimation to unnoticed slow kinetics of electron transfer from <b>biochars</b> to the dissolved redox mediators used in the monitoring.

The increase in volatile matter (r[*]=[*] 0.642 **, Table  4) {{could be due to}} modification the functional groups by pyrolysis temperatures (Domingues et al. 2017). Volatile matter is composed of easily degradable aliphatic carbon compounds with C–H (750 – 900  cm− 1) and C–O (2950 – 2850  cm− 1) stretching (Jindo et al. 2014). Consequently, these <b>biochars</b> could be suitable for use as soil amendment to improve soil fertility as they contain substrates which are suitable source of carbon and energy for soil microorganisms (Khodadad et al. 2011; Lehmann et al. 2011). Higher-temperature pyrolysis destroys suitable functional groups and produces aromatic carbon compounds with C–H, C=C, C–C, and C–O stretching (3050 – 3000  cm− 1, 1380 – 1450  cm− 1 and 1580 – 1700  cm− 1) that are highly recalcitrant and decompose slowly (Jindo et al. 2014).
