Whatever was cold she handed over to the servants to appease the hunger of the arrivals, while she <b>broiled</b> <b>steaks,</b> and heated the great perennial cauldron of broth with all the expedition in her power, with the help of Thora and the grumbling cook, when he appeared, angry at being disturbed.|$|R

50|$|Sirloin Stockade's first {{restaurant}} {{opened in}} Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1966. The original location had a giant 1,800 pound (820 kg) plastic ornamental cow at the location circa the 1970s. Other locations also had, and some continue to have, such large ornamental cows on trailers and mounted atop outdoor signage. Sirloin Stockade restaurants provide an all-you-can-eat buffet, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sirloin Stockade fare include <b>broiled</b> <b>steaks,</b> chicken and fried shrimp, among others. In 2008, there were 28 company-owned and managed Sirloin Stockade restaurants and 74 restaurant franchises. As of June 2016, the company operated over 80 restaurants in 9 U.S. {{states and in}} Mexico. The restaurants are typically 8000 - 9000 sq ft in size and have around 100-115 employees at each location. Circa December 2014, a Sirloin Stockade location in Galesburg, Illinois discontinued offering steak in its buffet due to escalating beef and food prices, but continued to offer steak as a menu item.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to determine the influence that broiler temperature and degree of doneness had upon palatability, cholesterol content (CC), and fatty acid (FA) and proximate composition (PC) of beef strip loin steaks from different USDA quality grades. Seven strip loins were obtained from each of USDA Standard, low Select, high Select, low Choice, ave to high Choice, and low to ave Prime quality carcasses of known age, ancestry and management. After storing 9 days (d) postmortem (PM), 3. 0 cm steaks were cut (except Prime = 23 d), vacuum-packaged and frozen. After thawing, <b>steaks</b> were <b>broiled</b> at either 246 °C or 316 °C to an internal temperature of 62. 8 °C or 70 °C;Trained sensory panelists scored samples of steaks from Standard lower (p 3 ̆c. 05) and those from Prime higher (p 3 ̆c. 05) than steaks from Select or Choice, respectively, for tenderness, juiciness, flavor, and overall desirability. <b>Steaks</b> <b>broiled</b> to 62. 8 °C (internal temperature) scored higher (p 3 ̆c. 05) for these same palatability attributes than those broiled to 70 °C. <b>Steaks</b> <b>broiled</b> at 316 °C were less juicy (p 3 ̆c. 05) than those broiled at 246 °C;Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) {{was used to determine}} CC in 2 ̆ 2 lean-only 2 ̆ 2 samples from raw and cooked steaks. Raw Prime had a higher CC (p 3 ̆c. 05) than Standard or Select, however, after broiling, these differences were negated;Raw Standard grade steaks had a lower percentage of C 16 : 0 (p 3 ̆c. 05) and higher percentage of C 18 : 2 (p 3 ̆c. 05) than those from Select, Choice and Prime. After <b>broiling,</b> <b>steaks</b> from high Select, Choice and Prime had a higher percentage of C 18 : 1 (p 3 ̆c. 05) than those from low Select and Standard. For both raw and cooked steaks, as quality grade increased, lipid content (LC) and caloric density (CD) increased (p 3 ̆c. 05);Our results suggest that degree of doneness of beef which possesses at least a slight degree of marbling is more important than quality grade for ensuring desirable palatability. Furthermore, CC differences observed in raw steaks differing in LC were negated after cooking. Using GCMS techniques, our data reveal CC was 10 - 15...|$|R

40|$|A TER {{a careful}} study of {{anorexia}} in 1, 471 {{children between the}} ages of 1 and 14 years, Bartlett (2) has divided his cases in two groups: (a) organic anorexia in which a definite cause for the condition could be determined; (b) functional anorexia in which an organic cause that could possibly explain the condition could not be found. The commonest pathological conditions found associated with marked loss of appetite were: (1) septic tonsils and adenoids; (2) acute infectious diseases; (3) tuberculosis; (4) pyelitis; and (5) dental caries. Thirty-five per cent of these children belonged to the group of functional anorexia and the most reliable method of treatment was the introduction of fresh calf's liver, <b>broiled</b> beef <b>steak</b> and lamb's kidneys into the diet of the child. Daily administrations of saccharated iron and cod liver oil were also tried with out any significant responses.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of food preparation methods on the composition of fatty acids and cholesterol in foods. MethodsThe chemical composition of cholesterol and fatty acids was analyzed in eight different types of meat and feijoada 1 in relation to different methods of preparation. ResultsFeijoada, when prepared with the beans and meats in separate pots, has less cholesterol (12. 1 vs. 16. 1 mg, respectively, p= 0. 005) and saturated fat (1. 4 vs. 1. 9 mg, p= 0. 046) than when it is prepared in a single pot. Broiled chicken without the skin has less saturated fat when compared with skinless fried chicken (1, 505 vs. 7, 645 mg, p= 0. 049). Broiled shrimp also has a lower saturated fat content than fried shrimp (532 vs. 1, 262 mg, p= 0. 049). <b>Broiled</b> ribeye <b>steak</b> without fat has a lower cholesterol content {{when compared with the}} fried steak (102 vs. 114 mg, p= 0. 049).

40|$|OBJETIVO: Analisar a influência do modo de preparo na composição de ácidos graxos e colesterol em alimentos. MÉTODOS: Foi analisada a composição química do colesterol e ácidos graxos de oito tipos diferentes de carnes e da feijoada, em relação a diferentes métodos de preparo. RESULTADOS: A feijoada preparada com as carnes em separado tem menos colesterol (12, 1 e 16, 1 mg, respectivamente; p = 0, 005) e gordura saturada (1, 4 e 1, 9 mg; p = 0, 046) do que quando preparada junto. O frango grelhado sem pele apresenta menor quantidade de gordura saturada quando comparado com o frango frito sem pele (7645 e 1505 mg; p = 0, 049). O camarão grelhado também apresenta menor conteúdo de gordura saturada quando comparado com o frito (532 e 1262 mg; p = 0, 049). O contrafilé grelhado sem gordura apresenta menor conteúdo de colesterol quando comparado com o frito (102 e 114 mg; p = 0, 049). CONCLUSÃO: As análises aqui {{realizadas}} indicam que a forma de preparo influencia no teor de gordura dos alimentos, com potencial impacto na prescrição de dietas com baixo teor de gordura e colesterol.
