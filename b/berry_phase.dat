When the barrier is sufficiently small, this is called (free) pseudorotation (not {{to be confused with}} the rotation of a rigid body in space, see difference between real and pseudo rotations illustrated [...] for the fullerene molecule C60). When the barrier between the minima and the saddle points on the warped path exceeds a vibrational quantum, pseudorotational motion is slowed down and occurs through tunnelling.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of electrons in solids {{is influenced by}} <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> in phase space (combined position and momentum space). Phase-space <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> lead to an effective force on the electrons, an anomalous contribution to the group velocity, and a correction to the density of states in phase space. In addition, <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> in position and in momentum space are related to topological winding numbers {{and can be used}} to characterize topologically distinct phases of matter. We study theoretically the effects of phase-space <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> in magnetic materials with weak spin-orbit coupling and a smoothly varying magnetization texture. Such magnetic textures appear generically in non-centrosymmetric magnetic materials with weak spin-orbit coupling due to a competition between the ferromagnetic exchange interaction and the weaker Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In particular, the discovery of topologically stable whirls, so-called skyrmions, in the magnetization texture of these materials has attracted considerable attention due to prospects of applications in future magnetic storage devices. In part I of this thesis, we investigate the influence of phase-space <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> on the equilibrium properties of electrons in chiral magnets with weak spin-orbit coupling. We show that the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the long-wavelength limit can be calculated from <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> in mixed position/momentum space and that the same <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> lead to an electric charge of skyrmions in metallic chiral magnets. In insulators, the skyrmion charge of magnetic skyrmions turns out to be proportional to the topologically quantized second Chern number in phase space. This establishes a link between skyrmions in chiral magnets and the charged excitations in integer quantum Hall systems with small Zeeman splitting. In part II, we consider the Hall effect in the skyrmion lattice phase of chiral magnets in presence of spin-orbit coupling. It has been previously known that <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> in momentum space lead to the intrinsic part of the anomalous Hall effect, and that <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> in position space lead to an effective Lorentz force, resulting in the so-called topological Hall effect. By expanding the Kubo-Středa Formula for the Hall conductivity in gradients in position and momentum space, we show that the interplay between smooth magnetic textures and spin-orbit coupling leads to a previously disregarded contribution to the Hall effect, and we find a correction to the semiclassical formulation of the topological Hall effect. In part III, we study the influence of phase-space <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> on the {{dynamics of}} skyrmions in chiral magnets. <b>Berry</b> <b>phases</b> in mixed position/momentum space lead to a dissipationless momentum transfer from conduction electrons to skyrmions that is proportional to an applied electric field and independent of the (spin or electric) current. We further show that the electric charge of skyrmions, discussed in part I, influences the skyrmion motion only via hydrodynamic drag and ohmic friction in metals. In insulators, the quantized skyrmion charge couples directly to an applied electric field...|$|R
