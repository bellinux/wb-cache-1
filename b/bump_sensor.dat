50|$|In March 2014, Neato Robotics {{released}} an expanded model dubbed BotVac developed over several years, {{with a side}} brush previously available only on the limited distribution Vorwerk Kobold models in Germany (see below). BotVacs were initially priced about 20 {{percent higher than the}} older XV models. The new model featured additional major changes re-arranging the internal construction with larger filter area and dust bin, for less frequent servicing and covering larger premises, and the battery compacted into a single compartment instead of two separate compartments in the older models. The main front brush was made longer and closer to the wall, with a new more closely fitting <b>bump</b> <b>sensor</b> construction. Along with the side brush this cleans the margin against walls much more closely than the older models, which left a two inch wide strip untouched. The longer brush covers a wider swath of floor on each pass and the unit runs much quieter. The casing was modernized with more snap-fit fastenings and fewer screws. Internal electronics were upgraded and refined, and new commercial embedded systems operating system used. The brush drive belt was covered by a cowling with a new mounting method. A major improvement in efficiency was made with a lower voltage 10-cell 12v battery but higher in Ampere-Hours capacity than the older 12-cell battery, reflecting advances in battery manufacture over years. The battery remains NiMh compared to the Lithium battery used in Germany (and avoiding all hazard concerns with Lithium Ion batteries). However, the new Botvac Connected has a lithium battery. The BotVac is sold in several packages differing in accessories included such as extra filters and different brush types, same as the previous XV models were packaged.|$|E

The benefits of CAN bus based network over traditional point to point schemes will offer increased flexibility and expandability for future technology insertions. This paper describes system which uses sensors to measure various parameters of the car like speed, distance from the other car, presence of alcohol in car and accidental change of lane and sends a warning signal to the driver if any of the parameter goes out of range to avoid accidents and breakdown of car. In addition to this if accident occurs in any remote area then using <b>bump</b> <b>sensor</b> accident is detected and SMS is send immediately using GSM. Also temperature and pressure sensors are implemented to check engine's temperature and fuel pressure for regular maintenance. A situation that provides {{a good example of how}} the system works is when a driver is about to change lanes, and there is a car in his blind spot.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a general framework for learning perception-based navigational behaviors in autonomous mobile robots. A hierarchical behavior-based decomposition {{of the control}} architecture is used to facilitate efficient modular learning. Lower level reactive behaviors such as collision detection and obstacle avoidance are learned using a stochastic hill-climbing method while higher level goal-directed navigation is achieved using a self-organizing sparse distributed memory. The memory is initially trained by teleoperating the robot on {{a small number of}} paths within a given domain of interest. During training, the vectors in the sensory space as well as the motor space are continually adapted using a form of competitive learning to yield basis vectors that efficiently span the sensorimotor space. After training, the robot navigates from arbitrary locations to a desired goal location using motor output vectors computed by a saliency-based weighted averaging scheme. The pervasive problem of perceptual aliasing in finite-order Markovian environments is handled by allowing both current as well as the set of immediately preceding perceptual inputs to predict the motor output vector for the current time instant. We describe experimental and simulation results obtained using a mobile robot equipped with <b>bump</b> <b>sensors,</b> photosensors and infrared receivers, navigating within an enclosed obstacle-ridden arena. The results indicate that the method performs successfully in a number of navigational tasks exhibiting varying degrees of perceptual aliasing...|$|R
5000|$|Turtles are a {{class of}} {{educational}} robots designed originally in the late 1940s (largely {{under the auspices of}} researcher William Grey Walter) and used in computer science and mechanical engineering training.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a proof of concept {{implementation}} of a Hyper-Redundent Reconfigurable Modular Manipulator system (RMMS) in an attempt to validate the Modular Decentralized Control (MDC) technique in a real world environment. Hyper-redundancy enables flexibility in configuration space. Decentralized control of manipulators enables modular construction with its attendant ease of design and reduced cost. The need for a full environment reconstruction in one master controller is bypassed by having localized and simpler subgoals for each module. The manipulator has been designed with each clone module a selfcontained structure including mechanical hardware, actuators, microprocessors and motor controllers. Flange interfaces at both ends of a module allowed for ease in system reconfigurability. Each module had two rotational DOFs and formed part of an exemplar serial manipulator allowing for 3 D end effector position and orientation control as determined from a combination of all module’s local actions. Test data from the environment in real time was transmitted to the first module via a stereo vision system. Each module in the system then took pseudo-independant control action, communicating through receiving and transmitting data between adjacent serial modules that formed a robot anthropic structure. The system also had the capability to avoid obstacles in real time by inclusion of <b>bump</b> <b>sensors</b> on each module. The results demonstrated the predicted fault-tolerant, robust nature of the control approach, achieving system flexibility and versatility.

One technique that has been used to speed up vision processing is that of selective visual attention [1]. This technique is based on the idea that not all areas in agiven visual scene are relevant to the task at hand. Therefore by restricting one's attention to the relevant parts of the scene, the agent can greatly increaseits visual processing speed. This intuition is corroborated by work in cognitive science confirming that human vision processing takes advantage of selectiveattention. For example, Sprague et al. [2] present a model of visual attention and compare it to human eye-tracking data. In robotic vision, selective attention can take two main forms. One is gaze direction, in which a robot moves its camera so that its field of view is facedtowards the important information [3 - 5]. That approach is analogous to human eye saccading, but does not address the question of how to process each image,an often time-consuming process...|$|R

This thesis {{focuses on the}} development of handheld sensors for in vivo measurement of soft tissue tension. The sensors will aid the surgeon in balancing forces in soft tissues during total knee arthroplasty, ACL repair, hip replacement surgeries, shoulder stabilization and other orthopaedic procedures by providing real-time measures of tension in soft tissue. The proposed method utilizes the application of an unknown transverse force on the soft tissue using a handheld probe. An array of miniature sensors on the probe is used to measure the resulting curvature of the soft tissue and tissue tension is estimated from this measurement. The first generation sensor developed in the project utilized capacitive sensing units to measure the forces required to displace the ligament by a fixed amount determined by the pattern of <b>bumps</b> in the <b>sensor.</b> These force values were used to estimate the tension in the ligament. The sensing concept was experimentally demonstrated; however it was not found to be suitable for hand held applications due to restrictions involved with the point of the contact along the ligament and also due to unreliability associated with estimates in the presence of noise. A second generation sensor design was developed to estimate the tension from displacements of three points on the sensor under three transverse loads. A sensor was fabricated using soft rubber <b>bumps.</b> The <b>sensor</b> works reasonably well for controlled orientations; however it is not suitable for hand held applications due to its sensitivity to orientation errors. Several challenges related to micro-fabrication also cause imperfections in the sensor and introduce variability in the results. The third generation sensor utilized changes in magnetic field to measure the displacements and curvature of the soft tissue. Linear coil springs were used in the sensor to ensure accurate calculation of forces from force-displacement relations. The design allowed for higher displacements within the sensor and hence was found to be significantly less sensitive to orientation errors as compared to the second generation sensor. The experimental results both during controlled orientations and handheld operation show that the sensor can measure tension values up to 100 N with a resolution of 10 N or better. The feasibility of the sensor to measure tension in biological tissues is also demonstrated using experimental tests with a turkey tendon. The developed magnetic sensor was also reconfigured for use in two other medical diagnosis applications. The sensor was able to measure tissue elasticity with five times better resolution and four times the range of other elasticity sensors previously proposed in the literature. The sensor could also be used to measure compartment pressure for non-invasive diagnosis of compartment syndrome. In-vitro results using both a pneumatic compartment and an agarose-gel compartment showed that the sensor could accurately measure compartment pressure and could be a non-invasive alternative to invasive catheter based measurements for diagnosing compartment syndrome...|$|R

The charge sharing results obtained from the X-ray beam study of the 3 D sensor are shown to agree with a simple simulation in which charge diffusion is neglected. The devices tested are found to be compatible with having a region in which no charge is collected centred on the electrode columns and of radius 7. 6 ± 0. 6 μm. Charge collection above and below the columnar electrodes in the double-sided 3 D sensor is observed. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA...|$|R
40|$|Thermo-compression bonding (TCB) {{relies on}} uniform thermal {{distribution}} during microelectronic packaging processes to ensure reliable interconnects are formed. During any TCB processes, the thermal application must uniformly distribute heat {{in order to}} produce robust, thoroughly bonded packages without being damaged due to thermo-mechanical effects. To better control and develop TCB processes, further insight through thermal analysis is required. Due to the form factors and complexity involved in TCB, it is difficult to accurately extract viable information such as temperature variation, lateral and vertical gradients, or interfacial bonding temperatures. To extract real time in-situ temperature and force signals, a microsensor array was used to observe any thermo-mechanical features recorded during emulated TCB processes. Algorithms were developed to post-process the signals and produce quantifiable data. Finite element models were developed to verify the experimental thermal responses and subsequently post-analyze the numerical results. Models formed through hybridized contact resistance layers as well as surface contact models are also discussed. Several features were identified and quantified: maximum heating rates, location of maximum lateral thermal gradients, internal joint thermal distributions, knee-region slope analysis and joint to joint thermal variation. The experimental responses in combination with numerical analyses show evidence that thermal applications during TCB is robust. Low thermal variation was found with respect to joint to joint temperatures. Chip design was found to heavily influence cooling on the periphery edges of the <b>bump</b> array. The <b>sensor</b> chip temperatures were to found to be about ≈ 6 °C lower than the extracted bump temperatures, signifying the use of microsensor arrays could be developed as accurate tools for thermal process control during TCB...|$|R
