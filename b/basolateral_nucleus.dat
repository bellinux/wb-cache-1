The <b>basolateral</b> <b>nucleus</b> differs from the cortex in that it is not layered, but it includes pyramidal neurons, is continuous with the parahippocampal cortex, and has extensive connections with the other parts of the cortex. Its strongest direct connections to the cerebral cortex are with the insular cortex, the orbital cortex, and the medial wall of the frontal lobe. These connections allow the <b>basolateral</b> <b>nucleus</b> to receive and modulate sensory and polysensory processing. The neurotransmitter in each of these connections is either glutamate or aspartate.

40|$|Dopaminergic cell bodies {{located within}} the ventral {{mesencephalon}} innervate the amygdaloid complex, a region critically involved in the attribution of affective significance to environmental stimuli. Recently, we have shown that post-session intra-amygdala administration of a D 3 dopamine receptor agonist enhances selectively the acquisition of an appetitive conditioned response. In the present study, we have investigated the potential involvement of the central <b>nucleus</b> and the <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the amygdala in mediating this effect. Thus, rats were trained to associate an arbitrary stimulus (CS+) with the availability of 10 % sucrose reward. Post-session infusions of the D 3 receptor-preferring agonist, R(+) 7 -OH- DPAT, were made into either the central <b>nucleus</b> or <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Acquisition of a conditioned approach response was enhanced by R(+) 7 -OH- DPAT infusions within the central nucleus, but not within the <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Drug infusions into either region failed to affect approach behaviour elicited by presentation of a control stimulus (CS-), explicitly unpaired with sucrose reward. The effects of pre-test infusions of R(+) 7 -OHDPAT on the instrumental properties of the stimuli were then determined. Rats were presented with two novel levers, depression of one lever resulted in presentation of the CS+, while presentation of the CS- was contingent upon depression of the other lever. Rates of response upon each lever {{as well as the}} ability of the conditioned stimuli subsequently to elicit conditioned approach behaviour were recorded. Data revealed a double dissociation of the effects of R(+) 7 -OH-DPAT on the expression of the Pavlovian and instrumental properties of the reward-related stimulus. Thus, within the central nucleus R(+) 7 -OH-DPAT dose-dependently attenuated expression of the conditioned approach response, but had no effect upon instrumental responding maintained by the conditioned reward. In contrast, within the <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei,</b> R(+) 7 -OH-DPAT had no effect upon expression of conditioned approach behaviour, but abolished selectively the ability of the reward-associated stimulus to support the acquisition of a novel instrumental response. Hence, these data indicate that distinct regions of the amygdaloid complex process distinct aspects of conditioned appetitive behaviours...|$|R

50|$|The amygdala’s role in learned fear {{includes}} {{interactions with}} other brain {{regions in the}} neural circuit of fear. While lesions in the amygdala can inhibit its ability to recognize fearful stimuli, other {{areas such as the}} ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the amygdala can affect the region's ability to not only become conditioned to fearful stimuli, but to eventually extinguish them. The <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei,</b> through receiving stimulus info, undergo synaptic changes which allow the amygdala to develop a conditioned response to fearful stimuli. Lesions in this area, therefore, have been shown to disrupt the acquisition of learned responses to fear. Likewise, lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (the area responsible for monitoring the amygdala) have been shown to not only slow down the speed of extinguishing a learned fear response, but also how effective or strong the extinction is. This suggests there is a pathway or circuit among the amygdala and nearby cortical areas that process emotional stimuli and influence emotional expression, all of which can be disrupted when an area becomes damaged.|$|R
40|$|Pharmacobehavioral {{studies in}} {{experimental}} animals, and imaging studies in humans, indicate that serotonergic transmission in the amygdala {{plays a key}} role in emotional processing, especially for anxiety-related stimuli. The lateral and <b>basolateral</b> amygdaloid <b>nuclei</b> receive a dense serotonergic innervation in all species studied to date. We investigated interrelations between serotonergic afferents and neuropeptide Y (NPY) -producing neurons, which are a subpopulation of inhibitory interneurons in the rat lateral and <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei</b> with particularly strong anxiolytic properties. Dual light microscopic immunolabeling showed numerous appositions of serotonergic afferents on NPY-immunoreactive somata. Using electron microscopy, direct membrane appositions and synaptic contacts between serotonin-containing axon terminals and NPY-immunoreactive cellular profiles were unequivocally established. Double in situ hybridization documented that more than 50  %, and about 30 – 40  % of NPY mRNA-producing neurons, co-expressed inhibitory 5 -HT 1 A and excitatory 5 -HT 2 C mRNA receptor subtype mRNA, respectively, in both nuclei with no gender differences. Triple in situ hybridization showed that individual NPY mRNA-producing interneurons co-express both 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 2 C mRNAs. Co-expression of NPY and 5 -HT 3 mRNA was not observed. The results demonstrate that serotonergic afferents provide substantial innervation of NPY-producing neurons in the rat lateral and <b>basolateral</b> amygdaloid <b>nuclei.</b> Studies of serotonin receptor subtype co-expression indicate a differential impact of the serotonergic innervation on this small, but important, population of anxiolytic interneurons, and provide the basis for future studies of the circuitry underlying serotonergic modulation of emotional stimulus processing in the amygdala...|$|R
50|$|While the stria terminalis carries {{information}} {{primarily from}} the corticomedian nuclei of the amygdala, the ventral amygdalofugal pathway carries output from the central and <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei</b> and delivers it a number of targets; namely, the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the basal forebrain, the brain stem, septal nuclei and nucleus accumbens. Both the amygdalofugal pathway and the stria terminalis project to the septal region, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus, but the stria terminalis reaches the septal region and the hypothalamus in a much longer and less direct path. While the stria terminalis follows a C-shaped pathway along the lateral ventricles, the ventral amygdalofugal pathway is more direct and contains {{a higher proportion of}} myelinated axons, causing the pathway to appear darker upon observation in stained crossection.|$|R

50|$|The {{amygdala}} is an almond shaped mass of nuclei that {{is located}} {{deep in the}} brain’s medial temporal lobe. It processes the events associated with fear and is being linked to social phobia and other anxiety disorders. The amygdala's {{ability to respond to}} fearful stimuli occurs through the process of fear conditioning. Similar to classical conditioning, the amygdala learns to associate a conditioned stimulus with a negative or avoidant stimulus, creating a conditioned fear response that is often seen in phobic individuals. In this way the amygdala is responsible for not only recognizing certain stimuli or cues as dangerous, but plays a role in the storage of threatening stimuli to memory. The <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei</b> (or <b>basolateral</b> amygdala) and the hippocampus interact with the amygdala in the storage of memory, which suggests why memories are often remembered more vividly if they have emotional significance.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that spatial, movement, and reward information is integrated within the ventral striatum (VS). The present study examined the possible contribution of the <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the amygdala (BLA) to this interaction by examining behavioral correlates of BLA neurons while rats performed multiple memory trials on an 8 -arm radial maze. Alternate arms consistently held 1 of 2 different amounts of reward. Recorded cells were correlated with motion, auditory input, space, and reward acquisition. Reward-related units were found that anticipated reward encounter, that responded during reward consumption, and that differentiated between high and low reward magnitude. This is consistent with the hypothesis that BLA neurons may provide the VS with reward-related information that could then be integrated with spatial information to ultimately affect goal-directed behavior. Past research into the role of the amygdala in animal behavior has demonstrated that it is an important substrate for the association of cues with their affective significance.

40|$|Abstract—Restricted feeding {{schedules}} (RF) {{in which}} daily access to food {{is limited to}} a few hours each day can entrain the rhythms of expression of circadian clock genes in the brain and periphery in rodents.

The right-left amygdala asymmetry in control subjects was absent in the cocaine addicts. Topological analysis of amygdala isosurfaces (population averages) revealed that the isosurface of the cocaine-dependent group undercut the anterior and superior surfaces of the control group, implicating a difference in the corticomedial and <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei.</b> In cocaine addicts, amygdala volume did not correlate with any measure of cocaine use.

50|$|Endocannabinoids affect {{long-lasting}} plasticity {{processes in}} various parts of the brain, serving both as regulators of pathways and necessary retrograde messengers in specific forms of LTD. In regard to retrograde signaling, cannabinoid receptors function widely throughout the brain in presynaptic inhibition. Endocannabinoid retrograde signaling has been shown to effect LTD at corticostriatal synapses and glutamatergic synapses in the prelimbic cortex of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and it is also involved in spike-timing-dependent LTD in the visual cortex. Endocannabinoids are implicated in LTD of inhibitory inputs (LTDi) within the <b>basolateral</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala (BLA) as well as in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus. Additionally, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating various forms of synaptic plasticity. They are involved in inhibition of LTD at parallel fiber Purkinje neuron synapses in the cerebellum and NMDA receptor-dependent LTD in the hippocampus.|$|E
50|$|The {{projections}} of the <b>basolateral</b> <b>nucleus</b> to the dorsal or ventral striatum have been suggested {{to play a role}} in avoidance learning. The amygdala has also been implicated in conditioned approach behaviors. Scientists demonstrated surprising limbic-motor interactions in patients with motor conversion disorder that may underlie the influence of affect or arousal on motor function. The amygdala projects to the nucleus accumbens core and dorsal striatum, which have projections via the pallidum and thalamus to the supplementary motor area. The supplementary motor area is a major source of input to the corticospinal tract and is reciprocally connected to the primary motor cortex and basal ganglia. The supplementary motor complex is implicated in self-initiated action. It is believed to be one source of a slowly increasing negative potential that precedes movement onset. The supplementary motor area has also been implicated in non-conscious motor inhibition. In a study on healthy individuals, masked stimuli that are briefly presented and not consciously observed can act as a prime to initially facilitate a response but the response is then inhibited. In the lesion patients, the responses were normally facilitated but not subsequently inhibited suggesting a potential role of the supplementary motor area in non-conscious motor response inhibition. Thus, they speculated that effect of arousal on amygdala activity may influence motor symptoms either through a general effect on initiation of the motor conversion symptom or possibly through a failure of inhibition of the motor conversion symptom.|$|E

The present {{study investigated the}} development of anxiety-like behavior and amygdala sensitization in incisional pain. Using hind-paw incision model in rats, we showed that surgical incision induced the anxiety-like behavior as determined by elevated plus-maze and open-field tests. Intraperitoneal (IP) morphine administration reversed mechanical allodynia and anxiety-like behavior in a dose-dependent manner. Gabapentin also partially reduced incision-evoked mechanical allodynia and anxiety-like behavior in a dose-dependent manner. After incision, the expression of phosphorylated cAMP response elements (CRE-) binding protein (p-CREB) was transiently upregulated in the central and <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei</b> in the bilateral amygdala. The upregulation of p-CREB was inhibited by morphine and gabapentin.

These tasks include basic classical conditioning tasks such as inhibitory avoidance, where a rat learns to associate a mild footshock with a particular compartment of an apparatus, and more complex tasks such as spatial or cued water maze, where a rat learns to swim to a platform to escape the water.

The influence of amygdala-orbitofrontal loop in reward behaviours and choice behaviours probably passes through its output connections to corticostriatal loop (input from <b>basolateral</b> <b>nuclei</b> of amygdala to nucleus accumbens). At the same time, amygdala modulates hypothalamus and brain stem arousal and controls such systems through pathways mainly running from the amygdala?s central nucleus to brain stem.
