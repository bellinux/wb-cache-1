Pierson said [...] "a story like {{this makes it}} a <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> to believe in Sheldon" [...] and suggested that Sheldon should [...] "take something from this experience". Pierson also disliked the girls' subplot as it did not [...] "go anywhere" [...] and described the guys as [...] "cowards".|$|E

[...] "Everything You Know Is Wrong" [...] is a stylistic {{pastiche}} of They Might Be Giants. Yankovic {{explained that he}} [...] "tried to write a song sort of in their style, but perhaps {{even a little bit}} more twisted". For fans of They Might Be Giants, he put [...] "little references in here and there, little allusions to other songs of theirs". Yankovic later admitted that it [...] "is a little <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> I think to decipher exactly where the inspiration is coming from." [...] The song title is taken from the 1974 Firesign Theatre album of the same name.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard it. If you can read lips, it's a little <b>bit</b> <b>harder,</b> and I apologize for that. That's a thing that you won't hear from me again.

500|$|At {{the time}} of the points deduction, Arsenal were placed second in the league, eight points behind leaders Liverpool and one in front of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. O'Leary {{expressed}} his disappointment at the docked points: [...] "The champagne will be out at Liverpool tonight because this makes our task very much harder." [...] His teammate Limpar was more optimistic: [...] "It seems very harsh. It makes it a little <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> to catch Liverpool, but it is not impossible." [...] Indeed, Arsenal went on to lose just one game all season and won the First Division title, seven points ahead of runners-up Liverpool. They became England's first representatives in the European Cup since the ban imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster was lifted. Manchester United finished sixth, but did not end the season empty-handed, winning the 1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup in the first season English clubs were allowed back into UEFA competitions.|$|E

500|$|The season {{confirms}} that the blue alien seen in the first season, and a recurring plot point this season, {{was a member of}} the Kree race, who play a significant role in Guardians of the Galaxy. Whedon explained that [...] "We obviously showed this body a year ago at around this time. When we were breaking that and sussing out what this arc would be, we had to have a lot of the pieces in place from the get go ... we had to talk to features about what their plans were and where they were going." [...] When asked whether this counts as the series tie-in to Guardians of the Galaxy, Whedon said [...] "It is a very far away other galaxy, so it's a little <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in is a little bit more challenging, but it's all one universe, so there's always opportunity for more. ... In Guardians, we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't explored yet, so it shows we're a part of that too." [...] This storyline also introduces the Inhumans to the MCU, ahead of their own film.|$|E
500|$|With three races {{remaining}} in the Championship and a fourteen-point advantage, Webber said he would continue his pursuit of the title; [...] "I need to keep racing hard and going for victories. Clearly, if my rivals have a rough weekend {{it makes it a}} <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> for them and it gives me a bit more scope, but I'm not looking to abuse that because it can all go pear-shaped very fast." [...] Vettel said his season had been fraught with car problems but he remained positive about his chances; [...] "I think it's normal to have ups and downs – and sometimes you have more, sometimes less – but, as I said, the expectation was probably {{to be in a position}} to fight for the championship and I think we're in a very strong and very good position." [...] Alonso urged his teammate Massa to help him in his title bid and said the Korean Grand Prix could become [...] "decisive" [...] for his championship rivals. He favoured Hamilton to win the Korean Grand Prix. With Hamilton twenty-eight points behind Webber and with Button a further three points behind his teammate, McLaren's team principal Martin Whitmarsh said his drivers would keep their focus in the season's remaining three races and produce consistent performances. Karun Chandhok, who raced for Hispania in the first ten races of the season, said Red Bull were the favourites to win, and that he thought the circuit's three long straights would suit the McLaren cars.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{still felt}} that Lightning Bolt was {{not up to}} the {{standards}} set by the band's previous work. Blue Sullivan of Slant Magazine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that the album had a [...] "familiar spark" [...] and was dragged down by [...] "Pearl Jam's antiseptic '70s-album-rock-radio conservatism, along with frontman Eddie Vedder's ham-fisted lyrics", ultimately concluding that [...] "Lightning Bolt is no masterwork. Years removed from the raw emotion and desperate appetites of youth, Pearl Jam has slipped into alt-rock elder statesmanship as one would a comfortable old sweater." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin gave the album a six out of ten, describing it as [...] "far from an implosion, far from spectacular", criticizing the focus on calm songs and considering that Backspacer [...] "barked louder and <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> overall." [...] In his 5.0 out of 10 review for Pitchfork, Stuart Berman also had a negative reaction to what he described as [...] "centerpiece ballads [...] tread on odious Lite-FM territory and forcefully tip the scales from poignant to maudlin". Philip Cosores of Paste gave the album a 4.0 out of 10, saying [...] "The album does grow on the listener, as Vedder's voice and the band's seeming ambivalence to all musical trends and developments outside of them is strangely comforting. And maybe some of these songs will come alive when performed, but {{there is not a single}} one to love in the set. Essentially, the cruise control is running onward with disregard for all the maintenance and repairs that an engine needs, and the result is the worst album of their career." ...|$|E

500|$|Another story arc saw Charlie {{reveal that}} her sister Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) {{is in fact}} her daughter. Charlie gave birth to Ruby after she was raped by Grant Bledcoe (Clayton Watson), when she was younger. Both Anderson and Breeds found the storyline {{challenging}} and felt {{they had to get}} it right. Breeds said it made her nervous but was pleased with the end result. She said she had to let it affect her own emotions to effect the viewing public. [...] "The revelation ruins their relationship, and Anderson said that Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap". Breeds added [...] "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?" [...] Breeds said it was a [...] "big exploration" [...] and a journey for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined: [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She added that everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said, [...] "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it {{is a bit of a}} journey." [...] Comparing the storyline to the lesbian plot she said, [...] "Perhaps this storyline was a little <b>bit</b> <b>harder,</b> you've seen the start of this storyline and there is a lot more to come and it wasn't easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Espinoza {{positioned}} {{the colt}} {{in third place}} early in the race as Dortmund took the lead, followed closely by Firing Line. The three remained ahead of the pack throughout the race, and broke clear of their rivals entering the straightaway with American Pharoah making a forward move on the outside. The favorite took the lead entering the final furlong and won by a length from Firing Line and Dortmund in 2:03.02, with Frosted finishing strongly in fourth. Espinoza, who won {{the race for the}} third time, said, [...] "I feel like the luckiest Mexican on earth. He has been a special horse since the first time I rode him. He has a lot of talent and is an unbelievable horse. Turning for home I started riding a little <b>bit</b> <b>harder.</b> At the eighth pole I just couldn't put that other horse away, but he got it done." [...] Espinoza's performance attracted some scrutiny as he appeared to have struck the winner 32 times with his whip during the race. In post-race analysis, one of the stewards at Churchill Downs said, [...] "we watched [...] many, many times prior to making it official, and that wasn't anything that got our attention." [...] Baffert said, [...] "He was hitting him on the saddle towel. He doesn't hit that hard." [...] Gary Stevens, rider of second-place Firing Line, commented that he had used his whip heavily as well, stating that the race was [...] "as tough a race as I've been in in 20 years the last eighth of a mile." [...] The Blood-Horse writer Steve Haskin, while condemning whip overuse in general, offered analysis that Espinoza [...] "did a lot of waving with the whip" [...] and may not have actually hit the horse as many times as it seemed. Reflecting on the race, Baffert said that the colt did not bring his [...] "super A-game" [...] to the Derby and that {{it was the first time}} American Pharoah had really been tested by other aggressive horses.|$|E
500|$|Jon Hornbuckle of So So Gay {{described}} [...] "DNA" [...] as [...] "an addictive {{slice of}} dark pop, with the chorus breakdown remaining {{not only a}} highlight on this track, but of the entire album." [...] The song was well received by Vicky Newman from Shields Gazette, who felt that it demonstrates the group's [...] "stunning" [...] harmonies and allows their voices to [...] "shine". Newman also wrote that the song's urban edge manifests Little Mix's growth and development. Gigwise's Andrew Trendell praised the track's production, writing, [...] "The skittering beats and little quirks of [...] 'DNA' make it instantly memorable." [...] Adrian Thrills of the Daily Mail complimented the song's choral middle-eight, deeming it [...] "an inventive sonic flourish". [...] "DNA" [...] was described as [...] "pop perfection" [...] by Lewis Corner of Digital Spy, who highlighted the song's [...] "spooky synths, pumping heartbeats and gothic choir finale". John Earls from British newspaper, Daily Star, positively reviewed the single, calling it [...] "a winning formula," [...] in addition to awarding it a {{nine out of ten}} rating. Earls went on to mention that the song is [...] "A regal anthem that'll have all of Girls Aloud wondering how they didn't release it first, the Little Mixers are sounding huge at last.". [...] "DNA" [...] was deemed [...] "amazing" [...] by Clemmie Moodie of the Daily Mirror. Eve Barlow for NME likened the song to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] and described it as [...] "a banger". According to Hackford Jones of music website, Pressparty, [...] "DNA" [...] is [...] "a storming slice of future-pop" [...] and [...] "a vibrant and commanding modern-day pop anthem that has the Little Mix personality stamped all the way through it." [...] Amy Gravelle of Entertainment Wise felt that the song represents the group's [...] "feisty charm". Gravelle also described the track as [...] "an infectiously catchy pop belter that proves the girls {{have what it takes to}} keep up with the best of their rivals." [...] Ciara Moore from The College View said that [...] "DNA" [...] won Little Mix a legion of teenage fans. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman called the song [...] "bludgeoning, booming techno pop". 4Music's Trent Maynard said that [...] "DNA" [...] is a [...] "much darker turn for the cheery foursome, but just as catchy and polished as their previous single." [...] The song was described as [...] "an absolute gem" [...] by Lizzie Cox of Sugar. Rick Fulton of the Daily Record positively reviewed the song, awarding it three out of five stars. Fulton deemed the song as [...] "feisty electro fun" [...] and [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> than 'Wings'". He also added, [...] "it seems Little Mix have big aspirations to be around for a lot longer than most of 's winners." [...] Nicky Diaz of The Miami Hurricane said that [...] "DNA" [...] shows the group's edgier side. Diaz went on to praise the track's harmonies and lyrics, writing, [...] "The stand-out harmonies on this song are incredible and the lyrics are catchy". Matt Collar of AllMusic called the track [...] "a truly catchy, infectious cut".|$|E

2500|$|The album {{features}} a notably heavier sound than their previous album, {{with a more}} [...] "aggressive, destructive, and power" [...] sound.

[...] Recording this solo was the most challenging aspect of the session; a take that surfaced on a bootleg in the 1980s reveals Harrison fumbling over his strings, losing his timing and missing notes. But {{by the time the}} session ended at 10 p.m. that night, he had sculpted one of his most memorable solos – an upward run played twice and capped with a circular flourish - in illustration of an observation made by engineer Geoff Emerick: [...] "George would {{spend a lot of time}} working out solos. Everything was a little <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> for him, nothing quite came easily." ...|$|E
2500|$|At an {{intermediate}} level, in South America {{and in the}} former plantations {{in and around the}} Indian Ocean, descendants of enslaved people are a <b>bit</b> <b>harder</b> to define because many people are mixed in demographic proportion to the original slave population. In places that imported relatively few slaves (like Chile), few if any are considered [...] "black" [...] today. In places that imported many enslaved people (like Brazil or Dominican Republic), the number is larger, though most identify themselves as being of mixed, rather than strictly African, ancestry. Behind America, Brazil has the largest population of Black diasporic people outside of Africa. However, in places like Brazil and the Dominican Republic, Blackness is performed in more taboo ways than it is in, say, the United States. The idea behind Trey Ellis Cultural Mulatto comes into play as there are blurred lines between what is considered as Black.|$|E
