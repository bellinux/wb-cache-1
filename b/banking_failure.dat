2500|$|With {{a lack of}} {{consumer}} confidence in the economic direction given {{by the federal government}} panic started to spread across the country shortly after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. President Hoover retained the Gold Standard as the country’s currency gauge throughout the following years. As a result, the American shareholders with the majority of the gold reserves began to grow wary of the value of gold in the near future. Europe’s decision {{to move away from the}} Gold Standard caused individuals to start to withdraw gold shares and move the investments out of the country or began to horde gold for future investment. The market continued to suffer due to these reactions, and in result caused several of the everyday individuals to speculate on the economy in the coming months. [...] Rumors of market stability and banking conditions began to spread, consumer confidence continued to drop and panic begin to set in. Contagion spread like wild fire pushing Americans all over the country to withdraw their deposits in mass. This idea would continue from 1929-1933 causing the greatest financial crisis ever seen at the banking level pushing the economic recovery efforts further from resolution. An increase in the currency-deposit ratio and a money stock determinant forced money stock to fall and income to decline. This panic-induced <b>banking</b> <b>failure</b> took a mild recession to a major recession.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Bank erosion {{consists}} of two processes: basal erosion due to fluvial hydraulic force and <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> {{under the influence of}} gravity. Because bank resistance force varies with the degree of saturation of bank material, the probability of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> is the probability of the driving force of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> being greater than the bank resistance force. The degree of saturation of bank material increases with river stage; therefore, the frequency of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> is correlated to the frequency of flooding. Consequently, the rate of bank erosion is due to both basal erosion and <b>bank</b> <b>failure,</b> and <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> is a probabilistic phenomenon. In this paper, for cohesive bank material experiencing planar <b>bank</b> <b>failure,</b> a deterministic approach was adopted for basal erosion analysis, whereas the probability of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> was included in the analysis of <b>bank</b> <b>failure.</b> A method for calculating the rate of bank erosion was derived that integrates both basal erosion and <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> processes, and accounts for the effects of hydraulic force, bank geometry, bank material properties, and probability of <b>bank</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R

Given {{the significance of}} bank solvency and <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> for the health and stability of the U.

The GARCH estimates indicate that FDICIA acted to reduce <b>bank</b> <b>failures,</b> whereas (presumably by increasing competition and/or increasing costs through branch bank expansion) RNIBA induced a net increase in <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> in the U.

It examines how contagion and information effects of major <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> have changed over time. FDIC policy for settling failures has important implications for system stability, and has changed over time. This study's purpose is to provide empirical evidence on the effects of FDIC policy. The FDIC's handling of the Penn Square failure signaled a policy shift and offers a unique opportunity to examine changes in market reactions to large <b>bank</b> <b>failures.</b> The literature on the capital market effects of major <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> provides limited evidence on the impact of <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> and related FDIC policy. Most fail to discriminate between contagion and information effects, and conduct analysis on one (or a few) <b>bank</b> <b>failure(s)</b> in the mid- 1970 s using traditional event study methodology. This study considers multivariate regression (MVRM) an appropriate methodology for <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> which are likely to have simultaneous impact on non-failed banks. MVRM, which accounts for contemporaneous cross-sectional dependence of residuals, has three advantages over standard residual analysis: no "event clustering" problem, multiple hypotheses tests, and computational efficiency.

For each <b>bank</b> <b>failure,</b> the non-failed banksare grouped into three portfolios: "information-related," "large," and "small.

40|$|The {{financial}} {{health of the}} banking industry is an important prerequisite for economic stability and growth. <b>Bank</b> <b>failures</b> in the United States have run in cycles largely associated {{with the collapse of}} economic bubbles. The number of <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> has increased dramatically over the last thirty years (Halling and Hayden, 2007). In this thesis, we try to address the following two questions: 1) What is the relationship, if any, between a bank 2 ̆ 7 s asset size and its likelihood of failures? 2) How can we use statistical tools to predict the numbers of <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> in the future? Various modeling techniques are proposed and applied to <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> data from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. For the first question, we find that there is a relationship between bank size and <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> status based on the Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s chi-square test. To answer the second question, first, logistic regression is applied to the <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> data, and the corresponding prediction rule and prediction results are obtained. Second, we develop the empirical recurrence rate (Ho, 2008) and empirical recurrence rates ratio time series for the given data, and also perform corresponding theoretical and graphical analysis on both of them.
