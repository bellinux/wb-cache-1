2500|$|Border tartan, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Northumbrian tartan, Shepherds' Plaid or Border Drab, or <b>Border</b> <b>check</b> is a design used in woven fabrics historically {{associated with the}} Anglo-Scottish Border, including the Scottish Borders and Northumbria. [...] Possibly the most identifiable Border tartan garment of the region is the maud (plaid), made popular from the 1820s by fashionable Border Scots such as Walter Scott, James Hogg, Henry Scott Riddell and Robbie Burns.|$|E
2500|$|At around 3.40 p.m., {{they crossed}} the Northern Ireland border at <b>Border</b> <b>Check</b> Point 10 on the Edenappa Road. It was a dark, {{overcast}} wintry day. Yards up ahead, {{at the top of}} a hill on a tree-lined section of the road just south of Jonesborough, armed members of the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade waited to carry out the ambush. The site the IRA chose was in [...] "dead ground", meaning that they could not be seen by the nearby British Army observation post. The secluded back road was considered to be one of the most dangerous in south Armagh and as such, a [...] "no-go area" [...] for the security forces as it was regularly patrolled by the local IRA. According to the Cory Collusion Inquiry Report, as Buchanan reached the hilltop he was flagged down by an armed IRA man standing in the middle of the road wearing Army battle fatigues and camouflage paint on his face. Another armed man, dressed likewise, stood in a ditch by the roadside by four cars he ordered to stop and their drivers to position so only one car could pass the road at a time and slowly at that. Buchanan, because of the location and dress of the two armed men would have had difficulty in ascertaining if it was an ambush or a British Army checkpoint, slowed down and stopped. At that moment, a stolen cream-coloured Litace van, which had been following behind his car, overtook and pulled into the laneway of an empty house opposite. Four more armed IRA men wearing battle fatigues and balaclavas leapt out of the van. They approached the Cavalier and immediately began shooting, mainly at the driver's side, hitting the two officers. Buchanan made two frantic attempts to reverse and escape but his car stalled on each attempt and he was likely already dead before his car came to a rest. Examination of the car the following day found it still to be in reverse gear with Buchanan's foot fully pressed against the accelerator. Breen, despite his gunshot wounds, managed to stumble out of the car, waving a white handkerchief at the gunmen in an apparent gesture of surrender. According to eyewitnesses, one of the gunmen walked over to him, told him to lie on the ground and fired a shot into the back of his head, killing him instantly. Another gunman then approached Buchanan's already dead body in the car and shot him again in the side of the head at point-blank range.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{presentation}} {{will discuss}} the requirements for veterinary <b>border</b> <b>checks</b> and procedures as a key pillar for preventing the introduction of any risks to human and animal health into a country originating from imports or transits of live animals and products thereof. To a certain extent also rules on animal welfare during transport of live animals have been taken into account considering the possibility of bottlenecks at the veterinary border inspection posts. Specific criteria and conditions for efficient and effective veterinary <b>border</b> <b>checks</b> are already laid down in specific chapters of the OIE Codes. Veterinary <b>border</b> <b>checks</b> need an all-inclusive legal framework and require a competent and credible Veterinary Service both at central and border post level. In addition, an adequate infrastructure for carrying out the veterinary <b>border</b> <b>checks</b> is required, which {{should be based on}} a long-term strategy and be properly resourced. Furthermore, harmonised procedures for performing the veterinary <b>border</b> <b>checks</b> should be in place, be transparent and based on scientific evidence.

50|$|A customs {{territory}} usually has inspection stations at its borders, {{but this is}} not always the case. For example, there are no <b>border</b> <b>checks</b> between the EU {{customs territory}} and the Switzerland—Liechtenstein customs territory, since both are part of the Schengen Area. There can also be <b>border</b> <b>checks</b> between two parts of the same customs territory. For example, there are <b>border</b> <b>checks</b> between the Schengen Area portions of the EU customs territory and those portions in the Common Travel Area formed by the United Kingdom, Crown Dependencies, and Ireland. Another example is the <b>border</b> <b>checks</b> between Israel and the Palestinian Territories, which are in a customs union. The European Union example is particularly complicated, since it also has different boundaries for EU VAT area, the EU excise duty area, the area where EU law applies, and the area considered by the EU statistics agency.|$|R
