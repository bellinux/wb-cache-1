40|$|Trypanosoma cruzi {{infection}} <b>by</b> <b>oral</b> <b>route</b> {{constitutes the}} most important mode of transmission in some geographical regions, as illustrated by reports on microepidemics and outbreaks of acute Chagas' disease acquired by ingestion of food contaminated with parasites from triatomine insects. in the mouse model, T cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes invade the gastric mucosal epithelium, a unique portal of entry for systemic infection. High efficiency of metacyclic forms in establishing infection <b>by</b> <b>oral</b> <b>route</b> is associated with expression of gp 82, a stage-specific surface molecule that binds to gastric mucin and to epithelial cells. Gp 82 promotes parasite entry by triggering the signaling cascades leading to intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization. T cruzi strains deficient in gp 82 can effectively invade cells in vitro, by engaging the Ca 2 + signal-inducing surface glycoprotein gp 30. However, they are poorly infective in mice <b>by</b> <b>oral</b> <b>route</b> because gp 30 has low affinity for gastric mucin. Metacyclic forms also express gp 90, a stage-specific surface glycoprotein that binds to host cells and acts as a negative regulator of invasion. T cruzi strains expressing gp 90 at high levels, in addition to gp 82 and gp 30, are all poor cell invaders in vitro. Notwithstanding, their infectivity <b>by</b> <b>oral</b> <b>route</b> may vary because, unlike gp 82 and gp 30, which resist degradation by pepsin in the gastric milieu, the gp 90 isoforms of different strains have varying susceptibility to peptic digestion. for instance, in a T cruzi isolate, derived from an acute case of Chagas' disease acquired <b>by</b> <b>oral</b> <b>route,</b> gp 90 is extensively degraded by gastric juice in the mouse stomach and this renders the parasite highly invasive towards target cells. If such an exacerbation of infectivity occurs in humans, it {{may be responsible for}} the severity of the disease reported in outbreaks of oral infection. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Subcutaneous administration of N-methylglucamine antimonate at 28 mg of pentavalent antimony kg per day for 15 days reduced the parasite burden by 95 % (P < 0. 001) and five intralesional injections at the same concentration reduced the parasite burden by 96 % (P < 0. 001). Other 2 -substituted quinolines, 2 -n-propylquinoline administered <b>by</b> the <b>oral</b> and intralesional <b>routes,</b> 2 -phenylquinoline administered <b>by</b> the <b>oral</b> <b>route,</b> 2 -n-pentylquinoline administered by intralesional injection, and two total alkaloidal extracts of #G. longiflora$ administered <b>by</b> the <b>oral</b> <b>route,</b> had intermediate effects. These findings suggest that chimanine B may be chosen as a lead molecule in the development of oral therapy against leishmaniasis. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Neosporosis is a {{parasitic}} disease {{caused by the}} protozoan Neospora caninum which results in major economic losses for cattle breeding due to abortion and other reproductive disorders. Gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) are commonly used as experimental models for neosporosis due to their high susceptibility to N. caninum infection, both by oocysts ingestion as by tachyzoites/bradyzoites parenteral inoculation. However, the risk of transmission by tachyzoites ingestion is not fully elucidated. In this study, infection of neonate gerbils by N. caninum (NC- 1 strain) tachyzoites inoculated <b>by</b> the <b>oral</b> <b>route</b> and the parasite distribution in gerbils' tissues were evaluated by protozoan DNA detection. Seventeen neonate gerbils, aged 4 - 5 days, were inoculated with 4 x 105 tachyzoites <b>by</b> the <b>oral</b> <b>route</b> and one gerbil was kept as uninfected control. N. caninum DNA was detected in 100 % of the inoculated gerbils, showing that the <b>oral</b> <b>route</b> is effective as a potential route of infection of neonates by N. caninum tachyzoites. N. caninum DNA was reported in all organs evaluated (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen and brain), with different frequencies. These results showed systemically distributed infection of neonate gerbils after oral inoculation of tachyzoites...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the author}} {{describes}} in detail experimental cholera infection of mammals (infection <b>by</b> the <b>oral</b> <b>route,</b> intragastric inoculation, and intestinal, gall-bladder, and parenteral infection). The pathogenicity for lower animals is examined, and certain observations on insects are included. The {{second part of}} the study is devoted to the pathology of human cholera (morbid anatomy distribution of the causative organisms in the dead bodies of cholera victims, and pathogenesis) ...|$|R
