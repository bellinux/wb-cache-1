5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He {{told the court}} that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he had}} warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had <b>been</b> <b>asleep</b> during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E
5|$|The woman wakes, sits up, {{looks at}} Sigurd, {{and the two}} {{converse}} in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break, and due to that spell she has <b>been</b> <b>asleep</b> a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a horn of mead to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen prayer in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named Sigrdrífa and {{that she is a}} valkyrie.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have <b>been</b> <b>asleep</b> or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.|$|E

5|$|When he {{came upon}} the Meng River, he {{found it to be}} guarded, but crossed anyway and was not stopped; he later stated that he {{believed}} the guards had <b>been</b> <b>asleep.</b> Though he recollected his immediate surroundings from his childhood explorations, he eventually passed into less familiar territory; he later told his supporters that he fell more than 200 times during his escape. Communicating with a network of activists via a cell phone, he reached a pre-determined rendezvous point where He Peirong, an English teacher and activist, was waiting for him. A chain of human rights activists then escorted him to Beijing. Several of the activists reported to be involved were detained or disappeared in the days following the announcement of Chen's escape.|$|E

25|$|After some skirmishes at Grafton, one of {{the first}} land battles of the Civil War, the Battle of Philippi, took place in Philippi, Barbour County, in what is now West Virginia. The battle began when a Federal battery started lobbing shells into a camp of around 825 {{surprised}} Confederate recruits who had <b>been</b> <b>asleep.</b> In response, the Confederates ran, thus earning the battle the name “Philippi Races.” After the battle, the 9th camped on the same hill where the battery was located.|$|E
25|$|Reptiles have {{quiescent}} periods {{similar to}} mammalian sleep, and {{a decrease in}} electrical activity in the brain has been registered when the animals have <b>been</b> <b>asleep.</b> However, the EEG pattern in reptilian sleep differs from what is seen in mammals and other animals. In reptiles, sleep time increases following sleep deprivation, and stronger stimuli are needed to awaken the animals when they have been deprived of sleep as compared to when they have slept normally. This suggests that the sleep which follows deprivation is compensatorily deeper.|$|E
25|$|Several known {{deaths have}} been {{associated}} with Project MKUltra, most notably that of Frank Olson. Olson, a United States Army biochemist and biological weapons researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November, 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and committed suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have <b>been</b> <b>asleep</b> in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.|$|E

500|$|The press {{coverage}} of the trial included the publication on day two, by The Sun, of a notorious close-up of a half-smiling Silcott, one that [...] "created a monster to stalk the nightmares of Middle England," [...] as journalist Kurt Barling put it. Silcott said he had <b>been</b> <b>asleep</b> in a police cell when it was taken; {{he said he was}} woken up, held in a corridor with his arms pinned against a wall and photographed, and that {{the expression on his face}} was one of fear. Its publication constituted [...] "the most gross contempt," [...] according to the trial judge, Sir Derek Hodgson (1917–2002), speaking to David Rose in 1992. No action was taken against the newspaper.|$|E

Mahrad had also {{admitted to}} being present at the murder scene, and claimed that the blood stains found on his trousers occurred {{as a result of his}} accidentally falling across Parker. Ali, defended by Mohammed Latif, denied being at the scene and claimed to have <b>been</b> <b>asleep</b> at the time of the murder, although a recording from a police van indicated this was a [...] "story" [...] that he had encouraged the others to [...] "stick to".

[...] Olsen turned on the oil, but then something went wrong, and the fire burst out of control.

2500|$|Irwin {{pointed out}} that OBEs appear to occur under {{conditions}} of either very high or very low arousal. For example, Green found that {{three quarters of a}} group of 176 subjects reporting a single OBE were lying down {{at the time of the}} experience, and of these 12% considered they had <b>been</b> <b>asleep</b> when it started. By contrast, a substantial minority of her cases occurred under conditions of maximum arousal, such as a rock-climbing fall, a traffic accident, or childbirth. McCreery has suggested that this paradox may be explained by reference to the fact that sleep can supervene as a reaction to extreme stress or hyper-arousal. He proposes that OBEs under both conditions, relaxation and hyper-arousal, represent a form of [...] "waking dream", or the intrusion of Stage 1 sleep processes into waking consciousness.|$|E

He was appalled by what he saw, recalling “ …what a sight presented itself to our eyes. Corpses lying all around, and all women and children, but two. Most of them had their skulls split. One old Indian, who {{looked to be a}} hundred years old, had his skull split, and still he sat there shivering”.

2500|$|Igor Kurdin, {{a former}} [...] {{commander}} {{and the current}} head of the St. Petersburg Submariners Club, attributed the high casualty count {{to the presence of}} a large number of civilian specialists on the submarine at the time of the accident. 17 of 20 people who perished in the accident were civilians. He noted that civilian observers would be untrained in the proper response to the release of the boat's firefighting gas, which would be preceded by a specific light and sound signal, after which all on board are supposed to put on oxygen masks to allow them to survive during the 30-minute period required to ventilate the compartments before they can be reopened. In addition, because the accident occurred at 8:30 PM many of the civilian specialists and crewmen would likely have <b>been</b> <b>asleep,</b> and unable to don their oxygen masks in time. The accident was the country's worst since 2000, when a torpedo exploded and sank another Russian nuclear submarine, [...] Kursk, killing 118 people.|$|E

[...] Vik Bansal of musicOMH compared Evanescence's own song [...] "Going Under" [...] with [...] "Bring Me to Life", noting their similarity to Linkin Park's material. Lee said, during an interview with MTV News: [...] "Basically, we go through life every day, kind of doing the same thing, going through the motions, and nothing fazes us for the most part. Then one day something happens that wakes [...] up and makes [...] realize that there's {{more to life than}} just feeling nothing, feeling numb.

2500|$|At 4 a.m. a brief signal {{bombardment}} of the ravelin {{was made and}} a contingent of French Grenadiers gained the fosse, penetrated the breaches [...] and then opened a sallyport which allowed {{the rest of the}} troops inside where they formed up in the gorge of the ravelin and then gained the ramparts without opposition. The French then seized the gates and entered the city sword in hand. The garrison commander, Cronström, and his officers had reportedly still <b>been</b> <b>asleep</b> in their beds when most of the officers were captured by the French. The brigade of Loudon's Highlanders put up a tenacious defense against the French through the streets of the city, making a stand in the market place losing two-thirds their number but enabling Governor Cronström to escape. The Dutch and their allies suffered some 3,000 casualties during the storm and the sack while French losses were only 479. Some 200 fortress guns were captured and 17 fully loaded supply ships in the port were taken. After the fall of the town, the garrisons of the forts of Rovers, Pinsen and Moermant in the lines outside the city surrendered.|$|E
