So I am for Willkie <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will help my people, and I figure my people should be for him, too.|$|E
500|$|McCoy is {{a member}} of the Church of Christ and {{attended}} Westover Hills Church of Christ in Austin, Texas. When living in Buffalo Gap, he attended and was very involved with the Oldham Lane Church of Christ. McCoy has participated in a church youth group since 2002. His work has included landscaping yards for the elderly, visiting nursing homes, helping with meals on wheels, and ministry. Fellow quarterback Tim Tebow said of McCoy, [...] "I was really proud of him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> represents college football and his faith extremely well, too, which I really respect as well. I think he's done a good job with everything he's going through." [...] McCoy was selected to welcome President George W. Bush home to Texas after his second term ended on January 20, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{character}} by the Washington Post, Violette said that [...] "He's {{a guy who has}} a lot of dreams and hopes. But he's not able to make them concrete <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a little bit lazy. He's {{the kind of guy who}} always has bad luck [...] [...] [...] but I'm sure he has a good heart." ...|$|R
2500|$|The filmmaker defended {{himself in}} an {{interview}} with ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper, answering: [...] "Actually I do [...] article and it's blown up 40 foot on the screen, you can see Richard Clarke's name right there saying that he approved the flights based on the information the FBI gave him. It's right there, right up on the screen. I don't agree with Clarke on this point. Just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> good {{on a lot of things}} doesn't mean I agree with him on everything." ...|$|R
2500|$|In The Arrangement (1969), a drama {{directed}} by Elia Kazan, based upon his {{novel of the}} same title, Douglas starred as a tormented advertising executive, with Faye Dunaway as costar. The film did poorly at the box office, receiving mostly negative reviews, while Dunaway felt many of the reviews were unfair, writing in her biography, [...] "I can't understand it when people knock Kirk's performance, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> terrific in the picture," [...] adding that [...] "he's as bright a person as I've met in the acting profession." [...] She says that his [...] "pragmatic approach to acting" [...] would later be a [...] "philosophy that ended up rubbing off on me." ...|$|R
500|$|Spotnitz's {{favorite}} magician was Ricky Jay, and so, for the episode, Jay {{was brought}} in to play the part of The Amazing Maleeni. Initially, however, the episode hit a snag. The production crew discovered that Jay's production agency had not been informed and that he would be unable to guest star in the episode. The staff's back-up magician, David Blaine, was unavailable for shooting as well. Series creator Chris Carter, however, later stated that the show would not take no for an answer: [...] "We got on the phone with him. He agreed to come to our offices to talk about the script and ended up doing some card tricks for us that reduced Frank and I to being six-year-olds again." [...] Jay eventually agreed to do the part, but requested that he only do the tricks he was accustomed to doing. Thus, many of Jay's trademark tricks were included in the episode's script. Gilligan, in retrospect, later noted, [...] "There was no choice other than Ricky Jay as far as we were concerned. He was not looking forward to the idea of playing a magician <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> felt that magicians were never portrayed very realistically in movies or television shows." ...|$|E
500|$|Rivera is well {{respected}} throughout baseball for his professionalism. Fellow closer Joe Nathan said, [...] "I {{look up to}} how he's handled himself {{on and off the}} field... You never see him show up anyone and he respects the game. I've always looked up to him and it's always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him." [...] Michael Young said of Rivera, [...] "I respect Mo more than anybody in the game. The guy goes out there, gets three outs and shakes [...] Posada's hand. You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does, respects the people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves." [...] In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, [...] "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." [...] Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, [...] " [...] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> brought something special to it." [...] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: [...] "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{has also}} {{maintained}} that Harry is a suitable real-life {{role model for}} children. [...] "The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine {{is that you can}} know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom you would never meet [...] if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is very likeable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wyllard has his faults, but there's {{this in his}} favor--he keeps a promise," [...] he said. [...] "One has {{a certain}} respect for a person who never goes back upon his word. Well, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would like it, I'll keep those men." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Gone" [...] {{is about}} leaving {{everything}} behind and moving along. The song brings into perspective perceptions {{that all is}} not lost if one chooses to incorporate change. When the song was performed on VH1 Storytellers in 2006, Vedder introduced it as [...] "a car song." [...] In an interview Vedder stated: The idea was that this guy was leaving Atlantic City and needing {{to find a new}} life without his past, without his possessions, and not really looking for more possessions. Because it takes place in a car, it's probably very similar to [...] "Rearviewmirror" [...] in a way. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this car is a hybrid, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> only got one tank of gas, so I want him to go far.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Tony begins dating Jeanne Benoit (Scottie Thompson) and {{is shown}} {{to be on the}} verge of a serious {{commitment}} for the first time within the series. His romance with Jeanne continues to progress throughout the year, and he remains tight-lipped about it when his colleagues notice the change in his behavior. When questioned about the effects this would have on Tony and Ziva's relationship, de Pablo commented, [...] "Am I just being jealous? I don't know. I still love him very much, but I've sort of thrown away that possibility <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> really struggling with some immense feelings for somebody else." [...] In an interview with Chicago Tribune, she clarified that Ziva [...] "does have feelings for DiNozzo," [...] but that she was uncertain that this would be addressed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not if {{you don't}} say it. I {{want you to}} realize that the chances are {{altogether}} against it. He was civil, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> rather liked me personally--" ...|$|E

"I {{should say}} wait here, Harry; {{in the first}} place, {{because it is the}} least trouble, and in the second, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is as likely to come this way as any other.

6000|$|For {{some moments}} Lord Lambeth was not {{mentioned}} again, {{and it was}} Mrs. Westgate who, {{at the end of}} this period, reverted to him. [...] "Of course I will let him know we are here, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would be hurt--justly enough--if we should go away without seeing him. It is fair to give him a chance to come and thank me for the kindness we showed him. But I don't want to seem eager." ...|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{deliberate}} manipulation by the forum's moderators and active users, the algorithm that dictated what content reached the [...] "/r/all" [...] page of Reddit {{resulted in a}} significant portion of the page being /r/The_Donald content. In response, Reddit administrators made changes to its algorithms on June 15, 2016, in an attempt to preserve the variety of /r/all. In April 2016, /u/jcm267, the founder of the subreddit, attributed the popularity of the subreddit to moderator /u/CisWhiteMaelstrom. /u/jcm267 told MSNBC that /u/CisWhiteMaelstrom told him [...] "we'd have hundreds of thousands of readers there and I was very skeptical about that, not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought Trump can't win, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> the only GOPer with 'landslide victory' potential, but because Reddit is not a conservative place." [...] Subsequently, /u/CisWhiteMaelstrom deleted his Reddit account. On November 2016, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman reported that the subreddit's moderator team had changed [...] "at least four times" [...] due to the community revolting.|$|R
50|$|The Umbrella Woman grossed $100,189 at the {{box office}} in Australia. The film was not widely seen {{overseas}} either. Cameron says the movie hurt his career:I think the reason that it didn't work was that there was something very difficult to understand about the relationship between Bryan and Rachel. They were at the height of their public relationship, very well known as a happy couple. It was terribly hard to cast them as a couple who had some unstated problem in their marriage because everything in fact denied that. So it was hard to understand why she would run after the barman when Bryan was there, because Bryan is quite iconic and quite wonderful as an Australian country man... Without wishing Sam Neill away, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> terrific - it might have worked better had Bryan been the barman... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that this was an example of how you can cast a film with great excitement, get all these wonderful actors but, at the same time, in the very act of casting, you're blighting it or preventing the drama from emerging successfully.|$|R
5000|$|Of Nasser, Ravelo says, [...] "He's a good trainer. He {{teaches the}} right things. He {{tells you what}} to do. He motivates his fighters.

60|$|Now {{when they}} heard this many {{remained}} silent, {{but some of the}} peace party began to clamour that I should be ordered to shoot at the apparition. At length Cetewayo seemed to give way to this pressure. I say seemed, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> wished to give way. Whether or not a spirit stood before him, he knew no more than the rest, but he did know that unless the vision were proved to be mortal he would be driven into war with the English. Therefore he took the only chance that remained to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Crocker! I love Crocker, in comparison. There is a {{delightful}} pachydermatousness about Crocker {{which is almost}} heroic. But I hate Mr. Greenwood, if it be in my nature to hate any one. It is not only that he insults me, but {{he looks at me}} as though he would take me by the throat and strangle me if he could. But still I will add the other hundred a year out of my own pocket, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is being treated hardly. Only I must do it on the sly." ...|$|E
6000|$|He did not rant. He {{seemed to}} have rather a {{remarkable}} knowledge of the law. In a conversational tone he described the sufferings {{of the man in}} the flannel shirt beside him, but there could be no question {{of the fact that he}} did produce an effect. The spectators were plainly moved, and it was undeniable that some of the judges wore rather a sheepish look as they toyed with their watch chains or moved the stationery in front of them. They had seen maimed men before, they had heard impassioned, sentimental lawyers talk about wives and families and God and justice. Krebs did none of this. Just how he managed to bring the thing home to those judges, to make them ashamed of their role, just how he managed--in spite of my fortified attitude to revive something of that sense of discomfort I had experienced at the State House is difficult to say. It was <b>because,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> contrived through the intensity of his own sympathy to enter into the body of the man whose cause he pleaded, to feel the despair in Galligan's soul--an impression that was curiously conveyed despite the dignified limits to which he confined his speech. It was strange that I began to be rather sorry for him, that I felt a certain reluctant regret that he should thus squander his powers against overwhelming odds. What was the use of it all! ...|$|E
5000|$|In June 2009, New Yorker {{journalist}} Elizabeth Kolbert {{wrote that}} Hansen is [...] "increasingly isolated among climate activists." [...] Eileen Claussen, {{president of the}} Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said that [...] "I view Jim Hansen as heroic as a scientist.... But I wish he would stick to what he really knows. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has a realistic idea of what is politically possible, or what the best policies would be {{to deal with this}} problem." ...|$|R

6000|$|Worldly {{people say}} [...] "Thank God" [...] {{when they get}} what they want; as if it amused God to plague them, and was a vast piece of self-denial on His part to {{give them what they}} liked.

They wander from their own hunting-grounds into those of other people. It is not so with Injins. The Pottawattamie does not kill the deer of the Iowa, nor the Ottawa the deer of the Menomenees. Each tribe knows its own game. This is because they are not lost. My pale-face father appears to wish us well. He has come on a long and weary path to tell us about his Manitou. For this I thank him. I thank all who wish to do me good. Them that wish to do me harm I strike from behind. It is our Injin custom. I do not wish to hurt the medicine- priest, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> wishes to do me good, and not to do me harm. He has a strange law. It is to do good to them that do harm to you. It is not the law of the red men. It is not good law. I do not wonder that the tribes which follow such a law get lost. They cannot tell their friends from their enemies. They can have no people to scalp. What is a warrior if he cannot find someone to scalp? No; such a law would make women of the bravest braves in the Openings, or on the prairie. It may be a good law for Jews, who get lost; but it is a bad law for Injins, who know the paths they travel. Let another speak." ...|$|E

5000|$|Early in the 2010-11 season, Birmingham manager Alex McLeish {{attempted}} {{to find a}} Football League club for O'Shea to join on loan {{so that he could}} play regular football. In October, he had a trial with Scunthorpe United, during which he played for the club's reserve team in a game against Lincoln City reserves which ended 1-1. Scunthorpe manager Ian Baraclough said he [...] "wanted to take a further look at O'Shea" [...] ahead of a reserve game against Leeds United, but he did not feature in the match. Towards the end of October, McLeish expressed surprise and concern that no club had taken the player on loan: [...] "I'm surprised nobody has come for him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a decent young player and {{it would be great to}} get him that league experience. Playing in reserve games every now and then is probably not the right thing for a young player with potential." [...] On 26 October, O'Shea joined League Two club Stevenage on a one-month loan deal. He was assigned the number 22 shirt. Having scored in a reserve match against Ipswich Town the day after signing, O'Shea started in Stevenage's 0-0 home draw with Chesterfield on 30 October. After six appearances, four in the League and two in the FA Cup, O'Shea's loan was extended until 16 January 2011.|$|R
5000|$|In early June 2011, Caulker {{was linked}} to a further season-long loan move to help {{continue}} his development through regular football this time to newly promoted Premier League clubs Swansea City and Norwich City as well as another stint at Bristol City. On 1 July 2011, Caulker officially joined Swansea City on a season-long loan, with Swansea paying an initial fee for his services and an option to review the loan in January. Former member of Spurs' backroom staff and Newport County manager Anthony Hudson described Caulker as having the [...] "potential {{to be one of}} the best defenders in country". Hudson said during his time at Bristol City, Caulker was [...] "the best defender in the Championship" [...] and described him as [...] "one to watch this season <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> going to be a real star". He made his Premier League and Swansea City debut in the 4-0 away defeat to Manchester City, playing the full 90 minutes. After featuring in all of Swansea's first four Premier League and keeping two clean sheets, Caulker suffered a knee cartilage injury when he collided with a goalpost in Swansea's match against Arsenal. The injury ruled him out for around eight weeks. Despite initially targeting his return for the match against Manchester United on 19 November 2011, Caulker returned to action after three months out in the 2-0 home victory over Fulham on 10 December 2011. Caulker became a mainstay for the remainder of Swansea's Premier League campaign and made 26 starts overall, helping the club finish 11th in the Premier League.|$|R

[...] Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>he</b> didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|R
