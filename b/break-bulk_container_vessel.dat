Following their reports, Davies began integrating containers into the company's business. By 1961, the company had begun launching ships capable of container transport, the first two of these being the combination <b>break-bulk</b> - <b>container</b> <b>vessels</b> SS President Tyler and SS President Lincoln. Ports also began adapting to the new container-based system, although many potential customers were still wary. By {{the end of the}} decade, the company was still launching combination ships rather than fully cellular container ships as already employed by several U.S., British, European and Japanese lines, yet by 1969, 23% of the company's business moved via container.|$|R

40|$|The <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> stowage {{problem is}} a hard {{combinatorial}} optimization problem concerned with the placement of containers on a <b>container</b> <b>vessel,</b> subject to various constraints. It {{is often the case}} that stowage coordinators need to modify existing stowage plans, while preserving their optimality. An interactive configuration system can guide the coordinator in this process. Such systems have previously been implemented using binary decision diagrams (BDDs), but this approach has been shown to have limited scalability. This thesis explores the usage of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers as engines for such systems, {{to gain a better understanding}} of the scalability offered by using these approaches. Several methods for encoding the <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> stowage problem as a SAT or SMT problem are introduced, and experimental results comparing the performance of BDD, SAT and SMT-based interactive configuration are presented, both on the <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> stowage domain and on several other domains. The results show that SAT and SMTbased approaches suffer from scalability problems on the <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> stowage domain, while providing strong performance on some other domains. In addition, experiments with simplified versions of the <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> stowage problem are presented, giving insight on what makes the <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> stowage problem hard for SAT and SMT-based interactive configuration systems.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the optimization of container stowage plan problem for a <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> with multiple ports of call. Generally, <b>container</b> <b>vessels</b> visit many different ports on their voyage. Due to the loading and offloading at each port, finding the stowage planning for <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> is getting more difficult for each subsequent port and also the complexity in stowage planning increases. For that reason, container stowage problem is called NP-hard problem. Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing Algorithm are implemented herein to obtain the optimum solution.

Run-way air full moon is used for taking off and landing aircraft, is the construction of pavement of asphalt or concrete. Shoulder in left and {{right side of the}} run way, is a difficult area of land planted with grass impregnated, so that water flows more in the surface soil and less infiltration. Around airports, especially around the run way and shoulder, there should be an open channel to drain water drainage (interseption ditch) from the outer side of the airport. To create a flood hydrograph first count of Synthetic Unit Hydrograph Method Nakayasu. Analysis of drainage channel dimensions obtained from the discharge peaks in the flood hydrograph. To calculate the capacity of <b>container</b> <b>vessel,</b> pump capacity is planned in advance, because the water that exceed the threshold of the <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> will be pumped into the river a higher elevation than the elevation of the reservoir basin.

The main drainage channel water directly into the <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> dimension and a trapezoidal open channel. Pumps are planned each with a capacity of 40 m 3 /menit = 0. 6667 m 3 /sec.

40|$|Whipping/springing {{research}} {{started in}} the 50 ’ies. In the 60 ’ies inland water vessels design rules became stricter due to whipping/springing. The research during the 70 - 90 ’ies may be regarded as academic. In 2000 a large ore carrier was strengthened due to severe cracking from North Atlantic operation, and whipping/springing contributed to half of the fatigue damage. Measurement campaigns on blunt and slender vessels were initiated. A few blunt ships were designed to account for whipping/springing. Based on the measurements, the focus shifted from fatigue to extreme loading. In 2005 model tests of a 4, 400 TEU <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> included extreme whipping scenarios. In 2007 the 4400 TEU vessel MSC Napoli broke in two under similar conditions.

This paper first looks into the historic energy efficiency of <b>container</b> <b>vessels</b> using available public data. The current energy efficiency is presented based on data provided by operating <b>container</b> <b>vessels.</b> It is documented that with proper emission predictions and knowledge on emission abatement potentials, policy makers and ship designers and operators will be able to make the right decisions for future shipping. The emission projections show, however, that currently discussed CO 2 -emission targets will probably not be met...|$|R
