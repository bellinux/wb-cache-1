25|$|The {{intermediate}} cars sit on type MD530 bogies {{with steel}} suspension and an axle base of 2500mm. New wheels have {{a diameter of}} 920mm. They are replaced when they reach a diameter of 860mm. The cars are coupled 900mm above the rails by a semi-automatic coupling that was designed specifically for the ICE1. It couples two <b>brake</b> <b>pipes,</b> two electric trainlines, cables and two fibre optic cables. The passage between two cars is 1.1m wide and 2.05m high. Unlike on the InterCityExperimental, they are not positive locked on the outside.|$|E

50|$|Also, {{since the}} <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> is {{typically}} used for control and supply of {{air to the}} cars, if an engineer is not careful, the air supply can be depleted. Further, since the engineer is only aware of the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure and flow of air into the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe,</b> {{it is not easy}} to know the state of the train brakes at any given time.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{train braking}} systems use {{pneumatic}} valves {{to control and}} generate brake applications on the cars {{along the length of}} the train. In general, this conventional system consists of a <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> that runs the length of the train which supplies air to reservoirs mounted on each of the cars. When the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> and car components are charged with air, the brakes release. When the engineer needs to make a brake application, control valves in the locomotive reduce the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure. As the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure reduces, the service portion on each car divert air from their reservoirs to their brake cylinders. To release the brakes, the engineer charges the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe.</b> This method of controlling the brakes on freight and passenger cars has been virtually the same since its invention by George Westinghouse in 1868.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{previous}} EP brake systems, if the train divided or a serious air leak occurred {{the drop in}} <b>Brake</b> <b>Pipe</b> pressure automatically caused the brakes to apply. This feature was lost with {{the removal of the}} <b>Brake</b> <b>Pipe,</b> so an electronic equivalent was created.|$|R
50|$|The driver's {{brake valve}} is a {{complicated}} valve system for controlling the compressed air brake of a railway vehicle. Depending on its setting, it controls whether the <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> of a compressed air brake are evacuated and thus whether braking is applied or maintained; or if the <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> are connected to a compressed air reservoir, it controls whether the brakes are released again or remain released.|$|E

50|$|When a {{locomotive}} is first coupled to a train, or if a vehicle is detached or added, a brake continuity test is carried out, {{to ensure that}} the <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> are connected throughout {{the entire length of the}} train.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the main}} {{reservoir}} pipe is kept constantly pressurized by the locomotive, the car reservoirs can be charged independently of the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe,</b> this being accomplished via a check valve to prevent backfeeding into the pipe. This arrangement helps to reduce the above described pressure loss problems, and also reduces the time required for the brakes to release, since the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> only has to recharge itself.|$|R
5000|$|Provisional {{findings}} of the Commission of Railway Safety discussed on a conference in October 2015 report a “discontinuity of <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure between the train engine and the trailing load of passenger coaches caused by wrong position of additional cut out cock provided in the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> of the locomotive which is not having the safety features specified in the design against inadvertent or unauthorized operation.” ...|$|R
50|$|The Westinghouse {{air brake}} system is very trustworthy, but not infallible. Recall {{that the car}} {{reservoirs}} recharge only when the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure {{is higher than the}} reservoir pressure, and that the car reservoir pressure will rise only to the point of equilibrium.

5000|$|This {{coupling}} {{is still}} the standard in European countries (except the former Soviet Union, where the SA-3 automatic coupler is used). Coupling is done by a worker who must climb between the cars. First he winds the turnbuckle to the loose position, and then he can hang the chain on the hook. After hanging the chain on the towing hook the turnbuckle handle is stowed on the idle hook to prevent damage to itself, the vehicle, or the <b>brake</b> <b>pipes.</b> Only shunting is permitted with a dangling chain. Disconnected <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> must be stowed on dummy connectors, to allow proper operation of the brakes. (The picture shows two coupled cars, with a single brake pipe.) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotives}} are air {{as well as}} dynamically braked.

25|$|In {{the event}} of a loss of braking due to {{reservoir}} depletion, the engine driver may be able to regain control with an emergency brake application, as the emergency portion of each car's dual-compartment reservoir should be fully chargedit is not affected by normal service reductions.

50|$|To {{prevent the}} train rolling back, the brakes were applied. The train did have {{continuous}} brakes, (i.e., all carriages had brakes {{which could be}} operated by the driver), but they were of the non-automatic vacuum type. That is to say, they were applied by creation of vacuum in the <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> and released by admitting air to the pipe.|$|E
50|$|Locomotive (air) {{and train}} (vacuum) brakes were fitted from new. Air train braking was added later, {{in some cases}} with {{high-level}} air <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> for use with Southern Region electric multiple units.

These were removed when operation at the docks ceased.|$|E
5000|$|The {{danger of}} {{electrocution}} of staff at track level was the entire tenet behind the Southern Region/Railway adopting high-level <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> and control jumpers {{that are so}} distinctive of SR stock (nicknamed [...] "bagpipes").

In contrast, almost all other contemporary locomotive classes (excepting notably classes 07, 09, 73 SR locomotives & class 50) had the multiple control jumpers and brake connectors on or under the buffer beam - a perilous place to be with 750 volts inches away. Despite overhead equipment being confined to {{just a handful of}} yards, class 71 was never retro-fitted with high-level connectors.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of brake application delays in Australian train brake systems {{began with a}} literature review of pneumatic train braking systems. Data located in the review gave examples of brake application delays of pre 1990 designs from the U. K., India and North America. Information on application delays on later Australian designs was scarce. Reading of literature has shown {{a difference between the}} Australian and North American control valves in the way the propagation of the pressure reduction rate in the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> is maintained. Control valves of the North American style allow the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> air to be connected for a short time to a small cavity or quick service volume of each valve. The quick service volume is then released to atmosphere. The action of exhausting a small amount of air from the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> helps to ensure a propagation of an adequate pressure reduction rate as it travels to the next valve. Australian control valves rely on the ratio of the volume of <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> between control valves {{and the size of the}} quick service volume or bulb to ensure the propagation of an adequate pressure reduction as it travels to the next valve. The air in a bulb of an Australian valve is not expelled to atmosphere until a brake release is made. The research explored possible reductions in application delays by utilizing an experimental pipe test rack that included 4 control valves and 120 meters of <b>brake</b> <b>pipe.</b> Experiments with different configurations of exhaust orifices or chokes, valves and branch pipe lengths that supplied the valves gave a record acquired by data acquisition of the timing of each valve and the local pressure drop from a valve or each valve for comparison. Experiments with exhaust chokes that gave a reduction drop rate in the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> that approached the minimum required to operate a control valve resulted in instability of the application operation of the control valve. The quick service volume of different sizes was included in the experiments to give comparisons in the propagation of the pressure reduction toward the end of a long train. Further increases into the size of the bulb of a control valve to enhance the propagation features toward the end of a long train are discussed. The branch pipe with different diameters from 12 mm to 20 mm and lengths from 160 mm to 800 mm when fitted to an adaptor pipe bracket were investigated and results show that larger diameters gave larger gulps in the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe.</b> Other components that were studied included the pipe bracket that is fitted on some control valves. The pipe bracket and isolation cock was found to add 282 mm of additional length to the air path and while not changing the operation of the valve, the results showed a smaller drop in local pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> to assist the pressure reduction rate than shown in valves without pipe brackets...|$|R
