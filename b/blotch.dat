5|$|The spiny scallop can be {{distinguished}} from its close relative the Pacific pink scallop (Chlamys rubida) by the valves being less rounded and by the small curved spines on the ribs which give it a rough texture whereas the Pacific pink feels smooth. The glossy white interior of the spiny scallop's shell often has a purplish <b>blotch</b> near the umbone, not present in the Pacific pink.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted turtle}} and painted turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the bog turtle. The bog turtle is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored <b>blotch</b> on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} spotted turtle is that the bog turtle has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Spodoptera picta (Crinum grub) as well as Pseudococcidae (Mealybugs), large, and small narcissus bulb flies (Eumerus strigatus and E funeralis), thrips, mites, aphids, snails and slugs. A fungal disease attacking Hippeastrum is Stagonospora curtisii (red <b>blotch,</b> red leaf spot or red fire). The leaves are also eaten by grasshoppers, and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near Hippeastrum bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the plant with nymphs.|$|E
5000|$|Adult {{specimens}} between 9 and 18 cm are grey to dark violet, with reddish-yellow to bark brown-red <b>blotches</b> on the head, sides, adipose fin, {{and partly}} running {{together on the}} ventral surface. [...] These <b>blotches</b> are evenly distributed and have sharp, distinct edges. [...] The <b>blotches</b> may be edged with dark violet. The fins are dark violet with brownish <b>blotches</b> and streaks. [...] Juveniles between 4 and 9 cm are strikingly colored, with white, round <b>blotches</b> on a red-violet background.|$|R
50|$|Dorsally, {{they have}} dark <b>blotches</b> {{on a variety}} of base colors ranging from reddish, pink, yellow/green, light tan, to gray. The <b>blotches</b> usually become crossbands near the tail. The young usually have more {{prominent}} <b>blotches</b> and facial markings than the adults. Some adults have no body markings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blotched</b> phase {{individuals}} have black to dark brown irregular <b>blotches</b> dorsally, and are yellow-green to yellow ventrally {{and on the}} sides.|$|R
5|$|The fish's {{upper surface}} is brown to reddish brown with many {{scattered}} darker spots, lighter streaks, and reticulations. The {{center of each}} pectoral fin is marked with an oval spot or <b>blotch.</b> The lower surface is light, white to grey, blotched irregularly with gray spots. The barndoor skate is unique from other species of skate in its having a straight line that begins at the snout and ends at the anterior margin of the outer corner of the disk, but stopping short of the disk.|$|E
5|$|The {{body is a}} pale {{brown or}} silvery brown colour, {{transitioning}} to white below, with green, mauve and rosy reflections when the fish is first removed from the water. An indistinct silver-yellow mid-lateral band extends across some specimens. The spinous dorsal fin is olive green with faint darker blotches, the second dorsal fin also a pale olive with rows of dark brown to blackish spots. The anal and ventral fins are pale yellow, the pectorals are pale yellow to pale brown with a well defined dark blue-black <b>blotch</b> at the base. The caudal fin is yellow to olive in colour with darker margins. Juveniles less than 90mm may have darker blotches along their sides and backs.|$|E
25|$|The major {{breeding}} objectives include high grain yield, good quality, {{disease and}} insect resistance and tolerance to abiotic stresses, including mineral, moisture and heat tolerance. The major diseases in temperate environments include the following, {{arranged in a}} rough order of their significance from cooler to warmer climates: eyespot, Stagonospora nodorum <b>blotch</b> (also known as glume <b>blotch),</b> yellow or stripe rust, powdery mildew, Septoria tritici <b>blotch</b> (sometimes known as leaf <b>blotch),</b> brown or leaf rust, Fusarium head blight, tan spot and stem rust. In tropical areas, spot <b>blotch</b> (also known as Helminthosporium leaf blight) is also important.|$|E
50|$|The {{color pattern}} {{consists}} of a pale brown to greenish tan ground color overlaid with 16-22 pairs of darker brown paravertabral <b>blotches</b> that have pale edges. Some of these <b>blotches</b> coalesce dorsally. These <b>blotches</b> are offset by a row of lateral <b>blotches</b> that create a semibanded appearance. Below this is a third series of dark <b>blotches,</b> alternated with lighter spots, that extends down onto the ventral scales. The belly is cream to pale tan with brown spots. A dark brown cheek stripe is present that is darkest along the outer edges where it is narrowly bordered by a lighter color that can sometimes be orange or yellow.|$|R
50|$|The {{color pattern}} usually {{consists}} of a buff, pale gray, pale brown, olive brown or yellowish brown ground color, overlaid {{with a series of}} 32-49 dorsal <b>blotches.</b> These <b>blotches</b> are dark brown to black in color, with pale centers and pale borders, and are often irregular in shape and wider than they are long. There is also a series of lateral <b>blotches</b> that are indistinct anteriorly, but become more distinct posteriorly and eventually merge with the dorsal <b>blotches</b> to form crossbands. Older specimens sometimes have a faded pattern, or they may have uniformly black <b>blotches,</b> with the dorsum of the head also being black.|$|R
50|$|Its {{coloration}} is {{a golden}} tan to pale brown, with dark <b>blotches</b> {{on the sides}} and saddle-like <b>blotches</b> across the back. <b>Blotches</b> toward the front tend to separate between top and bottom sections, while rear <b>blotches</b> {{are more likely to}} be contiguous. Coloration is nearly the same between juveniles and adults, which is unusual among snakeheads, and is similar to Channa maculata, but can be distinguished by two bar-like marks on the caudal peduncle (where the tail attaches); in C. maculata, the rear bar is usually complete, with pale bar-like areas before and after, while in C. argus, the rear bar is irregular and <b>blotched,</b> with no pale areas around it.|$|R

25|$|In life, the {{threadfin}} jack is a silvery-blue above, becoming silvery-white on the underside, {{with golden}} to yellow reflections. The first dorsal and pelvic fin is grey, {{while the second}} dorsal, anal, pectoral, and caudal fins are hyaline or grey with a yellow tinge. Juveniles have clear, dark, vertical bands, fading with age. Much like the shadow trevally, small black spots occur on the bases of soft dorsal rays and the body immediately below them that increase in size with age, with a small black <b>blotch</b> on the upper operculum.|$|E
25|$|The colour of {{the body}} is variable, often being light tan, silvery yellow-brown, sandy brown, or honey coloured. The {{underside}} of the fish is usually paler, being brown to white in colour. A silver midlateral, longitudinal stripe is normally present. The dorsal fins are dusky on each end, with or without rows of dark brown spots on the second dorsal fin membranes. The caudal fin is dusky terminally, and there is no dark <b>blotch</b> {{at the base of the}} pectoral fin as in other sillaginids. All other fins are hyaline, but the anal fin occasionally has a whitish margin.|$|E
25|$|The juveniles are {{distinctive}} due {{to their}} 'threadfin' appearance of having trailing anal and dorsal fin filaments which recede with age. During maturation, the species also becomes more elongate and more like that of other genera of jacks. The body is a silvery-metallic blue to blue-green colour above, being darkest {{on the head and}} upper shoulders while the underside is more silvery. The juveniles have five chevron-shaped dark bars on their bodies, with a black <b>blotch</b> {{at the base of the}} third to sixth soft dorsal fin rays. The base of the filaments is a dark blue to black, with all other fins pale to hyaline in appearance.|$|E
50|$|The {{color pattern}} {{consists}} of a tan, light brown or gray ground color that is overlaid {{with a series of}} around 20 dark brown or black rhomboid <b>blotches.</b> The lower tips of these <b>blotches</b> often connect with spots on the flanks to form narrow crossbands. The top of the head is dark with oblique postorbital stripes, below which {{the side of the head}} is a lighter color. The belly is whitish, occasionally with dark brown <b>blotches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... (Original {{description}} by M. Schepman) The size of {{the shell}} varies between 5 mm and 12 mm. The shell has a depressed, slightly conical shape. It is rather thin. The upper surface is yellowish-white, with ziczac-lines and <b>blotches</b> of yellowish-brown, forming more or less distinct bands, of which one, consisting of triangular white spots and very small <b>blotches,</b> borders the suture. A peripheral band is distinctly articulated with white and brown and an intermediate band of more arrow-headed <b>blotches.</b> The interstices are filled by the yellowish-brown lines, which are often confluent, leaving only smiall whitish spots. The basal surface is lighter, with scarce markings, of which a band of <b>blotches,</b> bordering the umbilicus, is the most conspicuous.|$|R
50|$|Genes F, I, B, and H {{are very}} closely linked {{and are usually}} {{inherited}} as a single unit. Therefore, many plants have pigmented flowers with at least medium intensity of color, and <b>blotches</b> in the throat, or have white flowers without <b>blotches.</b>|$|R
25|$|The longfin trevally's colour is {{variable}} with age, although {{maintains a}} general colouration of greyish blue above, fading to a whitish silver near the belly region. Younger individuals show a more silver blue dorsally, and have six dark crossbars {{visible on the}} body past the pectoral fin base. There is a distinct blackish <b>blotch</b> on the upper margin of the operculum. The first dorsal fin is pale grey to black, while the second dorsal fin and anal fin are both hyaline to black. The pectorals are dusty hyaline, the pelvics are usually black with a white leading edge and the caudal fin is also hyaline, with a dusty trailing edge.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} flower in {{cultivation}} is {{a hybrid of}} T. majus, T. minus and T. peltophorum, and {{is commonly known as}} the nasturtium (and occasionally anglicized as nasturtian). It is mostly grown from seed as a half-hardy annual and both single and double varieties are available. It comes in a range of forms and colours including cream, yellow, orange and red, solid in colour or striped and often with a dark <b>blotch</b> {{at the base of the}} petals. It is vigorous and easily grown and does well in sun. It thrives in poor soil and dry conditions, whereas in rich soil it tends to produce much leafy growth and few flowers. Some varieties adopt a bush form while others scramble over and through other plants and are useful for planting in awkward spots or for covering fences and trellises.|$|E
25|$|The {{body is a}} sandy brown to {{olive green}} colour above, while the sides and lower body are a silvery brown to cream-white hue. The head is dark olive brown to greenish above, while the cheeks and opercles are golden-green, with a dark <b>blotch</b> on the opercle of some individuals. The trumpeter whiting is usually easy to {{distinguish}} by its characteristic dark brown irregular blotches present {{on the side of}} the fish, as well as a golden silver longitudinal band. The spinous dorsal fin is whitish, with a mottled olive green and brown texture. The soft dorsal fin has about five rows of brownish green spots. The anal and ventral fins are golden to yellow with cream margins, while the pectoral fins are yellow to pale yellow-green, with a distinct black-blue spot at the base. The caudal fin is olive brown to a darkish green-brown with darker margins.|$|E
50|$|The body pattern {{consists}} of a pale gray, reddish-brown, or yellow-brown background, overlaid {{with a series of}} irregularly-shaped lateral <b>blotches.</b> These <b>blotches</b> are bordered with black and often have lighter centers. The head is dark brown or black, with beige or pale-gray sides.|$|R
50|$|The five {{adult males}} in the type series measure 52 - 66 mm in snout-vent length.

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{distortion}} in degraded film or video material is the occurrence of <b>blotches</b> of varying colour randomly dispersed in each frame. The <b>blotches</b> are caused by the abrasion of the film or collection of dirt on the film as it passes through the projection apparatus. They manifest as flashes of bright and dark areas. The <b>blotches</b> represent regions of missing data (i. e. they replace the original data), and the paper discusses a model based technique for suppressing this artefac...|$|R
