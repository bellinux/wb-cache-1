5|$|A <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier,</b> bulk freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing them to grow in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.|$|E

5|$|She was {{depicted}} on the Second Polish Republic's 20 złoty note. During World War II, a Polish female support unit, Emilia Plater 1st Independent Women's Battalion (1 Samodzielny Battalion Kobiecy im. Emilii Plater), {{a part of}} the Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division was named in her honor; its former members founded a village of Platerówka in Lower Silesia. Several streets in Poland are named after her, including one in Warsaw. In 1959, the MS Emilia Plater, a Polish Merchant Navy <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier,</b> was named after her.|$|E

50|$|Dry {{cargo ships}} today are mainly <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> and {{container}} ships. <b>Bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> or bulkers {{are used for}} the transportation of homogeneous cargo such as coal, rubber, copra, tin, and wheat. Container ships are used for the carriage of miscellaneous goods.|$|R
5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
5|$|Specialized bulk {{carriers}} {{began to appear}} as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first steam ship recognized as a <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852. She featured a metal hull, a steam engine, and a ballasting system which used seawater instead of sandbags. These features helped her succeed in the competitive British coal market. The first self-unloader was the lake freighter Hennepin in 1902 on the Great Lakes. This greatly decreased the unloading time of bulkers by using conveyor belt to move the cargo. The first bulkers with diesel propulsion {{began to appear in}} 1911.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{quantify}} the changes in the residual resistant capacity and corresponding failure probability, after collision and grounding, for both double-skin-side (DSS) and single-skin-side (SSS) <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers.</b> The residual strength after collision and grounding, as well as the residual torsional constant and shear strength, are investigated, based on the advanced analysis methods developed by the authors. Failure probability, of damaged DSS and SSS <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers,</b> is studied assuming the load effects obtained from the classification rules and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) guideline, respectively. Finally, the survivability of DSS and SSS <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> after damage is addressed...|$|R
25|$|In 2012, {{there were}} about 20.5million {{intermodal}} containers {{in the world of}} varying types to suit different cargoes. Containers have largely supplanted the traditional break bulk cargo – in 2010 containers accounted for 60% of the world's seaborne trade. The predominant alternative methods of transport carry bulk cargo – whether gaseous, liquid or solid – e.g. by <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> or tank ship, tank car or truck. For air freight, the more light-weight IATA-defined unit load device is used.|$|E

25|$|When Rautaruukki {{consulted}} Finnlines {{that already}} operated the steel company's conventional <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> Rautaruukki, the shipping company immediately presented the integrated tug barge system it had {{developed in the}} 1970s, the Finnpusku system. A development contract was signed and Finnlines performed several feasibility studies which showed that a pusher-barge system {{would be the most}} economical and efficient method of transporting bulk cargoes on the relatively short routes of the Baltic Sea. Thanks to the extremely short turnaround time at ports, the service speed of the vessel could be lower than that of normal ships, resulting in lower fuel expenses.|$|E
25|$|Vasco {{is heavily}} reliant {{on the port}} {{for most of its}} {{economic}} activity. Manganese ore mined in interior regions is brought to Mormugao by barges navigating the rivers Mandovi and Zuari, and then either collected in the Mormugao Port to be loaded onto <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> ships or directly loaded onto the ships using trans-shippers. Ore which is collected on the port is handled by machinery called MOHP (Mechanical Ore-Handling Plant). This includes massive bucket wheel loaders and miles of conveyor belts. The port has berthing facilities for large cruise liners as well as a floating dry dock. There are shipping and freight forwarding agents as well as offices of major mining companies based in the city.|$|E
