40|$|Chromosome {{studies are}} {{mandatory}} {{to confirm the}} diagnosis in even "typical" cases of genetic or malformation syndromes, since the phenotype does not unambiguously define the genotype. With the inception of banding methods to facilitate the unequivocal identification of chromosomes, major interest {{has been devoted to}} obtaining prometaphase chromosomes, since they allow for greater detail with a larger number of bands. The {{purpose of this study is}} to define in which circumstances prometaphase chromosome analysis is most useful and the minimum <b>band</b> <b>level</b> required for such high resolution detail in the karyotype. Karyotypes of 4 amniotic fluid samples and 14 prepheral blood specimens were prepared and studied at a range of <b>band</b> <b>levels.</b> The 18 cases were selected because of the presence of a variety of chromosomal anomalies. The results revealed that in most cases, a structural anomaly of a single chromosome could be surmised at <b>banding</b> <b>level</b> of 400 - 500. However, <b>banding</b> <b>levels</b> of 650 - 850 allowed for more clear delineation of the exact anomaly and accurate assignment of break points...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} sensation seeking, psychological problem behaviors, values orientation, and problem behaviors of smoking, alcohol use, and delinquency among Hong Kong adolescents studying {{in high school}} of two different ability levels. Adolescents (N = 1385) from a band one and <b>band</b> three <b>level</b> high school in Hong Kong were assessed using the Sensation Seeking Scale Form-V (SSS-V), Youth Self Report (YSR), Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ), and the Adolescent Health and Development Questionnaire (AHDQ), along with several demographic variables (e. g., age, gender, grade level, employment). Regression analyses were employed to determine {{the contribution of the}} significantly correlated variables in explaining each of the three problem behavior outcomes. For smoking behavior, regression analyses found that school <b>band</b> <b>level,</b> sensation seeking, externalizing problem behaviors, values orientation of openness to change, and alcohol use and delinquency were all predictive of smoking behavior. Specifically, sensation seeking, externalizing problem behaviors, school <b>band</b> <b>level,</b> and alcohol use were reliable predictors of current smokers from never smokers, while the values orientation of openness to change, school <b>band</b> <b>level,</b> and alcohol use were reliable predictors of not-current smokers from never smokers. These variables accounted for a total of 23. 5 % of the variance explaining smoking behavior category. For alcohol use, regression analyses found that age, school <b>band</b> <b>level,</b> sensation seeking, internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors, values orientation of conservation, openness to change, and self-transcendence, and the problem behavior outcomes of smoking and delinquency, were all predictive of alcohol use behavior. Specifically, sensation seeking, internalizing problem behaviors, school <b>band</b> <b>level,</b> values orientation of openness to change and self-transcendence, and smoking and delinquency were reliable predictors of current drinkers from never drinkers, while the school <b>band</b> <b>level,</b> sensation seeking, age, and smoking behavior were reliable predictors of not-current drinkers from never drinkers. These variables accounted for a total of 40 % of the variance explaining alcohol use behavior category. For delinquency, the following variables when entered into the linear regression equation were found to be predictors of delinquent behaviors: school <b>band</b> <b>level,</b> overall sensation seeking score, externalizing problem behavior score, values orientation of conservation, and the problem behavior outcomes of smoking and alcohol use. These variables accounted for a total of 31 % of the variance explaining delinquency. When examining the differences between adolescents who attend a band one or <b>band</b> three <b>level</b> school, there were significant findings with all three of the problem behavior outcomes. Adolescents studying at a <b>band</b> three <b>level</b> school were significant more likely to be categorized as current smokers and drinkers, and also reported more delinquent behaviors. Implications of the results are discussed in the context of clinical applications and directions for future research...|$|R
