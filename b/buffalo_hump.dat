5|$|Comanche War Chief <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> was {{determined}} {{to do more than}} merely complain about what the Comanches viewed as a bitter betrayal. Spreading word to the other bands of Comanches that he was raiding the white settlements in revenge, <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> led the Great Raid of 1840.. University of Oklahoma Press. 1952. <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> gathered a huge raiding party, at least 400 warriors, with wives and young boys along to provide comfort and do the work. Altogether as many as a thousand Comanche may have set out from West Texas on the Great Raid. On this raid the Comanches went {{all the way from the}} plains of west Texas to the cities of Victoria and Linnville on the Texas coast. In what may have been the largest organized raid by the Comanches to that point, they raided and burned these towns and plundered at will.|$|E
5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's {{injuries}} were severe, and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When {{he was able to}} travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for {{much of the rest of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Native scouts {{found about}} 500 Comanches, {{including}} <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump,</b> camped outside a Wichita village in Indian Territory. Early in the battle, Ross {{and his men}} successfully stampeded the Comanche horses, leaving the Comanche warriors at a disadvantage when facing the mounted troops. When many Comanche tried to flee the area, Ross, one of his scouts, Lieutenant Cornelius Van Camp of the 2nd Cavalry {{and one of his}} troopers chased a party of noncombatants that appeared to contain a white child. On Ross's orders, his man grabbed the child; as the four turned to rejoin the battle, they were confronted by 25 Comanche warriors. Van Camp and the private were killed with arrows, and Ross received an arrow through his shoulder. A Comanche picked up the trooper's carbine and fired a 0.58-caliber bullet through Ross's chest. His attacker, Mohee, was a Comanche brave Ross had known since childhood. Mohee was killed by buckshot fired by Lieutenant James Majors of the 2nd Cavalry as the warrior approached the temporarily paralyzed Ross with a scalping knife.|$|E

25|$|Nothing {{is known}} of his youth or early years. Older than the two war chiefs, Old Owl {{was a member of}} the same band of the Comanche as the more famous <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> (Potsʉnakwahipʉ), Yellow Wolf (Saviah) and Santa Anna. Although known as a civil, or peace, Chief, he was known to lead war parties. He was an {{important}} chief, though probably less influential than <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> during the 1830s and 1840s. He was originally, along with <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> and Santa Anna, a leader of Comanche resistance to Anglo settlement in Texas, especially during the period following the Council House Fight.|$|E
25|$|As war {{chief of}} the Penateka Comanche, <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> dealt peacefully with American {{officials}} throughout the late 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> {{was played}} by Eric Schweig in the 1996 TV miniseries Dead Man's Walk, and by Wes Studi in the 2008 TV miniseries Comanche Moon (both {{part of the}} Lonesome Dove series).|$|E

"Now {{at such a}} point, you will agree, the question turns from a question of disposing of this 'trash' {{to a question of}} appreciating its qualities, because, after all, it's 100 percent, right? And there can no longer be any question of 'disposing' of it, because it's all there is, and we will simply {{have to learn how to}} 'dig' it - that's slang, but percularly appropriate here. ...|$|R
5000|$|Little {{is known}} of <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump's</b> early life. In 1838 he, now an {{important}} war chief, went with Amorous Man (Pahayoko) and [...] "Old Owl" [...] (Mupitsukupʉ), to Houston, where they met President Sam Houston and signed with him a treaty. He became a historically important figure when, angered by the Council House fight of 1840, he led a group of Comanches, mostly his own band plus allies from various other Comanche bands, in the Great Raid of 1840. Their goal was to get revenge on the Texans who had killed thirty members of a delegation of Comanche Chiefs when these had been under a flag of truce for negotiations.|$|R
25|$|Finally, in May 1846 <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> became {{convinced}} that even he could not continue to defy the massed might of the United States, and the State of Texas, so he led the Comanche delegation to the treaty talks at Council Springs that signed a treaty with the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1849, {{he guided}} Robert Neighbors' and John S. Ford's {{expedition}} {{part of the}} way from San Antonio to El Paso, and in 1856, he sadly and finally led his people to the newly established Comanche reservation on the Brazos River. Continuous raids from white horse thieves and squatters, coupled with his band's unhappiness over their lack of freedom and the poor food provided on the reservation, forced <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> to move his band off the reservation in 1858. While camped in the Wichita Mountains, the Penateka Band under <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> were attacked by United States troops under the command of Maj. Earl Van Dorn. Allegedly not aware that Buffalo Hump's band had recently signed a formal peace treaty with the United States at Fort Arbuckle, Van Dorn and his men killed eighty of the Comanches.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Plum Creek was a {{clash between}} allied Tonkawa, militia, and Rangers of the Republic of Texas and a huge Comanche war party under Chief <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump,</b> which took place near Lockhart, Texas, on August 12, 1840, {{following}} the Great Raid of 1840 as the Comanche war party returned to west Texas.. Arthur H. Clarke Co. 1933.|$|E
60|$|The party now {{reveled in}} abundance. After {{all that they}} had {{suffered}} from hunger, cold, fatigue and watchfulness; after all their perils from treacherous and savage men, they exulted in the snugness and security of their isolated cabin, hidden, as they thought, even from the prying eyes of Indian scouts, and stored with creature comforts; and they looked forward to a winter of peace and quietness, of roasting, and boiling, and broiling, and feasting upon venison, and mountain mutton, and bear's meat, and marrow bones, and <b>buffalo</b> <b>humps,</b> and other hunter's dainties, and of dozing and reposing round their fire, and gossiping over past dangers and adventures, and telling long hunting stories, until spring should return; when they would make canoes of buffalo skins and float themselves down the river.|$|R

25|$|The Comanches {{arrived in}} San Antonio on March 19. Expecting a council of peace, the 12 chiefs brought women and {{children}} as well as warriors. They were dressed in finery with their faces painted. The delegation had hoped to negotiate a recognition of the Comancheria as the sovereign land of the Comanche. Other chiefs not in attendance, such as <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump,</b> warned that the whites could not be trusted.|$|E
25|$|A {{television}} {{adaptation of}} the novel first aired on CBS January 13, January 15, and January 16, 2008. It features many Hollywood stars, particularly Karl Urban as Woodrow F. Call, Steve Zahn as Augustus McCrae, Val Kilmer as Inish Scull (often given top billing), Elizabeth Banks as Maggie, Wes Studi as <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump,</b> Adam Beach as Blue Duck, and Jake Busey as Tudwal. Other stars include Linda Cardellini as Clara Forsythe, Rachel Griffiths as Inez Scull, and James Rebhorn as Elisha Pease.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of this book, three other {{familiar}} and important characters are introduced. At a general store, McCrae meets Clara Forsythe, later to marry Robert Allen and become Clara Allen, Augustus's old flame in the original novel. In the same town, Call meets a prostitute named Maggie, later to become the mother of his illegitimate son, Newt. On their journey, they are tracked by the notorious Comanche warrior <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump,</b> future father of Blue Duck, whom they will hunt during their later days as Texas Rangers.|$|E
60|$|The captain now set to {{work with}} his men, to prepare a {{suitable}} entertainment for his guests. It {{was a time of}} plenty in the camp; of prime hunters' dainties; of <b>buffalo</b> <b>humps,</b> and <b>buffalo</b> tongues; and roasted ribs, and broiled marrow-bones: all these were cooked in hunters' style; served up with a profusion known only on a plentiful hunting ground, and discussed with an appetite that would astonish the puny gourmands of the cities. But above all, and to give a bacchanalian grace to this truly masculine repast, the captain produced his mellifluous keg of home-brewed nectar, which had been so potent over the senses of the veteran of Hudson's Bay. Potations, pottle deep, again went round; never did beverage excite greater glee, or meet with more rapturous commendation. The parties were fast advancing to that happy state which would have insured ample cause for the next day's repentance; and the bees were already beginning to buzz about their ears, when a messenger came spurring to the camp with intelligence that Wyeth's people had got entangled in one of those deep and frightful ravines, piled with immense fragments of volcanic rock, which gash the whole country about the head-waters of the Blackfoot River. The revel was instantly at an end; the keg of sweet and potent home-brewed was deserted; and the guests departed with all speed to aid in extricating their companions from the volcanic ravine.|$|R
60|$|Arrived on {{the banks}} of that river, he found it rapid and boisterous, but not too deep to be forded. In {{traversing}} it, however, one of the horses was swept suddenly from his footing, and his rider was flung from the saddle into the midst of the stream. Both horse and horseman were extricated without any damage, excepting that the latter was completely drenched, so that it was necessary to kindle a fire to dry him. While they were thus occupied, one of the party looking up, perceived an Indian scout cautiously reconnoitring them from the summit of a neighboring hill. The moment he found himself discovered, he disappeared behind the hill. From his furtive movements, Captain Bonneville suspected him to be a scout from the Blackfeet camp, and that he had gone to report what he had seen to his companions. It would not do to loiter in such a neighborhood, so the kindling of the fire was abandoned, the drenched horseman mounted in dripping condition, and the little band pushed forward directly into the plain, going at a smart pace, until they had gained a considerable distance from the place of supposed danger. Here encamping for the night, in the midst of abundance of sage, or wormwood, which afforded fodder for their horses, they kindled a huge fire for the benefit of their damp comrade, and then proceeded to prepare a sumptuous supper of <b>buffalo</b> <b>humps</b> and ribs, and other choice bits, which they had brought with them. After a hearty repast, relished with an appetite unknown to city epicures, they stretched themselves upon their couches of skins, and under the starry canopy of heaven, enjoyed the sound and sweet sleep of hardy and well-fed mountaineers.|$|R
60|$|While Dick related his adventure, or mis-adventure {{with the}} bull, Joe and Henri {{completed}} the cutting {{out of the}} most delicate portions of the <b>buffalo,</b> namely, the <b>hump</b> on its shoulder--which is a choice piece, much finer than the best beef--and the tongue, {{and a few other}} parts. The tongues of buffaloes are superior to those of domestic cattle. When all was ready the meat was slung across the back of the pack-horse, and the party, remounting their horses, continued their journey, having first cleansed themselves as well as they could in the rather dirty waters of an old wallow.|$|R
25|$|The Nez Perce {{people lived}} in Idaho as early as 6000 BCE, and the area that is now the Gospel Hump Wilderness was used by them long {{before the arrival of}} settlers. In 1861 gold was {{discovered}} in Florence, Idaho, just outside the wilderness's boundary. A quartz vein at the base of <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> was discovered in 1898, which sparked a gold rush before mining subsided in 1903. Remnants of mines and other structures remain in the wilderness. The wilderness was formally established on February 24, 1978 when Congress passed Public Law 95-237.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} a central {{authority}} meant that one band could not force another band to return their captives. Chiefs <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> and Peta Nocona never agreed to return any captives to the Texian settlers. Captives were often assimilated into the society and adopted into families, and the Comanche made little distinction between people born Comanche and those adopted. The Comanche practice of taking captives dated back to at least the early 18th century with raids into Spanish New Mexico. Women and children were preferred, and in {{a significant number of}} cases, young captives were raised as Comanches and did not wish to leave.|$|E
25|$|He was {{stationed}} at Camp Radziminski from 1858 to 1859 and in 1859 at Camp Cooper, serving in Earl Van Dorn's Wichita Expedition against the Comanches. On February 10, 1859, he became acting commander of G Company, 2nd Cavalry after its commander {{was put on}} trial for shooting and killing a soldier who disobeyed orders and its first lieutenant went on recruiting duty. On May 13, 1859, he fought in an action that {{became known as the}} Battle of Crooked Creek at the camp of Comanche leader <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump,</b> erroneously identified as the Nescutunga Valley. During the battle, Kimmel led a detachment of dismounted skirmishers from G Company.|$|E
25|$|Van Dorn saw {{further action}} against the Seminoles and also the Comanches in the Indian Territory. He was wounded four {{separate}} times there, including seriously when he commanded an expedition against Comanches and took two arrows (one in his left arm and another in his right side, damaging his stomach and lung) at the Battle of Wichita Village on October 1, 1858. Not expected to live, Van Dorn recovered in five weeks. Van Dorn led six companies of cavalry and a company of scouts recruited from the Brazos Reservation in a spring campaign against the Comanche in 1859. He located the camp of <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> in Kansas in a valley he erroneously identified as the Nescutunga (or Nessentunga), and defeated them on May 13, 1859, killing 49, wounding five and capturing 32 women. He served at Fort Mason, Texas, in 1859 and 1860. While at Fort Mason, Van Dorn was promoted {{to the rank of}} major on June 28, 1860. He then was on a leave of absence from the U.S. Army for the rest of 1860 and into 1861.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1858, Ross {{returned}} to Texas and journeyed to the Brazos Indian Reserve, where his father served as Indian Agent. The United States Army had conscripted Indians from the reserve to help the [...] "Wichita Expedition" [...] of 2nd Cavalry {{in a search for}} <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump,</b> a Penateka Comanche chief who had led several deadly raids on Texas settlements. Fearing that Shapley Ross was too ill to command them on the expedition, the Indians named Sul Ross their new war chief. With his father's approval, the younger Ross led the 135 warriors to accompany 225 troops led by brevet Major Earl Van Dorn. Ross was given the courtesy title of [...] "Captain" [...] during his command.|$|E
500|$|The Great Raid of 1840 [...] was {{the largest}} raid ever mounted by Native Americans on white cities {{in what is now}} the United States.. Arthur H. Clarke Co. 1933. It {{followed}} the Council House Fight, in which Republic of Texas officials attempted to capture and take prisoner 33 Comanche chiefs who had come to negotiate a peace treaty, killing them together with two dozen of their family and followers. The Comanche tribe was supposed to have brought white hostages as their part of the negotiations but only brought one young girl who was mutilated. [...] Arguments and fighting then broke out among the Texans and Comanches. [...] The Texas Officials were determined to force the Comanche to release all white captives among them. To avenge what the Comanche viewed as a bitter betrayal by the Texans, the Comanche war chief <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Hump</b> raised a huge war party of many of the bands of the Comanche, and raided deep into white-settled areas of Southeast Texas.|$|E
