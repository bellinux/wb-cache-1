5|$|Bouldering {{competitions}} {{occur in}} both {{indoor and outdoor}} settings. The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets {{of four or five}} boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems, with ties settled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of attempts taken to solve the problems.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes {{are among}} the most {{important}} furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for trimmings, scarfs, muffs, jackets and coats. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming. The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} measure this parameter, {{we focus on}} the average number of {{vehicles}} rebroadcasting a packet. We consider that a given vehicle rebroadcasts a packet after a successful reception and the broadcast algorithm retransmits such packet. Furthermore, the packet retransmission rate is calculated <b>by</b> dividing <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of vehicles retransmitting <b>the</b> packet <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> of <b>number</b> of vehicles successfully receiving it.|$|R

5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E

30|$|To {{arrive at}} a more {{representative}} bifurcation number, Strahler (1953) used a weighted mean bifurcation ratio obtained <b>by</b> multiplying <b>the</b> bifurcation ratio for each successive pair of orders <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>numbers</b> of streams involved in the ratio and taking {{the mean of the}} sum of these values. Schumm (1956) has used this method to determine the weighted mean bifurcation ratio of the value of 4.39 of the drainage (Table  1).|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} seats won by a party would be {{calculated}} by multiplying a party's share of the party vote <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of seats in the province. As this multiplication would not automatically yield a round number, the fractional part would be allocated in favour of the party or parties with the largest fractions.|$|E
25|$|The {{competitor}} who {{clears the}} highest height is the winner. If {{two or more}} vaulters have finished with the same height, the tie is broken {{by the number of}} misses at the final height. If the tied vaulters have the same number of misses at the last height cleared, the tie is broken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of misses in the competition.|$|E

25|$|The ICC T20 Championship is an {{international}} Twenty20 cricket competition run by the International Cricket Council. The competition is notional {{in that it is}} simply a ranking scheme overlaid on the regular T20I match schedule. After every T20I match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team's points total is divided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked on a table in order of rating.|$|E
25|$|Perceived {{and actual}} safety {{play a role}} in the use of the street. Perceived safety, though perhaps an {{inaccurate}} reflection of the number of injuries or fatalities, influences parents' decision to allow their children to play, walk or bike on the street. Actual levels of safety as measured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of collisions and the number and severity of injuries are a matter of public concern. Both should inform the layout, if the street network is to achieve its optimum use.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{calculation}} {{for votes}} cast {{by a particular}} state is calculated by dividing the state's population by 1000, which is divided again {{by the number of}} legislators from the State voting in the electoral college. This number is the number of votes per legislator in a given state. Every elected member of the parliament enjoys the same number of votes, which may be obtained by dividing the total number of votes assigned to the members of legislative assemblies <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of elected representatives of the parliament.|$|E

25|$|In the US, the homeownership rate {{is created}} through the Housing Vacancy Survey by the US Census Bureau. It {{is created by}} {{dividing}} the owner occupied units <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of occupied units. This is an important point to understand changes in the homeownership rate over time. The bust of the housing bubble resulted in many houses becoming foreclosed. However, the decrease in the homeownership rate from 3Q2007 to 4Q2007 was mostly {{a result of an}} increase in the renter's population and less due to a decrease in the homeowner population.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} Test and ODI Rankings, the ICC T20I Team Rankings are an {{international}} Twenty20 ranking system {{run by the}} ICC. It is simply a ranking scheme overlaid on the regular T20I match schedule. After every T20I match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team's points total is divided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked {{on a table in}} order of rating. This ranking does not replace the ICC World Twenty20 competition.|$|E
25|$|For {{a finite}} {{population}}, the population mean of a property {{is equal to}} the arithmetic mean of the given property while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height {{is equal to the}} sum of the heights of every individual divided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of individuals. The sample mean may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples. The law of large numbers dictates that the larger the size of the sample, {{the more likely it is}} that the sample mean will be close to the population mean.|$|E

25|$|The ICC ODI Team Rankings were created, and are run, by the ICC {{for reasons}} {{similar to the}} Test Rankings. The rankings are simply an {{international}} ranking scheme overlaid on the regular ODI (One Day International) match schedule. After every ODI match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team's points total is divided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked {{on a table in}} order of rating.

25|$|We {{can view}} Ω {{as a measure}} of our lack of {{knowledge}} about a system. As an illustration of this idea, consider a set of 100 coins, each of which is either heads up or tails up. The macrostates are specified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of heads and tails, whereas the microstates are specified by the facings of each individual coin. For the macrostates of 100 heads or 100 tails, there is exactly one possible configuration, so our knowledge of the system is complete. At the opposite extreme, the macrostate which gives us the least knowledge about the system consists of 50 heads and 50 tails in any order, for which there are 100,891,344,545,564,193,334,812,497,256 (100 choose 50) ≈ 1029 possible microstates.|$|E
25|$|Each season {{starts with}} a 14-week {{round-robin}} stage, followed by a three-week finals series. In the initial round-robin stage, each team plays other teams from their own country twice, and teams from the other country once. Each team plays at least six home games, and also has one bye, some time during rounds five to nine. Teams accumulate points during the round-robin stage: two points are awarded for each match won, while no points are earned for matches lost; competition rules do not generally allow for draws. Teams are ranked according to points accumulated, with the team that has the most points ranked highest, and so on; teams with equal competition points are subsequently sorted by goal percentage (calculated as {{the total number of}} goals scored during the competition divided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> of goals conceded, all multiplied by 100), accurate to two decimal places.|$|E
