40|$|Abstract- Automatic optical {{inspection}} (AOI) of micro {{drill bit}} {{becomes more and}} more important with the rapid expanding of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing industry. Distinguished from most traditional manual inspection approach, AOI is time-saving, objective and non contact. In this work, a pattern classification method is proposedfor the AOI of micro drill bit in PCB manufacturing, in which three features of drill <b>bit</b> <b>blade</b> are extractedfor classification. In order to be independent on the clamp that can guarantee the exact position of drill <b>bit</b> <b>blade</b> for photography, and reduce the cost of the AOI system, an image registration method is used to align the drill <b>bit</b> <b>blade,</b> which can also make the feature extraction much easier. The evaluation result indicates that the approach works wellfor the AOI ofmicro drill bit. It is real time, more detailed resultproviding and low requirement on photographic device...|$|E

5000|$|The {{stone tools}} (or [...] "lithics") at Pulltrouser Swamp suggest that their use was during {{occupation}} of the site from the Late Preclassic to Late Classic Period (see Mesoamerican chronology). The tools found at the site were mostly for agricultural use or manufacturing agricultural products. There {{is little evidence that}} any of the tools were manufactured at the site. The types of tools found consisted of oval bifaces, trunchet bits, celts, picks, beveled <b>bits,</b> <b>blades,</b> and hammers stones. The majority of the tools are made from chert with some of chalcedony, cherty-limestone and obsidian. The oval bifaces are made from chert sourced near the site of Colha, Belize; these tools have wear consistent with agricultural work and were most likely used as hoes. The tranchet bits arrived fully formed at Pulltrouser, although there is evidence of retouching at the site. There are also blades made of chalcedony, stemmed knives and battered tools, sixteen of them made from chalcedony and two of cherty-limestone. Obsidian tools were mostly prismatic blades that were made from abraded surfaces and were sourced from Guatemala. The lithics found at Pulltrouser suggest extensive trade with nearby sites, since there is little evidence of manufacturing at the site. In addition, many of the chert tools were recycled and reused suggesting that these items were highly valued.|$|R

50|$|Air core {{drilling}} and related methods use hardened steel or tungsten blades to {{bore a hole}} into unconsolidated ground. The drill <b>bit</b> has three <b>blades</b> arranged around the bit head, which cut the unconsolidated ground. The rods are hollow and contain an inner tube which sits inside the hollow outer rod barrel. The drill cuttings are removed by injection of compressed air into the hole via the annular area between the innertube and the drill rod. The cuttings are then blown back to surface up the inner tube where they pass through the sample separating system and are collected if needed. Drilling continues {{with the addition of}} rods {{to the top of the}} drill string. Air {{core drilling}} can occasionally produce small chunks of cored rock.|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{optimized}} lunar regolith {{coring bit}} (LRCB) configuration, the load characteristics of rotary-percussive drilling of lunar rock simulant {{in a laboratory}} environment are analyzed {{to determine the effects}} of the drilling parameters (the rotational velocity, the penetration rate, and the percussion frequency) on the drilling load. The process of rotary drilling into lunar rock using an LRCB is modeled as an interaction between an elemental blade and the rock. The rock’s fracture mechanism during different stages of the percussive mechanism is analyzed to create a load forecasting model for the cutting and percussive fracturing of rock using an elemental blade. Finally, a model of the load on the LRCB is obtained from the analytic equation for the <b>bit’s</b> cutting <b>blade</b> distribution; experimental verification of the rotary-impact load characteristics for lunar rock simulant with different parameters is performed. The results show that the penetrations per revolution (PPR) are the primary parameter influencing the drilling load. When the PPR are fixed, increasing the percussion frequency reduces the drilling load on the rock. Additionally, the variation pattern of the drilling load of the bit is in agreement with that predicted by the theoretical model. This provides a research basis for subsequent optimization of the drilling procedure and online recognition of the drilling process...|$|R

No thought could come athwart that eager thirst. In one moment, before Tito could start back, the old man, with the preternatural force of rage in his limbs, had sprung forward, and the dagger had flashed out.

40|$|Controlling machine wear is a {{fundamental}} function of lubrication. By properly specifying lubricant viscosity, using appropriate modifying additives, and controlling contamination, wear rates can be minimized to extend equipment life. However, other influencing factors can still result in less than optimal component wear performance, including equipment loads, design issues, and environmental factors. Cryogenic treatment of tooling steels is a proven technology to increase wear resistance and extend intervals between component replacements for <b>blades,</b> <b>bits,</b> and machining mills. Recent work has also {{shed light on the}} effects of cryogenic treatment on bearings, gears and engine components to reduce wear and improve performance. Combining optimized lubrication, correct mechanical configuration, and cryogenic treatment of wearing parts results in the maximum performance of lubricated components, and can significantly extend component life. Reliability of operating systems is influenced by 5 factors: component design, manufacture, specification, installation, and maintenance. Each of these stages can be influenced by separate individuals or teams, but ultimately the responsibility for performance of the assembled system falls to the plant maintenance team.

Then the stout constable struck a mighty blow; but he struck no more in all that fight, for Stutely, parrying the blow right deftly, smote the constable back again with all his might. Then he would have escaped, but could not, for the other, all dizzy with the wound and with the flowing blood, seized him by the knees with his arms even as he reeled and fell. Then the others rushed upon him, and Stutely struck again at another of the Sheriff's men, but the steel cap glanced the blow, and though the <b>blade</b> <b>bit</b> deep, it did not kill. Meanwhile, the constable, fainting as he was, drew Stutely downward, and the others, seeing the yeoman hampered so, rushed upon him again, and one smote him a blow upon the crown so that the blood ran down his face and blinded him.

60|$|Cellulose.--I did {{not obtain}} this {{substance}} {{in a separate}} state, but tried angular bits of dry wood, cork, sphagnum moss, linen, and cotton thread. None of these bodies were in the least attacked by the secretion, and they caused only that moderate amount of inflection which is common to all inorganic objects. Gun-cotton, which consists of cellulose, with the hydrogen replaced by nitrogen, was tried with the same result. We have seen that a decoction of cabbage-leaves excites the most powerful inflection. I therefore placed two little square <b>bits</b> of the <b>blade</b> of a cabbage-leaf, and four little cubes cut from the midrib, on six leaves of Drosera. These became well inflected in 12 hrs., and remained so for between two and four days; the bits of cabbage being bathed all the time by acid secretion. This shows that some exciting matter, to which I shall presently refer, had been absorbed; but the angles of the squares and cubes remained as sharp as ever, proving that the framework of cellulose had not been attacked. Small square bits of spinach-leaves were tried with the same result; the glands pouring forth a moderate supply of acid secretion, and the tentacles remaining inflected for three days. We have also seen that the delicate coats of pollen grains are not dissolved by the secretion. It {{is well known that}} the gastric juice of animals does not attack cellulose.|$|R

We spoke not. Only once I said, 'Sleep, Diamelen, for soon you may want all your strength.' I heard the sweetness of her voice, but I never turned my head. The sun rose and still we went on. Water fell from my face like rain from a cloud. We flew in the light and heat. I never looked back, but I knew that my brother's eyes, behind me, were looking steadily ahead, for the boat went as straight as a bushman's dart, when it leaves the end of the sumpitan. There was no better paddler, no better steersman than my brother. Many times, together, we had won races in that canoe. But we never had put out our strength as we did then--then, when for the last time we paddled together! There was no braver or stronger man in our country than my brother. I could not spare the strength to turn my head and look at him, but every moment I heard the hiss of his breath getting louder behind me. Still he did not speak. The sun was high. The heat clung to my back like a flame of fire. My ribs were ready to burst, but I could no longer get enough air into my chest. And then I felt I must cry out with my last breath, 'Let us rest!'
