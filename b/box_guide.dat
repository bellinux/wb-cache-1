50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower Spring seat and the axle <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the axle <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> moves down. The downward movement of the Axle <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> puts pressure on the oil in the lower spring seat. The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the axle <b>box</b> <b>guide.</b> This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The axle <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> displaces the oil in the lower spring seat and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the axle <b>box</b> <b>guide,</b> the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower spring seat) and the piston (axle <b>box</b> <b>guide).</b> Axle box springs are placed on the lower spring seat placed on the axle box wing of the axle box housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower spring seat for cushioning effect. The axle <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> is welded to the bogie frame. The axle <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the axle <b>box</b> <b>guide.</b> The end portion of the axle <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The axle <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> moves in the lower spring seat filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the axle box housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the axle box seating area. the lower spring seat sits on the washers. The lower spring seat is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of spring seat, a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower spring seat {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the axle <b>box</b> <b>guide.</b> The axle <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> is welded to the bogie frame. The axle <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> works as a piston in the Lower spring seat filled with oil. This helps in damping the vibrations caused during running train operation.|$|E

40|$|The genomes of hyperthermophilic Archaea encode {{dozens of}} {{methylation}} guide, C/D box small RNAs that guide 2 ′-O-methylation of ribose to specific sites in rRNA and various tRNAs. The genes encoding the Sulfolobus homologues of eukaryotic proteins {{that are known}} to be present in C/D box small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complexes were cloned, and the proteins (aFIB, aNOP 56, and aL 7 a) were expressed and purified. The purified proteins along with an in vitro transcript of the Sulfolobus sR 1 small RNA were reconstituted in vitro, into an RNP complex. The order of assembly of the three proteins onto the RNA was aL 7 a, aNOP 56, and aFIB. The complex was active in targeting S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) -dependent, site-specific 2 ′-O-methylation of ribose to a short fragment of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that was complementary to the D <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> region of the sR 1 small RNA. The presence of aFIB was essential for methylation; mutant proteins having amino acid replacements in the SAM-binding motif of aFIB were able to assemble into an RNP complex, but the resulting complexes were defective in methylation activity.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a burst of}} studies in the rapidly developing field of “epitranscriptomics”, which encompasses post-transcriptional changes of transcripts that have a functional relevance. Several new experimental approaches coupled with high-throughput-sequencing enabled the transcriptome-wide mapping of various RNA modifications, including those that are guided by the well-characterized small nucleolar RNAs (snoR-NAs). In the projects presented in this thesis, we {{have taken advantage of}} these new tools to comprehensively examine snoRNA functions in various cellular systems as well as in a health/disease context. The first question that we set to answer is how complete is the catalog of human snoRNAs and snoRNA pro-cessing products, since it is known that a variety of small RNAs derive from other RNAs with well-known functions such as tRNAs and snoRNAs. To answer this question we sequenced long and short RNAs, RNA fragments ob-tained in photoreactive nucleotide-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) of core snoRNA-associated proteins and small RNAs that co-precipitate with the Argonaute 2 (Ago 2) protein. A striking outcome of this study was that virtually all C/D box snoRNAs are specifically processed inside the regions of terminal com-plementarity, retaining in the mature form only 4 - 5 nucleotides upstream of the C box and 2 - 5 nucleotides down-stream of the D box. Further we found several new non-coding RNA targets that were repeatedly identified as bound by the core snoRNPs and that were validated as carrying 2 ’-O-methyl sites and/or pseudouridines. Analysis of the total and Ago 2 -associated populations of small RNAs in human cells revealed that despite their cellular abundance, snoRNA-derived small RNAs are not efficiently incorporated into the Ago 2 protein. We therefore con-cluded that a miRNA-like function for these products in human is unlikely. Identification of the targets for the many newly discovered regulatory RNAs remains a challenge. To address this problem, in a second project, we combined two powerful experimental high-throughput methods (CLIP-seq and RiboMeth-seq) with computational modelling to map 2 ’-O-methylation sites in human rRNA and to comprehen-sively associate C/D <b>box</b> <b>guide</b> snoRNAs with targets. We thereby determined that many “orphan” snoRNAs ap-pear to guide 2 ’-O-ribose methylation at sites that are targeted by other snoRNAs. Moreover, we found that snoRNAs can be reliably captured in interaction with many mRNAs, yet a subsequent 2 ’-O-methylation of these mRNAs cannot be detected. Our study provides a reliable approach to the comprehensive characterization of snoRNA-target interactions in species beyond those in which these interactions have been traditionally studied and contributes to the rapidly developing field of “epitranscriptomics”. Finally, we applied the same approach to study a particular group of orphan snoRNAs that have been implicated in a rare neurodevelopmental disorder called Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). PWS is characterized by excessive appe-tite, morbid obesity, mental and growth retardation, which are due to the loss of paternal expression of the ma-ternally imprinted SNORD 116 C/D box snoRNAs. snoRNP-CLIPs in mouse and human cell lines as well as mouse primary neurons revealed that SNORD 116 snoRNAs associate with snoRNP proteins, yet the RiboMeth-seq indi-cates {{that they do not have}} a primary snoRNP guide function. Nevertheless, the 2 ’-O-methylation landscape of wild-type mouse differs from that of a mouse model that does not express Snord 116, and the identified candidate target sites are now subject to validation by mass spectrometry. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new congestion minimization technique for standard cell global placement. The most distinct {{feature of this}} approach {{is that it does not}} follow the traditional "estimate-theneliminate" strategy. Instead, it avoids the excessive usage of routing resources by the "local" nets so that more routing resources are available for the uncertain "global" nets. The experimental results show that our new technique, SPARSE, achieves better routability than the traditional total wire length (Bounding <b>Box)</b> <b>guided</b> placers, which had been shown to deliver the best routability results among the placers optimizing different cost functions [2]. Another feature of SPARSE is the capability of allocating white space implicitly. SPARSE exploits the well known empirical Rent's rule and is able to improve the routability even more in the presence of white space. Compared to the most recent academic routability-driven placer Dragon[8], SPARSE is able to produce solutions with equal or better routability...|$|R
