40|$|This Master's degree thesis {{focuses on}} shares {{from in the}} context of {{provision}} of stock law {{in the context of}} provision on securities or book-entry securities under civil law. In the first part the quality of connection of the right and the list is analyzed including situations when the shareholder's right can exist independently of the security list. Also the definition of securities is reviewed which apply to shares only with certain reservation described here. The functions and the most important features of shares, such as the substitutability and tradability of shares on a regulated market, are also discussed. The thesis further reflects the fact that the share can also be issued as a <b>book-entry</b> <b>security,</b> the regulation of which has been separated from the category of securities and therefore forms a separate category. The last alternative is the share {{in the form of an}} immobilized security whose character is based on the adjustment of the securities as the share's list is preserved, as well as the book-entry securities through registration in the register. The second part analyzes registered shares and bearer shares. These forms of shares are distinguished by their requisites, but also by the extent of the limitations that are set out in these forms. Above all, it is a ban on bearer shares in [...] ...|$|E

50|$|The 2003 Regulations were amended in 2010 {{to extend}} the {{appropriation}} remedy to credit claims in addition to cash and financial instruments, and it will apply to all forms of security financial collateral arrangements. This effectively means that all charges, and not just mortgages, are covered. However, {{it is argued that}} the s. 17(2) framework for the remedy remains conceptually unsound and is unworkable with respect to situations involving chained holding of <b>book-entry</b> <b>securities.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of the financial collateral arrangements, under which parties transfer <b>book-entry</b> <b>securities.</b> It focuses on the legal questions link to the international element. Financial collateral arrangements typically occur in securities repurchase and securities lending. These transactions play important role in order to guarantee liquidity cash and proper functioning of capital markets in the European Union. Simultaneously, securities are no longer only of a tangible goods nature; instead they exists as electronic records in securities accounts. This is why conflicts of law issues have become so paramount. This study analyses the approach of Czech law to financial collateral arrangements. In particular, if the collateral is represented by a book-entry share, bond or fund unit. It pays attention to such a matter from the national as well as the harmonised EU perspective. On an EU level, such arrangements are primarily regulated by the Collateral Directive (FCAD). The Hague Convection on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights in Respect of Securities held with Intermediaries, which has {{had a profound impact on}} the notion of <b>book-entry</b> <b>securities</b> conflicts of law rules, is specifically discussed too. Both methods to provide financial collateral, i. e. the outright transfer and [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{finance and}} {{financial}} law, dematerialization {{refers to the}} substitution of paper-form <b>securities</b> by <b>book-entry</b> <b>securities.</b> This {{is a form of}} indirect holding system where an intermediary, such as a broker or central securities depository, or the issuer itself (e.g French system) holds a record of the ownership of shares usually in electronic format. [...] The dematerialization of securities such as stocks has been a major trend since the late 1960s, with the result that by 2010 the majority of global securities were held in dematerialized form.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} is ancient, since book entry systems for recording securities have been noted from civilisations as early as Assyria in 2000 BC, it gained new prominence {{with the advent of}} computer technology in the late 20th century. Even during the period when paper certificates were popular, book-entry systems continued since many small firms could not afford printing secured paper-form <b>securities.</b> These <b>book-entry</b> <b>securities</b> were often held under the control of an attorney who acts as a notary to certify the existence of the securities, as well as their authenticity.|$|R
40|$|Uniformity of {{legislative}} response to proprietary {{issues relating to}} financial instruments is widely considered necessary, {{as a means of}} achieving a sound regulation of post-trading activities and, as a consequence, a broader, risk-free consolidation of financial markets. In its first part, the work aims to identify the different proprietary issues affecting financial instruments, and to analyze the consequences of lack {{of legislative}} uniformity upon the process of consolidation of financial markets. The work then provides a comprehensive survey of the EU and Hague Convention measures, both in force and planned, aiming to achieve legislative uniformity of the relevant proprietary issues. The analysis of the effectiveness of these measures demonstrates that satisfactory regulation cannot be achieved without taking a clear position on the problem of the legal nature of <b>book-entry</b> <b>securities...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper proposes two {{significant}} modifications of Japan’s Act on Transfer of Bonds, Shares, etc. (BETA). First, it suggests the control agreement method of transferring {{an interest in}} securities that is effective against third parties. Under the BETA, {{the creation of an}} effective interest in <b>book-entry</b> <b>securities</b> requires book entries in the securities accounts of the transferor and the transferee. Under the control agreement approach, the transferor, transferee, and the transferor’s securities intermediary would agree that (i) the intermediary would act on the instructions of the transferee with respect to securities credited to the transferor’s securities account or (ii) the intermediary would not act on the instructions of the transferor or (iii) both (i) and (ii). No book entries would be necessary. Second, it proposes to permit the creation of an effective transfer of an interest in a securities account—i. e., in any securities that from time to time are credited to a securities account—again, without book entries with respect to specific securities. The paper explains the historical origins of the control agreement and securities account concepts as they evolved in the revisions of UCC Articles 8 and 9 and as subsequently adopted by the GSC, providing inspiration for our proposals. It describes the transfer of securities under the BETA and it explains how the BETA could be revised to adopt the proposals. It also identifies some troublesome aspects of the BETA’s treatment of title transfer security interests (jōto tanpo) {{in the context of a}} transferee’s insolvency proceeding. The core of the paper is a policy analysis of the proposals. We conclude that the revisions would fit well with the underlying policies and the basic structure of the BETA and that on balance the revisions would be beneficial, such as by providing flexibility in financing and potentially lowering transactions costs...|$|R
40|$|In today's {{financial}} markets, investors {{no longer}} hold securities physically. Instead, securities such as shares or bonds are mostly held through intermediaries and transferred {{by way of}} <b>book-entries</b> on <b>securities</b> accounts. However, there are remarkable conceptual differences between the various jurisdictions {{with regard to the}} legal treatment of intermediated securities. It is widely agreed that this patchwork creates considerable legal risks, especially in cross-border situations. Two initiatives are in place to reduce these risks. In 2009, the UNIDROIT Convention on Substantive Rules for Intermediated Securities (the 'Geneva Securities Convention') was adopted, aimed at harmonisation on the international level. The EU Commission is also running a legislative project, to achieve harmonisation at the regional level. This book compares both initiatives and analyses their impact on the securities laws of selected European jurisdictions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} private {{law of the}} United States and Japan that applies to the holding of {{securities}} through intermediaries, such as securities firms and banks. In particular, it focuses on Articles 8 and 9 of the United States Uniform Commercial Code and the Japanese Book-Entry Transfer Act. That act is now in effect in Japan for most securities other than equity securities and it will become operative for equities in January 2009. The paper also examines the proposed UNIDROIT Draft Convention on Substantive Rules regarding Intermediated Securities. The Convention will be discussed at a diplomatic conference {{to be held in}} Geneva in September 2008, with the goal of adopting a final text. It considers the Convention on alternative assumptions that the non-Convention law is the law of the United States or the law of Japan. It generally concludes that the functional approach (i. e., result- oriented, as opposed to doctrine- or theory-oriented) adopted by the Convention is successful and appropriate. Finally, the paper considers differences between United States law and Japanese law in the context of similarities and differences in the principal systems and practices for clearance and settlement of securities transactions in the United States and Japan. <b>book-entry,</b> central <b>securities</b> depository, intermediary, securities, securities account, security interest, settlement...|$|R
