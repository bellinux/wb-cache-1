5|$|In December 2012, Network Rail {{appointed}} BAM Nuttall as {{its main}} contractor. The Network Rail team which {{worked on the}} line was {{essentially the same as}} the one which delivered the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link in 2009. A Network Rail spokesman confirmed that lessons learned from the previous project had been applied to the Borders project, such as better coordination between the different teams <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> together in one office in Newtongrange. In June 2013, the design contract for the line was awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of engineering support, for £3.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Player {{characters}} and monsters have hit points (HP), with the characters' HP captioned below the main battle screen. Attacks reduce remaining HP until none are left, {{at which point}} the character faints or the monster dies. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file. The player can restore the characters' hit points <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> sleep in an inn or use items in the party's inventory, such as potions, as well as using healing magic spells. Equipment (such as swords and armor) bought in towns or found in dungeons can be used to increase damage inflicted on monsters or minimize damage received. The player can choose whether characters appear on the front line of a battle or in the back. A character's placement impacts damage received and inflicted {{depending on the type of}} attack.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{stocking}} {{since the}} start of the 1980s have re-established reasonable populations of golden perch and Murray cod; native fish that were indigenous to the Molonglo River before the lake was built, but had been lost to mining pollution of the Molonglo River in the first half of the 20th century. The main reason for stocking is to boost fish stocks along the Molonglo, which have been depleted by overfishing, introduced species and habitat destruction. One of the motives for raising the level of Murray cod and golden perch is to balance the ecosystem <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> act as native predators of other fish.|$|E

5|$|The main {{narrative}} for Over the Edge {{continued the}} events that unfolded at , WWF's previous pay-per-view event, held on April 25, 1999. There, The Undertaker abducted Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of chairman Vince McMahon. The Undertaker's price for Stephanie's return was control over the wrestling organization. His plans were thwarted, however, by the WWF Champion, Steve Austin, who rescued Stephanie and denied The Undertaker his ransom. This plot development set up a feud between the two wrestlers, which would be settled in a standard singles match for the Championship at Over the Edge, in which both Vince and his son Shane, who had aligned himself with The Undertaker, would serve as the guest referee. Originally Shane had named himself the sole referee of the match, but WWF commissioner Shawn Michaels made Vince the co-referee in order {{to level the playing}} field. WWF further built up the rivalry between The Undertaker and Austin <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> attack each other on WWF programming, before their showdown. On May 3, 1999, The Undertaker threw Austin off the stage, and two weeks later, the WWF Champion handcuffed his title's challenger to a crucifix, which was raised above the ring.|$|E

5000|$|Shadows, {{like the}} other members of Avenged Sevenfold, uses a stage name. In an interview, Shadows says that he chose [...] "M. Shadows" [...] as his stage name because he thought of himself as [...] "the darker {{character}} in the group,". The M is in place of his first name, Matthew, which {{he did not want to}} be in his stage name because of the way it sounded. He also added that he and the band took stage names because many other successful musicians that they were influenced <b>by</b> <b>had</b> <b>them</b> (e.g. Slash of Guns N' Roses, Munky of Korn and the members of Slipknot).|$|R

At the 1874 elections, although only 5 of the 41 members elected to the Legislative Assembly were not supporters of the Common Schools Act, both of the members elected in Gloucester were in the opposition.

25|$|High {{need for}} {{cognition}} {{is associated with}} a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks. In a commonly used research paradigm, participants are asked to memorise a list of related words. Recognition is tested <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> pick out learned words from a set of studied and non-studied items. Certain non-studied items are conceptually related to studied items (e.g., chair if the original list contained table and legs). People high in NFC are more likely to show false memory for these lures, due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as {{they are more likely to}} think of semantically related (but non-studied) items.|$|E
25|$|In 1868 Shetra's coup organiser, a {{semi-literate}} Ganden monk named Palden Dondrup, {{seized power}} by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years, putting opponents to death <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> 'sewn into fresh animal skins and {{thrown in the}} river'. In 1871, {{at the request of}} officials outraged after Dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others, he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless 'Regent' Khyenrab Wangchuk. As a result of this action this venerable old Regent, who died the next year, is fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and the nation. The Kashag and the Tsongdu or National Assembly were re-instated, and, presided over by a Dalai Lama or his Regent, ruled without further interruption until 1959.|$|E
25|$|To {{the south}} in the Saar-Palatinate region, Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. 3rd Army had dealt a devastating blow to the German 7th Army and, in {{conjunction}} with the U.S. 7th Army, had nearly destroyed the German 1st Army. In five days of battle, from 18–22 March, Patton's forces captured over 68,000 Germans. These bold actions eliminated the last German positions west of the Rhine. Although Montgomery's drive was still planned as the main effort, Eisenhower believed that the momentum of the American forces to the south should not be squandered <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> merely hold the line at the Rhine or make only limited diversionary attacks beyond it. By the end of March, the Supreme Commander thus leaned toward a decision to place more responsibility on his southern forces. The events of {{the first few days of}} the final campaign would be enough to convince him that this was the proper course of action.|$|E

25|$|Corresponding {{with the}} attitudes of {{humanistic}} psychology, the developmental potential of the child- as in the acknowledgement of their strengths {{as well as their}} handicaps, and the importance of the therapist- child relationship are central factors in Orff music therapy. Theoretical foundations are also influenced by the strong emphasis on social integration and the involvement of parents in the therapeutic process found in social paediatrics. Knowledge of developmental psychology puts into perspective how developmental disabilities influence the child, as do their social and familial environments. The basis for interaction in this method is known as responsive interaction, in which the therapist meets the child at their level and responds according to their initiatives, combining both humanistic and developmental psychology philosophies. Involving the parents in this type of interaction, <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> participate directly or observe the therapist's techniques, equips the parents with ideas of how to interact appropriately with their child, thus fostering a positive parent-child relationship.|$|E
25|$|The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) {{has been}} shown to be quite {{effective}} for treating bulimia nervosa (BN) in adults, but little research has been done on effective treatments of BN for adolescents. Although CBT is seen as more cost efficient and helps individuals with BN in self-guided care, Family Based Treatment (FBT) might be more helpful to younger adolescents who need more support and guidance from their families. Adolescents are at the stage where their brains are still quite malleable and developing gradually. Therefore, young adolescents with BN are less likely to realize the detrimental consequences of becoming bulimic and have less motivation to change, which is why FBT would be useful to have families intervene and support the teens. Working with BN patients and their families in FBT can empower the families <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> involved in their adolescent's food choices and behaviors, taking more control of the situation in the beginning and gradually letting the adolescent become more autonomous when they have learned healthier eating habits.|$|E
500|$|Elephants {{were used}} as executioners of choice in India for many centuries. Hindu and Muslim rulers {{executed}} tax evaders, rebels and enemy soldiers alike [...] "under the feet of elephants". The Hindu Manu Smriti or Laws of Manu, written down around AD 200, prescribed execution by elephants {{for a number of}} offences. If property was stolen, for instance, [...] "the king should have any thieves caught in connection with its disappearance executed by an elephant." [...] For example, in 1305, the sultan of Delhi turned the deaths of Mongol prisoners into public entertainment <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> crushed by elephants.|$|E

500|$|When {{playing against}} an opponent, the player may block their opponent's moves by {{dropping}} [...] "refugee beans" [...] into their board. Refugee beans {{are clear and}} cannot be grouped with any other colour, nor with refugee beans themselves. They can only {{be removed from the}} board <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> touch an adjacent cluster of disappearing coloured beans. The only way to win the game or progress to the next level is to wait until the other player's board completely fills up with beans. The game relies on a password save system which is only obtainable once the player completes a level.|$|E
500|$|Orson Welles {{created a}} {{film version of}} the play in 1948, {{sometimes}} called the Übermensch Macbeth, which altered the witches' roles <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> create a voodoo doll of Macbeth in the first scene. Critics take this {{as a sign that}} they control his actions completely throughout the film. Their voices are heard, but their faces are never seen, and they carry forked staves as dark parallels to the Celtic cross. Welles' voiceover in the prologue calls them [...] "agents of chaos, priests of hell and magic". At the end of the film, when their work with Macbeth is finished, they cut off the head of his voodoo doll.|$|E
500|$|About [...] {{outside the}} town, the main columns reunited with the advance parties. [...] They were {{startled by the}} sudden {{appearance}} of 50 armed men, but they were American. [...] Led by Adam Stephen, they had not known about the plan to attack Trenton, and had attacked a Hessian outpost. [...] Washington feared the Hessians would {{have been put on}} guard, and shouted at Stephen, [...] "You sir! You Sir, may have ruined all my plans <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>them</b> put on their guard." [...] Despite this, Washington ordered the advance continue to Trenton. In the event, Rall thought the first raid was the attack which Grant had warned him about, and {{that there would be no}} further action that day.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes also {{concentrated}} on the Rhodes Scholarship, which had British statesman Alfred Milner {{as one of its}} trustees.
