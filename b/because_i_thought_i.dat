He began crying and said [...] "This is my fault, {{because you have}} suspected me. I have not really gone {{to work for the}} last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad. But I am not against you. I was sad <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was discredited with you. So Nguyễn Hữu Có profited from my absence to make trouble." [...] Đính claimed to know nothing of Có's activities and vowed to have his deputy killed. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to this end. Nhu ordered Đính and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace {{admitted}} {{she was nervous}} about reprising the role of Kat. Speaking to TVTimes, Wallace said she'd feared she forgot how to play Kat. She commented: [...] "I missed playing Kat," [...] she said. [...] "Now it feels like I've come home. I was nervous at first <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might have forgotten how to play her, {{but as soon as}} I stepped back onto the Square she came back to me. Even when I was out of the show, people called me Kat every day in the street. I was flattered and now I'm having a great time. The recent scripts have been brilliant." ...|$|E

6000|$|J.C.P.--'Well, then, I {{must say}} what I feel about it.

6000|$|... "I {{said you}} were a {{dangerous}} woman to marry," [...] he went on deliberately. [...] "I said it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it. <b>I</b> gave Gordon an opinion about you--it was a very unfavorable one. I could n't make you out--I thought you were playing a double part. I believed that you were ready to marry him, and yet <b>I</b> saw--I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> saw--" [...] and Bernard paused again.|$|R
2500|$|He {{afterwards}} recalled {{not being}} able to get a job with an NHL organization for over a decade and a half. [...] "I called the Canadiens {{at least two or three}} times [...] <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could help the organization in some way, not necessarily as a coach but in some role that could be developed," [...] Bossy told Sports Illustrated in 2005. [...] They never called back." [...] When former linemate Bryan Trottier was hired as New York Rangers coach in 2002, Bossy was certain Trottier would hire him on in some capacity. [...] "The reason was," [...] Bossy said, [...] "I remember having umpteen conversations with Bryan, having roomed with him for 10 years, that went, 'One of these days, Mike, we're going to take a team and do it our way.' I've found out since from Bryan [...] that he wasn't going to be given that chance." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] said Key hurriedly. [...] "We really saw nothing--it {{was all a}} fancy; and Uncle Dick {{was joking}} me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> saw a woman's face," [...] he added with a forced laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, yes;--he {{has taken}} you from me. When <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{you were coming}} back, in trouble, in disgrace from the world, nameless, a poor injured thing, with your nameless babe, then <b>I</b> comforted myself <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> could be all and {{everything}} to you. I would have poured balm into the hurt wounds. I would have prayed with you, and you and I would have been as one before the Lord.' ...|$|R
60|$|Like one who drams I {{passed down}} the outer hall where stood the silent guards as statues might, and {{out through the}} archway. Here I paused for a moment, partly to calm my mind in the {{familiar}} surroundings of the night, and partly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> heard someone approaching me through the gloom, and {{in such a place}} where I might have many enemies, it was well to be prepared.|$|R

6000|$|... "There you mistake me. I {{married him}} because I loved him, but I won't say that I didn't love him partly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> saw {{a promise of}} that life in him." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{remarks of}} my {{acquaintance}} remained {{in my mind}} and influenced it so much that when the occasion came, I did as a kind of duty what, however much I was pressed, I am almost sure I should never have done for any other reason, just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> ought to take an opportunity of trying to discover what was the truth of the matter. As it chanced it was quick in coming.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I’m sure it’s {{very kind}} of you," [...] {{continued}} the girl, [...] "and if I’ve hurt your feelings by refusing you, it is only <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>I</b> was {{not good enough for}} you." ...|$|R

Steve Coppellis the new manager and he has got his own ideas but I'm obviously not part of that. It's upsetting for me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could do a lot for Reading.

6000|$|MAGGIE. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might {{perhaps have}} the courage and the womanliness {{to give it back}} to you. [JOHN has a brief dream.] Will you never hold it up against me in the future that I couldn't do that? ...|$|E
60|$|I said nothing. The display {{was exactly}} {{according}} to the guide-book, and were we not traveling by the guide-book?

6000|$|... 'Your {{telling me}} that so kindly,' said Nicholas, 'emboldens me to proceed.

I did not tell you so, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> vainly <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could conquer my weaker feelings, and render every consideration subservient to my duty to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I didn't {{want to take}} a look at anything, Mr Chalmers.

2500|$|In November, Raisman {{decided to}} become a {{professional}} athlete, giving up her NCAA eligibility and a scholarship to University of Florida. She signed with the Octagon sports management firm. She said: [...] "It was a hard decision, but I’ve always thought about it {{in the back of my}} mind. I just wanted to try it and have no regrets, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>I</b> didn’t try to go pro, I’d always wonder. I know all the girls at Florida, and they love it there so much. But not a lot of people get the opportunity to be a professional gymnast and be able to have sponsors. I love fashion, so it’s cool to be sponsored by Ralph Lauren." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} haven't, and vessels {{belonging}} to neutral countries {{ought to be}} safe," [...] said Dick.

60|$|When {{you receive}} this I shall {{be on my}} way to London. I was married to Oliver Haddo this morning. I love him as I never loved Arthur.

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he {{said with}} a feeble grin, [...] "then now I shall {{know how to deal with}} her, {{especially}} as she cannot pretend that I did not play my part in the battle, as she bade me do.

6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said Miss Annie, {{after walking}} a little {{distance}} in silence, [...] "that I am afraid Aunt Patsy has done a dreadful thing, and one I never should have suspected her of. Aunt Keswick had a little baby once, and it died very young. She keeps its clothes in a box, and I remember when I {{was a little girl}} that she once showed them to me, and told me I was {{to take the place of}} that little girl, and that frightened me dreadfully, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> would have to die, and have my clothes put in a box. I recollect perfectly that there was a pair of little blue shoes among these clothes, and Aunt Patsy must have stolen them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She had fainted, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{we ought}} to see a doctor; but afterwards, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> ought {{not to do so}} without {{speaking}} to her, I did not go to the doctor; and that day we made up our minds to get home as soon as we could; and she seemed so much better, for a while; and then, everything seemed to happen at once. When we did start home, she could not go any farther than Switzerland, and in the fall we went back to Italy. We went to Sorrento, where the climate seemed to do her good. But she was growing frailer, the whole time. She died in March. I found some old friends of hers in Naples, and came home with them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Payne cites Pharrell Williams and Justin Timberlake {{as major}} musical influences. [...] "The {{person who has}} {{inspired}} me most is Pharrell Williams who I worked with a while back. I got talking to his producer recently and asked him what Pharrell was like when he was younger, {{and he said to}} me that when he was my age he couldn’t press a note on a keyboard. And that was amazing to me <b>because</b> at 22 <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was too old to learn guitar," [...] revealed Payne.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, Mr. Bennett. It {{is packed}} now in my trunk, but usually I carry it about with me {{everywhere}} {{in order to}} take a little practice at the Rupert Street range. I bought it when Sir Mallaby told me he was sending me to America, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> ought to be prepared--because of the Underworld, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} heard of him since he went away." [...] Mrs. Inwold put her {{handkerchief}} to her eyes to dry the tears which had started. [...] "One reason I wished these goods delivered was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might get {{a chance to talk to}} you about Tom. You intend to travel from place to place, do you not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry for that. Spinsterhood is trying, I fancy, so {{we should}} be patient with the poor old ladies. Why I asked was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might induce Miss Dolly to let me have some of her relics. Do you think she would?"

6000|$|When Rousseau {{got back}} to Paris he was amazed to find that Diderot spoke to him of this {{abandonment}} of the pension with a fire that he could never have expected from a philosopher, Rousseau plainly sharing the opinion of more vulgar souls that philosopher is but fool writ large. [...] "He said that if I was disinterested on my own account, I {{had no right to}} be so on that of Madame Le Vasseur and her daughter, and that I owed it to them not to let pass any possible and honest means of giving them bread.... This was the first real dispute I had with him, and all our quarrels that followed were of the same kind; he laying down for me what he insisted that I should do, and <b>I</b> refusing <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> ought not to do it."[230] ...|$|R
5000|$|The Kincaid {{character}} was written out after Hennessy {{expressed concern about}} being typecast as an [...] "uptight lawyer". [...] Kincaid was originally intended to be portrayed as paralyzed and leaving the DA's office for private practice after the events of [...] "Aftershock". This was eventually changed to Kincaid's death, which wasn't officially confirmed until Season 9 as {{for two and a}} half years, Kincaid's fate was ambiguous. This was much to the surprise of Hennessy, who rejects claims she refused to come back for a follow-up episode: [...] "I made it clear I wanted to come back. I found out they killed me off from a friend who watched the show and told me, 'Jill, they said you were dead!' <b>I</b> was surprised, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would return. Even now, I'd love to come back for some bizarre flashbacks." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> ‘Oh, <b>I</b> have this big song, and now I {{have a little bit of}} a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|R
