30|$|In fact, mean {{modulation}} with a fixed {{quantization step}} {{has previously been}} explored for the embedding of synchronization codes in the time domain for many audio watermarking algorithms [14, 15, 17, 23, 38]. In principle, watermark <b>bits</b> and <b>synchronization</b> codes are hidden in different segments of the audio file to avoid mutual interference. In this study, we propose embedding watermark <b>bits</b> and <b>synchronization</b> codes within separate DWT subbands. This arrangement offers additional advantages other than an increase in payload capacity. For example, the successful detection of synchronization codes in one subband can signify {{the presence of a}} data sequence in another subband.|$|R

Software Defined Radio (SDR) plays a major solution for the need for flexibility, upgradability, and the problems of implementing multiple radio standards alternatively and even running several services in parallel. Previously carrier synchronization in {{software defined radio}} is implemented using QPSK technique and synchronization is done using PLL concept. The drawback in this we can transmit only few (only two) number of <b>bits</b> while <b>synchronization</b> is performed. The carrier synchronization by software defined radio using 8 PSK technique will allow more number (three) of <b>bits</b> during <b>synchronization,</b> and the same bandwidth which is used for QPSK technique. The main advantage is the transmitting of three bits which reduces the time consumption and the synchronization is performed using COSTAS LOOP. The purpose and advantage of Costas loop compared to PLL is error voltage. The error voltage is less in Costas loop, due to this synchronization is performed effectively. The complete codings are coded using MATLAB...|$|R

50|$|In telecommunications, {{transmission}} (abbreviation: Tx) is {{the process}} of sending and propagating an analogue or digital information signal over a physical point-to-point or point-to-multipoint transmission medium, either wired, optical fiber or wireless. One example of transmission is the sending of a signal with limited duration, for example a block or packet of data, a phone call, or an email. Transmission technologies and schemes typically refer to physical layer protocol duties such as modulation, demodulation, line coding, equalization, error control, <b>bit</b> <b>synchronization</b> and multiplexing, but the term may also involve higher-layer protocol duties, for example, digitizing an analog message signal, and source coding (compression).|$|E

30|$|This section gives a brief {{overview}} of the ML algorithms for <b>bit</b> <b>synchronization</b> and decoding used in this paper.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{embedded}} {{two types}} of binary data (watermark <b>bits</b> and <b>synchronization</b> codes) within the same time frame under the same framework. This was achieved using DWT to conduct signal decomposition, thus allowing the embedding {{of different types of}} binary data within separate DWT subbands. However, the detectability of the embedded binary information differs somewhat between the watermark <b>bits</b> and <b>synchronization</b> codes. Unlike watermarks, where each bit conveys individual information, the bit sequence of a synchronization code can be considered a distinct entity. The existence of the synchronization code depends on a certain number of bits being recognizable, which means that the synchronization code may have some tolerance for faults. Thus, the watermark bits in our design are inserted within the lowest subband, wherein the coefficient magnitudes are larger than that observed in the subband used for the insertion of synchronization codes. Larger coefficients enable the use of stronger strengths to embed watermark bits. This is conducive to the robustness of the watermark and helps to keep it perceptually imperceptible.|$|R
30|$|The {{remainder}} {{of this paper is}} organized as follows. Section  2 describes the watermarking framework, whereby information <b>bits</b> and <b>synchronization</b> codes are embedded in selected DWT subbands. Section  3 discusses configuring the watermark to cope with speech signals. We also outline a package strategy used for information grouping and synchronization and delineate the complete watermarking process. Section  4 presents experiment results aimed at evaluating speech quality and watermark robustness against commonly encountered attacks. Conclusions are drawn in Section  5.|$|R

40|$|Ph. D. (Electrical & Electronic Engineering) In {{the ideal}} {{communication}} system no noise is present and error free communication is possible. In practice, however, several factors influence the correctness of· the communication. One {{of the most}} important of these factors is the synchronization of the message. Synchronization techniques form an integral part of data communication systems and without synchronization no comprehensible message can be received. An example of a communication system in which synchronization errors occur is the plesiochronous communication network which is used in many telephone networks [49, 50]. A common problem with the use of the multiplexers in such a network is that output pulses may occur that do not contain valid data, due to minor discrepancies in the clock frequencies of the incoming signals. These inserted bits are termed ''justification bits" and their presence is signaled over the link by the justification control bits or stuffing control bits, which are included in the frame [49 and 50]. Synchronization of the network is dependent, among other factors, on the correct decoding of the stuffing control <b>bits.</b> <b>Synchronization</b> at the receiver can also be lost when the frame markers are not recognizable due to errors on the channel [...] ...|$|R
