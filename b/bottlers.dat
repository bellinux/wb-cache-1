25|$|In general, The Coca-Cola Company and its {{subsidiaries}} only produce syrup concentrate, {{which is}} then sold to various <b>bottlers</b> throughout the world who hold a local Coca-Cola franchise. Coca-Cola <b>bottlers,</b> who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. The <b>bottlers</b> then sell, distribute, and merchandise the resulting Coca-Cola product to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and food service distributors. Outside the United States, these <b>bottlers</b> also control the fountain business.|$|E
25|$|Within Coca-Cola, {{the role}} the company's <b>bottlers</b> had played in forcing its hand led {{executives}} {{to create a new}} subsidiary, Coca-Cola Enterprises, which bought out several of the larger <b>bottlers</b> and placed distribution and marketing efforts more tightly under Coca-Cola's control.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{production}} and distribution of Coca-Cola follows a franchising model. The Coca-Cola Company only produces a syrup concentrate, which it sells to <b>bottlers</b> throughout the world, who hold Coca-Cola franchises for one or more geographical areas. The <b>bottlers</b> produce the final drink by mixing the syrup with filtered water and sweeteners, and then carbonate it before putting it in cans and bottles, which the <b>bottlers</b> then sell and distribute to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and food service distributors.|$|E

5000|$|Crush was {{purchased}} by Procter & Gamble in 1980 (with {{the exception of the}} Canadian rights, which were purchased in 1984). Procter & Gamble only manufactured [...] "bottler's base," [...] which was a concentrate consisting of flavor and color. 1 milliliter of <b>bottler's</b> base was combined with syrup and carbonated water to create a 12-ounce bottle of Crush. In 1989, Cadbury Schweppes acquired Crush USA from Procter & Gamble Co. Cadbury Schweppes spun off its United States beverage business as Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Little {{is known}} of his life prior to his arrival in New York, except only that he was of Egyptian origin, and was {{described}} as [...] "round, inoffensive, well-dressed and affable". He soon gained {{a reputation as a}} [...] "money maker" [...] in the underworld, specifically for his clever methods for cheating, and began building up a successful illegal gambling empire based around his Glonconda stuss parlor on Suffolk Street. The <b>Bottler's</b> success soon attracted Kid Twist, then leader of the Eastman Gang, who took advantage of The <b>Bottler's</b> affiliation with the rival Five Points Gang and sought to take over his operation by forcing The Bottler to take on Kid Dahl as his partner. Unsure that the Five Pointers could protect him, especially in the midst of their gang war with the Eastmans, The Bottler was forced to agree to Kid Twist's terms. He and Kid Dahl split the profits equally for six weeks until Kid Dahl brought in The Nailer and ordered The Bottler to leave. Although he considered going to the police, The Bottler decided against it and instead barred his doors to Dahl and sent word to the Five Pointers in preparation to make a stand against the Eastmans.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the survey}} team {{traveled}} up the Yellowstone River {{in what is}} now called Paradise Valley, they confirmed what Hayden already knew, that the trail was unsuitable for their wagons. Near <b>Bottler's</b> Ranch , the last outpost in the valley near Emigrant Gulch, the survey team set up a base camp that would be used to assist in any communications or support needed while the team was in the Yellowstone region with Fort Ellis. Abandoning their wagons at the base camp, the survey headed into Yankee Jim Canyon [...] late on July 20, 1871.|$|R

50|$|A wine label {{may include}} the producer, the bottler and the merchant's names. The <b>bottler's</b> name {{must always be}} {{included}} in the label. The importer's name must {{be included in the}} label only for countries outside the Common Market. While it is not necessary for a wine to be bottled at its place of origin, it is obligatory for classed growth claret and vintage port to be bottled in Bordeaux and Oporto. Also, bottling of Alsace must be done within the appellation. Thus, it is important to look for terms such as mis en bouteille au château or mis au domaine because they tell you the wine is estate bottled.|$|R
50|$|Pluto Water was a {{trademark}} for a strongly laxative natural water product {{which was very}} popular in the United States in the early 20th century. The water's laxative properties were from its high native content of mineral salts, with the active ingredient listed as sodium and magnesium sulfate, which are known as natural laxatives. The water's high native content of mineral salts generally made it effective within one hour of ingestion, a fact the company emphasized in their promotional literature. Company advertisements stated the laxative was effective from a half-hour to two hours after ingestion. The water was an extremely popular product. In 1919, it took 450 railroad cars to transport the <b>bottler’s</b> output.|$|R
50|$|At this time, {{a police}} detective from Central Office was {{tracking}} down a lush worker when he stumbled upon the scene between the desperate gambler and Kid Dahl both brandishing firearms at each other. The detective managed to relieve both men of {{their weapons and}} took them into custody whereupon he marched them both to the local police precinct where the two were charged with disturbance of the peace. Both were tried and Kid Dahl, who repeatedly threatened the life of The Bottler, was fined $5 and released. It was soon after this incident that Kid Dahl allegedly began planning the murder of The Bottler. A few days later, while The Bottler was at his place, a stranger entered the stuss parlor, {{shot him in the}} chest twice and left. Despite there being at least twenty people in the room {{at the time of the}} shooting, the resort was empty by the time police arrived. Both shots had struck The <b>Bottler's</b> heart and he had died at the scene. An inquest was held, however with Kid Twist being at the Delancy station house arguing over the release of an Eastman member and Kid Dahl seen arguing with the owner of a Houston Street restaurant, both men were released due to lack of evidence. Some time after that, a young member of the Five Points Gang known as Louie the Lump ambushed Kid Twist and his bodyguard Cyclone Louie at a Coney Island dance hall and gunned down the two men. The argument had been over a showgirl, Carroll Terry, however it was widely speculated that this had been the Five Pointers retribution for The <b>Bottler's</b> murder.|$|R
25|$|It {{was then}} {{a few years later}} that two {{entrepreneurs}} from Chattanooga, Tennessee, namely Benjamin F. Thomas and Joseph B. Whitehead, proposed the idea of bottling and were so persuasive that Candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar. Candler never collected his dollar, but in 1899, Chattanooga became the site of the first Coca-Cola bottling company. Candler remained very content just selling his company's syrup. The loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for The Coca-Cola Company for decades to come. Legal matters were not helped by the decision of the <b>bottlers</b> to subcontract to other companies, effectively becoming parent <b>bottlers.</b> This contract specified that bottles would be sold at 5¢ each and had no fixed duration, leading to the fixed price of Coca-Cola from 1886 to 1959.|$|E

50|$|When merger discussions resumed in 1980, The Coca-Cola Company {{had already}} entered the {{alcoholic}} beverage market; their Wine Spectrum subsidiary consisting of wineries in California and New York. As {{part of the}} proposed merger, The Coca-Cola Company agreed to sell the wine business of Coke-New York to a partnership formed by First Boston and top-level managers of the New York <b>bottler's</b> wine business. Coke-New York divested itself of its three wineries, which were bought in 1981 by The Wine Group, a limited partnership headed by Arthur A. Ciocca, to avoid a buyout involving a third party. The Wine Group was the fifth largest wine producer nationally (just behind Coca-Cola'a Wine Spectrum) for 1981 with sales of nine million cases, {{the same as the}} year before.|$|R
2500|$|Chapman Root {{approved}} the prototype bottle and a design patent was issued {{on the bottle}} in November 1915. The prototype {{never made it to}} production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on conveyor belts. Dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottle's middle diameter. During the 1916 <b>bottler's</b> convention, Dean's contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year. By 1920, the contour bottle became the standard for The Coca-Cola Company. A revised version was also patented in 1923. Because the Patent Office releases the Patent Gazette on Tuesday, the bottle was patented on December 25, 1923, and was nicknamed the [...] "Christmas bottle." [...] Today, the contour Coca-Cola bottle {{is one of the most}} recognized packages on the planet..."even in the dark!".|$|R
5000|$|On August 23, 1871 after {{dismantling}} and caching Annie, {{the party}} moved northeast away from Yellowstone Lake until they encountered Pelican Creek. They followed the creek northeast {{until they reached}} the divide at Mirror Lake [...] where they camped. The next morning the continued northeast until encountering the headwaters of the East Fork of the Yellowstone River Lamar River. Following the river downstream they camped just short of Soda Butte Creek. In the morning, on August 25, 1871 they entered the upper Lamar Valley and traveled on good trails northwest through the valley {{all the way to the}} Yellowstone River at Baronette Bridge [...] In October 1870, John C. Baronett, a Helena prospector, helped rescue Truman C. Everts after he had become lost during the Washburn Expedition of 1870. After rescuing Everts, Baronett returned to Yellowstone and constructed a pack train bridge across the Yellowstone just above the mouth of the Lamar River. This was the first bridge across the Yellowstone. In 1878, during a later survey, Hayden named a nearby peak [...] in honor of John Baronett. By the evening of August 26, 1871 most of the survey party had left the park region and was camped just north of Gardiner on the Yellowstone River. The next day, most would rendezvous at <b>Bottler's</b> Ranch. After reaching <b>Bottler's,</b> Dr. Hayden posted his report No. 8, August 28, 1871 to Spencer Baird (excerpted):Dear Professor Baird, We have completed our survey of the Upper Yellow Stone sic. Our success has been complete. Our map is now complete of every stream emptying into the Lake or River above this point. Henry Elliot and young Carrington returned in seven days with a wonderful sketch of the Lake ... Henry Elliot has sketched all the Craters, the Geysers in motion, the Mud Springs, etc. We have a splendid lot of specimens also. We have about 400 negatives ... The Lake has been well photographed. ... Huse does not amount to much. I shall drop him at Chicago and that will end him so far as I am concerned. I intend to have a nice little fellow. Dr. Peale, of Philadelphia, spend the winter at Washington arranging our collections ... He is, I think, a young man of the right stamp. ...Henry Elliot is the biggest kind of Trump. He has done some great things on this trip. ...Yours Truly, F.V. Hayden ...|$|R
25|$|Disinfection using UV {{radiation}} {{is commonly used}} in wastewater treatment applications and is finding an increased usage in municipal drinking water treatment.

40|$|Next-generation {{refrigerants}} {{with lower}} Global Warming Potentials than traditional HFC’s are being commercially introduced. Drop-in performance {{tests were conducted}} in a commercial bottle cooler/freezer. Tests were conducted with R 134 a as a baseline and several next-generation refrigerants and blends. The tests were conducted in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 72 at - 5. 6 °C and 3. 3 °C bottle cooler temperature setpoints. Two ambient conditions were tested, 23. 9 °C/ 55 % relative humidity and 26. 7 °C/ 55 % relative humidity. In addition to the ASHRAE test conditions, full pull-down and half pull-down tests were conducted in accordance with a soft-drink <b>bottler’s</b> specifications. Performance parameters such as discharge air temperatures, product simulator temperatures, suction pressure, discharge pressure, compressor mass flow rate, and compressor input power were measured and compared. With the exception of HFO 1234 ze(E), all the substitute refrigerants had similar performance as R 134 a. HFO 1234 ze(E) had lower density at compressor suction conditions and therefore resulted in longer compressor run times and longer pull-down times. A larger displacement compressor would likely bring HFO 1234 ze(E) to roughly the same performance as the other refrigerants...|$|R
