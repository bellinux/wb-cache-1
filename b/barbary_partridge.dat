50|$|The <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> is the {{national}} bird of Gibraltar.|$|E
25|$|Other mammals {{found in}} Gibraltar include rabbits, foxes and bats. Dolphins and whales are {{frequently}} {{seen in the}} Bay of Gibraltar. Migrating birds are very common and Gibraltar {{is home to the}} only <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridges</b> found on the European continent.|$|R
50|$|The Rock {{has been}} {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is a migratory bottleneck, or choke point, for an estimated 250,000 raptors that cross the Strait annually, and because it supports breeding populations of <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridges</b> and lesser kestrels.|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} park lies within the Jabal al Akhdar Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International. Birds recorded {{from the park}} include golden eagles, Egyptian vulture, <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridges,</b> common quails, great bustard, Houbara bustards, black storks, white storks and sandgrouse, as well as herons, ducks and waders. Also noted are greater flamingos on the beaches and green peafowl introduced also many birds of prey.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris barbara), is a gamebird in the {{pheasant}} family Phasianidae of {{the order}} Galliformes, gallinaceous birds Native to North Africa.|$|E
50|$|This 33-36 cm bird is a {{resident}} breeder in dry, open and often hilly country. It nests in a scantily lined ground scrape laying 10-16 eggs. The <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> takes {{a wide variety}} of seeds and some insect food.|$|E
50|$|Philby's {{partridge}} or Philby's {{rock partridge}} (Alectoris philbyi), {{is a relative}} of the chukar, red-legged <b>partridge</b> and <b>barbary</b> <b>partridges</b> and is native to southwestern Saudi Arabia and northern Yemen. Although similar in appearance to other Alectoris species, Philby's partridge can be distinguished by its black cheeks and throat. Although not currently listed as an endangered species, the Arab Spring and destruction of its fragile habitat in the tribal areas of Northern Yemen had led to concerns about the survival of this species. The name commemorates the British explorer St John Philby.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} closely related to the chukar, Przevalski's, and Philby's partridges, forming a superspecies. The Western Mediterranean red-legged and <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridges</b> with their spotted neck collar are {{slightly}} more distant relatives. Nonetheless, although this species' range does not naturally overlap with that of its relatives, they co-occur where they have been introduced as gamebirds, for example in North America, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Russia, and in southeastern France where red-legged partridges have been released. In these areas, hybrids between this species, the chukar, and the red-legged partridge are usually found.(McGowan 1994, see also Randi 2006) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of the Gibraltar Nature Reserve are of {{conservation}} interest and are protected by law. Within it is a range of animals and plants, but the highlights are the Barbary macaques (the famous Rock apes), the <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridges,</b> and flowers such as Gibraltar's own Chickweed, Thyme and the Gibraltar Candytuft. The Barbary macaques may have originated from an escape of North African animals transported to Spain; {{it is also possible}} that the original Gibraltar macaques are a remnant of populations that are known to have spread throughout Southern Europe during the Pliocene, up to 5.5 million years ago. Some animals of the Rock have been reintroduced by the Alameda Wildlife Conservation Park who have three Barbary macaques.|$|R
50|$|Flora of the Ortobene include mostly holm oaks, while {{wildlife}} include Sardinian wild boar, weasel, marten, garden dormouse, Sardinian fox, European hare, <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge,</b> {{great and}} lesser spotted woodpecker, Eurasian jay, blue rock-thrush, wood pigeon, Dartford warbler, goshawk, Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, peregrine falcon and golden eagle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> is a rotund bird, with a grey-brown back, grey {{breast and}} buff belly. The face is light grey {{with a broad}} reddish-brown gorget. It has rufous-streaked white flanks and red legs. When disturbed, it prefers to run rather than fly, but if {{necessary}} it flies a short distance on rounded wings.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the main}} purpose of the park was to house confiscated animals, it became {{apparent}} that, if finished properly, it could also be open to the public to make people aware not only about illegal animal trade but also about local wildlife conservation. The park has also become important for the care of native species that are considered for future re-introduction to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, such as the red fox, the raven and the <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{area of the}} Rock {{through which}} the path passes {{is one of the}} richest in Gibraltar for flora and fauna. The start of the path is {{relatively}} sparsely vegetated and includes species such as White Asparagus, Common Asphodel, Germander and Esparto Grass. Its later sections proceed through dense vegetation that is typical of Mediterranean maquis shrubland - a widespread biome in southern Europe that consists of densely growing evergreen shrubs adapted to resist droughts. The trees along the path are predominantly olives. These have all grown since the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83) when the Upper Rock's original woodland was felled by the British garrison to serve as fuel. It is thought that the present arboreal flora of Gibraltar is the result of seeds being brought onto the Rock by birds. The maquis flora includes dense knots of creepers such as smilax, December clematis, pipe fine and black bryony, while ferns such as southern polypody and the rusty-back fern exploit the shade provided by the canopy. Many species of aromatic herbs and flowers also grow alongside the path, including purple Jerusalem sage and bee orchids. The fauna includes various species of birds that are adapted to life in the maquis, including the Sardinian warbler, wren and woodcock. <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridges</b> {{can be seen in the}} more open areas adjoining the path. Europe's largest lizard, the ocellated lizard, also lives in the vicinity, along with Iberian wall lizard, Algerian sand racer and Moorish gecko.|$|R
50|$|The {{area around}} the path has been heavily shaped by human activity, leading to its {{colonisation}} by nitrophilous plants which benefit from nitrate-rich environments created by human interference. Flora and fauna {{that can be seen}} along the path include esparto grass, wild gladiolus, toothed lavender, rough bugloss and felty and shrubby germander, which grow in the area. <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge,</b> northern raven and common kestrels nest near the path. A less welcome presence is that of a number of feral goats which have caused serious damage to the vegetation, although eradication efforts are being pursued.|$|E
50|$|It is {{very similar}} to the rock {{partridge}} (Alectoris graeca) with which it has been lumped in the past but is browner on the back and has a yellowish tinge to the foreneck. The sharply defined gorget distinguishes this species from the red-legged partridge which has the black collar breaking into dark streaks near the breast. Their song is a noisy chuck-chuck-chukar-chukar from which the name is derived. The <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris barbara) has a reddish-brown rather than black collar with a grey throat and face with a chestnut crown.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{because of}} its {{prominence}} as the only vegetated area of {{the southern tip of}} Gibraltar, Windmill Hill attracts many species of migrating birds which may see it as a focal point on trans-Saharan journeys. It is home to Gibraltar's national bird, the <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris barbara), which nests in the plateau's open habitat. It is an important waypoint on the route that songbirds take in migrating between Europe and Africa, and is often their first European landfall on crossing the Strait of Gibraltar. Bats also hunt there, feeding on insects.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of Asinara is {{a typical}} Mediterranean macchia, with lentisk, Euphorbia, tree heath (Erica arborea), Calicotome spinosa, Phillyrea angustifolia, Phoenician juniper and cistus. The flora consists of 678 species, 29 of which are endemic. Some, such as Centaurea horrida, Limonium laetum and Limonium acutifolium, are exclusive to northern Sardinia, while others are characteristic of the Sardinian - Corsican region. The fauna numbers around 80 wild species of terrestrial vertebrates, including mouflon, wild boar, horses, Sardinian donkeys and the white Asinara donkey, which was introduced onto the island {{at the beginning of}} the 1800s, and probably abandoned when the inhabitants were moved to Stintino. Birds include the rare Audouin's gull, cormorants, peregrine falcons and the <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge.</b> Asinara is the only place in Sardinia where the magpie is present.|$|E
50|$|The {{footpaths}} of Gibraltar {{provide access}} to key areas of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, a refuge for hundreds of species of flora and fauna which in some cases are found nowhere else in Europe. The reserve occupies {{the upper part of}} the Rock of Gibraltar, a long and narrow mountain that rises to a maximum height of 424 m above sea level, and constitutes around 40 per cent of Gibraltar's total land area. The unusual geology of the Rock of Gibraltar - a limestone peak adjoining a sandstone hinterland - provides a habitat for plants and animals, such as the Gibraltar candytuft and <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge,</b> which are found nowhere else in mainland Europe. For many years, the Upper Rock was reserved exclusively for military use; it was fenced off for military purposes, but was decommissioned and converted into a nature reserve in 1993.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare viability, ATP content, and DNA {{integrity}} of rooster (Gallus gallus domesticus) and <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris barbara) fresh and frozen spermatozoa {{in order to}} identify factors possibly related to differences in semen freezability. Ejaculates were obtained from March to May by the abdominal massage method from 3 adult roosters and 12 adult Barbary partridges. Semen was frozen with different cryoprotectants using Lake's diluents as a base medium: 1) glycerol 11...|$|E
40|$|Semen {{cryopreservation}} plays {{a leading}} role in ex situ management of genetic diversity in wild birds, being the only available method in these animals. This work was carried on in two different species: the Griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), an endangered bird living in a very small colony in Sardinia, and the <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris barbara), a species running the risk of genetic merge with similar species. The semen of the rooster (Gallus domesticus) was used as experimental model and different cryopreservation methods were tested in order to identify the best extender (Lake and Talp) and cryoprotectant (glycerol and DMA). The effects of freezing methods were assessed by sperm viability, sperm motility, DNA fragmentation and ATP levels. The tests developed on domestic bird were also successfully applied on wild birds, with suitable adjustment needed for species-specific differences. Partridge and Griffon sperm ability to survive freezing process was demonstrated and the most reliable tests to predict the success rate of semen cryopreservation in these species were identified. In conclusion, the present study provides baseline data on semen characteristics and on reproductive physiology of <b>Barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> and Griffon vulture. These date are of great importance to create a semen cryobank in order to allow the development of assisted reproduction program to protect genetic heritage of these wild birds...|$|E
40|$|In the Alectoris {{partridges}} (Phasianidae), hybridization occurs occasionally as {{a result}} of the natural breakdown of isolating mechanisms but more frequently {{as a result}} of human activity. No genetic record of hybridization is known for the <b>barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> (A. barbara). This species is distributed mostly in North Africa and, in Europe, on the island of Sardinia (Italy) and on Gibraltar. The risk of hybridization between barbary and red-legged partridge (A. rufa : Iberian Peninsula, France, Italy) is high in Sardinia and in Spain. We developed two random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers to detect A. barbara x A. rufa hybrid partridges. We tested themon 125 experimental hybrids, sequenced the relative species-specific bands and found that the bands and their corresponding sequences were reliably transmitted through a number of generations (F 1, F 2, F 3, BC 1, BC 2). Our markers represent a highly valuable tool for the preservation of the A. barbara genome from the pressing threat of A. rufa pollution...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{biodiversity}} preservation is {{the most}} important requirement to guarantee the survival of a species. All of the Alectoris populations (Aves, Galliformes) that inhabit the Mediterranean Sea, namely the red-legged partridge (A. rufa), the rock partridge (A. graeca), the <b>barbary</b> <b>partridge</b> (A. barbara) and the chukar (A. chukar), are important game species. They are included into the list of the Species of European Conservation Concern (SPEC), due to their vulnerable or even endangered threat status. Naturally occurring hybridisations into the genus Alectoris represent a relatively restricted phenomenon when compared to the widespread, illegal exercise of rising up unnatural, captive-bred hybrid partridges. Unfortunately, these farmed birds are often used without genetic control in restocking activities to counterbalance drawings for hunting purposes, with a strong risk of native, genetic biodiversity loss. The Department of Ethology, Ecology and Evolution of the University of Pisa (Italy) started to work since 2001 to investigate populations from Mediterranean area, to gain insights into the effects of the restocking plans on their genetic structure. Alectoris populations are currently investigated in Spain, Corse (France), Italy, Greece and Cyprus. Molecular techniques such as mitochondrial DNA markers sequencing and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting are applied. This latter, successfully worked for detecting A. rufa x A. graeca as well as A. rufa x A. chukar hybrid partridges, revealing to be a reliable, time-saving, and relatively low-cost technique to unequivocally eradicate not pure bird...|$|E
