5|$|Wife {{selling in}} England {{was a way}} of ending an {{unsatisfactory}} marriage by mutual agreement that probably began in the late 17th century, when divorce was a practical impossibility for all <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> wealthiest. After parading his wife with a halter around her neck, arm, or waist, a husband would publicly auction her to the highest bidder. Wife selling provides the backdrop for Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which the central character sells his wife {{at the beginning of the}} story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him.|$|E
5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its leaded glass windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E

25|$|The {{rarity of}} {{information}} about the childhood of Jesus in the canonical gospels led to a hunger of early Christians for more detail about the early life of Jesus.

25|$|Although isospin {{symmetry}} is very slightly broken, SU(3) symmetry is more badly broken, due to {{the much}} higher mass of the strange quark compared to the up and down. The discovery of charm, bottomness and topness could lead to further expansions up to SU(6) flavour symmetry, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> large masses of these quarks make such symmetries almost useless. In modern applications, such as lattice QCD, isospin symmetry is often treated as exact while the heavier quarks must be treated separately.|$|E

25|$|The {{first full}} {{international}} team to visit Bangladesh was Sri Lanka in January 1978.

25|$|Costa, largely {{following}} Siebert, {{proposes that}} the following languages are assigned to SNEA: Massachusett, Narragansett, Mohegan-Pequot-Montauk (probably also including Western and Niantic), Quiripi-Naugatuck, Unquachog, and Loup A. Etchemin {{may also have been}} part of this group <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> small amount of material available precludes a more definitive conclusion. Costa outlines three sound changes that are innovations uniquely assignable to Proto-Eastern Algonquian, and hence constitute evidence for the subgrouping (the asterisk denotes a reconstructed sound in the proto-language: (a) palatalization of Proto-Eastern-Algonquian (PEA) *k; (b) merger of PEA consonant clusters *hr and *hx; (c) shift of word-final PEA *r to š, all of which occur in Massachusett phonology.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, in the Mycenaean Greek Linear B tablets, some Homeric names appear, {{including}} Achilles (Linear B: , a-ki-re-u), a name {{which was}} also common in the classical period, noted on tablets from both Knossos and Pylos. The Achilles of the Linear B tablet is a shepherd, not a king or warrior, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> fact that the name is an authentic Bronze Age name is significant. These names in the Homeric poems presumably remember, if not necessarily specific people, at least an older time when people's names were {{not the same as}} they were when the Homeric epics were written down.
