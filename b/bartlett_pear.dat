40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Previously, it has {{not been}} {{possible}} to obtain a concentrated ripe <b>Bartlett</b> <b>pear</b> essence. From studies of <b>Bartlett</b> <b>pear</b> aroma characteristics, it was found that methyl and ethyl decadienoates are the components contributing to the characteristic ripe <b>Bartlett</b> <b>pear</b> aroma. It was also found that only perfume-like aroma products, lacking in typical <b>Bartlett</b> <b>pear</b> aroma, could be obtained in the early pear essence recovery trials. Thus, a laboratory scale fruit essence recovery unit was designed and built to study the difficulties in pear essence recovery. Water was first used to calibrate the unit, then, apple juice was applied as a testing model to establish the basic essence recovery effectiveness of the unit. It was found that the high heat provided by the reboiler, would drive the high-boiling, low-volatile pear aroma components upward to the fractionating column top where they could be recovered as overhead product. The high-boiling compounds were found in the reboiler discharge water in the low-heat tests. A good, strong and characteristic ripe <b>Bartlett</b> <b>pear</b> essence was obtained in the high-heat pear essence recovery test. A concept of separating low-boiling alcohols from high-boiling esters, to avoid the interference from low-boiling alcohols in the concentrating high-boiling esters. was substantiated through developing a two-stage essence recovery unit. Characteristic <b>Bartlett</b> <b>pear</b> essence of 100 fold was produced successfully in the two-stage test. Along with the organoleptic evaluation, the essence product was also analyzed by GC-MS and UV spectrometry to confirm the presence of "decadienoates" — characteristic <b>Bartlett</b> <b>pear</b> aroma components.

More than 50 trees in a variety plant-ing of older pears and apples adjoining the <b>Bartlett</b> <b>pears</b> were sprayed at the same time, because some of them had fire blight. Two sprays of a commercial anti-biotic, Agrimycin (90 % streptomycin sulfate and 10 % tetramycin), were ap-plied. The first spraying was at full bloom and the second, 10 days later. Blight reduced Trees were examined six times dur-ing the summer of 1954. Blight was greatly reduced, only nine trees show-ing twig blight or body canker. Five trees were considered worthless and re-moved.
