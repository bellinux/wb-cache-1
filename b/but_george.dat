5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1880s George's health {{began to}} decline, and Josephine spent {{increasing}} time looking after him. They holidayed in Naples in 1889, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> contracted influenza in the 1889–90 pandemic. They returned to Britain <b>but</b> <b>George</b> died on 14 March 1890; Josephine suspended campaigning in the aftermath of his death. Soon after, she left Winchester, and moved to a house in Wimbledon, London, which she shared with her eldest son and his wife.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1756, as George {{approached}} his eighteenth birthday, the King offered him a grand establishment at St James's Palace, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> refused the offer, guided by his mother and her confidant, Lord Bute, who would later serve as Prime Minister. George's mother, now the Dowager Princess of Wales, preferred to keep George at home where she could imbue him with her strict moral values.|$|E
5|$|Henry Herbert Southey, {{physician}} to the recently deceased George IV, had travelled in the Duke's train, as had Dr Hunter, professor of anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. The {{two of them}} rushed to Huskisson's side, joined shortly afterwards by Joseph Brandreth, a Liverpool surgeon who had been travelling behind Phoenix. The doctors suggested returning Huskisson to Liverpool for treatment, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> Stephenson insisted {{that it would be}} better to take him on to Manchester.|$|E
60|$|The {{story was}} not yet finished; <b>but</b> <b>George's</b> impatience caused him to {{interrupt}} it.|$|R
25|$|In {{the episode}} no alcohol is {{served at the}} dinner, <b>but</b> <b>George's</b> boss, Mr. Kruger, drinks {{something}} from a hip flask.|$|R
6000|$|His {{order was}} obeyed promptly; <b>but</b> <b>George's</b> {{appetite}} {{was taken away}} the next moment by Dolly's exclaiming, as {{he looked up from}} his damaged coat, with a scandalized face: ...|$|R
5|$|The Dayton Project {{developed}} {{techniques for}} extracting polonium-210 from the lead dioxide ore {{in which it}} occurs naturally, and from bismuth targets that had been bombarded by neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Ultimately, polonium-based neutron initiators were used in both the gun-type Little Boy and the implosion-type Fat Man used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. The fact that polonium {{was used as an}} initiator was classified until the 1960s, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> Koval, a technician with the Manhattan Project's Special Engineer Detachment, penetrated the Dayton Project as a spy for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|George {{returns to}} Paris and learns from Andre Lobineau, a {{colleague}} of Nicole's, that Montfauçon is a location in Paris. Flap and Guido attempt to steal the tripod from the museum; but they are beaten to the theft by Nicole, who gives the artifact to George. In the sewers of Montfauçon, George spies on a secret meeting of people who {{claim to be the}} Templars, and he learns of their plan to find the Sword of Baphomet. After the group leaves, George uses the tripod and gem in the underground chamber to reveal the name of a village in Syria: Marib. He travels to the village and discovers that Khan has been looking for him. At a nearby rock formation called the Bull's Head, George finds a lens and deduces that it is represented on the manuscript as a crystal ball. He also discovers an idol with three bearded faces, Baphomet; and a Latin inscription that describes Britain. Khan arrives and holds George at gunpoint, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|No one at Truckee Lake {{had died}} during the interim between the {{departure}} of the first relief party and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Leaning on {{the broad}} stone {{balustrade}} of the upper terrace, Aline Peters and George Emerson surveyed the malcontents. Aline gave a little sigh, almost inaudible; <b>but</b> <b>George's</b> hearing was good.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} that. Perhaps I have gone far enough; <b>but</b> <b>George's</b> reformation {{is a good}} {{certificate}} of your character, and Helen and her mother owe you a debt of gratitude." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whose gold <b>but</b> <b>George's,</b> by {{the grace}} of God King of Great Britain and Ireland? And what minions {{distribute}} it? Abbott at Kaskaskia, for one, and Hamilton at Detroit, the Hair Buyer, for another!" ...|$|R
5|$|That evening, the {{witnesses}} gathered {{to discuss what}} was to be done. United States laws were not applicable west of the Continental Divide (in what was then Mexican territory) and wagon trains often dispensed their own justice. <b>But</b> <b>George</b> Donner, the party's leader, was a full day ahead of the main wagon train with his family. Snyder had been seen to hit James Reed, and some claimed that he had also hit Margret Reed, but Snyder had been popular and Reed was not. Keseberg suggested that Reed should be hanged, but an eventual compromise allowed Reed to leave the camp without his family, who were {{to be taken care of}} by the others. Reed departed alone the next morning, unarmed, but his daughter Virginia rode ahead and secretly provided him with a rifle and food.|$|E
5|$|When the Prince of Wales {{applied to}} Parliament for an {{increase}} in his allowance, an open quarrel broke out. The king, who had a reputation for meanness, offered a private settlement, which Frederick rejected. Parliament voted against the measure, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> reluctantly increased his son's allowance on the advice of Walpole. Further friction between them followed when Frederick excluded the king and queen from the birth of his daughter in July 1737 by bundling his wife, who was in labour, into a coach and driving off {{in the middle of the}} night. George banished him and his family from the royal court, much like the punishment his own father had brought upon him with the exception that he allowed Frederick to retain custody of his children.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few days}} after the death of Theodore II (the sources {{disagree}} on the exact date, although 25 August is the widely accepted date), a memorial service was held at the Monastery of Sosandra in Magnesia, founded by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and serving as his and Theodore's burial place. The entire court attended, while the army was encamped on the plain below the monastery. As soon as George Mouzalon, his brothers and his retinue arrived, the service began. Outside the church, however, soldiers had assembled, many of them Latin mercenaries, and they began to clamour and demand to see the young emperor. John IV went outside and raised his hand to quiet them; the soldiers, however, allegedly mistook this as a signal. Joined by a large mob, they stormed the church aiming to kill the Mouzalon brothers. They were warned of what was going on, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> only sent his secretary Theophylact to investigate. He was mistaken for Mouzalon and killed by the crowd. The mob, however, realized its error (the secretary was wearing black shoes, while the protovestiarios wore green ones) and entered the church, the soldiers with swords in hand.|$|E
50|$|<b>But</b> <b>Georges</b> is just {{a five-year-old}} child and Nicolas is put in the Bastille with his servant Jude Leker. In Brittany Hervé tries to drown the boy but an albino peasant called Jean Blanc rescues him. Georges disappears however.|$|R
25|$|Georges begins {{employing}} a nurse {{three days a}} week. Their daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), wants her mother to go into care, <b>but</b> <b>Georges</b> {{says he will not}} break the promise he made to his wife. He employs a second nurse, but fires her after he discovers she is mistreating his wife.|$|R

5|$|The mistrust between George and William was {{set aside}} during the {{revolution}} of 1688–89 but dogged relations during the latter's reign. George held mortgages on Femern, Tremsbüttel and Steinhorst, Schleswig-Holstein, which he {{surrendered to the}} Duke of Holstein {{as part of the}} peace of Altona of 1689 negotiated by William between Denmark and Sweden. William agreed to pay George interest and the capital in compensation, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> remained unpaid. During the military campaign against James's supporters in Ireland, George accompanied the Williamite troops at his own expense, but was excluded from command, and was even refused permission to travel in his brother-in-law's coach. Snubbed from the army by William, George sought to join the navy, without rank, but was again thwarted by his brother-in-law. When William's Dutch guards failed to salute George, Anne assumed they were acting under orders. George and Anne retired from court. Some degree of reconciliation was achieved following Queen Mary's sudden and unexpected death from smallpox in 1694, which made Anne heir apparent. In November 1699, William finally recommended that Parliament pay the mortgage debt to George, and in early 1700, the debt was honoured.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>George</b> {{responded in}} 1882 and ran another amateur {{world record in}} the mile on 3 June in 4:19, leaving only Cummings and two other {{professionals}} with faster performances. George applied to the AAA to race the professional Cummings, but was denied permission.|$|E
25|$|Name That Tune {{ran from}} 1953–59 on NBC and CBS in prime time. The first hosts were Red Benson and later Bill Cullen, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> DeWitt became most {{identified}} with the show. The series finished at #30 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1956–57 season.|$|E
50|$|When Veronica {{left for}} work, Sibilot started thinking, however, Georges' {{sneezing}} interrupted him {{too many times}} and he got angry. Sibilot wanted to call the police, <b>but</b> <b>Georges</b> - as usual - talked about an idea which he will only reveal at the editor's office, but it is perfect and it can save Sibilot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{work was}} premiered at salle Pleyel in Paris on 2 April 1938 by the Concerts Colonne {{orchestra}} and the singers of Lyon {{under the direction}} of Paul Paray. This first performance was a failure with the audience, and the composer wanted to destroy the score of his work, <b>but</b> <b>Georges</b> Auric dissuaded him.|$|R
50|$|The {{attack at}} Southerland Mayfield's {{homestead}} left much of <b>George's</b> family dead, <b>but</b> <b>George's</b> {{mother and sister}} survived and resettled in Nashville. Although Mayfield lived contentedly among the Creek, he retained memories and affections for his mother and sister. In 1800, {{at the age of}} 21, Mayfield left his adopted people to return to his mother and sister.|$|R
25|$|George {{traveled}} with Captain Rowan to Boston {{and then to}} Worcester, Massachusetts, where he was put into the house of his teacher Samuel Cotting in 1813 when Rowan's property had run out. Rowan tried to get George an apprenticeship as a joiner, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> was now a restless young man.|$|E
25|$|In {{his studio}} George works on his {{painting}} obsessively while Dot prepares for their date and fantasizes {{about being a}} Follies girl ("Color and Light"). When George briefly stops painting to clean his brushes, he and Dot reflect on how fascinated they are by each other. Dot is ready to leave, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> chooses to continue painting instead, greatly upsetting her.|$|E
25|$|According to Simon Wilde, in {{the early}} 1860s Carpenter and Hayward were rated as {{two of the three}} finest batsmen in England along with Richard Daft. Daft himself ranked Carpenter and Hayward as being equal, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> Parr {{reckoned}} Carpenter to be the better. Wilde's own estimation was that Carpenter was the best batsman in England from 1860 to 1866.|$|E
60|$|Now the Duke, {{in running}} away with the lady, {{intended}} to dispense altogether with ceremony, and make of Julie anything but his wife; <b>but</b> <b>Georges,</b> her father, and one Morisseau, a notary, discovered him in his dastardly act, and pursued him to the very feet of the Regent, who compelled the pair to marry and make it up.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the drilling, Mrs. Lechmere. Yes, it is {{wonderful}} how much drill {{does for a}} man; {{and there is a}} good deal in the cut of the clothes.

25|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the Dallas Cowboys, there had not been an NFL team south of Washington, D.C. since the Dallas Texans folded in 1952. Oilman Clint Murchison Jr. had been trying to get an NFL expansion team in Dallas (as was Lamar Hunt – who ended up with an AFL franchise), <b>but</b> <b>George</b> Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins, had a monopoly in the South.|$|E
25|$|In {{their season}} finale against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Alabama won 7–0 at Legion Field on Thanksgiving Day. The only scoring drive {{began in the}} third and ended early in the fourth with a two-yard Vic Bradford {{touchdown}} run. Bradford's extra point was then blocked, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> Zivich recovered it and took it in for the point to give Alabama the 7–0 lead. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Vanderbilt to 11–9.|$|E
25|$|The Lords voted this 1910 Parliament Bill down, so Asquith {{called a}} second general {{election}} in December 1910, and again formed a minority government. Edward VII {{had died in}} May 1910, <b>but</b> <b>George</b> V agreed that, if necessary, he would create 500 new Liberal peers to neutralise the Conservative majority in the Lords. The Conservative Lords then backed down, and on 10 August 1911, the House of Lords passed the Parliament Act 1911 by a narrow 131–114 vote.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} many {{attempts}} {{throughout the history of}} education to improve the world, <b>but</b> <b>George’s</b> is aided by the aforementioned unique E11 (US Alien of Extraordinary Ability) visa—the only ever issued in child education, most commonly called ‘extraordinary capacity.’ The US government only grants the E11 if it establishes that a green card applicant is one of the very best in his field of endeavour.|$|R
