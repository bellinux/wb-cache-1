40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{employee}} alignment with an initiative is often considered a critical process of organizational change, {{few studies have examined}} processes where organizations change the individual to bring about alignment. This research aims to fill this gap by examining how employees change following the introduction of a new change initiative. Specifically, I investigate how employee knowledge of (1) a change objective (i. e., line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives) and (2) how to best affect the objective (i. e., line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions) changes following the introduction of a change initiative. To better understand potential attributes that may affect the trajectory of the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> constructs, I take a social cognitive approach to suggest five potential moderators (i. e., locus of control, interaction quality, valence, learning goal orientation, self-efficacy) based on the five core concepts of social cognitive theory (i. e., agency, observational learning, valued outcomes, goals, self-efficacy). Additionally, I propose a potential trajectory for behavioral alignment, based on a theory of change momentum; and, I examine the potential moderating effects of learning on the behavioral alignment trajectory. I also examine a potential pathway in which line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions mediate the relationship between line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives and behavioral alignment with the same five social cognitive facets as proposed moderators. In a sample of 189 fast food employees, partial support is found for the alignment model. Line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives influences both line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions and behavioral alignment. Line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions also predicted performance. When looking at the trajectories, the time period encompassing the intervention saw significant gains in line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives, but not line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions. The change in line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives and line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions also predicted the change in behavioral alignment.

40|$|The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) {{has allowed}} precise {{determinations}} {{of the column}} densities of molecular hydrogen () in Galactic lines <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> {{with a wide range}} of pathlengths and extinction properties. However, survey studies <b>of</b> lines <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> with greater extinction have been mostly restricted to the low-J states (lower total angular momentum) in which most molecular hydrogen is observed. This paper presents a survey of column densities for the molecular hydrogen in states of greater rotational excitation (J ≥ 2) in Galactic lines <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> with ≳ 20. This study is comprehensive through the highest excited state detectable in each line <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> J= 5 is observed in every line <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> and we detect J= 7 in four lines <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> J= 8 in one line <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> and vibrationally excited in two lines <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> We compared the apparent b-values and velocity offsets of the higher-J states relative to the dominant low-J states and we found no evidence of any trends that might provide insight into the formation of higher-J, although these results are the most affected by the limits of the FUSE resolution. We also derive excitation temperatures based on the column densities of the different states. We confirm that at least two distinct temperatures are necessary to adequately describe these lines <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> and that more temperatures are probably necessary. Total column density is known to be correlated with other molecules; we explore if correlations vary as a function of J for several molecules, most importantly CH and CH^+. Finally, we briefly discuss interpretations of selected lines <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> by comparing them to models computed using the Meudon PDR code.
