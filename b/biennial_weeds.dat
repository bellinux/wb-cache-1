50|$|Annual and <b>biennial</b> <b>weeds</b> such as chickweed, annual meadow grass, shepherd's purse, groundsel, fat hen, cleaver, {{speedwell}} and {{hairy bittercress}} propagate themselves by seeding. Many produce {{huge numbers of}} seed several times a season, some all year round. Groundsel can produce 1000 seed, and can continue right through a mild winter, whilst Scentless Mayweed produces over 30,000 seeds per plant. Not all of these will germinate at once, but over several seasons, lying dormant in the soil sometimes for years until exposed to light. Poppy seed can survive 80-100 years, dock 50 or more. There can be many thousands of seeds in a square foot or square metre of ground, thus and soil disturbance will produce a flush of fresh weed seedlings.|$|E

The survey was conducted in pear orchards situated in Chungnam province of Korea from April to June 2015, for spring, and from September to October 2015, for autumn. A total of 19 survey sites were randomly selected. The weed species were summarized as a total of 63 taxa belonging to 24 families. Specifically, 18 exotic weeds, belonging to 9 families, were identified. The majority of weeds were Compositae (10), followed by Poaceae (7) and Polygonaceae (6). Rumex crispus and Poa annua were dominant weeds. In terms of life cycle, there were 17 species of annual weeds, 13 species of <b>biennial</b> <b>weeds,</b> and 17 species of perennial weeds for the spring survey, and 15 species of annual weeds, 6 species of <b>biennial</b> <b>weeds,</b> and 11 species of perennial weeds for the autumn survey.

40|$|Braided river {{floodplains}} in the Canterbury Plains of New Zealand {{are classified}} as threatened ecosystems currently undergoing dramatic changes, including adjacent land-use intensification and increased water abstraction. In addition, both the regional environmental management authority and conservation NGOs are concerned by the invasion of these ecosystems by alien plants that can reduce biodiversity and alter ecosystem processes. However, whether these plant invasions are driven by flow regime {{has yet to be}} elucidated. In this thesis I address how we study the effects of hydrological flows on the ecology of ecosystems by developing a framework for setting up flow-gradient analyses. I then evaluate the three aspects of invasion organised from most general to most specific. First, I address whether flow regime, land-cover, climate and floodplain factors are associated with alien versus native cover and richness. I then ask whether groups of alien species with the same regenerative and growth traits respond to floods and hydrologic drought similarly. Finally, I take a targeted approach to determine whether flow and other drivers are associated with three woody legume invaders in the system. Using flow data from 19 river reaches, a regional multi-scale plant survey and data from the seed bank, I found that alien and native floras were driven by completely different drivers with aliens associated with flow variability and floodplain variation while natives were associated with climate and land-cover. The most prevalent species were woody and perennial herbaceous legumes, while annual and bienniel weeds had the greatest combined frequency across all the sampled rivers. Annual and <b>biennial</b> <b>weeds</b> increased in prevalence as winter flow variability increased, whereas perennial herbaceous species were more prevalent in rivers with a greater number of low flow days. Finally, flow regime played only a minor role in predicting the distribution and cover of the three most frequent woody legumes in the system. However, local patterns in the distribution of these three species suggested that decreases in mean flows coupled with flow stabilisation could allow them to establish across more of the floodplain than they already occupy. These results highlight a few key lessons. Flow-gradient studies can be used to study flow-ecology relationships if applied rigorously. Alien and native floras can be driven by completely different variables in the same ecosystem, thus management against aliens cannot presume management for natives. Finally, changes in river flows have the potential to influence aspects of alien invasion in the ecosystems and should be considered in the context of changing climate and resource use patterns in Canterbury. Future work on understanding invasion in the ecosystem could benefit from monitoring alien species responses to flow events through time and addressing whether invasive legumes drive invasional meltdown of the ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Radish (Raphanus sativus L.), a salad vegetable, and shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Med.), {{a common}} annual or <b>biennial</b> <b>weed,</b> are plants of similar height, leaf area and root biomass which often occur {{together}} in early summer. To assess {{the effects of}} the weed on the crop, plants were grown in well-watered and fertilized monocultures and mixtures in the greenhouse. Growth of both species in monoculture decreased, per plant, as planting density increased, particularly in radish which had a high relative monoculture response. In mixtures, at a range of planting densities, and in different proportions, radish was much the stronger competitor, its total dry matter and tuber production being affected only slightly, and not at all in some experiments, by mixture with C. bursa-pastoris. Thus the relative mixture response of radish ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 0, and the relative crowding coefficient of radish over Capsella was high, indicating that radish was strongly aggressive in the mixture. Although the two species had similar leaf areas in monoculture, that of C. bursa-pastoris was greatly reduced in mixture. The advantage displayed by radish in intercepting light was further enhanced when it was grown in mixtures because radish increased the height of the greatest part of its leaf area, so increasing its shading of the weed. Withholding water from plants increased dry matter partitioning to the root systems in both species, and slightly increased the competitive advantage of radish over C. bursa-pastoris. It is concluded that the weed poses little threat to the yield of radish crops in the field...|$|R

These orchards were cultivated with: Citrus spp., Phoenix dactylifera, Musa sapientum, Prunus persica, Mangifera indica, Vitis vinifera, Psidium guajava and Pyrus malus. The total number of weed species recorded in these orchards was 169 related to 126 genera and grouped under 35 families. Out of these weeds, 47 species were monocotyledoneae (27. 81 %) and 122 species were dicotyledoneae (72. 19 %). Gramineae and Compositae were the main families representing collectively about 36. 06 % of the total recorded species. According to the life span, the recorded species were classified into three groups: 1) 50 perennial weed species (29. 58 %), 2) 4 <b>biennial</b> <b>weed</b> species (2. 37 %) and 3) 115 annual weed species (68. 05 %). Furthermore, the annual weeds can be subdivided into three categories as follows: a) all year active annuals (31 species), b) winter-spring annuals (57 species) and c) summer-autumn annuals (27 species). According to the life-form spectrum, the weed flora of the study orchards may be grouped under six groups; these were: therophytes (119 species), cryptophytes (27 species), hemicryptophytes (12 species), chamaephytes (7 species), nanophanerophytes (3 species) and parasites (one species).

Verbascum thapsus, common mullein, is a <b>biennial</b> <b>weed</b> of roadsides, pastures, and open and semi-open natural habitats. This report reviews the autecology of V. thapsus in its native range (Eurasia) as well as in Hawai'i and elsewhere where it has naturalized. V. thapsus exhibits many characteristics of an ideal weed; broad germination conditions, self-compatibility, high seed output and a long-lived seed bank. Populations can vary substantially in life history characters, which may have allowed the species to spread over such a wide geographical range, including most temperate parts of the world. V. thapsus was introduced to the island of Hawai'i about 100 years ago, and it still appears to be spreading. It has invaded sites from sea level to the summit of Mauna Kea, but the densest populations occur in upper montane and subalpine habitats. Outside of Hawai'i, it is a poor competitor in many habitats, relying on continuous disturbance to maintain its populations. In contrast, in Hawai'i common mullein appears to have spread in little-disturbed native habitats, particularly where vegetation is sparse such as on relatively recent lava flows. Little is known about the impact this may have on the native biota. Further studies are needed to determine if the spread of V. thapsus depends on disturbance in Hawai'i. Extreme stem and inflorescence fasciation in V. thapsus appears to be unique to Hawai'i; its cause and how it affects life history characteristics are not known. While certain herbicides are effective in killing common mullein, long-term control is very difficult due to its abundant, long-lived seeds. No biocontrol agents have been introduced to Hawai'i, although a number of insects and pathogens attack it and its seeds elsewhere...|$|R

Herbicide efficacy experiments were conducted with four modes of action: amino acid biosynthesis inhibitors, growth regulators, acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, and cell membrane disrupters. Total seedheads, seeds per primary seedhead and plant were estimated under two levels of intraspecific competition. Plant rosettes stored resources in the taproot and produced larger and fewer leaves compared with reproductive stage plants. Most of the herbicides were highly effective for teasel control ([greater than] 90 %), but ALS inhibitors such as sulfosulfuron and sulfometuron-methyl were ineffective (less 80 %).

40|$|Cutleaf teasel is a <b>biennial,</b> {{invasive}} <b>weed</b> found along roadsides {{throughout much}} of the central USA. Long-term management should, ideally, integrate chemical and cultural practices. Research in Missouri along Interstate Highway 70 was initiated to combine chemical applications with overseeding perennial grasses. A field experiment was carried out with a split-plot design (four replications), where the main plot factor was herbicide applied, and the sub-plot factor was grass species overseeded. Herbicide treatments comprised dicamba Ã¾ diflufenzopyr, aminopyralid, triclopyr, and metsulfuron. Grass species included tall fescue Ã¾ buffalograss or Canada wildrye Ã¾ buffalograss. Cutleaf teasel coverage was reduced from 79 % to 93 % for all herbicide treatments except triclopyr, 5 months after the last herbicide application. Seedling counts of cutleaf teasel were lowest for aminopyralid by 6 months after the last herbicide application. The herbicide programme that provided 490 % cutleaf teasel control and resulted in at least 65 % grass establishment resulted in up to a 93 % reduction in cutleaf teasel emergence by 363 days after initial herbicide application. Integration of applications of herbicides and desirable seeding grasses are needed over a long period to exclude cutleaf teasel in roadside areas. Fil: Bentivegna, Diego Javier.

40|$|Cultural {{practices}} promoting vigorous, {{environmentally friendly}} dense turf are discussed. These {{are the most}} important and least recognized means of preventing weed establishment and encroachment which includes appropriate propagation material selection, sanitation and cultivation, adjustment of planting time, manual weed control (hand pulling, hoeing and rouging), turfgrass selection to better compete with weed populations, applying physiological stresses, fertilizer management, moisture management, mowing, and irrigation with salt water. Cultural management of weed is important because it reduces dependence on synthetic pesticides. A healthy turfgrass stand has been reported to be the best defense against weed colonization, and can be accomplished by proper mowing, watering, and fertilization. Mowing height is the clearest and best-documented cultural factor and a lower mowing height is always associated with more weeds in the turfgrass. Split application of fertilizer at intervals throughout the growing period is recommended for warm season turfgrasses. The application of fertilizer during dormant periods or periods of low growth may encourage weed growth.

Irrigation by saltwater has been one method used recently to effectively control grassy broadleaved and sedge weeds in salt-tolerant turfgrass species.

40|$|Onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a pest of onion {{crops and}} other Allium spp. {{worldwide}} {{and is the}} only known vector of Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) (Bunyaviridae: Tospovirus), a yieldreducing pathogen infecting onion. IYSV was first detected in New York onion fields in 2006 and has since been found throughout all of the major onion producing regions in the state. Recent studies in New York have shown that IYSV can reduce bulb size, suggesting that this disease may cause serious economic losses for the onion industry. Sources of IYSV in New York onion fields have only recently become better understood. IYSV may be annually introduced via transplanted onions imported from AZ, where the virus is established. IYSV also may be established in New York and bridge seasons through volunteer onion p lants and winter-annual, <b>biennial</b> and perennial <b>weeds</b> near onion fields. However, weed species that may be important in the epidemiology of IYSV in onion fields are not known. T. tabaci can only acquire IYSV as first instars. Therefore, a weed can only be a source for IYSV if it is also a host for immature T. tabaci. Because weed hosts that would support larval populations of T. tabaci were not known for the Great Lakes region of North America including New York, the main purpose of this research was to identify weed species that supported populations of T. tabaci larvae. In 2008 and 2009, common weed species and T. tabaci larvae were sampled from spring through early fall in the Elba Muck onion-growing region in western New York, the second largest onion growing region in the state. Ninety-eight weed species were sampled and 30 had at least one T. tabaci larva. A total of 2, 121 T. tabaci larvae were found on weeds sampled in 2008 and 2009; 17 % of the weed species were members of Asteraceae and 20 % were in the Brassicaceae. Most of the larvae (90 %) were found on species of these two families. Because IYSV is thought to be non-transmissible by seed, winterannual, <b>biennial</b> and perennial <b>weed</b> species have the ability to act as overwintering reservoirs for IYSV in onion cropping systems. Thus, these types of weed species may likely be the most important sources for this virus. Of the 30 weed species hosting T. tabaci larvae, 25 were winter-annual, <b>biennial</b> and perennial <b>weeds.</b> Of these, only four are confirmed hosts of IYSV: common burdock, Arctium minus, chicory, Cichorium intybus, curly dock, Rumex crispus, and dandelion, Taraxacum officinale. Among these four species, plant densities and populations of T. tabaci larvae were highest on common burdock and dandelion, suggesting that these weed species may have the greatest potential to impact the epidemiology of IYSV in New York onion fields. Densities of T. tabaci larvae were estimated to be 3, 536 and 3, 851 larvae per hectare on common burdock in 2008 and 2009, respectively, whereas densities were estimated to be 4, 720 and 24, 964 larvae per hectare on dandelion in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Larvae were only observed on curly dock in 2008 (3 larvae per hectare) and on chicory in 2009 (143 larvae per hectare). In a separate field survey in the fall of 2009, populations of T. tabaci larvae were highest on common burdock and dandelion plants adjacent to onion fields (0 - 50 m), whereas no larvae were observed on these weed species farther than 5 km from onion fields. Samples of common burdock and dandelion did not test positive for IYSV; however, the relative localization of T. tabaci populations suggests that management of these weed species near onion fields in an effort {{to reduce the number of}} viruliferous T. tabaci that may colonize onion fields warrants further investigation. In addition to IYSV, there are other important viruses of vegetable crops grown in muck soils.

T. tabaci larvae and adults were sampled every two weeks from 69 weed species in five areas located adjacent to onion fields in western New York in 2008 and 2009. Twenty-five of the 69 weed species were identified as hosts for T. tabaci larvae and populations were highest on the Brassicaceous weeds, Barbarea vulgaris Ait. f., Sinapis arvensis L., and Thalspi arvense L.

40|$|The general {{ecological}} {{characteristics of}} weeds {{at the individual}} and population levels were evaluated and assessed from the available literature. Adventive weed species {{were found to be}} difficult to define as a class, but were worth studying for their economic significance. The most adequate definitions of such weeds mention their characteristic aggressiveness and their tendency to occupy disturbed sites. Weeds tend to have inbreeding reproductive systems, but some species form inter-generic crosses, resulting in genetically complex populations. Adventive weeds were found to be different from non-weeds in a number of respects, being more tolerant of a range of environmental conditions and having more effective long distance dispersal mechanisms. Weeds tend to have general purpose genotypes and plasticity in their phenotypic expression. Before man 2 Ì† 7 s alteration of much of the earth 2 Ì† 7 s surface, weeds were probably confined to naturally disturbed sites. Since the development of agriculture, man has created the most important conditions influencing weed reproduction and survival. The use of herbicides is a most important current aspect of man-weed interactions. The characteristics and distribution patterns of adventive weeds in Canada were analysed from the available government sponsored weed survey reports. The Canadian weed population was found to include a high proportion of species of Eurasian origin. The proportion of perennial species was found to be similar to the proportion of annuals and biennials taken together. There were far fewer annuals than <b>biennials.</b> Many individual <b>weed</b> species had a distribution which covered all of southern Canada. British Columbia, and the souther parts of Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime provinces have a richer weed flora, and a higher proportion of alien species than that found in the rest of Canada. Physical and historical reasons for this distribution are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Since {{suburban}} secondary woodlands such as {{red pine}} (Pinus) forests and deciduous oak (Quercus) forest, or coppice, ceased being utilized for fuel resources, those abandoned woodlands have developed closed canopy and thick floor vegetation (Photo. 1). Accordingly, {{when considering the}} development of recreational possibilities on these sites, {{it is very important}} to prepare suitable forest composition for such use. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the ecological response of floor vegetation under conditions of periodical weeding and changes in degree of light, in order to develop an effective management program for recreation forests. Experimental work was conducted over ten-year period in Pinus forests and Quercus forests in selected districts in the Kansai area, specifically, in Nose, Senboku and Nishigori in Osaka Prefecture, Kameoka in Kyoto Perfecture, Miki in Hyogo Prefecture, and Hashimoto in Wakayama Prefecture. In an atempt to obtain universal validity in the study, the existing recreation forests in selected areas of the Kanto area, Musashi in Saitama Prefecture, Tsukuba in Ibaragi Prefecture, etc., were investigated. The results of study suggest the following principles which can serve to guide the development of forest management programs for various recreational needs and functions (Fig. 25, Table 7). 1. The composition and succession stage of floor vegetation. (1) Composition of the floor vegetation before weeding Regardless of locality or forest type (Pinus or Quercus), such broad-leaved evergreen shrubs as Eurya japonica, Irex crenata and Irex pedunculosa dominated in the floor vegetation (Fig. 1 - 3). Furthermore, since seedlings of Quercus glauca, Neolitsea sericea, etc., as component species of potential natural vegetation, were found growing on the floor, these forest areas are considered to be in progress toward becoming broad-leaved evergreen forest. The light condition on the floor is so dark that not only herbaceous plants are scarce but also wild Rhododendron and other deciduous shrubs were found to be stunted. (2) The succession movements of the floor vegetation One year after weeding, the floor was covered with vegetation which was mainly generated from stumps of shrubs. This kind of vigorous growth hindered herbaceous plants from making normal development (Fig. 4, 5). Six years later, the shrubs had grown so thick that it was extremely difficult to walk through the floor (Photo. 2). At this time, species diversity was the highest since weeding. Three years later, diversity was reduced by half due to the shading of broad-leaved evergreen shrubs. Judging from the above mentioned results, it was concluded that floor vegetation should be weeded at six years rotations in order to maintain rich species diversity in the interests of providing food supply for wild birds and animals. At the very least, floor vegetation should be weeded at ten years rotations in order to avoid succession to broad-leaved evergreen forests. These long term rotations are suitable for floor management when we intend both effects as buffer forests and nursing forests. However, it is important to divide the forest into several zones and to conduct weeding on a staggered basis, that is, weeding one zone one year, another zone the second year, etc., in order to obtain appropriate growth-stages for continuous effect. 2. The results of different frequency and season of weeding on floor vegetation (1) Results in red pine forest in the Kansai area (Fig. 6 - 9) Regardless of whether weeding was done in winter or summer, the reproductive power of woody plants was not reduced by <b>biennial</b> and triennial <b>weeding.</b> Since visibility was interrupted in the case of triennial weeding (Photo. 3), it was considered that we should weed floor vegetation at least at two year rotations when we intend to keep visibility along the strolling trail, but not for walking on the floor (Photo. 4). On the other hand, annual summer weeding reduced floor vegetation to bareness, as was the case with semiannual summer and winter weeding, whereas deciduous shrubs and such high-stem herbage as Miscanthus sinensis and Pteridium aquilinum grew vigorously under annual winter weeding condition. Accordingly, in cases in which the floor is to be utilized resting and strolling, weeding should be done in the spring, but not in summer or winter. Otherwise, it is essential to seed or plant suitable herbaceous species which can endure under summer weeding conditions. (2) Results in Pleioblastus chino var. viridis in the Kansai area This plant often occurs in woodlands or grasslands on hills or mountainsides in the Kansai area, in similar to the case of P. chino in the Kanto area. Since the plant has tall stems and grows vigorously, experimental work was conducted in order to control their stem-height and to form desirable floor of Pleioblastus. Semiannual weeding prevented regrowth of Pleioblastus. Likewise, <b>biennial</b> and triennial <b>weeding</b> led to Pleioblastus being oppressed and shaded by high-growing shrubs, in the case of light condition (Fig. 11, 12). On the other hand, Pleioblastus regenerated well under annual winter weeding. However, the stem was too high for strolling. Furthermore, high-stem herbage also flourished in the case of light condition (Photo. 5). Annual late-spring weeding controlled the height of Pleioblastus to below 30 cm, and the resulting thick regeneration hindered undesirable herbage from invading. Under annual summer weeding, on the other hand, Pleioblastus could not regenerate and high-stem naturalized herbage grew vigorously (Photo. 6). (3) Results in the recreation forests in the Kanto area In the Kanto Plains, in contrast with the Kansai area, not only the topography is flat or gentle, but also the soil is good. Based on a field survey, it became clear that Pleioblastus chino-type floor could be obtained from original abandoned forest floor covered with thick shrubs under annual summer weeding condition, at a stem-height below 25 to 30 cm (photo. 9, Fig. 15). Under conditions of two or three weedings per year, the floor changed into herbage-type just after three years (photo. 10, Fig. 16). The above mentioned results suggest that such conditions as gentle topography and good soil effect the floor vegetation regeneration. Further, an important factor is that since the plain forests adjoin dry farms, various weed seeds can easily reach and germinate in the floor. In the Kansai area, on the other hand, because the majority of farms are paddy fields in which species composition of weeds is different, and slso because the land is more hilly, it is more difficult for weed seeds to reach and germinate in the floor. 3. Condition of flowering of wild Rhododendron Such wild Rhododendron as R. reticulatum, R. kaempferi and R. macrosepalum are frequently seen in abandoned secondary woodlands. However, since the thick forest canopy and shrubs intercept the sunlight, the Rhododendron produce few blooms due to the light shortage (Photo. 12). In order to ascertain desirable conditions for flowering, experimental work and field surveys were conducted (Photo. 13 - 16). The research results suggest that at least 30 % relative light intenstity is necessary for satisfactory flowering of R. reticulatum (Fig. 19), 20 % in the case of R. kaempferi (Photo. 18, Fig. 21), and even 40 % is not adequate light for R. macrosepalum (Photo. 17, Table 4). The flower color becomes more pale under the darker condition, and the number of blooms decreases significantly with only 5 ï½ž 10 % reduction in the specified light levels. An anatomical survey revealed that the beginning of flower formation occurs between July 1 and July 8 (Fig. 22). Therefore, it is necessary that at least by the beginning of June the appropriate tree stand density must be provided in order to open the canopy. Furthermore, floor shrubs should be removed, except for Rhododendron. This ecological study suggests that abandoned secondary woodlands can be changed into desirable recreation forests by appropriate management as shown in table 7. By utilizing secondary woodlands for recreationl use, we can also conserve important parts of our rural landscape in Japan...|$|R
