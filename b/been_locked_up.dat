5|$|The Social Hall, {{also known}} as the Officers' Club, was a social club located on the northwestern side of the island. Located in {{proximity}} to the Power House, water tower and Former Military Chapel (Bachelor Quarters), it formerly housed the post exchange. The club was a social venue for the Federal Penitentiary workers and their families on the island to unwind after a hard week's work dealing with America's most hardened criminals after they'd <b>been</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> at 17:30. It was burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz in 1970, leaving a shell which still remains.|$|E
25|$|A mistake, however, {{prevented}} {{the move to}} the club: when the contract had been agreed, Dalglish realised {{they did not have}} the correct paperwork needed to complete the transfer. This was on a Friday afternoon, and the office had <b>been</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> for the weekend. With a verbal agreement in place, they agreed to meet on Monday morning to complete the transfer officially. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, hearing about the move, phoned Keane and asked whether he would like to join them instead of Blackburn. Ferguson ensured they had the paperwork ready and met up with Keane on the Saturday and signed for Manchester United for £3.75million, a British transfer record at the time.|$|E
500|$|Following the leak, Kravitz {{discussed}} {{the song in}} a video he uploaded to the social networking site Twitter. He confirmed that he had written, produced and played instruments on the song, as well as record it with Jackson. Kravitz stated {{that he was not}} responsible for the unofficial release, as his copy [...] "has <b>been</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> in a vault". He noted that the two DJs on the snippet were not involved in the recording process, stating, [...] "I don't know what their purpose is, but that person {{has nothing to do with}} the track." [...] Kravitz reflected that working with Jackson had been [...] "one of the most amazing musical experiences" [...] that he had ever had. [...] "It was done by two people who had respect for each other and who love music — that was it." [...] The singer-songwriter concluded that [...] "Another Day" [...] had not been mixed or completed but added that he hoped the full song would be released and heard [...] "the way me and Michael intended it to be".|$|E

500|$|According to Joseph, [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is thematically {{similar to}} [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] (1999) and [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), from the Destiny's Child era. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] celebrates showing off. Jon Pareles of The New York Times viewed {{the concept of}} the song as not merely having a nice {{wardrobe}} to entice men, but it also serves as [...] "a means of self-assertion." [...] In the song, the female protagonist pulls out her best dress to remind her potentially wandering mate of what he is leaving at home. Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly added that Beyoncé also seemingly gives professional advice to women on how to hold a man's attention in a long-term relationship. She sings: [...] "I think I'm ready/ <b>Been</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> in the house way too long / It's time to get it, cause once again he's out doing wrong [...] Wear very skimpy clothes...". Joseph commented that in the song, Beyoncé is capable of wearing anything to keep her man by her side rather than dumping him. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that after having skirted her best dress, Beyoncé eyes other guys in dance clubs to make her own man jealous, in the hope of regaining his attention but she also makes sure that he really pays when he does her wrong. Beyoncé later refers to her [...] "freakum dress" [...] in [...] "Jealous", a track from her fifth studio album Beyoncé (2013).|$|E

2500|$|Zero Time Dilemma is set {{between the}} events of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and [...] The game follows nine {{characters}} who have <b>been</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> in an underground nuclear bomb shelter and are forced to play a death game called the Decision Game, which is led by a masked person known as Zero. The shelter {{is divided into three}} wards, with three people placed in each section, making up three teams: C-Team, Q-Team, and D-Team. To get to the central elevator hall and escape, the characters need six passwords; one password is revealed each time one of them dies. The characters are all wearing watches that inject them with a drug every 90 minutes, inducing memory loss. Heavily involved in the game's lore is the many-worlds theory, where every decision made creates alternate universes where the opposite was chosen; these timelines make up the game's multiple routes.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the couple}} were still in France, King Edward had retaliated against Mortimer by taking Joan and all of their {{children}} into custody, and [...] "treating them with severity". In April 1324 Joan was removed from Hampshire {{where she had been}} confined in a lodging under house arrest and sent to Skipton Castle in Yorkshire; there she was imprisoned in a cell and endured considerable suffering and hardship. Most of her household had been dismissed and she was permitted a small number of attendants to serve her. She was granted just one mark per day for her necessities, and out of this sum she had to feed her servants. She was additionally allowed ten marks per annum at Easter and Michaelmas for new clothes. [...] Her daughters suffered worse privations having <b>been</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> inside various religious houses with even less money at their disposal. Joan was transferred from Skipton to Pontefract Castle in July 1326.|$|E
2500|$|The Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I, went a step further, {{creating}} enormous virtual triumphs {{that existed}} solely {{in the form}} of print. The Triumphs of Maximilian (begun in 1512 and unfinished at Maximilian's death in 1519) contains over 130 large woodcuts by Dürer and other artists, showing a huge procession (still in open country) culminating in the Emperor himself, mounted on a huge car. [...] The Triumphal Arch (1515), the largest print ever made, at 3.57 x 2.95 metres when the 192 sheets are assembled, was produced in an edition of seven hundred copies for distribution to friendly cities and princes. It was intended to be hand-coloured and then pasted to a wall. [...] Traditional tableau themes, including a large genealogy, and many figures of Virtues, are complemented by scenes of Maximilian's life and military victories. [...] Maximilian was wary of entries in person, having <b>been</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> by his loyal subjects in Bruges in 1488 for eleven weeks, until he could pay the bills from his stay.|$|E

2500|$|Between flops, it is true, I {{have come}} up with an {{occasional}} hit, but compared to a good boxer's record, for instance, my percentage has been lamentable. I fought a draw in my first fight, stupified everyone by winning the championship in my second, got a couple of wins with picture rights, then was knocked out three times in a row. Dragging my weary carcass to Hollywood, I was immediately knocked out again, won a big fight some six months later, then marked time for six years as an ordinary ham-and-beaner, picking up what I could. Suddenly I saw a chance and offered to fight for the world championship for a dollar. To everyone's astonishment, I won that championship and defended it successfully for a number of years, winning nine times by knockout, fighting three draws, losing twice and getting one no-decision in Europe. I have just come over to America for a fight, but it was called off at the last moment, one of the promoters having gone nuts and having to have <b>been</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up.</b> Why I'm not walking on my heels after all this, I don't know. Maybe I am walking on my heels. [...] It would be surprising if I weren't.|$|E
2500|$|The {{programming}} of {{the artificial}} intelligence for Elizabeth {{was considered a}} major technical challenge for Irrational, as they desired to give her as much near-human behavior in contrast to most other games where such companions are either highly scripted or given relatively simplistic pragmas to follow, and had little previous examples from other games to build on; Levine cited Half-Life 2s Alyx as the last [...] "great AI companion". Irrational had previously developed AI routines for the Big Daddies and Little Sisters in BioShock {{that would allow them}} to roam and interact with the environment if otherwise left alone by the player; these routines were the basis of building out improved behavior for Elizabeth. The developers had spent much time improving these routines to give Elizabeth her own tendencies to look and move around as a real actor instead of a robotic non-player character, as to re-enforce her central role to the player. To this, Levine explained that they looked to the banter between the main characters in the Uncharted series by Naughty Dog. [...] Levine praised the work that Naughty Dog had done, and felt he would be able to create the same with a more somber period piece. Some of Elizabeth's responses will be driven by a player's action (such as the aforementioned horse recovery scene), but other times, Elizabeth's actions will be on her own in response to the environment. Much of Columbia was seeded [...] "room by room" [...] with elements that Elizabeth will be interested in, comment on, and react to. However, as for the player not missing these elements, such actions would only be performed based on a number of factors, including whether the player was near and looking at Elizabeth, and the current tension of the game. This apparent curiosity serendipitously worked with Elizabeth's story, who after having <b>been</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> for twelve years would be eager to see new things. Elizabeth's AI also monitors and tracks the player's behavior over time, such that the AI will attempt to predict when the player is moving and keep Elizabeth out of the line of fire. Programming Elizabeth's AI was a significant challenge to the Irrational team, and at several points during development the suggestion of cutting her from the game was brought up. Levine countered these suggestions, insisting on keeping her in the game. To manage this, a multidisciplinary subgroup called the [...] "Liz Squad" [...] reviewed the levels designed by others to assure that the presence of Elizabeth was accounted for across the game and to avoid situations where the level would delegate the character to simply hiding in a closet. On March 15, 2013, the full voice cast was announced by Irrational Games.|$|E
