25|$|Welles {{was placed}} on the U.S. Treasury payroll on May 15, 1944, as an expert {{consultant}} {{for the duration of the}} war, with a retainer of $1 a year. On the recommendation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau asked Welles to lead the Fifth War Loan Drive, which opened June 12 with a one-hour radio show on all four networks, broadcast from Texarkana, Texas. Including a statement by the President, the program defined the causes of the war and encouraged Americans <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> $16 billion <b>in</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> finance the Normandy landings and the most violent phase of World War II. Welles produced additional war loan drive broadcasts on June 14 from the Hollywood Bowl, and June 16 from Soldier Field, Chicago. Americans purchased $20.6 billion <b>in</b> War <b>Bonds</b> during the Fifth War Loan Drive, which ended on July 8, 1944.|$|R
40|$|Heads — you win; tails — I lose. ” Such is {{the message}} the Fed sends <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> speculators. But why would the Fed offer such a stupid wager? Read on. The Fed is trying <b>to</b> bribe <b>bond</b> speculators with risk-free profits. That’s how the Treasury/Fed check-kiting {{conspiracy}} makes sure that {{there will always be}} plenty of buyers for government debt, regardless of the size of offering. Ten years ago I started writing about my theory that, wittingly or unwittingly, the Fed has become the quartermaster general of the coming deflation and depression. I offered a logical, closely argued reasoning for this thesis. My argument {{had to do with the}} contention that the open market operations of the Fed make bond speculation risk-free, which explains the perpetual bull market <b>in</b> <b>bonds.</b> Bond speculators, knowing that the Fed must needs <b>buy</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> keep the money supply growing, front-run (or, to use the old-fashioned term: pre-empt) the Fed’s open market operations. They buy the bonds beforehand, and pocket risk-free profits when they sell them to the Fed. Speculators will allow the <b>bond</b> price <b>to</b> fall only so much. Then they show up as buyers for another ride of the escalator upstairs. Incidentally, my theory also gives the coup-de-grâce to Keynesian and Friedmanit...|$|R
40|$|Thank {{you very}} much for the time, {{attention}} and care you devoted to examine my paper. I certainly shall correct the mistakes you mentioned in your note on Minor Points. Thank you for pointing this out. Regarding your main concern, I give my response to your points below. I print the passages of your report I comment on in bold and give my notes on these as normal text. In Schlichts words "the present value of the households lifetime income has increased by switching from a pay-as-you-go regime to a debt regime [...] . As the value of their lifetime income stream has increased, they could have afforded higher expenditure. " The problem with this statement is that the disposable income only increases because households are saving (buying government bonds). Yes. They do so because they are assumed to hold Barro expectations (that “rearrangements of the timing of taxes – as implied by budget deficits – have no first-order effect on the economy, ” [Barro, 1989, 51]). They therefore think that they have <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> use them for paying future taxes that they (wrongly) think are inevitable because the debt must be repaid. The debt trajectory – households asset trajectory – is endogenous to the household maximization problem. I agree, but Barro expectations rule that out. They imply no behavioral change if the government runs into debt when lowering taxes while keeping expenditure unchanged. The reason is that it is asserted that the government’s budget constraint would be violated without tax increases. My example shows {{that this is not the}} case. Thus, the constraint is not (1 + i) −t ct ≤ ∑ (1 + i) −t (Yt − Tt + i Dt) but (1 + i) −t ct ≤ ∑ (1 + i) −t (Yt − Tt) (1) Here I disagree. The households can spent their interest income if they wish. But let us assume that this is the correct budget constraint. Consider my case that the households are not satiated and exhaust their budget, and take your ct as my privat...|$|R
5000|$|After 400 {{years of}} Spanish rule, Puerto Rico was handed over {{as a war}} prize to the U.S. after the {{negotiations}} {{that led to the}} drafting of the Treaty of Paris in 1898. As U.S. investors began to settle on the land, serious vulnerabilities in the social and economic structures of Puerto Rico’s agricultural economy began to arise, the repercussions of which would be evident in the years to come. Hurricane San Ciriaco of 1899 killed over 3,400 Puerto Ricans and destroyed many important export crops, especially coffee. (Schwartz 1992) Shortly thereafter, while neglecting to provide any meaningful form of hurricane disaster relief, the U.S. set up the American Colonial Bank and converted the Puerto Rican peso to the American dollar and devalued the currency by 40%. (Davis 2015)  The Foraker Act of 1900 made Puerto Rico subject to U.S. Federal law by establishing a civil government appointed by the U.S. President. This act prohibited Puerto Rico from negotiating trade treaties with any foreign country or setting its own tariffs or import/export regulations. In 1917, the Jones Act imposed a civil administration with new import and export taxes and regulations. Key to this legislation is the implementation of triple-tax exempt municipal bonds. This means that the interest on municipal bonds are not subject to federal, local or state taxes, causing the economically desperate government of Puerto Rico <b>to</b> flock <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> finance public services. The Jones Act also forced U.S. citizenship onto all Puerto Ricans, but disallowed Puerto Ricans living on the island the ability to vote in U.S. presidential or congressional elections. This institutionally implemented structural dependency is reinforced in 1952 when the Puerto Rican government constructs its own constitution, officially deeming the island the Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (literally [...] "Associated Free State of Puerto Rico") also known as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Unlike the “Free State” name may seem to suggest, this did not give Puerto Rico any significant political and socio-economic autonomy that stands apart from the U.S. powers that control the territory. In fact, the constitution openly supports this unspoken exploitative economic code, containing language that limits fiscal ‘misbehavior’ by suggesting that the islands’s public debt must be prioritized before other spending for basic public services occurs.
