25|$|Dick Whittington is an {{apprentice}} to the draper Fitzwarren whose daughter Alice {{he is in}} love with. After an argument with his master, Whittington flees the shop in company of his cat Thomas. Alice and the cook Dorothy track him down in Highgate where he is sleeping {{on the street with}} his cat as a pillow. Dick goes on the run again pursued across rooftops by a strange police patrol. He embarks on the sailing ship Z. 10 owned by Fitzwarren under the captain <b>Bobstay.</b> In the second act the ship has set in on the exotic island of Bambouli with temples and sacred gardens where Whittington and others witness a grand procession of the local ruler. Employed at the court Dick gains swift promotion thanks to the attentions of Princess Hirvaia, although he remains faithful to Alice. Whittington becomes rich by ridding the island of all its rats {{with the help of his}} cat. The third act, after a pastoral interlude, is back in London, where the cat guides Dick to Alice's house. Now a rich man, Whittington can marry Alice. Kind Edward the third receives him at Westminster Hall and names him Lord Mayor of London, and the opera ends with a grand Lord mayoral procession.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} a handful of {{boatswain}}s and boatswain's mates in literature. The boatswain in William Shakespeare's The Tempest is a central character in the opening scene, which takes place aboard a ship at sea, and appears again briefly in the final scene. Typhoon by Joseph Conrad has a nameless boatswain who tells Captain MacWhirr of a [...] "lump" [...] of men going overboard during {{the peak of the}} storm. [...] Also, the character Bill <b>Bobstay</b> in Gilbert and Sullivan's musical comedy H.M.S. Pinafore is alternatively referred to as a [...] "bos'un" [...] and a [...] "boatswain's mate." [...] Another boatswain from literature is Smee from Peter Pan. [...] Lord Byron had a Newfoundland dog named Boatswain. Byron wrote the famous poem [...] "Epitaph to a Dog" [...] and had a monument made for him at Newstead Abbey.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Pratt {{joined the}} D'Oyly Carte Opera Company {{in the chorus}} in September 1945, {{at the age of}} 22. [...] He began to play small roles with the company in 1947, {{including}} Go-To in The Mikado. [...] In the 194849 season, he became second understudy to Martyn Green and continued to play several of the smaller roles, including Bouncer in Cox and Box, Bill <b>Bobstay</b> in H.M.S. Pinafore and Major Murgatroyd in Patience. He got his big break when he was called upon to play Robin Oakapple in Ruddigore on short notice in May 1949 (and several of the other [...] "patter" [...] roles that summer), when both Green and the principal understudy fell ill. He was soon given the primary understudy responsibilities, filling in for most of the comic [...] "patter" [...] roles, as well as playing several of the other smaller roles from time to time.|$|E

Pinafore, Samuel in The Pirates of Penzance, Second Yeoman in The Yeomen of the Guard, and Antonio in The Gondoliers, {{eventually}} understudying 26 roles. The next season, he took over the principal role of Captain Corcoran in H.M.S. Pinafore and substituted for the ailing Alan Styler as Cox in Cox and Box, the Counsel in Trial by Jury and Grosvenor in Patience. [...] He also appeared once as Old Adam Goodheart in Ruddigore and soon began to play the Lieutenant of the Tower in The Yeomen of the Guard. Adams also began to fill in for the ageing Darrell Fancourt, who missed an increasing number of performances, as the Pirate King in Pirates, Colonel Calverley in Patience, the Earl of Mountararat in Iolanthe, the title role in The Mikado and Sir Roderic Murgatroyd in Ruddigore.|$|E
60|$|A cracked bell rang. Clean {{and sharp}} (beautifully grained, too), a {{bowsprit}} surged over our starboard bow, the <b>bobstay</b> confidentially hooking itself into our forward rail.|$|E
6000|$|... 267 surged quickly {{under my}} feet, as the {{pressure}} of the downward-bearing <b>bobstay</b> was removed. Half-a-dozen men of the foc'sle had already thrown out fenders, and stood by to bear off a just visible bulwark.|$|E
6000|$|... "Too many. You {{observe that}} her top-gallant masts are fidded abaft; {{none of her}} lofty sails set flying; and then, Madam, she has {{depended}} on <b>bobstays</b> and gammonings {{for the security of}} that very important part of a vessel, the bowsprit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too true! too true!" [...] said Mrs de Lacey, {{in a sort}} of {{professional}} horror. [...] "These things had escaped me; but I see them all, now they are mentioned.

Really, Mrs Wyllys, I can never consent that my niece should embark in such a vessel." ...|$|R

Put her before the wind and sea, and hove about twenty-five tons of cargo {{overboard}} to lighten the ship forward. Slung myself in a bowline, and by means of thrusting 2 1/2-inch rope in the opening, contrived to stop a great portion of the leak.|$|R
5000|$|On January 20, 1893, Ice Boat No. 3 {{arrived at}} the Delaware Breakwater with the Reading Railroad steamer Panther in tow, which had {{experienced}} continual westerly winds and snowstorms since departing Newburyport, Massachusetts ten days earlier. Some weeks later, {{on the night of}} 7 February, Ice Boat No. 3 was towing the ship Standard past the Delaware Breakwater when the towing hawser broke, propelling the Standard into the Italian bark Giovanni anchored at the Breakwater and damaging the latter vessel to the amount of $4,000. The captain of Giovanni sued the City of Philadelphia for damages and won the ensuing court case, with the master of the ice boat found to have exercised [...] "gross carelessness" [...] for failing to see the Giovanni in time, and for his [...] "sudden veering" [...] manoeuvre which caused the hawser to catch on Standards <b>bobstays</b> and snap.|$|R
5000|$|The Preu√üen was steel-built with a {{waterline}} {{length of}} 124 m {{and a total}} hull length of 132 m. The hull was 16.4 m wide and the ship had a displacement of 11150 LT, for an effective carrying capacity of 8000 LT. The five masts were fully rigged, with courses, upper and lower topsails, upper and lower topgallant sails, and royals. Counting staysails, she carried 47 sails (30 square sails in six storeys, 12 staysails between the five masts, four foresails (jibs) and a small fore-and-aft spanker) with a total sail area of 6806 m2 (according to other sources 5560 m2, which probably refer to the square sail area only). Not only the hull was steel: masts (lower and top mast were made in one piece) and spars (yard, spanker boom) were constructed of steel tubing, {{and most of the}} rigging was steel cable. All <b>bobstays</b> between jibboom and bow were made of massive steel rods and chains. The only wooden spar was the gaff of the small spanker. The hoistable yards were equipped with special shoes to slide in rails riveted to the masts. [...] "Jarvis' Patent" [...] brace winches for the lower and top-sail yards were mounted before each of the five masts. The fall winches were of [...] "Hall's Patent".|$|R
60|$|The craft, {{being under}} reduced sail, drove along more easily {{during the rest}} of the afternoon, and they ran into a little {{colliery}} town on the following day. There Vane replaced the broken <b>bobstay</b> with a solid piece of steel, and then sat down to write a letter, while Carroll stretched his cramped limbs ashore.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} {{half an hour}} before all was clear, and the last of the yachts in the race had passed them before the leeward sheet of the {{foresail}} was hauled aft, and the Phantom resumed her course. As soon as she did so, the captain came aft with part of the copper bar of the <b>bobstay.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] he shouted. [...] "Help!" [...] A {{few seconds}} later {{the light of a}} lantern was flashed down upon him. Then a figure crawled out on the spar {{projecting}} above his head, seized him by the collar, and lifted him from the <b>bobstay</b> to which he was clinging on to the bowsprit. A minute later he was standing on the deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, {{my dearest}} niece," [...] {{concluded}} the relict of the Rear-Admiral, after exhausting her breath, and her store of wisdom, in numberless exhortations {{to be careful}} of her health, to write often to repeat the actual words of her private message to her brother the General, to keep below in gales of wind, to be particular in the account of any extraordinary sight she might have the good fortune to behold in the passage, and, in short, in all other matters likely to grow out of such a leave-taking [...] "and now, my dearest niece, I commit you to the mighty deep, and One far mightier--to Him who made it. Banish from your thoughts all recollections of any thing you may have heard concerning the imperfections of the 'Royal Caroline;' for the opinion of the aged seaman, who sailed with the lamented Admiral, assures me they are all founded in mistake." [...] ["The treacherous villain!" [...] muttered Wilder.] [...] "Who spoke?" [...] said Mrs de Lacey; but, receiving no reply, she continued; [...] "His opinion is also exactly in accordance with my own, on more mature reflection. To be sure, it is a culpable neglect to depend on <b>bobstays</b> and gammonings for the security of the bowsprit, but still even this is an oversight which, as my old friend has just told me, may be remedied by 'preventers and lashings.' I have written a note to the Master,--Gertrude, my dear, be careful ever to call the Master of the ship Mister Nichols; for none, but such as bear his Majesty's commission, are entitled to be termed Captains; it is an honourable station, and should always be treated with reverence, it being, in fact, next in rank to a flag-officer,--I have written a note to the Master on the subject, and he will see the neglect repaired and so, my love, God bless you; take the best possible care of yourself; write me by even opportunity; remember my kindest love to your father and be very minute in your description of the whales." ...|$|R
60|$|It was impossible, however, {{when the}} {{bowsprit}} and <b>bobstay</b> were brought on board, {{that the crew}} should have failed to notice the break in the bar, and the news {{that there had been}} foul play had at once been passed round. Seeing the angry faces of the men, and the animated talk forward, Frank told the captain to call all hands aft.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am English, sir. I was {{on board}} a fishing boat in the channel when we were run down by one of those privateers in the dark. I believe the {{fisherman}} with me was drowned, but I clung to the <b>bobstay</b> and was got on board. She {{was on her way}} out here and had no opportunity of landing me. She only arrived here two days before you came up." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{appearance}} of the Osprey as she sailed into the anchorage, without topmast or bowsprit, excited great attention; {{and many of the}} yachtsmen came on board to inquire how the disaster had happened. To save going through the story a score of times, Frank had the broken pieces of the <b>bobstay</b> bar brought up and laid on the deck near the tiller, and in reply to inquiries simply pointed to them, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was a quick}} snap, {{followed}} by a crash. The steel weather-rigging carried away at the lanyards, and mast, jib, mainsail, blocks, stays, sea-anchor, French Pete--everything--went over the side. Almost by a miracle, the captain clutched at the <b>bobstay</b> and managed to get one hand {{up and over the}} bowsprit. The boys ran forward to drag him into safety, and Red Nelson, observing the disaster, put up his helm and ran down to the rescue.|$|E
60|$|As the Topaz {{was coming}} out of the port of Havana, homeward bound, and just as she was abreast of the Moro, the brig carried away her <b>bobstay.</b> I was busy in helping to unreeve the stay, when I was seized with sudden and violent cramps. This attack proved to be the cholera, which came near {{carrying}} me off. The captain had me taken aft, where I was attended with the greatest care. God be praised for his mercy! I got well, though scarcely able to do any more duty before we got in.|$|E
60|$|Never, in {{the history}} of that or any other kingdom, were priests kept so busy as those in this city. They worked as hard as they could, but at three o'clock they were obliged to {{commence}} marrying the folks by squads; and so, before suppertime, there was not a bachelor or maid in the whole city,--excepting an old <b>bobstay</b> spinner,--one of the crossest of old maids, who hated men so much that she had not spoken to one for forty years; and a crabbed bachelor, who despised women so completely that he never had his clothes washed, because {{it would have to be}} done by females.|$|E
60|$|She had swung round, beam to wind, when he feebly {{clutched}} her rail amidships. For {{a few moments}} he held on; he had now to solve the difficulty of getting on board. As she drifted, his body trailed out away from her, {{and he could not}} get his knees against the planking. Even if he were able to do so, he had not the strength to lift himself on deck; and there was no rope hanging over that he could seize. Then he thought of the wire <b>bobstay</b> that ran down {{from the end of the}} bowsprit and was fastened to the stem near the waterline. He must try to reach it and climb on that way. He cautiously moved his hands along the rail; for if they slipped off, he might not be able to get hold again.|$|E
60|$|Some of the excursionists {{had left}} {{at a much}} earlier hour. Four {{strapping}} youths, with guides, had {{set out for the}} summit of Mont Blanc; a mingled party of ladies, gentlemen, guides, and mules, were on the point of starting to visit the Mer de Glace; a delicate student, unable for long excursions, was preparing to visit with his sister, the Glacier des Bossons. Others were going, or had gone, to the source of the Arveiron, and to the Brevent, while the British peer, having previously been conducted by a new and needlessly difficult path to the top of Monte Rosa, was led off by his persecutor to attempt, by an impossible route, to scale the Matterhorn--to reach the main-truck, as Captain Wopper put it, by going down the stern-post along the keel, over the <b>bobstay,</b> up the flyin' jib, across the foretopmast-stay, and up the maintop-gallant halyards. This at least was Lewis Stoutley's report of the Captain's remark. We cannot answer for its correctness.|$|E
60|$|On {{trying to}} strike out, Geoffrey found {{that as he}} had been knocked {{overboard}} he had struck his right knee severely against the rail of the vessel, and was at present unable to use that leg. Fearful of being run down by one of the great ships, and still more of being caught between two of them as they rolled, he looked round to try to get sight of an English ship in the throng. Then, seeing that he was entirely surrounded by Spaniards, he left the spar and swam as well as he could to the bow of a great ship close beside him, and grasping a rope trailing from the bowsprit, managed by its aid to climb up until he reached the <b>bobstay,</b> across which he seated himself {{with his back to the}} stem. The position was a precarious one, and after a time he gained the wooden carved work above, and obtained a seat there just below the bowsprit, and hidden from the sight of those on deck a few feet above him. As he knew the vessels were drifting to leeward towards the shoals, he hoped to remain hidden until the vessel struck, and then to gain the shore.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{scrambled}} forward {{through the}} water and loosed the peak-halyard. The head of the sail swung down and blew out to leeward, banging threateningly, and {{he saw that the}} half-lowered topsail hung beneath it. This promised to complicate matters; but Moran was already endeavoring to change the jib for a smaller one, and Jimmy sprang to his assistance. Though the sail was not linked to a masthead stay, it would not run in; and when Bethune luffed the boat into the wind, the loose canvas swept across the bows, swelling like a balloon and emptying with a shock that threatened to snap the straining mast. It was obvious to the men who knelt in the water dragging frantically at a rope that something drastic must be done; but both were drenched and half blinded and had been suddenly roused from sleep. The boat was large enough to make her gear heavy to handle, and yet not so large as to obviate the need for urgent haste when struck with all her canvas set by a savage squall. Though they recognized this, Jimmy and his comrade paused a few moments to gather breath. The jib, however, must be hauled down; and with a hoarse shout to Moran, Jimmy lowered himself from the bowsprit until he felt the wire <b>bobstay</b> under his feet.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the fairway}} of the {{entrance}} the flagship Trenton still held on. Her rudder was broken, her wheel carried away; within she was flooded with water from the peccant hawse-pipes; she had just made the signal [...] "fires extinguished," [...] and lay helpless, awaiting the inevitable end. Between this melancholy hulk and the external reef Kane must find a path. Steering within fifty yards of the reef (for which she was actually headed) and her foreyard passing {{on the other hand}} over the Trenton's quarter as she rolled, the Calliope sheered between the rival dangers, came to the wind triumphantly, and was once more pointed for the sea and safety. Not often in naval history was there a moment of more sickening peril, and it was dignified by one of those incidents that reconcile the chronicler with his otherwise abhorrent task. From the doomed flagship the Americans hailed the success of the English with a cheer. It was led by the old admiral in person, rang out over the storm with holiday vigour, and was answered by the Calliopes with an emotion easily conceived. This ship of their kinsfolk was almost the last external object seen from the Calliope for hours; immediately after, the mists closed about her till the morrow. She was safe at sea again--una de multis--with a damaged foreyard, and a loss of all the ornamental work about her bow and stern, three anchors, one kedge-anchor, fourteen lengths of chain, four boats, the jib-boom, <b>bobstay,</b> and bands and fastenings of the bowsprit.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{towards the}} end of September in 1832, that's just forty years ago now, that I went out with my father and three hands in the smack, the Flying Dolphin. I'd been at sea with father off and on ever since I was about nine years old, and a smarter boy wasn't to be found on the beach. The Dolphin was a good sea boat, but she wasn't, so to say, fast, and I dunno' as she was much to look at, for the old man wasn't the sort of chap to chuck away his money in paint or in new sails as long as the old ones could be pieced and patched so as to hold the wind. We sailed out pretty nigh over to the French coast, and good sport we had. We'd been out two days when we turned her head homewards. The wind was blowing pretty strong, and the old man remarked, he thought we was in for a gale. There was some talk of our running in to Calais and waiting till it had blown itself out, but the fish might have spoil before the Wind dropped, so we made up our minds to run {{straight}} into Dover and send the fish up from there. The night came on wild and squally, and as dark as pitch. It might be about eight bells, and I and one of the other hands had turned in, when father gave a sudden shout down the hatch, 'All hands on deck.' I was next to the steps and sprang up 'em. Just as I got to the top something grazed my face. I caught at it, not knowing what it was, and the next moment there was a crash, and the Dolphin went away from under my feet. I clung for bare life, scarce awake yet nor knowing what had happened. The next moment I was under water. I still held on to the rope and was soon out again. By this time I was pretty well awake to what had happened. A ship running down channel had walked clean over the poor old Dolphin, and I had got hold of the <b>bobstay.</b> It took me some time to climb up on to the bowsprit, for every time she pitched I went under water. However, I got up at last and swarmed along the bowsprit and got on board. There was a chap sitting down fast asleep there. I walked aft to the helmsman. Two men were pacing up and down in front of him. 'You're a nice lot, you are,' I said, 'to go running down Channel at ten knots an hour without any watch, a-walking over ships and a-drowning of seamen. I'll have the law of ye, see if I don't.' ...|$|E
