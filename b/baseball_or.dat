5|$|Chesbro's 1904 {{record for}} games {{won in a}} season (41 wins) has stood for over a century—one of the oldest major records in <b>baseball,</b> <b>or</b> in any other sport. Under current playing practices, his record is unbreakable. Chesbro started 51 games that season (plus 4 relief appearances) and pitched 48 {{complete}} games, for a record of 41–12. Today, it is uncommon for a pitcher to start even 35 games in a season and complete games are a rarity. The only other 40-win season since 1900 was 40 by Ed Walsh in 1908, and only three other pitchers {{in the modern era}} have won as many as 35--Christy Mathewson (37 in 1908), Walter Johnson (36 in 1913) and Joe McGinnity (35 in 1904). Since the pitcher's mound was lowered to its current height of 10 inches in 1969, no pitcher has won more than 27 games in a season.|$|E

25|$|Catcher is a {{position}} for a <b>baseball</b> <b>or</b> softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, {{in front of the}} (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher {{is similar to that of}} the wicket-keeper in cricket.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{management}} {{announced in}} February 2006 {{that it had}} extended Scully's contract through the 2008 baseball season for about $3 million per year. For health reasons, beginning around 2005, Scully no longer called most non-playoff games played east of Phoenix. Exceptions to this rule were the 2007 opening series in Milwaukee, a series against the Chicago Cubs in 2007, a series against the Boston Red Sox in 2010, and the series in Australia against the Diamondbacks that opened the 2014 baseball season. He was also not normally scheduled to announce Dodgers games (on either radio or TV) that were televised by ESPN on Sunday Night <b>Baseball</b> <b>or</b> by Fox on the Saturday Game of the Week.|$|E
25|$|All-you-can-eat seats, {{also called}} {{all-inclusive}} sections, are blocs {{of seats in}} a Major League <b>Baseball</b> <b>or</b> Minor League Baseball park in which seat holders are entitled to unlimited hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, peanuts, soft drinks, and bottled water before and during a game. Typically located in less desirable areas of the ballpark, such as the bleachers and upper decks, all-you-can-eat (AYCE) seats are priced approximately 50% higher than seats in the same section, but are viewed by patrons as a bargain considering the added cost of ballpark food. The first AYCE section was introduced at Dodger Stadium in 2007. The trend spread to 19 of the 30 major league parks by 2010 and numerous minor league parks by 2012. In 2008 AYCE seats were also inaugurated in numerous NBA and NHL arenas and at several NASCAR tracks.|$|E

25|$|All committees' ballots {{now include}} 10 candidates. While there was {{previously}} a one-year waiting period after elimination from annual BBWAA consideration, {{there is now}} no waiting period. At least one committee convenes each December {{as part of the}} election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early <b>Baseball</b> <b>or</b> Golden Days committee meets. This means that in the next two 5-year cycles, the Today's Game committee (having met in 2016) will meet in 2018, 2021, and 2023, while the Modern Baseball committee will meet in 2017, 2019, 2022 and 2024. Additionally, the Hall of Fame has modified the criteria under which active executives can be considered for induction. All active executives age 70 or older may now have their careers reviewed as part of the Era Committee balloting process, regardless of the position they hold in an organization, and regardless of whether their body of work has been completed. Previously, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.|$|E
500|$|Born in the Philadelphia suburb Havertown, Pennsylvania, Donaghy {{attended}} Cardinal O'Hara High School in Springfield, Pennsylvania {{along with}} three other NBA referees: Joe Crawford, Mike Callahan, and Ed Malloy. In 1989, Donaghy graduated from Villanova University {{with a degree in}} sales and marketing. [...] While at Villanova, he played on the school's baseball team. According to the National Basketball Referee's Association, Donaghy participated and earned All-Catholic and All-Delaware County honors in baseball and All-Delaware County honors in basketball during high school, but then–Villanova baseball coach George Bennett contends that Donaghy did not play on the varsity team and that no records indicate that he was selected to the All-Catholic team in <b>baseball</b> <b>or</b> named to the All-Delaware County basketball team. Donaghy and his wife Kimberly had four daughters before terminating their 12-year marriage in 2007.|$|E

[...] Because Corsicana's blue laws forbade Sunday <b>baseball</b> (<b>or,</b> according to The Sporting News, due to poor attendance in Corsicana), the game was played in Ennis, Texas, in a facility that has a right field fence estimated to be 210 feet from home plate along the foul line. [...] While some cast doubt on Clarke's eight home run game, the feat was later attested to by the official scorer (under oath) and by others who observed the game.

500|$|The name of {{the team}} was at first left up to Brown, who {{rejected}} calls {{for it to be}} christened the Browns. McBride then held a contest to name the team in May 1945; [...] "Cleveland Panthers" [...] was the winning choice, but Brown rejected it because it was the name of an earlier failed football team. [...] "That old Panthers team failed", Brown said. [...] "I want no part of that name." [...] In August, McBride gave in to popular demand and christened the team the Browns, despite Paul Brown's objections. With the roster fixed and the team's name chosen, Brown set out to build a dynasty. [...] "I want to be what the New York Yankees are in <b>baseball</b> <b>or</b> Ben Hogan is in golf", he said.|$|E
500|$|The more {{formally}} structured National League {{was founded}} in 1876. As the oldest surviving major league, the National League is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "senior circuit." [...] Several other major leagues formed and failed. In 1884, African American Moses Walker (and, briefly, his brother Welday) played in one of these, the American Association. An injury ended Walker's major league career, and by the early 1890s, a gentlemen's agreement {{in the form of the}} baseball color line effectively barred black players from the white-owned professional leagues, major and minor. Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded. Several independent African American teams succeeded as barnstormers. Also in 1884, overhand pitching was legalized. In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor <b>baseball</b> <b>or</b> indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game. Virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by 1893; the last major change—counting foul balls as strikes—was instituted in 1901. The National League's first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved from the minor Western League, was established that year. The two leagues, each with eight teams, were rivals that fought for the best players, often disregarding each other's contracts and engaging in bitter legal disputes.|$|E

2500|$|A batting helmet is the {{protective}} headgear worn by batters {{in the game}} of <b>baseball</b> <b>or</b> softball. It is meant to protect the batter's head from errant pitches thrown by the pitcher. A batter who is [...] "hit by pitch", due to an inadvertent wild pitch or a pitcher's purposeful attempt to hit him, may be seriously, even fatally, injured. In 1905, a New York Giants (the team now known as the San Francisco Giants) baseball player named Roger Bresnahan, after missing thirty days of the baseball season and lying in a hospital bed due to a head injury (or beaning), created, with assistance from the A.J. Reach Company, a crude, leather, vertically sliced football helmet over his cap that is considered to be the first batting helmet. The headgear was unpopular, even with Bresnahan at the time, and it wasn't until the mid-1950s that his idea was accepted.|$|E
2500|$|The leave {{clearance}} registration process, {{dubbed the}} [...] "loyalty questionnaire" [...] by inmates, was another {{significant source of}} discontent among incarcerated Japanese Americans. Originally drafted as a War Department recruiting tool, the 28 questions were hastily, and poorly, revised for their new purpose of assessing inmate loyalty. The form was largely devoted to determining whether the respondent was a [...] "real" [...] American — <b>baseball</b> <b>or</b> judo, Boy Scouts or Japanese school — {{but most of the}} ire was directed at two questions that asked inmates to volunteer for combat duty and forswear their allegiance to the Emperor of Japan. Many were offended at being asked to risk their lives for a country that had imprisoned them, and believed the question of allegiance was an implicit accusation that they had been disloyal to the United States. Although most answered in the affirmative to both, 15 percent of the total inmate population refused to fill out the questionnaire or answered [...] "no" [...] to one or both questions. Under pressure from War Department officials, Myer reluctantly converted Tule Lake into a maximum security segregation center for the [...] "no-nos" [...] who flunked the loyalty test, in July 1943.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there is}} {{considerable}} evidence to dispute this claim. Baseball historian George B. Kirsch has described {{the results of the}} Mills Commission as a [...] "myth". He wrote, [...] "Robert Henderson, Harold Seymour, and other scholars have since debunked the Doubleday-Cooperstown myth, which nonetheless remains powerful in the American imagination because of the efforts of Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown." [...] At his death, Doubleday left many letters and papers, none of which describe <b>baseball</b> <b>or</b> give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person {{in the evolution of the}} game, and his New York Times obituary did not mention the game at all. Chairman Mills himself, who had been a Civil War colleague of Doubleday and a member of the honor guard for Doubleday's body as it lay in state in New York City, never recalled hearing Doubleday describe his role as the inventor. Doubleday was a cadet at West Point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from Cooperstown the prior year. Furthermore, the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to Doubleday was that of Abner Graves, whose credibility is questionable; a few years later, he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life. Part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in Cooperstown in 1839.|$|E
