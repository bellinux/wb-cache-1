50|$|The labels {{have evolved}} to have {{barcodes}} that can be read by tape libraries.

50|$|Organizations face a {{significant}} challenge {{to track the}} location, quantity, condition, maintenance and depreciation status of their fixed assets. A popular approach to tracking fixed assets uses serial numbered asset tags, which are labels often with bar codes for easy and accurate reading.

5000|$|In 2007, USPTO {{announced}} {{new regulations}} under 37 CFR (published August 21, 2007) that would significantly alter procedures regarding continuation application before the USPTO. Previously, USPTO rules allowed an inventor to file as many continuations {{as necessary to}} get desired breadth of claims. The procedure was criticized for creating uncertainty {{as to what is}} covered or could be covered by a given patent application. An inventor, for example, could have sought to get claims with limited scope approved early, and then continue to file continuations over many years seeking broader coverage. For example, inventor Jerome H. Lemelson filed a series of continuations over thirty years to get a very broad patent on <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>readers.</b> This patent was issued in 1984, long after <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>readers</b> had {{become an integral part of}} the U.S. economy. Jerome Lemelson was then able to collect over a billion dollars in license fees from large companies using <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>readers.</b> (Note however that the Lemelson optical recognition patents followed the old 17-year rule. For patents filed 8-June-1995 or later under the TRIPS agreement, continuation patents expire 20 years from the date of filing of the parent patent application. Thus, Lemelson's [...] "submarine patents" [...] strategy is no longer possible.) ...|$|R
50|$|One {{feature the}} EOS-1N (and previous/subsequent '1' models) lacks, which lower {{models in the}} range have, is {{built-in}} flash, intentionally omitted to provide an overall very rigid camera body able to withstand severe treatment by professionals. Weather sealing was incorporated after feedback from working professionals. Other notable omissions are the eye-controlled focus feature of the EOS 5 and the <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>reader</b> of the EOS 10, neither of which are professional-level cameras.|$|E
50|$|The 32 {{kilobyte}} {{read-only memory}} of the Model 100 contains the N82 version of the Microsoft BASIC 80 programming language. This is similar to other Microsoft BASICs {{of the time and}} includes good support for the hardware features of the machine: pixel addressing of the display, support for the internal modem and serial port, monophonic sound, access to tape and RAM files, support for the real-time clock and the <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>reader,</b> and I/O redirection between the machine's various logical devices. Like previous Microsoft BASIC interpreters, variable names were restricted to two characters and all program lines and subroutines were numbered and not named. However, the default for floating point numbers is double-precision.|$|E
50|$|In most European countries, cheques are now rarely used, {{even for}} third party payments. In these countries, it is {{standard}} practice for businesses to publish their bank details on invoices, {{to facilitate the}} receipt of payments by giro. Even before the introduction of online banking, it has been possible in some countries to make payments to third parties using ATMs, which may accurately and rapidly capture invoice amounts, due dates, and payee bank details via a <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>reader</b> to reduce keying. In some countries, entering the bank account number results in the bank revealing {{the name of the}} payee as an added safeguard against fraud. In using a cheque, the onus is on the payee to initiate the payment, whereas with a giro transfer, the onus is on the payer to effect the payment (The writer of a paper cheque is pushing on a rope: he cannot force money out of his own account and into the destination's account. By writing the paper cheque, he is handing {{the far end of the}} rope to the payee, who will pull in his own good time. In contrast, giro is more akin to wire transfer, in that the payer pushes his money away towards the payee). The process is also procedurally more simple, as no cheques are ever posted, can claim to have been posted, or need banking or clearance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{demonstrates}} the functional elements of an automated sorting system {{by using a}} <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>reader</b> (BCR). The adaptability of <b>Bar</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Reader</b> (BCR) is destined for {{the recognition of the}} destination code through the bar code available in the parcel and sorting them accordingly. A parcel usually comes with a consignment number with a set of bar code representing them. The destination code must also be included in the bar code set, so as to enable the recognition of the destination by the <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>reader.</b> The process of sorting can be continued by using a timed rolling system which will be in the conveyer belt as a cross member which will drop down the parcel to the destination box. There must be separate sorting system for incoming and outgoing parcels to avoid complications...|$|E

40|$|The Holdup Measurement System II (HMSII) {{software}} is a database management package for doing Holdup Measurements. It {{is based on}} the generalized geometry holdup (GGH) methodology taught in the US Department of Energy Safeguards Technology Training Program, ``Nondestructive Assay of Special Nuclear Materials Holdup. `` This program was developed and taught by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The HMSII was developed as a joint effort between LANL and the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant, managed for the US Department of Energy by Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, Inc. The system is designed specifically for use with three types of Multichannel Analyzer (MCA) : a Davidson Portable MultiChannel Analyzer (MCA); a EG&G Ortec MicroNOMAD ({mu}NOMAD); or a new Miniature Modular MultiChannel Analyzer (M{sup 3 }CA) under development at LANL. It is also designed assuming a 512 channel spectrum from a low resolution (e. g., NaI) detector measuring Uranium or Plutonium. Another important hardware component of the system is a portable <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>reader</b> (also called a DataLogger or Trakker), by Intermec Corporation. The 944 X series and the JANUS 2 OXX series readers are compatible models with the HMSII. The JANUS series is a <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>reader</b> which is also a 386 compatible palmtop PC with MS-DOS 5. 0 built-in. Both series readers are programmable and control all the aspects of field holdup data collection from the MCAs...|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} version simply dispenses an allotted {{volume of}} liquid from a motorized pipette or syringe; more complicated machines can also manipulate {{the position of the}} dispensers and containers (often a Cartesian coordinate robot) and/or integrate additional laboratory devices, such as centrifuges, microplate readers, heat sealers, heater/shakers, <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>readers,</b> spectrophotometric devices, storage devices and incubators.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} effect of the use of <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>readers</b> and {{programmable}} keypads for entry of specimen details and results in two microbiology laboratories. METHODS: The solutions selected in each laboratory are described. The benefits resulting from the implementation were measured in two ways. The speed of data entry and error reduction were measured by observation. A questionnaire was completed by users of <b>bar</b> <b>codes.</b> RESULTS: There were savings in time and in reduced data entry errors. Average time to enter a report by keyboard was 21. 1 s v 14. 1 s for <b>bar</b> <b>coded</b> results entry. There were no observed errors with the <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>readers</b> but 55 errors with keystroke entries. The laboratory staff of all grades found the system fast, easy to use, and less stressful than conventional keyboard entry. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect time savings should accrue from the observed reduction in incorrectly entered data. Any microbiology laboratory seeking to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data entry into their laboratory information systems should consider the adoption of this technology which can be readily interfaced to existing terminals...|$|R
