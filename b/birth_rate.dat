40|$|Teenage {{pregnancy}} and childbearing are considered serious social problems. In this report, we examine trends and patterns in teen �ummary <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> in California. Examining {{the history of}} teen <b>birth</b> <b>rates,</b> and their variations across demographic groups and regions, should help inform policy discussions surrounding teen {{pregnancy and}} birth. We find that teen <b>birth</b> <b>rates,</b> after increasing in the 1980 s, have fallen dramatically in California over the past decade. In 1991, California’s teen <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> were {{among the highest in}} the nation; by 2000, the state’s rates were below the national average. This decline might have more to do with the state’s demography than with more effective intervention programs in California than in other states. Much of the decline in teen <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> in California can be attributed to declines among foreign-born Latinas, although they still have very high rates of teen childbirth. Two of every three babies born to teens in California are born to Latinas. Teen <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> for whites and Asians in California, already low compared to other groups, also declined during the 1990 s. There are substantial variations in teen <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> across California’s regions and counties. Teen <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> in the San Joaquin Valley are more than twice as high as those in the Bay Area. Only some of this variation can be explained by differences in the demographic composition of the teen population. For example, Hispanic teen <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> are over 50 percent higher in the San Joaquin Valley than in the North Coast and Mountain region, African American teen <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> are over twice as high in the San Joaquin Valley as in the Central Coast, and white teen <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> are almost three times higher in the San Joaquin Valley than in the Bay Area.

These rates were estimated from the reproductive histories of five cohorts of animals branded as pups between 1980 and 1984 at Los Islotes colony in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Age-specific <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> varied among age classes and ranged between 0. 06 and 0. 80. The highest <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> were observed for females between 10 and 15 yr of age, with decreased <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> among older females.

The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America.

In Latvia, pro-immigration sentiment if negatively related to municipal <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> and older individuals are less favourable to immigration if <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> are high.
