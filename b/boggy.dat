5|$|Following {{the success}} of The Legend of <b>Boggy</b> Creek, Pierce was {{encouraged}} to film a sequel, but resisted {{because he wanted to}} prove himself as a filmmaker rather than duplicate the same idea. He continued to make inexpensive regional films set in the southern United States, primarily targeting small-town and rural audiences. His family said Pierce liked to be continuously working and would start a new film immediately after finishing the last. His sophomore effort was Bootleggers (1974), a period action-comedy film about rival families making moonshine in the Ozark Mountains. It featured Slim Pickens and the first major performance of Jaclyn Smith, who went on to play Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie's Angels. Pierce followed that film up with two Westerns released in 1976. The first, Winterhawk, was about violence erupting between Blackfoot Native Americans and white villagers. The film proved difficult for Pierce to shoot due to challenges from the weather and problems with the horses on the set. However, according to Pierce, Winterhawk was more widely seen than The Legend of <b>Boggy</b> Creek. His second Western was Winds of Autumn. Pierce co-wrote both films with his <b>Boggy</b> Creek partner, Earl E. Smith. Pierce made a trademark of casting his friends in his films, and Pierce himself performed minor roles in both Winterhawk and Winds of Autumn. During this period, Pierce continued working as a set decorator for films such as Black Belt Jones (1974).|$|E

The genesis of this waving is complex. Rail corrugation is a recognized problem that leads to excess vibration on the rails and vehicles to a point of reducing their life span and compromising safety. In urban areas excess vibration noise is also a problem. A software tool was developed to analyze accelerometer signals acquired in the <b>boggies</b> of rail vehicles in order to quantify the rail corrugation according to their frequency and amplitude. A wavelet packet methodology was used in this work and compared with the One Third Octave Filter (OTOF) power representations, which is currently used in the industry.

50|$|The trail itself {{winds through}} forests, bogs, {{slippery}} moss-covered ladders, climbing, repelling and beach treks. Hikers {{have a choice}} {{in parts of the}} trail to stay in the highlands, which is much <b>boggier,</b> or try to make progress on the beach, which is slow, but easier on the feet. The trail passes old growth trees, waterfalls, streams and thick patches of deep mud. Along the coast, the trail includes sand and pebble beaches, headlands, and exposed shelf and boulders at low tide. The trail often diverts inland to avoid dangerous surge channels and impassable headlands, where cliffs descend straight into the sea even at low tide. Portions of the beach sections can be made impassable by high tides. Tide tables and maps are issued by Parks Canada staff to all hikers prior to starting the trek. In some inland areas the trail consists of a boardwalk, which can be in disrepair and covered with moss and mud.|$|R

5|$|Germanicus' {{divisions}} met {{up to the}} north, and ravaged {{the countryside}} between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Teutoburg Forest, a mountain forest in Western Germany situated between these two rivers. There, Germanicus {{and some of his}} men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman soldiers that had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans. He made his way into the heartland of the Cherusci. At a location Tacitus calls the pontes longi ("long causeways"), in <b>boggy</b> lowlands somewhere near the Ems, Arminius' troops attacked the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus' cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them.

5|$|Pierce largely {{fell from}} the movie industry's public eye shortly {{after the release of}} <b>Boggy</b> Creek II. In 1987, he {{directed}} Hawken's Breed, a Western film starring Peter Fonda as a drifter who meets and rescues a young Shawnee woman. While shooting that film, Pierce met the woman who became his second wife, Beth Pulley. In 1996, he directed Renfroe's White Christmas, an adaptation of the classic children's book Renfroe's Christmas. Starting in 1997, he began production on his western film Chasing the Wind (1998), a gritty epic about a mountain man. It proved to be Pierce's final directorial effort, although he continued working as a set decorator for several television shows including MacGyver, Remington Steele, The Twilight Zone and Fresno, a Carol Burnett miniseries parodying prime time soap operas. Pierce's work on the latter show earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or a Special.|$|E
5|$|Pierce's directorial debut was The Legend of <b>Boggy</b> Creek, {{which was}} {{inspired}} by the Fouke Monster, a seven-foot-tall Bigfoot-like creature said to live in the swamps near Fouke, Arkansas. Pierce said he did not necessarily believe in the legend, but was fascinated with the stories. After interviewing Fouke residents who said they encountered the monster, Pierce became impressed with their authenticity and down-to-earth qualities. He approached Earl E. Smith, an acquaintance from the advertising business, to adapt those eyewitness tales into a screenplay. The film was shot at locations in Fouke, Texarkana and Shreveport, using a camera Pierce built himself at home. It was filmed in a faux documentary style, and included interviews with Fouke residents mixed with dramatizations of their supposed encounters with the creature. Like Pierce, the film's financial backers and many of the actors had never been involved in a film before.|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{also from}} the 16th century onwards up until the late 18th century, Körborn shared the same history as the now former County of Veldenz and its {{successor}} state, Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Cörbern still belonged, as before, to the Burgfrieden of Castle Lichtenberg along with the villages of Thallichtenberg, Ruthweiler and Bistert (now vanished). According to Johannes Hoffmann’s 1588 description of the Amt of Lichtenberg, Körborn lay in the ﬁfth Hauptgrund (literally “main ground”): “In this case … herein: The Cörbergrundt is 8,600 feet or 573 roods and 5 feet. In this lies above at the end or the beginning the village of Cörbern. The dell, called Müllenbach, is 5,170 feet or 344 roods and 10 feet long, falls into the Cörpergrundt”. Hoffmann used the word Schuch (in today’s German, Schuh - literally “shoe”) for “foot” and Ruttenn or Rutten for “roods”. He also identiﬁed the “dell” (he used the same word in German) with the brook running through it. According to this report, the Mühlbach was called the Cörbergrundt (or Cörpergrundt) and the Müllbach {{was said to be}} a side valley of this “ground”. It is unlikely that a mill (Mühle in German) ever stood on either of these brooks. During the Thirty Years' War, the nearby Castle Lichtenberg escaped the customary destruction, though the villages all around it suffered heavily under the horrors wrought by the war and also by the Plague. Körborn was likely utterly destroyed in this war and afterwards newly settled. Further hardship and woe came in the late 17th century with French King Louis XIV’s wars of conquest. Only in the 18th century was their steady population growth. From a report by Daniel Hinkelmann that has been preserved to the present day come details about agricultural conditions in those days. The ﬁrst survey of the municipal area known to history was done in 1745 by the Ducal Renovator Gottfried Sundahl from Zweibrücken, who determined the area to be 3,455 Morgen. According to documents from 1777 issued by the Keller (collector) at Castle Lichtenberg, Johann Christoph Gassert, the municipality then had 1,287 Morgen of cropland of which 341 Morgen lay at the municipality’s outermost edges, 245 Morgen of meadowland and 323 Morgen of woodland and grazing land. Produced were, among other things, 5,070 bales of corn straw and 2,845 bales of fodder straw. Of the cropland mentioned above, only 190 Morgen were dunged, which according to Gassert’s calculations yielded 3,420 sheaves of grain, and therefrom all together 213 Malter of actual grain. The 42 Morgen of stubble ﬁelds and <b>boggier</b> land yielded 6 sheaves to a Morgen and therefore 252 sheaves all together, and thus 15 Malter and 3 Fass (“barrels”). Of the 269½ Morgen planted with summer crops, one third with potatoes, the yield for one Morgen was 15 Malter, all together 1,350 Malter of potatoes, while 179 Morgen of barley and oats yielded 3 Malter (roughly 6 hundredweight) to a Morgen, and thus all together 537 Malter. The livestock kept in that year broke down as follows: 1 horse, 48 oxen, 43 cows, 41 other cattle, 473 wethers and other sheep, 190 lambs and 182 pigs.|$|R
5|$|Purely natural {{sources were}} {{insufficient}} {{in some areas}} and additional steps taken to increase supplies. In New England, holes were drilled in the ice to promote the thickening of the surface. Alternatively, artificial lakes were created in some areas, and guidance was published {{on how best to}} construct the dams that lay at the heart of these designs. Low-lying, <b>boggy</b> land was dammed and flooded in Maine {{towards the end of the}} century to meet surge demands, while pre-existing artificial mill ponds in Wisconsin turned out to be ideal for harvesting commercial ice. In Alaska, a large, shallow artificial lake covering around 40 acres (16 hectares) was produced in order to assist in ice production and harvesting; similar approaches were taken in the Aleutian islands; in Norway this was taken further, with a number of artificial lakes up to half a mile long built on farmland to increase supplies, including some built out into the sea to collect fresh water for ice.|$|E
