The very great numbers of bacteria generally found in ice cream, in Iowa and elsewhere, make this question important, but it is hardly possible to answer it positively at present. However, in the investigations made by the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station and set forth in this bulletin these facts appeared: As cleanliness in making ice cream increases, the number of bacteria decreases. It is possible to make ice cream in quantities up to 20 gallons with a low bacterial count without expensive methods, {{though it is not}} certain that this is true under large factory conditions.

Our investigations were performed on 141 poultry samples sorted from supermarkets. Relative accuracy, relative specificity and relative sensitivity were determined. According to the ISO 16140 : 2003 criteria for validation of alternative microbiological methods, the ELFA-based method (VIDAS ICS 2 + SLM), and real-time PCR methods (TaqMan, Bax) were comparable to the reference standard method for the detection of Salmonella spp. in chicken meat. The use of these methods provide results within 48 hours with high sensitivity (100 %). The TaqMan real-time PCR showed a relative specificity of 98 % and both of the real-time PCR methods presented 100 %. The VIDAS ICS 2 + SLM and the Bax real-time PCR methods showed the highest relative accuracy (100 %) and 99 % in case of the TaqMan method.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the bacterial profile and antibiotic resistance pattern of the urinary pathogens isolated from pregnant women at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital Bahirdar, Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 367 pregnant women with and without symptoms of urinary tract infection were enrolled as a study subject from October 2010 to January 2011. Organisms were identified from mid-stream clean catch urine samples and antibiotic susceptibility was performed using <b>bacteriological</b> <b>standard</b> tests. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and were processed and analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 16. RESULTS: Out of 367 pregnant women, 37 were symptomatic and the rest 330 asymptomatic. Bacteriological screening of urine samples revealed growth of bacteria in 8. 5 % (7 / 37) and 18. 9 % (28 / 330) for symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women respectively with overall prevalence of 9. 5 %. The most common isolates detected were E. coli (45. 7 %) followed by coagulase negative Staphylococcus (17. 1 %) and S. aureus (8. 6 %). Gram-negative bacteria showed resistance rates in the range of 56. 5 %- 82. 6 % against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, amoxicillin & ampicillin. Gram positive isolates showed resistant rate ranging from 50 - 100 % against tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, amoxicillin and penicillin-G. Both Gram positive and gram negative bacteria showed high sensitivity against Nitrofurantoin with a rate of 82. 3 % and 87 %, respectively. All isolated Gram positive bacterial uropathogens were sensitive for Amoxicillin-clauvlanic acid.

Here, the Se of the ISO (SeISO) was estimated on 675 samples selected from two populations with different Salmonella prevalences (14 farms with a â‰¥ 20 % prevalence and 13 farms with a < 20 % prevalence) and through the use of latent-class models in concert with Bayesian inference, assuming 100 % ISO specificity, and an invA-based PCR as the second diagnostic method. The Se ISO was estimated to be close to 87 %, while the sensitivity of the PCR reached up to 83. 6 % and its specificity was 97. 4 %. Interestingly, the bacteriological reanalysis of 33 potential false-negative (PCR-positive) samples allowed isolation of 19 (57. 5 %) new Salmonella strains, improving the overall diagnostic accuracy of the bacteriology. Considering the usual limitations of bacteriology regarding Se, these results support the adequacy of the ISO for the detection of Salmonella spp. from MLN and also that of the PCR-based method as an alternative or complementary (screening) test for the diagnosis of pig salmonellosis, particularly considering the cost and time benefits of the molecular procedure.

Typhimurium were the two more frequently isolated serovariants in confirmed human cases. The main source of contamination is food of animal origin, especially pig meat, which is largerly consumed in EU (Devine, 2003); in Italy, in particular, the consumption {{of a wide range}} of salami produced with pork is very common. Pigs are important reservoir of infection for humans as they are asymptomatic carriers of broad host-range serovars of Salmonella (Fedorka-Cray et al., 2000). From April to December 2015, 155 ground pork and fat mixture samples (corresponding to 155 different batches) used for salami production were tested for Salmonella. All samples were provided by four production plants located in Emilia-Romagna region, northern Italy. Salami batches were tested only in case their ground raw mixture was positive for Salmonella. The detection of Salmonella was performed using a molecular method based on the Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and positive samples were confirmed by the ISO 6579 : 2002 <b>bacteriological</b> <b>standard</b> method. The enumeration of Salmonella in the Real-Time PCR positive samples was performed following the miniaturized Most Probable Number (MPN) technique according to ISO 6579 - 2 : 2012. Since the ability of Salmonella to cause systemic disease has been assessed in mice according to their survival and growth in murine cell lines,, we evaluated the capacity of some Salmonella isolatesto survive and replicate within a human macrophages-like cell line (U 937). This study was performed to investigate the potential invasiveness for humans of Salmonella strains found in ready-to-eat pork products. Salmonella was isolated from 24 / 46 (52. 2 %) of raw mixture samples and from 16 / 59 (27. 1 %) of cured salami; eight Salmonella serovars were identified, with S. Derby (12 / 24; 50. 0 %) as the most common.

Water samples were collected at the different stations by Ching (1) and analyzed, and flows were approximated by analytical methods since they were not measured by Ching at the time of sampling. With the concentration of constituents, land areas, and flow values the pollution load, in lbs/acre/day, for each incremental drainage area was then calculated and subsequently related to various land activities. It was concluded that mountainous areas, where rains, containing constituents from the atmosphere (6), fall initially and most severely, and heavy vegetation contribute substantially to the pollution loading of the stream. In urban areas, an increase in pollution load is generally noted for a corresponding increase in urban activity, such as an increase in residential land use. In addition according to Chapter 37 -A of the Public Health Regulations (7), the bacteriological levels in Manoa Stream, which is classified as class 2 waters, exceeds the <b>bacteriological</b> <b>standards</b> defined in those regulations. Also, since Manoa Stream flows into the Ala Wai Boat Harbor, total phosphorus and total nitrogen standards are violated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Forty {{samples of}} sea and estuary water were {{collected}} from a 40 km strip along the Adriatic coast of Italy between June 1994 and September 1995. Each sample consisted of t 0 1 of water. Routine bacteriological analyses were carried out and viral particles concentrated on cross-flow membranes; the concentrated water samples, equally divided into two parts, were used to infect both BGM and Hep- 2 cells. Lysates from all cell cultures were further tested {{for the presence of}} enteroviruses by reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and reoviruses by polyacrylamide gel eleetrophoresis (PAGE). The results showed widespread viral contamination of the waters tested, particularly in late summer. Under our experimental conditions, BGM cells were more efficient than Hep- 2 in recovering viruses. In fact, enteroviruses were detected in up to 33 % and reoviruses in 80 % of BGM infected with seawater, compared to 8 % and 53 %, respectively, for the Hep- 2 cells. In estuarine samples, enteroviruses were detected in 30 % and reovirus in 54 % of BGM, compared to 23 % and 30 % of Hep- 2. Twenty nine out of 40 samples showed the presence of infectious particles {{on the basis of the}} CPE appearance; after identification of the isolated viruses, only 13 turned out to be specifically contaminated by enteroviruses. Of the latter, five were below the <b>bacteriological</b> <b>standards</b> set by the Italian legislation in line with the EEC Directive 76 / 160 IEEC for bathing waters...|$|R
40|$|We studied, for two years, the {{prevalence}} of indigenous human enteric viruses in wild oysters gathered each month {{from the bottom of}} Mikawa Bay, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Viruses were detected periodically in 9 out of 54 oyster pools prepared by the acid or polyethylene glycol precipitation method although all these 9 pools met current national <b>bacteriological</b> safety <b>standards.</b> Since most of the serotypes of the enteric viruses detected in the oysters were identical with those of viruses isolated from sick children living in the area, it is suggested that contamination of enteric viruses in the oysters would depend on {{the prevalence}} of enteric viral infections in the local inhabitants...|$|R
40|$|The {{sanitary}} {{classification of}} harvesting areas for bivalve mollusks in France {{is based on}} the level of Escherichia Coli contamination detected in shellfish meat, as defined in EC Directive 91 / 492 EEC. However, outbreaks of gastroenteritis or hepatitis after consumption of shellfish meeting current <b>bacteriological</b> <b>standards</b> suggest that E. coli is a poor indicator of viral contamination. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the adequacy of enterovirus and F-specific RNA bacteriophages as new indicators of human enteric viruses. Shellfish were sampled over a 37 -mo period to characterize microbial contamination in two coastal areas subjected to different sewage contamination inputs. Contamination by E. coli, F-specific RNA bacteriophages (F+ RNA) and human enteric viruses (enterovirus, EV; hepatitis A virus, HAV; Norwalk-like virus, NLV: astrovirus, AV; and rotavirus, RV) was measured in the same samples. E. coli analysis was performed by conductance measurement, enteric viruses were detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and hybridization. and F+ RNA was evaluated by culture according to the ISO 10705 - 1 method. Statistical analysis based on bootstrap methods was performed on 95 series of paired observations. The validity of E. coli, enterovirus, and F-specific RNA bacteriophages as viral indicators was evaluated by measuring their sensitivity and specificity in the presence of enteric viruses. None of the tested indicators proved adequate to protect the public from viral shellfish contamination. The sensitivity of all indicators was better in the highly contaminated zone, and enteroviruses showed the highest specificity for both sites...|$|R
