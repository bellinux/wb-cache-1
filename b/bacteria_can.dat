5|$|Many <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> move using {{a variety}} of mechanisms: flagella are used for {{swimming}} through fluids; bacterial gliding and twitching motility move bacteria across surfaces; and changes of buoyancy allow vertical motion.|$|E
5|$|In {{compound}} implants (two stage implants), {{between the}} actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> penetrate from the oral cavity. Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue {{and can cause}} periimplantitis. As prophylaxis these implant interior spaces should be sealed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bacteria</b> <b>can</b> {{also be used}} in {{the place}} of {{pesticides}} in the biological pest control. This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators and most other beneficial insects.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> be {{isolated}} from various body fluids, and serological testing with an ELISA {{can also be}} performed.|$|R
50|$|Xanthomonas arboricola is {{a species}} of proteobacteria. This phytopathogenic <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> cause disease in trees like Prunus, {{hazelnut}} and walnut.|$|R
50|$|In addition, this <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> combine oxygen-sensitive and oxygen-requiring enzyme {{reaction}} {{processes for}} metabolism and thus, it can thrive under varying and even very little levels of oxygen.|$|R
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. <b>Bacteria</b> <b>can</b> be classified {{on the basis of}} cell structure, cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components, such as DNA, fatty acids, pigments, antigens and quinones. While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was {{due to the lack of}} distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises molecular systematics, using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the rRNA gene. Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> form complex {{associations with}} other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|Lithotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> use {{inorganic}} compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions {{inorganic compounds}} are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E
50|$|Spirochaeta {{americana}} is {{a relatively}} newly discovered single-celled extremophile. This haloalkaliphilic and obligately anaerobic <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> {{be found in the}} bleach-like highly alkaline, salty, deep waters of California's Mono Lake.|$|R
25|$|The chronic manifestation {{consists}} of a benign skin eruption with raised, reddish-purple nodules (angiomatous tumours). The <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> be seen microscopically, if a skin biopsy is silver stained (the Warthin–Starry method).|$|R
50|$|Though GBS is an {{asymptomatic}} colonizer of the gastrointestinal human tract {{in up to}} 30% of {{otherwise healthy}} adults, including pregnant women,this opportunistic harmless <b>bacterium</b> <b>can,</b> in some circumstances, cause severe invasive infections.|$|R
5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene are unique to sebum and not produced as final products {{anywhere else in the}} body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated in the development of acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> produce strong odors.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E
5|$|Syphilis is most {{commonly}} spread through sexual activity. It {{may also be}} transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in congenital syphilis. Other human diseases caused by related Treponema pallidum subspecies include yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum), and bejel (subspecies endemicum). Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests; the <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant women be tested.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese {{scientists}} have isolated a bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis that possesses two enzymes which can {{break down the}} PET into smaller pieces that the <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> digest. A colony of [...] I. sakaiensis can disintegrate a plastic film in about six weeks.|$|R
50|$|Listeria monocytogenes secretes a {{pore-forming protein}} listeriolysin O so the <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> escape the phagosome into the cytosol. Listeriolysin is {{activated}} by the acidic {{environment of the}} phagosome. In addition, Listeria secrete two phospholipase C enzymes that facilitate in phagosome escape.|$|R

5|$|The {{energy in}} {{sunlight}} is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists. This process is often coupled to {{the conversion of}} carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> use sunlight {{as a source of}} energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of life on Earth lives in mesophyllic (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them microbes, have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are bacteria, for example, living in Lake Whillans, half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock. Other <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> be found in abundance in the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; marine snow drifts down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bacteria</b> <b>can</b> {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases can be grown in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
50|$|Micro{{bacterium}} paraoxydans is a Gram-positive bacterium {{from the}} genus of Microbacterium which was first {{isolated from the}} fish Nile tilapia in Mexiko.

50|$|The Anton antigen is a cell surface {{receptor}} {{found on}} some human red blood cells. It {{has been observed}} {{to play a role}} in Haemophilus influenzae infections. Studies showed that the <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> adhere to this receptor and cause human red blood cells to agglutinate.|$|R
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. <b>Bacteria</b> <b>can</b> spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Some true fungi specialise in the {{colonisation}} of the Myxogastriae: {{almost all}} of these are species of sac fungi. The most common such fungus is Verticillium rexianummainly species from Comatricha or Stemonitis. Gliocladium album and Sesquicillium microsporum are often found on Physaridae, while Polycephalomyces tomentosus is often found on certain species of Trichiidae. Nectriopsis violacea specialises on Fuligo septica. Bacterial associates, mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae, were discovered on plasmodia. The combination of plasmodia and <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> bind atmospheric nitrogen or produce enzymes which make possible the decomposition of e.g. lignin, carboxymethylcellulose or xylan. In a few cases, the plasmodia acquired salt tolerance or tolerance of heavy metals through this association.|$|E
5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E

30|$|The above results {{confirm the}} strong {{biodegradation}} potential of P. putida F 1 against monoaromatic compounds and {{indicate that this}} specific <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> lead to the complete degradation of benzoate.

5|$|Thermus aquaticus is a {{bacterium}} {{found in the}} Yellowstone hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating DNA {{as part of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. The retrieval of these <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in {{multicellular}} organisms, {{increases in}} cell size (cell growth) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission, {{a form of}} asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8minutes. In cell division, two identical clone daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by Myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces, or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.|$|E
25|$|Sucrose is {{the only}} sugar that <b>bacteria</b> <b>can</b> use to form this sticky polysaccharide.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the {{bacteria}} used as starter culture {{are not the}} same used as probiotics. There are, however, cases when one <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> be used both as starter culture and as probiotic. The scientific community is presently trying to deepen understanding of the roles played by microbes in food processing and human health.|$|R
50|$|As {{the price}} of fossil fuels {{increases}} and reserves diminish, biofuel production {{is seen as a}} viable contribution to current. as well as future energy demands, Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans can use several pure sugars for hydrogen production, Hence, this <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> potentially increase the efficiency and efficacy of biohydrogen production from renewable biomass resources.|$|R
50|$|Plasmids {{are small}} extra-chromosomal DNAs that may contain genes for {{antibiotic}} resistance or virulence factors. Plasmids replicate independently of chromosomes, {{so it is}} possible that plasmids could be lost in bacterial cell division. Against this possibility is the fact that a single <b>bacterium</b> <b>can</b> contain hundreds of copies of a single plasmid.|$|R
