50|$|Adozelesin and <b>bizelesin</b> cause genomic DNA lesions by alkylating DNA. Adozelesin induces single-strand DNA lesions, whereas <b>bizelesin</b> induces both single-strand lesions and double-strand DNA cross-links. At {{equivalent}} cytotoxic concentrations, {{these agents}} caused different biological responses. Low adozelesin concentrations (e.g., 0.5 nM) induced a transient S-phase block and cell cycle arrest in G(2)-M, {{as well as}} increased induction of p53 and p21, whereas a high drug concentration (e.g., 2.5 nM) caused apoptosis but no p21 induction. In contrast, both low and high <b>bizelesin</b> concentrations enhanced p53 and p21 induction and triggered G(2)-M cell cycle arrest and eventual senescence without significant apoptotic cell death. However, in cells lacking p21, <b>bizelesin,</b> as well as adozelesin, triggered apoptosis, indicating that p21 was crucial to sustained bizelesin-induced G(2)-M arrest. Despite similar abilities to alkylate DNA, adozelesin and <b>bizelesin</b> caused a decrease in HCT116 tumor cell proliferation by different pathways.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bizelesin</b> is antineoplastic {{antibiotic}} which binds to {{the minor}} groove of DNA and induces interstrand cross-linking of DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and RNA synthesis. <b>Bizelesin</b> also enhances p53 and p21 induction and triggers G2/M cell-cycle arrest, resulting in cell senescence without apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthetic}} analogs of duocarmycins include adozelesin, <b>bizelesin,</b> and carzelesin. As {{members of}} the cyclopropylpyrroloindole family, these investigational drugs have progressed into clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} cancer.|$|E
50|$|The work of Dale L. Boger {{and others}} created a better {{understanding}} of the pharmacophore and mechanism of action of the duocarmycins. This research has led to synthetic analogs including adozelesin, <b>bizelesin,</b> and carzelesin which progressed into clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Similar research that Boger utilized for comparison to his results involving elimination of cancerous tumors and antigens was centered around the use of similar immunoconjugates that were introduced to cancerous colon cells. These studies related to Boger's research involving antigen-specificity that is necessary to the success of the duocarmycins as antitumor treatments.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} of administering <b>bizelesin,</b> a cyclopropyl-pyrroloindole with extraordinarily high potency as a bifunctional DNA-damaging agent and selectivity for specific AT-rich DNA sequences, as a single i. v. bolus injection every 4 weeks in patients with advanced solid malignancies. The study also sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of <b>bizelesin,</b> character-ize its pharmacokinetic behavior, and seek preliminary evidence of anticancer activity. Patients and methods: Patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with escalating doses of <b>bizelesin</b> as an i. v. bolus injection every 4 weeks. The selection of the specific starting dose, 0. 1 µg/m 2, which was equivalent to one-tenth the toxic dose low in dogs, factored in large interspecies differences in myelo-toxicity as gauged using an ex vivo hematopoietic colony-forming assay. Due to concerns about the high potency of <b>bizelesin</b> and the large interspecies differences in toxicity, a conservative dose-escalation scheme was used for dose-level assignment to determine the MTD levels for both minimally pretreated (MP) and heavily pretreated (HP) patients. A variety of analytical assays were assessed to reliably measure <b>bizelesin</b> concentrations in plasma. Results: Sixty-two patients were treated with 185 courses of <b>bizelesin</b> at eight dose levels ranging from 0. 1 to 1. 5 µg/m 2. Myelosuppression, principally neutropenia that was always brief, was the most common toxicit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCellular DNA is not {{a uniform}} target for DNA-reactive drugs. At the {{nucleotide}} level, drugs recognize and bind short motifs of a few base pairs. The location of drug adducts at the genomic level depends on how these short motifs are distributed in larger domains. This aspect, referred to as region specificity, may be critical for the biological outcome of drug action. Recent studies demonstrated that certain minor groove binding (MGB) drugs, such as <b>bizelesin,</b> produce region-specific lesions in cellular DNA. <b>Bizelesin</b> binds mainly T(A/T) 4 A sites, which are on average scarce, but occasionally cluster in distinct minisatellite regions (200 – 1000 bp of ∼ 85 – 100 % AT), herein referred to as AT islands. Bizelesin-targeted AT islands are likely to function as strong matrix attachment regions (MARs), domains that organize DNA loops on the nuclear matrix. Distortion of MAR-like AT islands may be {{a basis for the}} observed inhibition of new replicon initiation and the extreme lethality of <b>bizelesin</b> adducts (< 10 adducts/cell for cell growth inhibition). Hence, long AT-islands represent a novel class of critical targets for anticancer drugs. The AT island paradigm illustrates the potential of the concept of regional targeting as an essential component of the rational design of new sequence-specific DNA-reactive drugs...|$|E
40|$|AT-rich minisatellites (AT islands) are {{sites of}} genomic {{instability}} in cancer cells and targets for extremely lethal AT-specific drugs, such as <b>bizelesin.</b> Here we investigated the AT {{islands in the}} FRA 16 B fragile site region for their possible roles {{in the organization of}} DNA on the nuclear matrix. The FRA 16 B AT island nominally spans ∼ 3 kb of mostly > 90 % A/T DNA. In silico analysis indicates that this domain exhibits characteristics of nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) : an exceptionally intense computed ‘MAR potential’ and profound duplex destabilization and flexibility. FRA 16 B repeats specifically bind to isolated nuclear matrices, which indicates their in vitro MAR function. This binding is several-fold greater than that of a known MAR in the c-myc gene. AT islands in fragile sites FRA 16 B and FRA 16 D are significantly more abundant in CEM cells that are hypersensitive to <b>bizelesin</b> compared to normal WI- 38 cells. FRA 16 B overabundance in CEM is due to an ∼ 10 -fold expansion of FRA 16 B repeats. The expanded FRA 16 B minisatellites in CEM cells preferentially localize to the nuclear matrix-associated DNA indicating their in vivo MAR function. The unexpanded repeats in WI- 38 cells localize to the loop DNA. The c-myc MAR is also matrix-associated in CEM cells while localizing to loop DNA in WI- 38 cells. These results are the first to demonstrate that AT islands in fragile sites can function as MARs both in vitro and in vivo. The ability of FRA 16 B-mediated MAR sites to rearrange depending on the repeat expansion status could be relevant to both genomic instability of cancer cells and their sensitivity to AT-island targeting drugs...|$|E
40|$|Background: In Plasmodium, meiosis {{occurs in}} diploid zygotes as they develop into haploid motile ookinetes inside the mosquito. Further sporogonic {{development}} involves transformation of ookinetes into oocysts and formation of infective sporozoites. Methodology/Principal Findings: Reverse genetics {{was employed to}} examine the role of the meiotic specific recombinase Dmc 1, a bacterial RecA homolog during sporogony in Plasmodium berghei. PbDmc 1 knockout (KO) parasites showed normal asexual growth kinetics compared to WT parasites; however oocyst formation in mosquitoes was reduced by 50 to 80 %. Moreover, the majority of oocysts were retarded in their growth and were smaller in size compared to WT parasites. Only a few Dmc 1 KO parasites completed maturation resulting in formation of fewer sporozoites which were incapable of infecting naive mice or hepatocytes in vitro. PbDmc 1 KO parasites were shown to be approximately 18 times more sensitive to <b>Bizelesin,</b> a DNA alkylating drug compared to WT parasites as reflected by impairment of oocyst formation and sporogonic development in the mosquito vector. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that PbDmc 1 plays a critical role in malaria transmission biology...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{structural}} {{studies of}} the cyclopropapyrroloindole (CPI) antitumor antibiotics have shown that these ligands bind covalently edge-on into the minor groove of double-stranded DNA. Reversible covalent modification of the DNA via N 3 of adenine occurs in a sequence-specific fashion. Early nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular modeling studies with both mono- and bis-allcylating ligands indicated that the ligands fit tightly within the minor groove, causing little distortion of the helix. In this study, we propose a new binding model for several of the CPI-based analogues, in which the aromatic secondary rings form pi-stacked complexes within the minor groove. One of the adducts, formed with adozelesin and the d(ATTAAT) (2) sequence, also demonstrates the ability of these ligands to manipulate the DNA of the binding site, resulting in a Hoogsteen base-paired adduct. Although this type of base pairing has been previously observed with the bisfunctional CPI analogue <b>bizelesin,</b> {{this is the first}} time that such an observation has been made with a monoalkylating nondimeric analogue. Together, these results provide a new model for the design of CPI-based antitumor antibiotics, which also has a significant bearing on other structurally related and structurally unrelated minor groove-binding ligands. They indicate the dynamic nature of ligand DNA interactions, demonstrating both DNA conformational flexibility and the ability of two DNA-bound ligands to interact to form stable covalent modified complexes...|$|E
40|$|The pleiotrophic {{cellular}} {{response to}} DNA damage includes activation of cell cycle checkpoints, induction of DNA repair pathways, and initiation of {{programmed cell death}} among others. The fate of cells with damaged DNA depends on the coordination of these different responses. The clinical efficacy of genotoxic therapies is influenced by cell fate and thus by how the DNA damage response is coordinated. While a great deal has been learned about how different DNA lesions activate distinct cell cycle check-points and DNA repair pathways, less is known about whether the type of DNA lesion influences the qualitative and quantitative nature of the cell death response. To address this question, HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells have been treated with equally cytotoxic doses of the anti-tumor DNA alkylating agents adozelesin or <b>bizelesin</b> or the DNA strand scission agent C- 1027. The relative contribution of cell cycle arrest and cell death to measured cytotoxicity varied among the three drugs. Apoptotic cell death accounts for most C- 1027 cytotoxicity while cell cycle arrest and cell death both contribute to the cyto-toxicity of the alkylating agents. Each of the drugs induces a distinct but overlapping pattern of caspase activation. In addition, the cell death response to these drugs is differ-entially dependent on p 53 and p 21. These observations suggest {{that the type of}} DNA lesion influences not only the relative extent of apoptotic cell death at a given cyto-toxic dose but also the qualitative nature of that response.
