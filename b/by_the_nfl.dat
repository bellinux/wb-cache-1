5|$|By early 1933, Bell's {{opinion on}} the NFL had changed, {{and he wanted to}} become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia.

He borrowed funds from Frances Upton, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland won the AAFC {{championship}} {{in each of}} the following three years before the league dissolved and the Browns were absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL.</b> Rymkus was named to all-AAFC teams in 1947, 1948, and 1949. In 1948, when the Browns won all of their games, Brown took away Rymkus's defensive duties and made him exclusively an offensive tackle. That summer, he served as an umpire in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.|$|E

5|$|Born in Columbus, Ohio, Willis {{attended}} Ohio State University, {{where he}} joined the track and football teams. He {{was part of a}} Buckeyes football team that won the school's first national championship in 1942. After graduating in 1944, Willis heard about a new AAFC club in Cleveland led by his old Ohio State coach, Paul Brown. He got a tryout and made the team. With Willis as a defensive anchor, the Browns won all four AAFC championships between 1946 and 1949, when the league dissolved. The Browns were then absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL,</b> where Willis continued to succeed. Cleveland won the NFL championship in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Gatski {{was born}} in West Virginia to a coal-mining family.

He joined the U.S. Army in 1942 and went to fight in World War II. Upon his return in 1945, he finished his collegiate studies at Auburn University in Alabama. After graduating, he tried out and made the roster for the Browns, a team under formation in the new AAFC. He played as a linebacker and backup center {{for most of his}} first two years before earning a spot as the starting center. He retained that position as Cleveland continued to dominate after the AAFC dissolved and the Browns were absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> in 1950.

5|$|Horvath, {{who worked}} as a dentist in the offseason in Los Angeles, was {{released}} by the Rams in 1949. He signed with the Browns a week later, closing his dental office and moving to Cleveland to reunite with Brown. Horvath, who was used primarily on defense early in the season, had an 84-yard fumble return for a touchdown in a game against the New York Yankees, and ran for two touchdowns in a November game against the Chicago Hornets. Cleveland finished the season with a 9–1–2 record and won a fourth straight AAFC championship. The AAFC disbanded after the season and the Browns were absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL,</b> but Horvath decided to quit football to practice dentistry back in California.|$|E
5|$|In late 2011 Madonna {{was busy}} {{with the release of}} her film W.E. and with {{recording}} her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The singer was reportedly signed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> for the Super Bowl halftime show, and in December the league confirmed that Madonna would perform in the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The game was scheduled for February 5, 2012, and its organizers continued their practice of inviting global musicians to perform. Artists who had previously performed in the show included the Black Eyed Peas, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, U2, Paul McCartney and Prince. The show coincided with the release of W.E. in United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E

Returning in 1945 after serving in Europe, he joined the Browns in the team's first-ever season in the AAFC. Helped by Lavelli's play, the Browns won each of the AAFC's championships before the league dissolved in 1949 and the team was absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL.</b> Cleveland continued to succeed in the NFL, winning championships in 1950, 1954 and 1955.

5|$|The Super Bowl MVP {{has been}} awarded {{annually}} since the game's inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by SPORT magazine.

5|$|Gillom {{signed with}} the Browns, an AAFC team coached by Brown, in 1947. He handled all of the team's punting chores and played as a utility end on both offense and defense. Gillom's Cleveland teams won three {{straight}} AAFC championships before the league dissolved and the Browns were absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL.</b> The Browns won the NFL championship in 1950 and repeated in 1954 and 1955. Gillom was a consistent punter, never averaging below 41.2 yards per kick in a season. His abilities declined in his later years, however, and he was released during the 1956 season. Gillom attempted a comeback in 1961 with the New York Titans of the American Football League, but {{failed to make the}} team. He moved to Los Angeles and worked as a security guard {{for the rest of his}} life. Gillom died of a heart attack in 1985. He was named in 2007 as a Cleveland Browns Legend, a grouping of the team's best-ever players.|$|E
5|$|In a {{press conference}} after the game, Brown {{announced}} that he would not return for his senior season and enter the NFL Draft, saying he told the media he said he was staying to take the focus off of himself prior to the game. Brown was drafted 27th overall by the Indianapolis Colts, becoming the first UConn player ever drafted in the first round. Three other UConn players were drafted in the second round: Darius Butler 41st overall by the New England Patriots, Will Beatty 60th overall by the New York Giants, and defensive end Cody Brown 63rd overall by the Arizona Cardinals. Tight end Martin Bédard was drafted 15th overall {{in the second round of}} the Canadian Football League's (CFL) 2009 Draft.

UConn cornerback Robert McClain was also drafted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> in 2010, in the seventh round, 249th overall, by the Carolina Panthers.|$|E
5|$|But Thorpe had not {{abandoned}} football either. He first played {{professional football}} in 1913 {{as a member}} of the Indiana-based Pine Village Pros, a team that had a several-season winning streak against local teams during the 1910s. He then signed with the Canton Bulldogs in 1915. They paid him $250 ($ today) a game, a tremendous wage at the time. Before signing him Canton was averaging 1,200fans a game, but 8,000 showed up for his debut against the Massillon Tigers. The team won titles in 1916, 1917, and 1919. He reportedly ended the 1919 championship game by kicking a wind-assisted 95-yard punt from his team's own 5-yard line, effectively putting the game out of reach. In 1920, the Bulldogs were one of 14teams to form the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which would become the National Football League (NFL) two years later. Thorpe was nominally the APFA's first president, but spent most of the year playing for Canton and a year later was replaced as president by Joseph Carr. He continued to play for Canton, coaching the team as well. Between 1921 and 1923, he helped organize and played for the Oorang Indians (LaRue, Ohio), an all-Native American team. Although the team's record was 3–6 in 1922, and 1–10 in 1923, he played well and was selected for the Green Bay Press-Gazette's first All-NFL team in 1923, which would later be formally recognized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> as the league's official All-NFL team in 1931).|$|E
