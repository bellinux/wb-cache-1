5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in Dance of the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy <b>bond</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In practice, several methods {{would often}} be combined. For example, if six extra {{copies of a}} letter were needed, the fluid-corrected {{original}} would be photocopied, but only for the two recipients getting [...] "c.c."s; the other four copies, the less-important file copies that stayed in various departments at the office, would be cheaper, hand-erased, less-distinct <b>bond</b> <b>paper</b> copies or even [...] "flimsies" [...] of different colors (tissue papers interleaved with black carbon paper) that were all typed as a [...] "carbon pack" [...] {{at the same time}} as the original.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} erasing method {{involved the}} use of a special typewriter eraser made of hard rubber that contained an abrasive material. Some were thin, flat disks, pink or gray, approximately [...] in diameter by ⅛ inch (3.2mm) thick, with a brush attached from the center, while others looked like pink pencils, with a sharpenable eraser at the [...] "lead" [...] end and a stiff nylon brush at the other end. Either way, these tools made possible erasure of individual typed letters. Business letters were typed on heavyweight, high-rag-content <b>bond</b> <b>paper,</b> not merely to provide a luxurious appearance, but also to stand up to erasure.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bond</b> <b>paper</b> is a {{high quality}} durable writing paper similar to bank paper but having a weight greater than 50 g/m2. The most common weights are 60 g/m2 (16 lb), 75 g/m2 (20 lb) and 90 g/m2 (24 lb). The name comes from its having {{originally}} been made for documents such as government bonds. It is now used for letterheads, other stationery and as paper for electronic printers. Widely employed for graphic work involving pencil, pen and felt-tip marker, <b>bond</b> <b>paper</b> can sometimes contain rag fibre pulp, which produces a stronger, though rougher, sheet of paper.|$|E

50|$|For {{traditional}} media (such as paint), {{the division}} between layout and comp is more clear-cut than for computer-generated art. For traditional media, the distinction between layout and comp is typically one of refinement and presentation. Layouts and comps are often done on different substrates because of this (e.g., tracing paper for a layout vs. calendered <b>bond</b> <b>paper</b> or illustration board for a comp). In this case, a layout done on tracing paper could be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) {{to see how it}} would eventually appear after finish render, and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp could be done on opaque <b>bond</b> <b>paper</b> or illustration board as a presentation piece for a client's approval.|$|E

40|$|During the {{production}} of beer large amounts of yeast waste are generated. This paper considers the possible making of environmentally friendly adhesive compositions from such wastes. Chemical treatment of yeast wastes increases their adhesive characteristics. Chemical cross-linking with glutaric aldehyde and biological cross-linking by enzyme transglutaminase improves the moisture resistance of the adhesive compositions. In terms of their physical and mechanical parameters they are not inferior to glues of natural origin {{and can be used}} for <b>bonding</b> <b>paper,</b> cardboard, and wood.

5000|$|Veroboard [...] is a {{brand of}} stripboard, a pre-formed circuit board {{material}} of copper strips on an insulating <b>bonded</b> <b>paper</b> board which was originated and developed in the early 1960s by the Electronics Department of Vero Precision Engineering Ltd (VPE).

50|$|The process {{starts with}} {{original}} documents {{that have been}} created on a translucent medium. Such media include polyester films, vellums, linens, and translucent <b>bond</b> <b>papers</b> (<b>bonds).</b> Any media that allows some light to pass through typically works as a master; the desired durability of the master determines the choice. Depending on the thickness and type of the master, {{the intensity of the}} UV exposure light is adjusted using an intensity knob typically pre-marked for media types commonly used for masters in any particular shop. Similarly, the speed control (for setting the speed at which the sheets are pulled through the machine) is likewise typically pre-marked in any particular shop, having been optimized based on trial runs.|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} {{the effects of}} cassava starch as binder on the {{flexural}} strength and the water absorptivity properties of cassava starch <b>bonded</b> <b>paper</b> pulp based composites. Paper pulp was produced by chopping waste papers into smaller pieces and soaked in water for 2 weeks after which it was pulverized in the grinding machine to form paper pulp. The starch slurry was prepared with boiled water and stirred properly to produce lumps free starch slurry. The starch slurry after cooling was preserved in a container. The composites were developed by forming the homogeneous pastes from the mixture of starch with white and brown papers slurry, respectively in predetermined proportions. The developed composites were allowed to cure at room temperature in the laboratory for 28 days after which flexural and water absorptivity tests were carried out on the samples. It was deduced from the work that both white and brown paper pulp based composites possessed improved properties than the control sample which was without starch. However, starch <b>bonded</b> brown <b>paper</b> pulp based composites gave the best bending properties while starch <b>bonded</b> white <b>paper</b> pulp based composites gave the best water absorption resistance response...|$|R

In addition, they are generally produced with enhanced security features, including watermarks, security thread, color-shifting ink, and special <b>bond</b> <b>paper.</b> These are designed to decrease the vulnerability to counterfeit items. To be recognized as a cashier's check, words to that effect must be included in a prominent place {{on the front of the}} item.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{priced at}} 25 centavos (Philippine céntimo) per copy, Halakhak was {{published}} with 42 pages that were {{half the size}} of a regular <b>bond</b> <b>paper</b> due to shortage of paper after World War II. Later on, it was published as a regular-sized comic book at 40 centavos per copy. Halakhak Komiks was published in ten issues before the company closed due to the naiveté of the managers in the comic book business, financial difficulties, ineffective distribution and advertising strategies, and non-paying comic book agents and distributors.|$|E
50|$|Diazo prints {{remain in}} use in some {{applications}} {{but in many cases}} have been replaced by xerographic print processes similar to standard copy machine technology using toner on <b>bond</b> <b>paper.</b> More recently, designs created using computer-aided design techniques may be transferred as a digital file directly to a computer printer or plotter; in some applications, paper is avoided altogether and work and analysis is done directly from digital displays. Another common modern method of copying is the use of large-format scanners. These digitize an image which can then be printed with a large-format plotter.|$|E
