5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} {{methods that}} rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the three primary fertility signs (<b>basal</b> <b>body</b> temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods. Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} methods involve {{determining the}} most fertile {{days of the}} menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse. Techniques for determining fertility include monitoring <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> temperature, cervical secretions, or {{the day of the}} cycle. They have typical first-year failure rates of 24%; perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4% to 5%. The evidence on which these estimates are based, however, is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early. Globally, they are used by about 3.6% of couples. If based on both <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as symptothermal. Overall first-year failure rates of <2% to 20% have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretory}} {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> temperature.|$|E

40|$|The planar cell {{polarity}} (PCP) {{signaling system}} governs {{many aspects of}} polarized cell behavior. Here, we use an in vivo model of vertebrate mucociliary epithelial development to show that Dishevelled (Dvl) {{is essential for the}} apical positioning of <b>basal</b> <b>bodies.</b> We find that Dvl and Inturned mediate the activation of the Rho GTPase specifically at <b>basal</b> <b>bodies,</b> and that these three proteins together mediate the docking of <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> to the apical plasma membrane. Moreover, we find that this docking involves a Dvl-dependent association of <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> with membrane-bound vesicles and the vesicle-trafficking protein, Sec 8. Once docked, <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> again require Dvl and Rho for the planar polarization that underlies directional beating of cilia. These results demonstrate previously undescribed functions for PCP signaling components and suggest that a common signaling apparatus governs both apical docking and planar polarization of <b>basal</b> <b>bodies.</b> close 19618...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the basal apparatus of cilia from respiratory epithelium has been studied in 5 subjects with immotile cilia syndrome without any specific defects in ciliary morphology.

In particular defective <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> of the so-called "half centriole" type, abnormal <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> showing an unusual dense granule in their central part, as well as abnormal accessory structures (i. e., giant striated roots, and double basal foot arising from single <b>basal</b> <b>bodies)</b> {{were found to be}} variously distributed in the patients examined.

5|$|Natural {{selection}} therefore {{explains why}} wheels are an unlikely {{solution to the}} problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the evolution of flagella, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called exaptation.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms-based methods involve {{tracking}} {{one or more}} of {{the three}} primary fertility signs: <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position. Systems relying exclusively on cervical mucus include the Billings Ovulation Method, , the Creighton Model, and the Two-Day Method. Symptothermal methods combine observations of <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, and sometimes cervical position. Calendar-based methods rely on tracking a woman's cycle and identifying her fertile window based on the lengths of her cycles. The best known of these methods is the Standard Days Method. The Calendar-Rhythm method is also considered a calendar-based method, though it is not well defined and has many different meanings to different people.|$|E
25|$|Women who are fertile {{experience}} a natural period of fertility {{before and during}} ovulation, and they are naturally infertile {{during the rest of}} the menstrual cycle.

40|$|Among flagellar mutants of Escherichia coli, flaM or flaU mutants form <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> {{lacking the}} outer P and L rings, whereas flaY mutants {{predominantly}} form <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> lacking the L ring. In these mutants, hooks and filaments are occasionally assembled onto these incomplete <b>basal</b> <b>bodies.</b> When the hook protein gene, flaFV, of Salmonella typhimurium was cloned on the multicopy plasmid pBR 322 and introduced into these mutants, the efficiency with which cells assembled hooks and filaments onto the incomplete <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> increased significantly. Such cells formed characteristic dotted swarms on semisolid plates, indicating that cells carrying flagella without the outer rings are weakly motile {{because of poor}} function of their flagella, a low flagellar number per cell, or both of these defects. FlaV mutants also produced incomplete <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> lacking the outer rings, but assembly of hooks and filaments did not occur in these mutants even after introduction of the plasmid carrying flaFV of S. typhimurium.

50|$|Flagella are microtubule-based {{structures}} that allow cells to have controlled movement {{to a certain}} degree. The root of the microtubule arrangement {{that is associated with}} the flagellar <b>basal</b> <b>bodies,</b> R1, which is also the site of cytoskeletal microtubules, is positioned uniquely in the genus Mallomonas. Instead of pulling away from the <b>basal</b> <b>bodies,</b> R1 actually loops around them in a clockwise fashion. There is also a second root of microtubules extending from the point of origin towards the cellâs centre. Both <b>basal</b> <b>bodies,</b> each assigned one of the two flagella, are enclosed in a thick, fibrous capsule.|$|R
25|$|The {{three primary}} signs of {{fertility}} are <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, and cervical position. A woman practicing symptoms-based fertility awareness {{may choose to}} observe one sign, two signs, or all three.

25|$|More {{effective}} than calendar-based methods, systems of fertility awareness that track <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> temperature, cervical mucus, or both, {{are known as}} symptoms-based methods. Teachers of symptoms-based methods take care to distance their systems from the poor reputation of the rhythm method. Many consider the rhythm method to have been obsolete for at least 20 years, and some even exclude calendar-based methods from their definition of fertility awareness.|$|E
40|$|The {{controversial}} {{question of}} the possible autonomy of centrioles, {{as shown by the}} persistence of all or part of them in the generative cell line throughout the life cycle of organisms, remains unresolved. All previous reports on shedding or withdrawal of cilia and flagella showed that their <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> (= centrioles) were retained in the cells where they may, or may not, subsequently disassemble. We show that in the fungusNeocallimastix sp. the <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> are discarded with the flagella when zoospores encyst. This shedding of <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> argues against centriolar persistence in any form and thus against their autonomy and endosymbiotic origin...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} a conserved "core" of proteins that are required for centriole duplication. A small number of additional proteins have recently been identified as potential duplication factors, but {{it is unclear whether}} any of these proteins are components of the core duplication machinery. In this study, we investigate the function of one of these proteins, Drosophila melanogaster Ana 3. We show that Ana 3 is present in centrioles and <b>basal</b> <b>bodies,</b> but its behavior is distinct from that of the core duplication proteins. Most importantly, we find that Ana 3 is required for the structural integrity of both centrioles and <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> and for centriole cohesion, but it is not essential for centriole duplication. We show that Ana 3 has a mammalian homologue, Rotatin, that also localizes to centrioles and <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> and appears to be essential for cilia function. Thus, Ana 3 defines a conserved family of centriolar proteins and plays an important part in ensuring the structural integrity of centrioles and <b>basal</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R

25|$|During spermiogenesis, the {{spermatids}} {{begin to}} form a tail by growing microtubules {{on one of the}} centrioles, which turns into <b>basal</b> <b>body.</b> These microtubules form an axoneme. Later the centriole is modified in the process of centrosome reduction. The anterior part of the tail (called midpiece) thickens because mitochondria are arranged around the axoneme to ensure energy supply. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive. The Golgi apparatus surrounds the now condensed nucleus, becoming the acrosome.|$|E

40|$|Techniques {{have been}} {{developed}} for the isolation of <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> with cilia attached or for the isolation of only <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> from the rabbit oviduct. Oviducts are removed, cut open, and placed in an extraction medium composed of 0. 25 M sucrose, 0. 001 M EDTA, 0. 025 M KCI, 0. 02 M Hepes buffer pH 7. 5, and 0. 05 % Triton X- 100. After the oviduct is agitated in this medium on a Vortex mixer for j/z h, the lumenal cortex of each ciliated cell, containing 200 - 300 <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> with cilia attached, is released as a unit. The cortices and the intact nuclei, which are also released from the disrupted cells, form a pellet when the extraction medium is centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min. When cortices which contain only <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> are to be isolated, the oviduct is subjected to conditions which remove the cilia prior to being processed as above. The cilia are removed when the oviduct is placed in a medium of 0. 25 M sucrose, 0. 01 M CaC 12, 0. 02 M Pipes buffer pH 5. 5, and 0. 05 % Triton X- 100 and continuously agitated for 15 min on a Vortex mixer. The low pH and Ca++ solubilize the transition region of the cilium and also prevent the cell from being disrupted. The cortices can be partially purified if the 600 -g pellet is resuspended in 2. 2 M sucrose pH 6. 5 and centrifuged at 40, 000 g for 2 h. Under these conditions, 85 % of the nuclei form a pellet and the cortices float {{to the surface of the}} sucrose. In addition to the <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> or <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> with cilia, the cortices contain some adherent cytoplasm, a few fibers, and a few vesicles which may be remnants of mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum. The structure of the cilia and the <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> isolated with either procedure is normal...|$|R
40|$|A new {{procedure}} for isolating pellicles from TetraJiymena yields stable whole pellicles in good yield. Electron microscopy of fixed pellicles showed inner membranes and <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> but no mitochondria. Sucrose gradient sedimentation of pellicle extracts labelled with [s H]uridine showed {{an increase in}} the ratio 17 s RNA to 25 s RNA and little 4 s RNA. The method of long term labelling presumably excluded messenger RNA. The technique of RNA/DNA hybridization in the presence of competing RNA showed that 35 % of the pellicle RNA which could hybridize (Cot 2 - 3) to DNA did not contain sequences in common with ribosomal RNA. It is proposed that a stable RNA which is not mitochondrial RNA, transfer RNA or ribosomal RNA is associated with the pellicle. Fixed pellicles stained with acridine orange showed brilliant yellow-green fluorescence at the <b>basal</b> <b>bodies.</b> RNase reduced or abolished fluorescence; DNase, histone, and lysozyme had no effect. Mercaptoethanol changed the colour of the fluorescence of <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> from yellow-green to orange, while not changing yellow nuclear fluorescence. Fluorescence of <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> was seen in pellicles isolated from log-phase cells and also in synchronized cells. It is proposed that <b>basal</b> <b>bodies</b> contain, or are associated with, singlestranded RNA held in a rigid configuration by protein. The implications of this proposal are discussed...|$|R
500|$|In {{interphase}} cells, {{the majority}} of NEDD9 localizes to focal adhesions. [...] However, some of the protein is also cytoplasmic, and small pools localize to the centrosome [...] and the <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> of cilia.

500|$|NEDD9 binds {{directly}} to the Aurora-A mitotic kinase at the centrosome, and promotes its activity, allowing cells to enter mitosis. [...] Degradation of NEDD9 {{at the end of}} mitosis contributes to timely Aurora-A degradation. [...] Cell overexpressing NEDD9 exhibit deficient cytokinesis resulting in accumulation of multipolar mitotic spindles and abnormal numbers of centrosomes. On the other hand, cells with depleted NEDD9 have prematurely separated centrosomes and are deficient in microtubule organizing activity at mitosis leading to abundance of monopolar or asymmetric spindles, preventing cells from entering mitosis. NEDD9 also regulates Aurora-A activation at the <b>basal</b> <b>body</b> of cilia as cells resorb cilia during early G1. [...] Cilia are small organelles that protrude from the surface of adherent cells that are the obligate site of action for proteins such as Hedgehog, and the polycystins: by influencing ciliary stability, NEDD9 is positioned to affect these signaling systems. Interaction of NEDD9 with Aurora A kinase may also play a role in tumor invasion. NEDD9 binds to and regulates acetylation of cortactin (CTTN) in an Aurora A kinase (AURKA)/HDAC6âdependent manner. The knockdown of NEDD9 or AURKA results in an increase in the amount of acetylated CTTN and a decrease in the binding of CTTN to F-actin. Overexpression of the deacetylation mimicking (9KR) mutant of CTTN is sufficient to restore actin dynamics at the leading edge and migration proficiency of the tumor cells.
