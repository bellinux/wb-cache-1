Cigarette smoke contains at least 73 known carcinogens, including <b>benzopyrene,</b> NNK, 1,3-butadiene and a radioactive isotope of polonium, polonium-210. Across the developed world, 90% of lung cancer deaths in men during the year 2000 were attributed to smoking (70% for women). Smoking accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases.|$|E
5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as <b>benzopyrene</b> diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E

Sidestream smoke contains 69 known carcinogens, particularly <b>benzopyrene</b> and other polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and radioactive decay products, such as polonium-210. Several well-established carcinogens have been shown by the tobacco companies' own research to be present at higher concentrations in second-hand smoke than in mainstream smoke.|$|E
25|$|Smoke {{contains}} several carcinogenic pyrolytic {{products that}} bind to DNA and cause genetic mutations. Particularly potent carcinogens are {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH), which are toxicated to mutagenic epoxides. The first PAH {{to be identified as}} a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was <b>benzopyrene,</b> which has been shown to toxicate into an epoxide that irreversibly attaches to a cell's nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. If the mutation inhibits programmed cell death, the cell can survive to become a cancer cell. Similarly, acrolein, which is abundant in tobacco smoke, also irreversibly binds to DNA, causes mutations and thus also cancer. However, it needs no activation to become carcinogenic.|$|E

Nicotine is known to produce conditioned place preference, a sign of enforcement value. Nicotine scores almost as highly as opioids on drug effect questionnaire liking scales, which are a rough indicator of addictive potential. Users may develop tolerance and dependence. Thousands of different substances in cigarette smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (such as <b>benzopyrene),</b> formaldehyde, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and phenols contribute to {{the harmful effects of}} smoking.

Our study aims to investigate the toxicity of nicotine with special emphasis on the replacement of animals. Furthermore, we intend to study the effect of nicotine, cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapours on human airways.

2500|$|PAHs {{that affect}} cancer {{initiation}} are typically first chemically modified by enzymes into metabolites that react with DNA, leading to mutations.

Mutagenic PAHs, such as <b>benzopyrene,</b> usually have {{four or more}} aromatic rings {{as well as a}} [...] "bay region", a structural pocket that increases reactivity of the molecule to the metabolizing enzymes. Mutagenic metabolites of PAHs include diol epoxides, quinones, and radical PAH cations. These metabolites can bind to DNA at specific sites, forming bulky complexes called DNA adducts that can be stable or unstable. Stable adducts may lead to DNA replication errors, while unstable adducts react with the DNA strand, removing a purine base (either adenine or guanine). Such mutations, if they are not repaired, can transform genes encoding for normal cell signaling proteins into cancer-causing oncogenes.

2500|$|In the UK and the USA, an {{increase}} in lung cancer rates, formerly [...] "among the rarest forms of disease", was noted by the 1930s, but its cause remained unknown and even the credibility of this increase was sometimes disputed as late as 1950. For example, in Connecticut, reported age-adjusted incidence rates of lung cancer among males increased 220% between 1935–39 and 1950-54. In the UK, the share of lung cancer among all cancer deaths in men increased from 1.5% in 1920 to 19.7% in 1947. Nevertheless, these increases were questioned as potentially caused by increased reporting and improved methods of diagnosis.

30|$|Diagnostic {{considerations}} when encountering oral melanosis {{should include}} physiological, pathological, and environmental variables. Physiological oral melanosis is usually localised to the gingival and buccal mucosa and is bilateral and symmetrical, brownish in colour, and clinically {{more common among}} dark-skinned populations [1]. Oral melanotic macules present as well-circumscribed brown-to-black flat lesions, mainly on the lower vermilion. The pathogenesis of physiological melanotic macules remains controversial; both reactive and genetic factors may be involved [6]. Oral nevi typically appear as solitary brown-to-black mucosal macules, mainly on the palate and buccal mucosa. Although the pathogenesis of nevi remains unknown, {{it has been suggested}} that the lesions are benign neoplasms. No malignant transformation of oral nevi has yet been reported, and no evidence points to an increased risk of oral melanoma in affected subjects [24]. Notably, palatal melanosis must be differentiated from an oral melanoma, which may present as an asymptomatic brown-to-grey-black macula with irregular borders. Further, an oral melanoma grows rapidly and exhibits ulcerative evolution with bleeding and pain [25]. Several systemic diseases, including Addison’s disease, Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, McCune–Albright syndrome, Cowden syndrome, neurofibromatosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, haemochromatosis, and hyperthyroidism, as well as uncommon conditions such as Nelson’s syndrome, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia syndrome, Laugier–Hunziker syndrome, and the Carney complex, may feature oral melanotic macules [1, 26, 27]. Melanosis associated with these conditions is due to increased levels of melanin within the basal cell layer, attributable to incontinent melanophages in the lamina propria, in the absence of iron deposits and bleeding [3, 28]. Oral pigmentation induced by smoking (smoker’s melanosis) may be associated with the effects of components of tobacco on oral melanocytes [29]. It has been hypothesised that stimulation of melanin production may be a protective reaction of the oral mucosa, associated with detoxification of polycyclic amines and <b>benzopyrenes,</b> thus being a side effect of tobacco use [30]. Post-inflammatory melanin deposits scattered throughout the oral connective tissue are frequently observed in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as oral lichen planus, pemphigoid, and pemphigus [31]. Hyperpigmentation following inflammation may be caused by an increase in melanogenesis triggered by cytokines and reactive oxygen species, which induce melanocyte activity and the proliferation of dendritic cells, and increase tyrosinase activity [31, 32].|$|R
