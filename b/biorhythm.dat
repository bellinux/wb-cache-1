They have also {{been the subject of}} a number of unofficial documentaries, commissioned and produced by individuals independent of the group.

The Spice Girls have had episodes dedicated to them in several music biography series, including VH1's Behind the Music, E!

Notable appearances include Saturday Night Live (SNL), The Oprah Winfrey Show, two Royal Variety Performances, and the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.

40|$|Background: <b>Biorhythms</b> {{are one of}} the {{fundamental}} attributes of life. <b>Biorhythms</b> are found at all levels of organization of a living system, they are genetically determined. In the postmodern information society they can be traced in the field of space research, medicine, education, and the production sectors. Objective: The article makes the basic characteristics of <b>biorhythms,</b> their classification and bonds with an emphasis on the human body. Management system <b>biorhythms,</b> manifestations of their disorders are listed and the use <b>biorhythms</b> in medical and educational practice and on a new view of aging are pointed out. Methods: This is a review article, which was based on the analytic-synthetic approach using printed and electronic literary sources. Results: <b>Biorhythms</b> are manifested as cyclical alternation of physiological processes occurring in the body, as well as the alternation of&#x 202 F;the intensity of these processes. Living systems possess endogenous clock synchronized alternating light and dark. <b>Biorhythms</b> can be divided according to the length of their period into ultradian (less than 20 hours), circadian (20 - 28 hours) and infradian (longer than 28 hours). <b>Biorhythms</b> are at a higher level represented by a series of&#x 202 F;brain nuclei, endocrine glands, retina and peripheral organ centers. It operates through a hierarchy of cells, tissues and organs to macroorganism, they are associated with a number of important processes in the body, nature and the&#x 202 F;universe. Their basic role is to enable the existence and adaptability of any living system. Appropriate timing of&#x 202 F;medical interventions, educational process, work and relaxation are also associated with <b>biorhythms.</b> Knowledge and respect of human <b>biorhythms</b> can help to harmonize day cycle, improve efficiency at work, use of leisure time and relaxation. Conclusions: Human life and health are influenced by a numbers of factors, <b>biorhythms</b> are one of&#x 202 F;them. Realistically, we can use knowledge about human <b>biorhythms</b> for more effective work and rest, to learn to sense and&#x 202 F;respect the needs of the body. We can actively intervene in our own lifestyle, try to minimize behavioral risks and reinforce the operation of protective factors...|$|R

40|$|When {{stressors}} are present, {{they cause}} delays or phase {{shifts in the}} <b>biorhythms</b> of the body because the body needs to stop its normal habitual work and mobilize for respond to the stressors. The genetically-inherited weak organ, being with lowest energy, will not have enough energy to propel the phase shifts, and they will accumulate there, which will make its functioning sluggish and its <b>biorhythms</b> weakly integrated. When the accumulated phase shifts surpass the ultimate level, which the genetically weak organ can tolerate, its <b>biorhythms</b> will become desynchronized, which will lead to chronic disease of this organ. This article discusses the dynamic of phase shift changes caused by stress and uses Lyapounov criteria for stability to evaluate how close the genetically weak organ is to becoming chronically sick. Both, the effect of self-calming and irregular self-calming of the <b>biorhythms</b> are considered. Comment: 14 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the chronobiological aspects of dandruff, hair shedding and alopecia. METHODS: This study {{was performed in}} eight men suffering from such a scalp condition. They were examined 40 times at regular intervals for five consecutive years. Hair-density assessments and trichograms were performed at least twice per trimester on the parietal region of the scalp, corresponding to an area where dandruff was present. RESULTS: A positive correlation {{was found between the}} percentage of telogen hairs and dandruff severity as assessed by the squamometry index. Bimodal yearly <b>biorhythms</b> were found for dandruff severity, telogen counts and hair loss between two consecutive visits. The chronobiological fluctuations were prominent in some study participants, but remained inconspicuous in others. The <b>biorhythms</b> were almost synchronized in all participants, showing variations over the year.
