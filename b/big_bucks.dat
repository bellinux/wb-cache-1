The documentary was produced by and aired on GSN (in association with Lionsgate and FremantleMedia, the latter of which now owns the rights to Press Your Luck), and broke all previous viewership records for the network. The <b>Big</b> <b>Bucks</b> documentary included additional footage, directly from the original master tapes, that had been edited out of the episodes for their initial broadcast. The original telecast was dedicated to the memory of Bill Carruthers, producer/creator of Press Your Luck, who had died before the airing.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Hunter is an arcade hunting game {{released}} by Play Mechanix, Inc. in 2000. The well-received game spawned {{a series of}} sequels including <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Hunter: Shooter's Challenge, <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Hunter II: Sportsman's Paradise, <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Hunter: Call of the Wild, <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Hunter Pro (2006), <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Safari (2008), <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Hunter Pro: Open Season, and <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> World (2010), which combined the content of <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Hunter Pro: Open Season and the newly updated <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Safari: Outback. In 2012, <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> HD was released. This latest installment includes elements from both <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Hunter Pro and <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Safari in high-definition. In Fall of 2009, Play Mechanix partnered with Merge Interactive to release an iOS version of <b>Big</b> <b>Buck</b> Hunter Pro for the iPhone.

2500|$|In {{an article}} {{comparing}} the contemporary art scene with show business, renowned critic Robert Hughes wrote that Koons is “an extreme and self-satisfied {{manifestation of the}} sanctimony that attaches to <b>big</b> <b>bucks.</b> Koons really does think he's Michelangelo and is not shy to say so. The significant thing {{is that there are}} collectors, especially in America, who believe it. He has the slimy assurance, the gross patter about transcendence through art, of a blow-dried Baptist selling swamp acres in Florida. And the result is that you can't imagine America's singularly depraved culture without him.” Hughes placed Koons's work just above that of Seward Johnson and was quoted in a New York Times article as having stated that comparing their careers was [...] "like debating the merits of dog excrement versus cat excrement".|$|E

The early shows were successful, and the program stayed on Sunday nights from 6:00-7:30pm ET for its first season, shifting to 6:30-8:00pm ET in its second. NBC went full-throttle {{in an attempt to}} keep radio from its predicted death, and The Big Show was thought to be a key to that effort.

2500|$|Following {{the third}} {{film in the}} Scream series, Campbell {{appeared}} in several films that received a limited theatrical release but were well reviewed by critics, including the 2000 film Panic, in which she appeared alongside William H.

Campbell co-wrote, produced and starred in the 2003 film The Company, about Chicago's Joffrey Ballet, and the independent film When Will I Be Loved (2004), which was praised by critic Roger Ebert, but received only a brief and limited theatrical release. In Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide (2009 edition), the film critic describes it as an [...] "Unlikable film ... crammed with coldhearted characters who are obsessed with <b>big</b> <b>bucks,</b> sleazy sex, and endless hustling." ...|$|E
50|$|In the 2010-2011 season, <b>Big</b> <b>Buck's</b> {{was again}} {{aimed at the}} Ladbrokes World Hurdle. In every race prior to the World Hurdle, he won, not even coming off the bridle once.

The slow pace set by Cross Kennon never suited <b>Big</b> <b>Buck's,</b> but they both travelled well throughout the race. Ruby Walsh kicked <b>Big</b> <b>Buck's</b> into the lead two out with Grand Crus stalking and moving well. However, <b>Big</b> <b>Buck's</b> accelerated away to win a third consecutive World Hurdle by 1 lengths.|$|R

60|$|That was {{far back}} on the ridges, {{where most of the}} <b>big</b> <b>bucks</b> loaf and hide, each one by himself, during the summer. Down at the lake, however, there were two or three that for some reason {{occasionally}} showed themselves with the other deer, but were so shy and wild that hunting them without a gun was almost impossible. It was one of these big fellows that now stood half hid in the underbrush within twenty yards of me, watching the deer's game impatiently.|$|E
60|$|In {{the midst}} of the play, and after I had watched it for a full half-hour, there was a swift rustle in the woods on my right, and I caught my breath sharply at sight of a {{magnificent}} buck standing half hid in the underbrush. There were two or three <b>big</b> <b>bucks</b> with splendid antlers that lived lazily on the slopes above this part of the lake, and that I had been watching and following for several weeks. Unlike the does and fawns and young bucks, they were wild as hawks and selfish as cats. They rarely showed themselves in the open, and if surprised there with other deer they bounded away at the first sight or sniff of danger. Does and little fawns, when they saw you, would instantly stamp and whistle to warn the other deer before they had taken the first step to save themselves or investigate the danger; but the <b>big</b> <b>bucks</b> would bound or glide away, according to the method of your approach, and in saving their own skins, as they thought, would have absolutely no concern {{for the safety of the}} herd feeding near by.--And that is one reason why, in a natural state, deer rarely allow the bucks and bulls to lead them.|$|E
6000|$|... “Flush of Gold {{caught sight}} of me, called me over, shook hands with me, and {{introduced}} me to the Count. She was beautiful. I was as mad for her then as ever. She smiled into my eyes and said I must sign {{as one of the}} witnesses. And there was no refusing her. She was ever a child, cruel as children are cruel. Also, {{she told me she was}} in possession of the only two bottles of champagne in Dawson—or that had been in Dawson the night before; and before I knew it I was scheduled to drink her and the Count’s health. Everybody crowded round, the captain of the steamboat, very prominent, trying to ring in on the wine, I guess. It was a funny wedding. On the upper deck the hospital wrecks, with various feet in the grave, gathered and looked down to see. There were Indians all jammed in the circle, too, <b>big</b> <b>bucks,</b> and their squaws and kids, to say nothing of about twenty-five snarling wolf-dogs. The missionary lined the two of them up and started in with the service. And just then a dog-fight started, high up on the pile of freight—Pee-lat lying beside the big box, and a white-haired brute belonging to one of the Indians. The fight wasn’t explosive at all. The brutes just snarled at each other from a distance—tapping at each other long-distance, you know, saying dast and dassent, dast and dassent. The noise was rather disturbing, but you could hear the missionary’s voice above it.|$|E

6000|$|The leading {{spirit of}} the family was, I am {{inclined}} to fancy, Mrs. Hanson. Her social brilliancy somewhat dazzled the others, and she had more of the small change of sense. It was she who faced Kelmar, for instance; and perhaps {{if she had been}} alone, Kelmar would have had no rule within her doors. Rufe, to be sure, had a fine, sober, open-air attitude of mind, seeing the world without exaggeration--perhaps, we may even say, without enough; for he lacked, along with the others, that commercial idealism which puts so high a value on time and money. Sanity itself is a kind of convention. Perhaps Rufe was wrong; but, looking on life plainly, he was unable to see that croquet or poker were in any way less important than, for instance, mending his waggon. Even his own profession, hunting, was dear to him mainly as a sort of play; even that he would have neglected, had it not appealed to his imagination. His hunting suit, for instance, had cost I should be afraid to say how many bucks--the currency in which he paid his way; it was all befringed, after the Indian fashion, and it was dear to his heart. The pictorial side of his daily business was never forgotten. He was even anxious to stand for his picture in those buckskin, hunting clothes; and I remember how he once warmed almost into enthusiasm, his dark blue eyes growing perceptibly larger, as he planned the composition in which he should appear, [...] "with the horns of some real <b>big</b> <b>bucks,</b> and dogs, and a camp on a crick" [...] (creek, stream).|$|E
