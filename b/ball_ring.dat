40|$|Abstract: The 3 -D multi-body contact {{dynamics}} {{simulation model}} {{was built by}} ADAMS base on the Hertz contact theory and multi-body contact dynamics, which considered the dynamics relationship among the <b>ball,</b> <b>ring</b> and cage of the bearing. Considering the clearances, frictions and loads, results that contained deformation and displacement of the bearing, trajectory of the CM of the cage and the dynamic contact force were obtained {{by means of the}} 3 -D multi-body contact dynamics model simulation and statics calculation. The outcomes got from two different methods are consistent, so the 3 -D multi-body contact dynamics simulation model has the positive significance on dynamic design and engineering application of the bearing...|$|E

50|$|Although juggling in {{its western}} form {{involving}} props such as <b>balls,</b> <b>rings,</b> and clubs is rarely performed in modern China, at certain periods in Chinese history {{it was much}} more popular. In fact, some of the world's earliest known jugglers were Chinese warriors and entertainers who lived {{during the time of the}} Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. References to these artists in ancient Chinese literature have preserved records of their incredible achievements. From such references, it appears that juggling was a well-regarded and highly developed form of ancient Chinese art.|$|R

40|$|As {{result of}} {{increase}} of customers’ demands, products become more complexes and dynamics control increased its role into product development. As example, clothing washing machines use LeBlanc balancers {{in order to}} reduce vibration issues. Nevertheless, the behaviour of such apparatus is still hard to describe and the numerical simulation of this sort of vibration control is based on <b>ball</b> <b>rings.</b> The main goal of this work is to define and characterize a numerical model that describes the hydrodynamics balance ring in the transient state in addition to steady state models. As consequence, the behaviour of balance ring was identified in a computational fluid dynamics tool and an equation that describes restoration forces, unbalance, force phase, and eccentricity was found...|$|R

50|$|Juggling {{clubs are}} a prop used by jugglers. Juggling clubs are often simply called clubs by jugglers and {{sometimes}} {{are referred to}} as pins or batons by non-jugglers. Clubs are one of the three most popular props used by jugglers; the others being <b>balls</b> and <b>rings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Juggling {{clubs are}} used to perform unique tricks which are not {{possible}} with other juggling props like <b>balls</b> and <b>rings.</b> Examples of these include chin rolls, helicopter spins, various types of traps, and various types of throws unique to clubs because of the shape and spin of these props.|$|R
50|$|Passing can be {{performed}} with three or more juggling props (for examples <b>balls</b> and <b>rings)</b> but is most commonly performed with clubs.

50|$|Clubs are {{the prop}} {{of choice for}} passing between jugglers.

40|$|Machining induced {{residual}} stress states {{contribute to the}} distortion of machined components during heat treatments. Thus, ideally a complete characterization of the components {{residual stress}} state is required. Magnetic and micromagnetic analysis of residual stresses can represent an important gain of time if compared to X-ray diffraction. Another important advantage is the access of inner faces of components like <b>ball</b> bearing <b>rings.</b> This study presents a comparison of these two methods for the characterization of outer and inner surfaces of <b>ball</b> bearing <b>rings.</b> A good calibration of micromagnetic measurements with X-ray diffraction data is necessary. Reliable results then can be achieved and the residual stress states of rings can be characterized. Effects of clamping systems and feed on the residual stress levels and distribution will be discussed, as well as complex interactions. An implementation of the presented micromagnetic method for non-destructive control in large manufacturing series could be possible...|$|R
