40|$|Presented herein is a {{scalable}} {{framework for}} estimating path <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities</b> in optical burst switched (OBS) networks where limited wavelength conversion is possible. Although presented {{under the guise}} of OBS, it is pertinent to a broader class of optical networks based on the principle of bufferless unacknowledged switching. By applying the framework to the NSFNET topology, it is shown that even the most limited conversion range may reduce path <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities</b> by several orders of magnitude, compared with no wavelength conversion. Moreover, contrary to previous results derived for all-optical non-OBS networks with acknowledgement, OBS with full wavelength conversion achieves significantly lower <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities</b> than OBS with limited wavelength conversion when the conversion range is small. Underpinning the framework is a generalization of the classical reduced load approximation. Assuming links evolve independently of each other allows decoupling of the network into its constituent links. A set of fixed-point equations describing the evolution of each conversion range are then solved by successive substitution to estimate link <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities.</b> Having these link <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities,</b> path <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities</b> are evaluated. The complexity of the framework is dominated by the wavelength conversion range and is independent of the number of wavelengths per link under certain symmetry conditions. Both just-in-time (JIT) and just-enough-time (JET) scheduling are considered. Simulations are implemented to corroborate the accuracy of the framework...|$|R

40|$|We are {{concerned}} with the performance evaluation of loss networks, in particular under a form of admission control known as trunk reservation. The most important performance measures are the <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities</b> for the various types of call (effectively the amount of potential revenue lost). For the uncontrolled system, under several regimes, the Erlang Fixed Point (EFP) method provides a good approximation for the <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities,</b> but when these regimes are not operative the method does not perform as well. In many cases this is because the key assumption of independent blocking does not hold.

The total number of sources is assumed to be infinite. The Erlang B formula calculates the <b>blocking</b> <b>probability</b> of a buffer-less loss system, where a request that is not served immediately is aborted, causing that no requests become queued.

In this paper, we study the <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities</b> in a {{wavelength}} division multiplexing-based asynchronous bufferless optical packet/burst switch {{equipped with a}} bank of tuneable wavelength converters dedicated to each output fiber line. Wavelength converter sharing, {{also referred to as}} partial wavelength conversion, corresponds to the case of a number of converters shared amongst a larger number of wavelength channels. In this study, we present a probabilistic framework for exactly calculating the packet <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities</b> for optical packet/burst switching systems utilizing wavelength converter sharing.

5000|$|... “Teletraffic {{theory is}} the {{application}} of mathematics to the measurement, modeling, and control of traffic in telecommunications networks (Willinger and Paxson, 1998). The aim of traffic modeling is to find stochastic processes to represent the behavior of traffic. Working at the Copenhagen Telephone Company in the 1910s, A. K. Erlang famously characterized telephone traffic at the call level by certain probability distributions for arrivals of new calls and their holding times. Erlang applied the traffic models to estimate the telephone switch capacity needed to achieve a given call <b>blocking</b> <b>probability.</b> The Erlang blocking formulas had tremendous practical interest for public carriers because telephone facilities (switching and transmission) involved considerable investments. Over several decades, Erlang’s work stimulated the use of queuing theory, and applied probability in general, to engineer the public switched telephone network. Teletraffic theory for packet networks has seen considerable progress in recent decades (Adas, 1997; Frost and Melamed, 1994; Michiel and Laevens, 1997; Park and Willinger, 2000). Significant advances {{have been made in}} long-range dependence, wavelet, and multi fractal approaches. At the same time, traffic modeling continues to be challenged by evolving network technologies and new multimedia applications. For example, wireless technologies allow greater mobility of users. Mobility must be an additional consideration for modeling traffic in wireless networks (Thajchayapong and Peha, 2006; Wu, Lin, and Lan, 2002). Traffic modeling is clearly an ongoing process without a real end. Traffic models represent our best current understanding of traffic behavior, but our understanding will change and grow over time. ”1 ...|$|E
5000|$|Measurements {{are useful}} and {{necessary}} for verifying the actual network performance. However, measurements {{do not have}} the level of abstraction that makes traffic models useful. Traffic models can be used for hypothetical problem solving whereas traffic measurements only reflect current reality. In probabilistic terms, a traffic trace is a realization of a random process, whereas a traffic model is a random process. Thus, traffic models have universality. A traffic trace gives insight about a particular traffic source, but a traffic model gives insight about all traffic sources of that type. Traffic models have many uses, but at least three major ones. One important use of traffic models is to properly dimension network resources for a target level of QOS. It was mentioned earlier that Erlang developed models of voice calls to estimate telephone switch capacity to achieve a target call <b>blocking</b> <b>probability.</b> Similarly, models of packet traffic are needed to estimate the bandwidth and buffer resources to provide acceptable packet delays and packet loss probability. Knowledge of the average traffic rate is not sufficient. It is known from queuing theory that queue lengths increase with the variability of traffic (Kleinrock, 1976). Hence, an understanding of traffic burstiness or variability is needed to determine sufficient buffer sizes at nodes and link capacities (Barakat, et al., 2003). A second important use of traffic models is to verify network performance under specific traffic controls. For example, given a packet scheduling algorithm, {{it would be possible to}} evaluate the network performance resulting from different traffic scenarios. For another example, a popular area of research is new improvements to the TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. It is critical that any algorithm is stable and allows multiple hosts to share bandwidth fairly, while sustaining a high throughput. Effective evaluation of the stability, fairness, and throughput of new algorithms would not be possible without realistic source models. A third important use of traffic models is admission control. In particular, connection oriented networks such as ATM depends on admission control to block new connections to maintain QOS guarantees. A simple admission strategy could be based on the peak rate of a new connection; a new connection is admitted if the available bandwidth is greater than the peak rate. However, that strategy would be overly conservative because a variable bit-rate connection may need significantly less bandwidth than its peak rate. A more sophisticated admission strategy is based on effective bandwidths (Kelly, 1996). The source traffic behavior is translated into an effective bandwidth between the peak rate and average rate, which is the specific amount of bandwidth required to meet a given QoS constraint. The effective bandwidth depends on the variability of the source.1 ...|$|E
40|$|Call-blocking probabilities {{are among}} the key {{performance}} measures in mobile communications networks. For the analysis of these <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities,</b> mobile networks can be modelled as networks of Erlang loss queues with common capacity restrictions dictated by the distribution of frequencies over {{the cells of the}} network. However, due to the time-varying load offered to the cells of such networks, and due to the mobility pattern of users that varies over time, <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities</b> usually cannot be obtained in closed form. The relation between networks of Erlang loss queues and networks of infinite server queues, for which also the time-dependent occupancy distribution is known and is given by a multidimensional Poisson distribution, suggests to use that distribution as approximate distribution for the occupancy distribution for the network of Erlang loss queues. This paper extends this so called Modified Offered Load (MOL) approximation to networks of Erlang loss queues with the additional feature that subscribers that find their call blocked attempt to redial to continue their call. For GSM networks operating under Fixed Channel Allocation such that capacity cannot be shared among the cells, it is shown that <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities</b> are increasing in the redial rates so that the MOL approximation that is most accurate for the maximal value for the redial rates {{turns out to be a}} fairly accurate approximation of the upper bound for the <b>blocking</b> <b>probabilities</b> of interest.
