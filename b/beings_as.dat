5|$|The {{wildebeest}} {{benefit the}} ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta. They are economically important for human <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> {{they are a}} major tourist attraction. They also provide important products like leather to humans. The wildebeest, however, can also {{have a negative impact}} on humans. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
5|$|In 2029, {{aboard the}} United States Air Force space station Oberon, Leo Davidson {{works closely with}} {{primates}} who are trained for space missions. His favorite simian co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station, a small space pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Against his commanding officer's orders, Leo takes a second pod and goes in pursuit of Pericles. Entering the storm, Leo loses contact with the Oberon and crashes on a planet called Ashlar in the year 5021. He discovers {{that the world is}} ruled by humanoid apes who speak English, use domesticated horses for transportation, and treat human <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} names of hells, {{as well as}} the type of sinners sent to a {{particular}} hell, varies from text to text; however, many scriptures describe 28 hells. After death, messengers of Yama called Yamadutas bring all beings to the court of Yama, where he weighs the virtues and the vices of the being and passes a judgement, sending the virtuous to Svarga (heaven) and the sinners to one of the hells. The stay in Svarga or Naraka is generally described as temporary. After the quantum of punishment is over, the souls are reborn as lower or higher <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> per their merits. In a few texts, hell is described as a bottomless pit of darkness where souls are trapped for eternity and deprived of rebirth.|$|E

40|$|The various {{positions}} in the suit about “hundredthalers” opened by Kant’s criticism of ontological argument are compared. It is argued that Heidegger’s concept of <b>being</b> <b>as</b> transcendental predicate cannot be identified with Frege’s treatment of existence as a second-order predicate. Furthermore it is shown that the understanding of <b>being</b> <b>as</b> perfection by Aquinas is quite similar to Kant’s concept of <b>being</b> <b>as</b> absolute positing in the via eminentiae perspective...|$|R

5|$|Arriving at the Necromanteion, the reunited crew is {{attacked}} by Clytius, Pasiphaë, {{and a group}} of their minions. Each of the demigods uses some aspect of their newly strengthened powers or identities to help defeat these monsters; for example, Hazel's new power and alliance with Hecate helps her defeat Pasiphaë and Clytius. During the questers' journey in the mortal world, Percy and Annabeth have been travelling through Tartarus {{to the other side of}} the Doors of Death, aided by the Titan Iapetus (Bob) and a few other <b>beings.</b> <b>As</b> the other demigods fight in the world above, Percy and Annabeth's group reaches the Doors and fights the personification of Tartarus to destroy the chains holding the Doors in place. Bob stays behind amongst hordes of angry monsters to defend the Doors while Percy and Annabeth escape. Once the full quest group is safely reassembled in the mortal world, Reyna arrives on her dying Pegasus. Annabeth says that Reyna, as a Roman, should bring the Athena Parthenos (in the Argo IIs hold) back to Camp Half-Blood to appease both the Greeks and Romans, with Nico and Coach Hedge volunteering to accompany her.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

He finds that especially in his final discussion of how one discovers <b>being</b> <b>as</b> <b>being,</b> Maritain’s account suffers greatly from {{the absence of any}} appeal to Aquinas’s negative judgment of separation and also from the omission of reference to the role of judgments of existence in one’s discovery of a premetaphysical notion of being. Wippel finds no evidence in Aquinas’s texts for Maritain’s defense of an intuition of being or of existence...|$|R
