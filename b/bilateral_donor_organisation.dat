50|$|The Working Party on Aid Effectiveness’ primary {{function}} is to measure and encourage progress in implementing the commitments of the 2005 Paris Declaration and provide guidance on policy and good practice. The Working Party comprises senior policy advisers from the 23 DAC members, 23 developing countries and 11 multilateral organisations. It has a unique “tripartite” chairing arrangement, including representatives of a <b>bilateral</b> <b>donor</b> <b>organisation,</b> a multilateral organization and a developing-country partner. This reflects the partnership commitments embodied in the Paris Declaration. The WP-EFF also engages actively with civil society organisations. In order to effectively cover its broad mandate, it has established a number of Joint Ventures to examine particular areas of interest, including monitoring the Paris Declaration, public financial management, procurement, and managing for development results.|$|E

After decades of generous (and ongoing) {{political}} and financial support for privatisation from international financial institutions and <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors,</b> these development <b>organisations</b> have effectively ignored the remunicipalisation trend. Support for the implementation of remunicipalisation is practically non-existent (with the exception of limited funding for public-public partnerships from UN-Habitat [...] ). In some cases international donors even have attempted to undermine remunicipalisation efforts, making the transition to public services an even more difficult one (such as the World Bank’s attempts to block remunicipalisation in Dar es Salaam and Lagos).|$|R

The paper also identifies potential sources of influence that threaten judicial independence, and reflects upon what insights Vanuatu’s experiences may provide into the influence of informal networks on judicial independence more broadly.

40|$|In {{the debate}} about a global {{transformation}} of energy systems, technology transfer and financial aid are seen as crucial factors {{for the promotion of}} sustainable energy in de-veloping countries. As the single most important aid agency, the World Bank claims to fight both energy poverty and climate change in its partner countries. This paper ana-lyzes the World Bank 2 ̆ 019 s involvement in the Mozambican energy sector by applying en-vironmental, social and economic criteria for sustainable development. The analysis is based on interviews conducted with World Bank staff, Mozambican officials, represen-tatives of <b>bilateral</b> <b>donor</b> <b>organisations,</b> NGO activists, and energy experts. It focuses on completed and on-going World Bank projects in Mozambique 2 ̆ 019 s electricity, coal and gas sectors. The study shows that the World Bank 2 ̆ 019 s involvement in each sector has both positive and negative impacts. While the World Bank claims to have stopped funding new coal development projects, it is still promoting the large-scale resumption of coal production by a private investor. It is also promoting a radical reform of the Mozambican electricity sector that might produce a decrease in energy access, especially in rural areas. At the same time the Bank is advancing the off-grid use of renewable energy and the im-provement of access to electricity in peri-urban areas. By facilitating the export of natu-ral gas to Mozambique 2 ̆ 019 s highly coal-dependent neighbouring country South Africa, it contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in that country. The gas ex-ports will generate considerable additional revenues for the Mozambican government. The future quality of governance in Mozambique will determine whether these revenues will be used for poverty alleviation or not. The case study further shows that the World Bank increasingly respects its safeguard policies in specific investment projects and integrates environmental concerns in its sector projects. At the same time it seems to keep on missing its mandate to alleviate poverty by over-emphasising liberal market reforms. Since the World Bank is both promoting fossil fuel projects and renewable energy (with GEF funds) it does not con-sistently incorporate climate change concerns in its energy policy choices...|$|R
40|$|Following the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, {{international}} development policy discourses {{have focused on}} partnership as an overarching principle. With a focus on participation and non-hierarchical relationships, new partnerships aim to reconstitute the aid relationship {{in a way that}} obviates power inequality and hegemony. However, empirical studies of these partnerships are scarce. This paper uses social network analysis to analyse relationships between organisations involved in prominent partnerships for education in {{international development}}. Our analysis of an original dataset demonstrates that <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors,</b> civil society <b>organisations,</b> and international organisations are most likely to occupy central positions in this network, meaning that they enjoy high levels of connectivity to many organisations. Literature on international networks suggests that these organisations would therefore shape the flow of information and ideas between organisations, influence the distribution of resources among members, and determine normative preferences of the partnerships. In contrast, recipient governments, private businesses, and universities occupy peripheral positions. We contextualise these findings with respect to literature on aid in international education and privatisation in the political economy of educational development...|$|R

Paviignani Background: In most societies the health marketplace is pluralistic in character, with a mix of formal and informal providers. In high-income countries, state regulation of the market helps ensure quality and access and mitigate market failures. In the present study, using Haiti as a case study, we explore what happens to the functioning of the pluralistic health marketplace in severely disrupted environments where the informal sector is able to flourish. Methods: The overall research design was qualitative. Research methods included an extensive documentary and policy analysis, based on peer-reviewed articles, books and “grey ” literature–government policy and program reports, unpublished research and evaluations, reviews and reviews from key multilateral and <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors,</b> and non-government <b>organisations,</b> combined with field site visits and in-depth key informant interviews (N = 45). Results: The findings show that state fragility has resulted in a privatised, commoditised and largely unregulated and informal health market.

This paper suggests a trade-off: multiple <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> for each recipient may imply coordination and strategic problems but intermediating through a multilateral may dilute individual donor objectives. The paper conducts traditional panel and truly bilateral regressions with bilateral-pair, fixed effects to model aid allocation decisions.

40|$|This study sets up {{a process}} for the {{systematic}} evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} aid agencies in aid delivery through evaluating the projects and programmes that they are implementing. It evaluates and compares five different aid agencies comprising of a <b>bilateral</b> aid <b>donor,</b> non-government <b>organisation,</b> community based organisation, development bank and multilateral aid donor. The common ground for comparison is that these agencies have all been providing assistance to, or working in, the forestry sector in the Solomon Islands over a relatively long period. The study found {{that it is possible to}} apply a systematic comparative evaluation process to aid agencies, and the projects and programmes that they were implementing, despite seemingly large differences in aid philosophy and aid management among them. By applying systematic comparative evaluations such as the one set up in this study it is possible to learn from all agencies how to enhance the effectiveness of aid delivery for the ultimate benefit of donor and recipient alike. The study found that none of the agencies reviewed in the study were necessarily more effective than any other agency in aid delivery. There was likewise no evidence that any one theoretical position on development, or any particular approach to aid delivery was necessarily any more effective when it came to implementing aid projects or programmes. There are too many variables affecting the implementation of projects and programmes for any one approach to aid delivery or theoretical position to be the most effective in all cases...|$|R

40|$|This paper, {{based on}} a review of SIDA’s funding of NGOs in Bangladesh, explores the {{changing}} relationships between <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors,</b> Northern NGOs (NNGOs), and Southern NGOs (SNGOs). It compares direct and indirect funding routes between donors and SNGOs. Most SIDA funding of SNGOs was previously undertaken through Swedish NGOs. As SNGO competence and capacity has increased through their own efforts at professionalisation, through wider recognition and support from government and by the provision of `capacity building’ partnerships with NNGOs, these Southern organisations have taken up positions within the burgeoning `third sectors’ of aid-recipient countries alongside the governmental and business sectors. SIDA has increasingly funded SNGOs directly through its Dhaka office. The paper sets out to address two main themes {{in the context of}} Swedish aid to NGOs in Bangladesh. Firstly, as <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> provide an increasing proportion of their resources to NGOs, how can sound and responsible funding relationships based on mutual trust rebuilt between <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> and NGOs?

Every <b>bilateral</b> <b>donor</b> conditions aid on conflict. The United States allocates large amounts of development aid to countries bordering a conflict, both pre- and post-Cold War.

40|$|In this paper, we {{perform a}} Tobit {{analysis}} of aid allocations, covering the period 1999 - 2002 and accounting for both altruistic and selfish donor motives. We first compare the allocative behavior of all <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> taken together {{with that of}} multilateral aid agencies, and then look at nine major <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> individually. It turns out that poorer countries get clearly more aid from both <b>bilateral</b> and multilateral <b>donors,</b> {{with the possible exception}} of France and Japan. Most <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> and the multilateral agencies are also found to direct significantly more aid to well governed recipients if governance is measured by the World Bank?s CPIA. If the CPIA is replaced by the Kaufmann index, however, the policy orientation of aid becomes extremely weak. In contrast to a recent paper by Dollar and Levin (2004), our estimates do neither suggest that multilateral aid is more poverty and policy oriented than bilateral aid, nor that IDA performs particularly well within the group of multilateral donors. Post-conflict resolution, the third altruistic motive considered in the paper, emerges as a significant determinant of aid allocations in 2002. The importance of selfish aid motives clearly differs between <b>bilateral</b> and multilateral <b>donors.</b> We find no evidence that donor countries were able to push through their individual trade and political interests at the multilateral level. By contrast, the export-related self interest of DAC countries provided a fairly strong incentive to grant bilateral aid, as did colonial ties.
