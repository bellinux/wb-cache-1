60|$|There was {{something}} of her brother's large liberality about Mrs. Shelton, a tiny lady with affectionate eyes, warm cheeks, and chilly feet; fond as a cat of a chair by the fire, and full of the sympathy that has no insight. She kissed her son at once with rapture, and, as usual, began to talk of his engagement. For {{the first time a}} tremor of doubt ran through her son; his mother's view of it grated on him like the sight of a <b>blue-pink</b> dress; it was too rosy. Her splendid optimism, damped him; it had too little traffic with the reasoning powers.|$|E
6000|$|The {{ruins of}} Shaghab are built upon a more {{complicated}} site than those of Shuwák. The position is charming. The Wady Shaghab, flowing to the south, here spreads out in a broad bulge or basin open to the west. Down-stream we see a [...] "gate" [...] formed by the meeting of two rocky tongue-tips, both showing large works. Beyond these narrows the valley bends to the south-west and feeds the Wady Aznab, which falls into the sea south of the Dámah. The mass of the ruined city lies upon the left bank, where a high and artificial-looking remblai of earth masks an eastern influent, the Wady el-Aslah (Athlah), or [...] "of the Kali-plant." [...] It drains the mountain of the same name, and the Jebel Zigláb (Zijláb), the cones of pale granite visible from Shuwák; and upon its broad mouth the old settlement stood à cheval. A little north of west rises profiled the great Shárr, no longer a ridge with a coping of four horns, but a tall and portly block, from whose summit spring heads and peaks of airy <b>blue-pink.</b> Slightly east of north the twins Naghar and Nughayr, combining to form the [...] "Mountain of the Maker" [...] (Jebel el-Sáni'), tower {{in the shape of}} a huge pyramid. Lastly, a regular ascent, the Majrá el-Wághir, fronts the city, sloping up to the west-north-west, and discloses a view of the Jibál el-Tihámah: this broad incline was, some three centuries ago, the route of the Hajj-caravan.|$|E
50|$|The Palouse {{is defined}} by its unique rolling hills that were created by wind-blown soil, which {{supports}} one of the world's most productive dry-land agricultural regions. The main crops are wheat, peas, barley, and lentils. Evenings are often highlighted by a spectacular <b>blue-pink</b> sunset, which the first Board of Regents decided to use as the college's colors (later changed to the current crimson and gray colors). Perched atop College Hill (one of the four main hills in Pullman), the campus overlooks downtown Pullman.|$|E
50|$|Calectasia browneana is an undershrub with stilt roots {{but without}} a rhizome. It grows to a height of about 60 cm with many very short side branches. Each leaf blade is 8.3 - 15.2 x 0.2 - 0.4 mm {{tapering}} to a short, sharp point on the end and densely covered with fine hairs. The base of the petals (strictly tepals) form a tube 7.2 - 8.0 mm long, while the outer parts spread outwards to form a pale <b>blue-pink,</b> papery star-like pattern. In {{the centre of the}} star are six yellow stamens forming a tube which turns orange-red with age. The thin style extends beyond the stamens. Flowers appear from June to August.|$|E
