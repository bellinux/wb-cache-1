40|$|Abstract Background Plotless density estimators {{are those}} that are based on {{distance}} measures rather than counts per unit area (quadrats or plots) to estimate the density of some usually stationary event, e. g. burrow openings, damage to plant stems, etc. These estimators typically use distance measures between events and from random points to events to derive an estimate of density. The error and bias of these estimators for the various spatial patterns found in nature have been examined using simulated populations only. In this study we investigated eight plotless density estimators to determine which were robust across a wide range of data sets from fully mapped field sites. They covered a wide range of situations including animal damage to rice and corn, nest locations, active rodent burrows and distribution of plants. Monte Carlo simulations were applied to sample the data sets, and in all cases the error of the estimate (measured as relative root mean square error) was reduced with increasing sample size. The method of calculation and ease of use in the field were also used to judge the usefulness of the estimator. Estimators were evaluated in their original published forms, although the variable area transect (VAT) and ordered distance methods have been the subjects of optimization studies. Results An estimator that was a compound of three <b>basic</b> <b>distance</b> estimators was found to be robust across all spatial patterns for sample sizes of 25 or greater. The same field methodology can be used either with the <b>basic</b> <b>distance</b> formula or the formula used with the Kendall-Moran estimator in which case a reduction in error may be gained for sample sizes less than 25, however, there is no improvement for larger sample sizes. The variable area transect (VAT) method performed moderately well, is easy to use in the field, and its calculations easy to undertake. Conclusion Plotless density estimators can provide an estimate of density in situations where it would not be practical to layout a plot or quadrat and can in many cases reduce the workload in the field. </p...|$|E

Many techniques have been proposed for image annotation {{in the last decade}} that give reasonable performance on standard datasets.

In this work, we introduce a new baseline technique for image annotation that treats annotation as a retrieval problem. The proposed technique utilizes low-level image features and a simple combination of <b>basic</b> <b>distances</b> to find nearest neighbors of a given image.

40|$|A {{look at the}} {{psychology}} literature reveals that researchers still seem to encounter difficulties in coping with multivariate outliers. Multivariate outliers can severely distort the estimation of population parameters. Detecting multivariate outliers is mainly disregarded or done by using the <b>basic</b> Mahalanobis <b>distance.</b> However, that indicator uses the multivariate sample mean and covariance matrix that are particularly sensitive to outliers. Hence, this method is problematic. We highlight the disadvantages of the <b>basic</b> Mahalanobis <b>distance</b> and argue instead {{in favor of a}} robust Mahalanobis distance. In particular, we present a variant based on the Minimum Covariance Determinant, a more robust procedure that is easy to implement. Using Monte Carlo simulations of bivariate sample distributions varying in size (ns = 20, 100, 500) and population correlation coefficient (ρ =. 10, 30, 50), we demonstrate the detrimental impact of outliers on parameter estimation and show the superiority of the MCD over the Mahalanobis distance.

The contact infrastructure anisotropy and variable population and development density lead to socioeconomic space discontinuities.

However, from the points corresponding to the subareas we can draw the radii of the sphere to represent the concrete connection between two subareas available in this moment by means of a segment connecting the corresponding radii at different distances from the centre of the sphere. Thus connections longer or shorter than the <b>basic</b> <b>distance</b> are to be found on an other sphere than the basic sphere. Accordingly, the degree of connectedness is characterized by the corresponding length of radius to express several alternative connections to employ a spatial or time measure and to state whether the lengthening of the distance is due to a “roundabout ” connection or to the low speed parameters etc. It is thus possible to dodge the difficulties which in such cases emerge because of the necessity to employ both types of models – the gravity and the “opportunity ” models...|$|E

40|$|Background: Distance {{geometry}} methods allow protein {{structures to}} be constructed using {{a large number}} of distance constraints, which can be elucidated by experimental techniques such as NMR. New methods for gleaning tertiary structural information from multiple sequence alignments make it possible for distance constraints to be predicted from sequence information alone. The <b>basic</b> <b>distance</b> geometry method can thus be applied using these empirically derived distance constraints. Such an approach, which incorporates a novel combinatoric procedure, is reported here. Results: Given the correct sheet topology and disulfide formations, the fully automated procedure is generally able to construct native-like Cα models for eight smallβ-protein structures. When the sheet topology was unknown but disulfide connectivities were included, all sheet topologies were explored by the combinatorial procedure. Using a simple geometric evaluation scheme, models with the correct sheet topology were ranked first in four of the eight example cases, second in three examples and third in one example. If neither the sheet topology nor the disulfide connectivities were givena priori, all combinations of sheet topologies and disulfides were explored by the combinatorial procedure. The evaluation scheme ranked the correct topology within the top five folds for half the example cases. Conclusions: The combinatorial procedure is a useful technique for identifying a limited number of low-resolution candidate folds for small, disulfide-rich, β-protein structures. Better results are obtained, however, if correct disulfide connectivities are known in advance. Combinatorial distance constraints can be applied whenever there are a sufficiently small number of finite connectivities...|$|E

In this paper we provide the first direct application of computational modeling methods to infer flocking behavior from experimental field data.

Using experimental field measurements of homing pigeons in flight we demonstrate {{the existence of a}} <b>basic</b> <b>distance</b> dependent attraction/repulsion relationship and show that this rule is sufficient to explain collective behavior observed in nature. Positional data of individuals over time are used as input data to a computational algorithm capable of building complex nonlinear functions that can represent the system behavior. Topological nearest neighbor interactions are considered to characterize the components within this model. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated with simulated noisy data generated from the classical (two dimensional) Vicsek model. When applied to experimental data from homing pigeon flights we show that the more complex three dimensional models are capable of predicting and simulating trajectories, as well as exhibiting realistic collective dynamics. The simulations of the reconstructed models are used to extract properties of the collective behavior in pigeons, and how it is affected by changing the initial conditions of the system. Our results demonstrate that this approach may be applied to construct models capable of simulating trajectories and collective dynamics using experimental field measurements of herd movement.

CONTEXT Designers of peer-to-peer systems are usually concerned by the match between logical overlay and physical infrastructure: a peer should preferentially be connected with the peers that are the closest in Internet [10]. However determining its closest neighbors in a wide population spread on a large-scale network as Internet is still a challenge.

Previous works show that these virtual coordinates {{can be obtained by}} active probing, i. e. by collecting round-trip-time (RTT) measurements between peers and a small set of landmarks [5]. Unfortunately, network coordinate systems require a substantial amount of time before to deliver accurate information. This time is actually an issue. Consider live streaming peer-to-peer systems [11]: when a newcomer joins, it first experiences a setup delay before the video becomes actually visible.

The impact of such changes is quite visible in both developed and developing countries. Switching over to online mode, joining hands with private initiatives and making a presence in foreign waters, are some of the hallmarks of the open and distance education (ODE) institutions in developing countries. The compilation of twenty six essays on themes as applicable to ODE has resulted in the book, Distance Education in Technological Age. These essays follow a progressive style of narration, starting from describing conceptual framework of distance education, how the distance education was emerged on the global scene and in India, and then goes on to discuss emergence of online distance education and research aspects in ODE. The initial four chapters provide a detailed account of historical development and growth of distance education in India and State Open University and National Open University Model in India. Student support services are pivot to any distance education and much of its success depends on how well the support services are provided. These are discussed from national and international perspective. The issues of collaborative learning, learning on demand, life long learning, learning-unlearning and re-learning model and strategic alliances have also given due space by the authors. An assortment of technologies like communication technology, domestic technology, information technology, mass media and entertainment technology, media technology and educational technology give an idea of how these technologies are being adopted in the open universities. The study provides details on how the multi-media systems like radio, audio cassettes, telephone, video cassettes, video discs, education television and computer based education etc can be successfully adopted. There are factors like socio-political, economic, human and administrative, and economic, which manipulate the application of information communication technology in education in developing countries. The authors in their chapters on satellite communication and virtual university explain the advancements. The book also gives details of how the library services could be arranged for the distance learners in developing countries. Skills in distance teaching are crucial to the successful counseling and teaching as the learners have varied characteristics. These skills contribute to the effective distance teaching in traditional as well as online distance education settings. A major portion of the book has been dedicated to the e-learning and virtual university initiatives. Cases from YashwantRao Chawan Maharastra Open University, a project C-MODE which deals with offering education through virtual academy and application of non-broadcasting and broadcasting media technologies to distance education can be found in these chapters. Research in and research on distance education is very significant. Quality and Quantity of research in distance education {{has been a source of}} prime concern of educators. The readers can find here an overview of review and critiques of researches in the field of open and distance learning in the Indian context and what are various changing paradigms of research in distance education. The authors strongly suggest undertaking researches on pedagogy, educational media and management of distance education.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt of proposing the {{processing}} approach of neutrosophic technique in image processing. As neutrosophic sets is a suitable tool to cope with imperfectly defined images, the properties, <b>basic</b> operations <b>distance</b> measure, entropy measures, of the neutrosophic sets method are presented here. İn this paper we, introduce the distances between neutrosophic sets: the Hamming distance, the normalized Hamming distance, the Euclidean distance and normalized Euclidean distance. We will extend the concepts of distances {{to the case of}} neutrosophic hesitancy degree. Entropy {{plays an important role in}} image processing. In our further considertions on entropy for neutrosophic sets the concept of cardinality of a neutrosophic set will also be useful. Possible applications to image processing are touched upon. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{world of}} dynamic routing {{protocols}} can be {{split into two}} <b>basic</b> groups: <b>Distance</b> vector protocols and link-state routing protocols. Link-state routing protocols have gained popularity over the years due {{to their ability to}} calculate a more accurate routing table and an ability to do it quickly. The ability to do so however comes with a price. The price is one of complexity and a process of steps that have to be taken before they will exchange their routing information with a neighbor. The process of establishing a neighbor relation is a complex one and requires a series of steps that must be taken in order to form a full neighbor relation. This project implements this process in a network programming language that involves responding with the necessary neighbor information in order to form a full adjacency and receive complete routing information from its 2 ̆ 7 newly formed peer...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} interplay between basic and applied {{research}} intensities in a simple model of creative destruction with research complementarities. Basic research intensity is chosen {{by the government and}} applied research intensity by the private sector. We find that the closer the country is to the world’s technological frontier the more the government should invest in basic research and the more the private sector will react with higher R&D expenditures. If innovation steps are small, a higher degree of openness triggers higher basic research and higher applied research investments in leading sectors. If innovation steps are larger, the government invests less in basic research, while firms in leading sectors tend to increase R&D investments, and those in lagging sectors reduce them. In the light of these findings, we discuss the available empirical evidence on basic-research expenditures across countries. applied research; <b>basic</b> research; <b>distance</b> to frontier; openness...|$|R
