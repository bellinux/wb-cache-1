40|$|Simultaneous {{determination}} of several psycotic drugs in blood {{in a short}} time The treatment of patients suffering from different types of psychiatric problems is often carried out administrating them with mixtures of more psycotic drugs. This procedure arises from several considerations. First, usually this kind of drugs suffers from different grades of side effects, so that it is a common procedure to face them by administrating complementary drugs. Moreover the psychiatric disorders themselves are often a mixture of different states, depressive, obsessive, convulsive, anxious, etc., and specific action drugs are used to fight any of these states. Unfortunately the mixtures are normally used as a sum without taking into account possible interactions inside the organism. On top of that, sometimes it is important to check the effective assumption of the drugs. Most of the drugs taken into account in the present investigation are basic, so that positive electrospray has been chosen as ionization technique. The different compounds have been separately optimized and the best transition and source parameters have been found for each of them: nicotine (163 - 132), caffeine (195 - 138), carbamazepine (237 - 194), amitriptyline (278 - 233), imipramine (281 - 86), sertraline (306 - 275), alprazolam (309 - 281), fluoxetine (310 - 44), clomipramine (315 - 86), fluvoxamine (319 - 71), clozapine (327 - 270), and paroxetine (330 - 192). The HPLC separation have been carried out by a Phenomenex Synergi POLAR 2 x 50 mm, 4 &mum particle size, using a gradient water/acetonitrile/ammonium acetate/formic acid in 4 min. The separation of the 12 drugs reavealed quite challenging. Several HPLC columns and mobile phase conditions were tested. Finally the use of a phenyl ether with polar endcapping stationary phase allowed a reasonsable separation {{in a short time}}. The use of a partially <b>buffered</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> (ammonium acetate is present only in the water component) allowed to retain nicotine and caffeine for about 2 minutes inside the HPLC column. The use of the only formic acid as a modifier causes the elution of the nicotine with the solvent front and the caffeine shortly after, in a region suffering fron high suppression effects. The use of the only ammonium acetate as a modifier causes much longer analysis times. The study of matrix effects has been performed on serum and plasmas containing different anticoagulant agents.

40|$|Abstract: Interest in ionic liquids {{for their}} {{potential}} in different chemical processes is constantly increasing, {{as they are}} claimed to be environmentally benign – excellent, non-volatile solvents {{for a wide range}} of applications. The wide applicability of these compounds also demands reliable, relatively simple and reproducible analytical techniques. These methods must be applicable not only to different technical or natural matrices but also to the very low concentrations that are likely to be present in biological and environmental systems. In this review, therefore, methods for separating and analysing imidazolium- and pyridinium-type ionic liquids in aqueous matrices using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) are examined. The techniques for identifying ionic liquids are meant primarily to track the concentrations of ionic liquids as residues not only in products and wastes but also in biological or environmental samples. The application of hyphenated techniques in this field is intended to selectively separate the quaternary entity from other cationic and non-ionic species present in the matrix, and to enable its fine-scale quantification.

40|$|Lytic {{polysaccharide}} monooxygenases (LPMOs) {{are able}} to cleave recalcitrant polysaccharides, such as cellulose, by oxidizing the C 1 and/or C 4 atoms. The analysis of the resulting products requires a variety of analytical techniques. Up to now, these techniques mainly focused on the identification of non-oxidized and C 1 -oxidized oligosaccharides. The analysis of C 4 -oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides is mostly performed by using high pressure anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC). However, the alkaline conditions used during HPAEC analysis lead to tautomerization of C 4 -oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides, which limits {{the use of this}} technique. Here, we describe the use of reverse phase-ultra high performance liquid chromatography (RP-UHPLC) in combination with non-reductive 2 -aminobenzamide (2 -AB) labeling. Non-reductive 2 -AB labeling enabled separation of C 4 -oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides from their non-oxidized counterparts. Moreover, RP-UHPLC does not require <b>buffered</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phases,</b> which reduce mass spectrometry (MS) sensitivity. The latter is seen as an advantage over other techniques such as hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and porous graphitized carbon coupled to MS. RP-UHPLC coupled to UV detection and mass spectrometry allowed the identification of both labeled non-oxidized and C 4 -oxidized oligosaccharides. Non-reductive labeling kept the ketone at the C 4 -position of LPMO oxidized oligosaccharides intact, while selective reducing agents such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride (STAB) reduced this ketone group. Our results show that RP-UHPLC-UV-ESI-MS in combination with non-reductively 2 -AB labeling is a suitable technique for the separation and identification of LPMO-generated C 4 -oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides. </p...|$|R

The separation was performed on LiChrospher RP- 18 column using methanol as <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> A and 0. 2 % ammonium acetate <b>buffer</b> solution as <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> B in gradient elution. A total of 12 related substances were detected through high resolution mass spectrometric determination in a positive electrospray ionization mode.

40|$|The {{trivalent}} arsenic glutathione complexes arsenic triglutathione, methylarsonous diglutathione, and dimethylarsinous glutathione are key intermediates in the mammalian metabolism of arsenite {{and possibly}} represent the arsenic {{species that are}} transported from the liver to the kidney for urinary excretion. Despite this, the comparative stability of the arsenic-sulfur bonds in these complexes has not been investigated under physiological conditions resembling hepatocyte cytosol. Using size-exclusion chromatography and a glutathione-containing phosphate <b>buffered</b> saline <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> (5 or 10 [*]mM glutathione, pH 7. 4) in conjunction with an arsenic-specific detector, we chromatographed arsenite, monomethylarsonous acid, and dimethylarsinous acid. The on-column formation of the corresponding arsenic-glutathione complexes between 4 and 37 °C revealed that methylated arsenic-glutathione complexes are more stable than arsenic triglutathione. The relevance of these results {{with regard to the}} metabolic fate of arsenite in mammals is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a liquid-chromatographic procedure for de-termining low concentrations of 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxy-phenylethylene glycol in urine. After liquid-liquid extraction and cleanup of the sample, an aliquot of the extract is in-jected onto a reversed-phase chromatographic column, with isocratic elution with an acetonitrile/acetate <b>buffer</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phase.</b> An on-line fluorescence detector {{is used for}} measuring the natural fluorescence of the compound. The method gives a relatively clean extract, which is suitable for measuring the less-than-normal concentrations associated with mentally depressed patients. Although a liquid-chromatographic technique has been recently de-scribed for measuring this compound in urine, the method involves electrochemical detection, {{which may not be}} available in many clinical laboratories, and, because of its nonspecificity, the method is only suitable for detecting the increased amounts of 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenyl-ethylene glycol excreted by patients with pheochromo-cytoma. In recent years, interest in measuring 3 -methoxy- 4 -hy-droxyphenylethylene glycol (MHPG) in body fluids of men-tally depressed patients (1, 2) has increased. Determining it in urine has been suggested to be particularly useful as an aid in selecting appropriate medication with a tricyclic drug (1). Norepinephrine of the brain is principally metabolized to MHPG (3). Several methods for assaying this metabolite are based on extraction, hydrolysis, and derivatization, followed by gas-liquid chromatography with electron capture detection (4 - 8). Liquid-chromatographic procedures for rapidly deter-mining MHPG in human cerebrospinal fluid (9) and urine (10) have been described. Whereas these authors used elec-trochemical detection, we use a fluorescence detector for this analysis, because with it only a simple extraction and clean-up are required before chromatography...|$|R
