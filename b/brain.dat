5|$|A <b>brain</b> tumor is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the <b>brain</b> or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary <b>brain</b> tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary <b>brain</b> tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary <b>brain</b> tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic <b>brain</b> cancer is over six times more common than primary <b>brain</b> cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|As a hominid <b>brain,</b> {{the human}} <b>brain</b> is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to}} the <b>brain</b> of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in <b>brain</b> size. As <b>brain</b> size increased, this altered {{the size and shape of}} the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of the human <b>brain</b> and other primates.|$|E

The 1942 science fiction book (adapted three times for cinema) Donovan's <b>Brain</b> tells the tale of an isolated <b>brain</b> kept alive in vitro, gradually taken over by a malign intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function of the human <b>brain</b> comes {{from a variety of}} experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about <b>brain</b> trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the <b>brain</b> and the effects of <b>brain</b> damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the <b>brain</b> and record <b>brain</b> activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E

50|$|Early {{research}} into the differences {{between male and female}} <b>brains</b> showed that male <b>brains</b> are, on average, larger than female <b>brains.</b> This research was frequently cited to support the assertion that women are less intelligent than men. One of the most influential early researchers on this topic was Paul Broca. In 1861, he examined 432 human <b>brains</b> from cadavers and found that the <b>brains</b> of men had an average weight of 1325 grams, while the <b>brains</b> of women had an average weight of 1144 grams. This study, however, did not control for differences in body size or age.|$|R

5|$|The {{study of}} the anatomy of the <b>brain</b> is neuroanatomy, while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience.

50|$|In a {{study on}} the Circle of Willis and its {{relation}} to cerebral vascular disorders, a comparison on various anomalies between normal <b>brains</b> (those without the condition of cerebral softening) and <b>brains</b> with cerebral softening were looked at to observe trends in the differences of the anatomical structure of the Circle of Willis. Statistically significant results were found in the percentage of normal <b>brains</b> that had a normal Circle of Willis and those that had cerebral softening and had a normal Circle of Willis. The results yielded 52% of normal <b>brains</b> having a normal Circle of Willis, while only 33% of <b>brains</b> with cerebral softening had a normal Circle of Willis. There were also a higher number of string-like vessels in <b>brains</b> with cerebral softening (42%), than there were in normal <b>brains</b> (27%). These results point to an assumption of a higher incidence rate of anomalies in <b>brains</b> with cerebral softening versus those that do not have cerebral softening.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the human}} <b>brain</b> {{represents}} only 2% {{of the body}} weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The <b>brain</b> mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness. The energy consumption of the <b>brain</b> does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional <b>brain</b> imaging methods PET and fMRI. These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} to <b>brain</b> {{function is to}} examine the consequences of damage to specific <b>brain</b> areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the <b>brain</b> makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of <b>brain</b> damage have been a key source of information about <b>brain</b> function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E
