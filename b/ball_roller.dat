50|$|Modern <b>ball,</b> <b>roller</b> or tapered {{bearings}} {{can also}} overheat, but {{the likelihood of}} a roller bearing overheating is usually far smaller than with journal bearings. When modern bearings do fail, the balls or rollers and their races fail, generating heat which can ignite fires or be the ignition source of a dust explosion in grain, coal, sawdust, etc.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} usual {{limits to the}} {{lifetime}} or load capacity of a bearing: abrasion, fatigue and pressure-induced welding. Abrasion occurs when the surface is eroded by hard contaminants scraping at the bearing materials. Fatigue results when a material becomes brittle after being repeatedly loaded and released. Where the <b>ball</b> or <b>roller</b> touches the race there is always some deformation, and hence a risk of fatigue. Smaller <b>balls</b> or <b>rollers</b> deform more sharply, and so tend to fatigue faster. Pressure-induced welding can occur when two metal pieces are pressed together at very high pressure and they become one. Although <b>balls,</b> <b>rollers</b> and races may look smooth, they are microscopically rough. Thus, there are high-pressure spots which push away the bearing lubricant. Sometimes, the resulting metal-to-metal contact welds a microscopic part of the <b>ball</b> or <b>roller</b> to the race. As the bearing continues to rotate, the weld is then torn apart, but it may leave race welded to bearing or bearing welded to race.|$|R
50|$|A wire race bearing is a rolling-element bearing, {{where the}} <b>balls</b> or <b>rollers</b> run on races {{resembling}} loops of wire. Roller bearings may use just two races, but ball bearings typically use {{three or four}} races. Wire race bearings can be large yet lightweight and with small profile and good precision. Wire races have little intrinsic structure and must be adequately supported by the bearing housing. <b>Balls,</b> <b>rollers</b> or even cross rollers are used as rolling elements. Due to the design wire race bearings are commonly called '4-point-contact' bearings.|$|R

50|$|Leonardo da Vinci {{incorporated}} {{drawings of}} ball bearings in his {{design for a}} helicopter around the year 1500. This is the first recorded use of bearings in an aerospace design. However, Agostino Ramelli {{is the first to}} have published sketches of roller and thrust bearings. An issue with <b>ball</b> and <b>roller</b> bearings is that the <b>balls</b> or <b>rollers</b> rub against each other causing additional friction which can be reduced by enclosing the <b>balls</b> or <b>rollers</b> within a cage. The captured, or caged, ball bearing was originally described by Galileo in the 17th century.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>ball</b> pens {{generally}} {{run out of}} ink {{more quickly}} than ballpoints because <b>roller</b> <b>balls</b> use a greater amount of ink while writing.

50|$|The U.S. bearing {{industry}} {{by this point}} was a $1 billion business, having tripled in size since World War II. As a leading producer of a broad line of anti-friction bearings, including needle, <b>ball,</b> <b>roller,</b> and specialty bearings, Torrington had benefited immeasurably from the prolific growth of the bearing industry, while the company's host of other products buttressed its financial performance. In addition to bearings, Torrington's eight domestic plants were devoted to the manufacture of nuts, screws, bolts, metal specialties, spokes and nipples, drill bits, surgeon needles, hooking and felting needles, swaging machines, and a special purpose sewing machine, lending a diversity to the company's business lines that insulated it from cyclical economic conditions to a large extent. Beyond U.S. borders, the Torrington empire comprised manufacturing facilities in England, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and in Japan, giving the company a sizeable presence in key international markets. The domestic and international operations created a solid manufacturing entity that flourished during the 1960s. Sales, which stood at $33.6 million in 1950, totaled $67.5 million in 1960, then shot upward to $93.4 million in 1965. The following year, Torrington celebrated two century marks by reaching its 100th anniversary in business as well as reaching over $100 million in sales. By all accounts, Torrington was a thriving manufacturer—a company that had earned the respect of competitors—and now, as it mapped its course for its second century of business, it began {{to attract the attention}} of a handful of suitors intent on acquiring the venerable manufacturing concern.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the Street dance as a phenomenon, {{together}} with other sportive activities such as street <b>ball,</b> <b>roller,</b> BMX or skateboarding, is now being practiced also by Romanian teenagers. Its main trait is the lack of institutionalisation when organised, wholly depending on the free will of those practicing it, but which gains a sportive character through the training process and the competitions organised between teams. The purpose of this research is to analyse the influence of sports on the street dance phenomenon, seen as a subculture of sports and the way in which dancers identify themselves with the sport with the aim of integrating it as a branch of sports for all. Observation and the survey questionnaire were the research methods used. A demographic questionnaire was developed and the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale was applied to 150 dancers (male and female) from Timisoara. The results indicate the fact that the dancers identify themselves with athletes to a significant extent...|$|E
40|$|A {{technological}} {{break through}} for supporting rotating shafts is the {{active magnetic bearing}} (AMB). Active magnetic bearings offer some important advantages over conventional <b>ball,</b> <b>roller</b> or journal bearings such as reduced frictional drag, no physical contact in the bearing, no need for lubricants, compatibility with high vacuum and ultra-clean environments, and ability to control shaft position within the bearing. The disadvantages of the AMB system are the increased cost and complexity, reduced bearing stiffness {{and the need for}} a controller. Still, there are certain applications, such as high speed machining, biomedical devices, and gyroscopes, where the additional cost of an AMB system can be justified. The inherent actuator capabilities of the AMB offer the potential for active balancing of spindles and micro-shaping capabilities for machine tools, The work presented in this paper concentrates on an AMB test program that utilizes the actuator capability to dynamically balance a spindle. In this study, an unbalanced AMB spindle system was enhanced with an LMS (Least Mean Squares) algorithm combined with an existing PID (proportional, integral, differential) control. This enhanced controller significantly improved the concentricity of an intentionally unbalanced shaft. The study included dynamic system analysis, test validation, control design and simulation, as well as experimental implementation using a digital LMS controller...|$|E

40|$|Succession {{in local}} dung beetle assemblages {{influences}} their delivery of ecological functions in natural and modified environments globally. Short-term changes in dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) species richness, abundance, and biomass were investigated in standardized dung pads in northern, coastal Turkey. For mean tunneling guild abundance, dung deposition time, dung exposure period, and their interaction were significant, and for mean dung dwelling guild abundance, dung exposure period was significant, {{as was the}} interaction with dung deposition time, which collectively evidenced temporal resource partitioning, based principally on differences in diel activity. Succession was highly compressed, with maximum abundance at 12 h and maximum species richness at 24 h. A large <b>ball</b> <b>roller</b> and small-to medium-sized tunnelers dominated different periods in the first 24 h but were superseded by dwellers. Regression analysis demonstrated a significant, positive relationship between species richness and the evenness of abundance for both dung deposition times. Correlation analysis generally showed strong, positive correlations between tunneling species, low correlations between tunneling and dwelling species, and low correlations between dwelling species. Niche partitioning based on size difference appears to have acted on the environmental filtering of tunneling species along the temporal gradient of declining moisture, thereby {{limiting the number of}} abundant, concurrent species. The aggregation of tunneling species provided opportunities for the less competitive dwelling species to occupy less densely populated zones termed probability refuges. The network of strong, positive habitat 2 ̆ 7 correlations between tunneling species may indicate that their collective functionality is vulnerable to loss of efficiency if species are lost...|$|E

Of 74 individual dung beetles observed, 37 were catalogued as piece rollers, 27 as ball rollers and 10 as strict burrowers. The mean arrival times to dungpieces was smaller for rollers than for burrowers. We observed selection of dung material, {{as well as}} cooperationand competition between species and within species by dung beetles. The remotion distance of seeds resultedinversely proportional with its size.
