5000|$|The {{terminus}} {{was close}} to the Kingsteignton road, and consisted of a basin with buildings on both sides. The basin was filled in to enable lorries to turn, and the buildings were for many years used by A J Booker's Autobodies as a car <b>body</b> <b>workshop.</b> Although they were grade II listed structures, all except one were demolished in 2001 as part of a redevelopment of the area. The tow-path followed the north bank of the canal, and the water supply entered the canal from a leat which passed under the tow-path to the east of the wharf buildings, crossing over a drainage ditch on an aqueduct before it did so. To the south of the wharf area was Newton Abbot Potteries, built before 1905, and labelled [...] "Bricks and Pipes" [...] on the 1956 map. After a short distance, the canal turned to the south-east, and followed a nearly straight line across what is now the end of Newton Abbot racecourse. In 1969, the end of the racetrack followed {{the west bank of the}} canal, but by 1989 the track had been extended across the site of the canal. A drainage ditch crosses the area, which gives an indication of where the canal was, since the ditch was on the west side of the canal before it was filled in. Just beyond the second crossing by the race track are the remains of the lock and the wall which prevents the Teign flooding the area. The route turns to the east, to pass under the railway line, and joins the Hackney channel of the River Teign.|$|E

40|$|Eating {{disorders}} are life threatening, chronic, {{and difficult to}} treat (Stice, 2002). Body dissatisfaction in women is {{a risk factor for}} developing an eating disorder at any age (Goldschmidt et al., 2016), yet body dissatisfaction treatment is not readily available for college-age women. It may be beneficial to offer treatment for college-age women as a way of reducing the likelihood of developing an eating disorder later in life. In order to address various barriers to treatment (e. g., money and time), the effectiveness of a one-day <b>body</b> dissatisfaction treatment <b>workshop</b> for college-age women was examined. This <b>body</b> image <b>workshop</b> included interventions that targeted factors that may lead to body dissatisfaction (e. g., the internalization of the thin ideal), while also utilizing interventions that targeted factors that help promote positive body image (e. g., body appreciation). Participant 1 ’s scores improved on each of the measures from Time 1 to Time 2, while Participant 2 ’s scores did not improve but were comparable to other college-age women. Both participants found the workshop to be effective and useful. These findings provide hope that eating disorder prevention programs for college-age women can be provided via one-day <b>body</b> image <b>workshops...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of my}} master’s thesis deals with four important areas: stress, body, activity and dance movement therapy. Precisely these {{are considered to be}} big individual areas that have many things in common. Physical movement of our body constantly evokes feelings that an individual is not always aware of. We encounter stress on a daily basis and consequently use different strategies to fight against its effects. Furthermore, at the same time, {{it is not possible to}} completely ignore the messages our bodies send due to the overwhelming stress. It is necessary to be aware of our feelings and needs in order to effectively manage stress. One of the less known, yet highly efficient strategies that deal with both body and movement, is the so called dance movement therapy. In the empirical part of the thesis, the preparation and performance of 12 body movement therapies are described. A group of participants, consisting of six primary school teachers, took part in this project. The effects of <b>body</b> movement <b>workshops</b> were examined with an initial and final questionnaire, regular short evaluations of the meetings and with a group evaluation in the last meeting. The aims of the research part were as followed: to research whether adults use an activity as one of the methods to reduce stress, to prepare and perform preventive body movement method for an adult population, and to check the effects of the performed body movement method of work with the adults. Based on the obtained and analysed data, we came to some conclusions. The participants of <b>body</b> movement <b>workshops</b> mostly use physical activities to reduce stress. They use other types of relaxation less frequently. The participants considered the meetings useful. The performed body movement activities helped them to overcome stress and they also found the activities useful not only for their profession but also for everyday life. The thesis raises the awareness and improves the perception of body stress identification. It represents some of the most known strategies for successfully tackling stress, and simultaneously offers a new body movement work method. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of the study was}} to discover if art can assist young girls in resisting cultural stereotypes of feminine beauty. Pre-adolescence was chosen as an age-group to investigate if feminist theory and art-making strategies could promote a positive self image in girls. Issues-based art education was determined to be an appropriate teaching method to explore sociopolitical issues by looking at art and making art. A secondary goal of the study was to understand the dynamics related to teaching and learning about gender oppression, to identify factors that facilitated, and barriers that impeded the successful implementation of the body image project. The results of the research indicate that the participants' body image dissatisfaction was influenced by media images, but that it originated in body-based harassment from boys at school. Also, the stereotype that 'girls are nice,' seen as an inherent feature of femininity, was a major stumbling block for the girls that necessitated self-silencing strategies. Nevertheless, it appeared that the girls used the <b>body</b> image <b>workshops</b> to practice their voices to address issues of gender inequity.

It will involve an evaluation of the Longlife Project, the <b>body</b> mapping <b>workshop</b> process and individual body maps. ? While the over-arching intention of the Longlife Project was advocacy in the face of government resistance to providing antiretroviral treatment at the time, its proposed advocacy could not take place without education. ? Building on this premise, together with an analysis of the body maps and interview transcripts found in the book Longlife: Positive HIV Stories it is suggested the creation of body maps increased biomedical understanding of HIV/AIDS and to some extent heath-enhancing behaviour. ? Apart from gaining factual knowledge about their health, the women involved in the project also engaged in conversation that provided a rich opportunity for discussing the personal, emotional, cultural and socio-economic challenges of being HIV-positive in South Africa. ? Both the body mapping and conversation processes will be situated within adult education theory and discussed in relation to 'transformational learning', 'critical consciousness', community art-based learning, peer education and Participatory Research practice. ? By assessing the strengths and failures of these concepts within an African context the potential for body mapping to be employed as an HIV/AIDS education tool will be further developed...|$|R
