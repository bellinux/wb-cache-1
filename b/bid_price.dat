40|$|In {{the modern}} {{building}} industry {{it is important}} for a contracting company to be awarded contracts on a constant basis and to be present on the market with its services and tenders. All large constructing companies constantly apply for invitations to tenders and prepare relevant <b>bidding</b> <b>prices.</b> A well-prepared <b>bidding</b> <b>price</b> is essential in for a company to be awarded the contract and to sign the construction contract. <b>Bidding</b> <b>price</b> is prepared for the clients who sign, based on this price, the construction contract with a contracting company. The <b>bidding</b> <b>price</b> of a facility is determined in the contract or <b>bidding</b> <b>price</b> preparation process. This is a part of a construction project which is repeated in each project. The <b>bidding</b> <b>price</b> accuracy is crucial for the project’s final financial success. Analysis of the <b>bidding</b> <b>price</b> preparation and a description of procedures from the reception of the tender documents to the submission of tenders, and the types of construction and trade works are presented in the thesis. The thesis also provides a brief presentation of an example of construction works calculation and analysis of subcontracting tenders drawn up for the facility of the Red Cross of Slovenia at Debeli rtič, for which a contracting company Energoplan was preparing a <b>bidding</b> <b>price...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{theoretical}} framework for determining dynamic ask and <b>bid</b> <b>prices</b> of derivatives using the theory of dynamic coherent acceptability indices in discrete time.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{endogenous}} structure of intermediation when heterogeneous intermediaries choose between becoming a middleman or a market maker, and {{the relation between}} the equilibrium market structure and price dispersion. We obtain three main results: First, middlemen and oligopolistic market makers can coexist in the market equilibrium. All market makers publicly post unique ask and <b>bid</b> <b>prices.</b> These prices serve as the high and low bounds, respectively, for the ask and <b>bid</b> <b>prices</b> of middlemen, when capacity cost is sufficiently large. Second, more efficient intermediaries choose to become market makers, whereas less efficient intermediaries choose to become middlemen. Third, if the fixed cost of capacity installation for market makers increases, the number of market makers declines, whereas the number of middlemen increases. As a result, both ask <b>prices</b> and <b>bid</b> <b>prices</b> become more dispersed. " Copyright (c) 2010, The Author(s) Journal Compilation (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc [...] ...|$|R
