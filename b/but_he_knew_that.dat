25|$|Concern {{about the}} Militant {{tendency}} led Reg Underhill, whose 1975 report had been dismissed by Heffer, {{to issue a}} revised version in 1980. This report {{made it clear that}} most party institutions in Liverpool, especially in Heffer's constituency, were now under Militant control. Heffer compared the report to the propaganda of Joseph Goebbels, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Militant was powerful: when Heffer considered running against Denis Healey for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party under the new electoral college system in 1981, his constituency party prevented him. He supported Benn when Benn challenged Healey.|$|E
25|$|One theory {{provided}} by Herodotus is that Leonidas sent away {{the remainder of}} his men because he cared about their safety. The King would have thought it wise to preserve those Greek troops for future battles against the Persians, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the Spartans could never abandon their post on the battlefield. The soldiers who stayed behind were to protect their escape against the Persian cavalry. Herodotus himself believed that Leonidas gave the order because he perceived the allies to be disheartened and unwilling to encounter the danger to which his own mind was made up. He therefore chose to dismiss all troops except the Thebans, Thespians and helots and save the glory for the Spartans.|$|E
25|$|In 629, Emperor Gaozu's son and successor, Emperor Taizong, {{ordered his}} {{officials}} to submit suggestions for him. As Chang was unacquainted with historical writings, Ma drafted some 20 suggestions for him. When Emperor Taizong read the suggestions that Chang submitted, he was impressed, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Chang was not well-studied, he summoned Chang {{to ask him}} how {{he came up with}} the suggestions. Chang told Emperor Taizong that he did not write the suggestions and that Ma did. He also told Emperor Taizong that whenever he conversed with Ma, Ma was always concerned about faithfulness and filial piety. Emperor Taizong sent messengers to summon Ma into his presence, and once they conversed, he was impressed by Ma and, while initially not giving him an official position, had him serve at the examination bureau of the government (門下省, Menxia Sheng). In 632, he officially made Ma a governmental auditor. He awarded Chang silk for having discovered Ma.|$|E

25|$|In foreign affairs, he {{held that}} the French people should conduct their {{revolution}} as they wished, and that no foreign nation had any right {{to interfere with the}} country's internal affairs. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> neighboring nations were disturbed by the progress of the revolution, feared its influence on their own peoples, and that foreign monarchs were being importuned by French émigrés to intervene on behalf of the French monarchy. To prevent this intervention, or rather to give no pretext for it, was the guiding principle in his foreign policy. He was elected a member of the comité diplomatique of the Assembly in July 1790, and in this capacity he was able to prevent the Assembly from doing much harm with regard to foreign affairs. He had long known Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin, the foreign secretary, and, as matters became more strained, he entered into daily communication with the minister, advising him on every point, and, while dictating his policy, defended it in the Assembly. Mirabeau's exertions in this respect showed him to be a statesman; his influence is best demonstrated by the confused state of affairs in this area after his death.|$|E
25|$|Appleby Castle {{surrendered}} to the Scots on 31 July, whereat Lambert, who was still {{hanging on to the}} flank of the Scottish advance, fell back from Barnard Castle to Richmond so as to close Wensleydale against any attempt of the invaders to march on Pontefract. All the restless energy of Langdale's horse was unable to dislodge Lambert from the passes or {{to find out what was}} behind that impenetrable cavalry screen. The crisis was now at hand. Cromwell had received the surrender of Pembroke Castle on 11 July, and had marched off, with his men unpaid, ragged and shoeless, at full speed through the Midlands. Rains and storms delayed his march, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the Duke of Hamilton in the broken ground of Westmorland was still worse off. Shoes from Northampton and stockings from Coventry met him at Nottingham, and gathering up the local levies as he went, he made for Doncaster, where he arrived on 8 August, having gained six days in advance of the time he had allowed himself for the march. He then called up artillery from Hull, exchanged his local levies for the regulars who were besieging Pontefract, and set off to meet Lambert. On 12 August he was at Wetherby, Lambert with horse and foot at Otley, Langdale at Skipton and Gargrave, Hamilton at Lancaster, and Sir George Monro with the Scots from Ulster and the Carlisle Royalists (organized as a separate command owing to friction between Monro and the generals of the main army) at Hornby. On 13 August, while Cromwell was marching to join Lambert at Otley, the Scottish leaders were still disputing whether they should make for Pontefract or continue through Lancashire so as to join Lord Byron and the Cheshire Royalists.|$|E
500|$|Cantor {{established}} {{these results}} using two constructions. His first construction shows {{how to write}} the real algebraic numbers as a sequence a1, a2, a3,.... In other words, the real algebraic numbers are countable. Cantor starts his second construction with any sequence of real numbers. Using this sequence, he constructs nested intervals whose intersection contains a real number not in the sequence. Since every sequence of real numbers {{can be used to}} construct a real not in the sequence, the real numbers cannot be written as a sequence – that is, the real numbers are not countable. [...] By applying his construction to the sequence of real algebraic numbers, Cantor produces a transcendental number. Cantor points out that his constructions prove more – namely, they provide a new proof of Liouville's theorem: Every interval contains infinitely many transcendental numbers. Cantor's next article contains a construction that proves the set of transcendental numbers has the same [...] "power" [...] (see below) as the set of real numbers.} (for example, tn=e/n). Call this set T0. Then T= T0∪{tn}= T0∪{t2n-1}∪{t2n}. The set of reals R= T∪{an}= T0∪{tn}∪{an} where an is the sequence of real algebraic numbers. [...] So both T and R are the union of three pairwise disjoint sets: T0 and two countable sets. A one-to-one correspondence between T and R is given by the function: f(t)=t if t∈T0, f(t2n-1)=tn, and f(t2n)=an. Cantor actually applies his construction to the irrationals rather than the transcendentals, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it applies to any set formed by removing countably many numbers from the set of reals (...)

500|$|The basic {{story was}} {{conceived}} by Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, while the script {{was written by}} Sakaguchi, Masaru Hatano and Takatoshi Aoki. The story was contributed to by multiple staff members, which sometimes annoyed Sakaguchi when they suggested {{something that would be}} out of character for one of the cast. According to Sakaguchi, the initial version featuring a science fiction storyline was [...] "shot down" [...] by Nintendo, forcing the team to begin all over again with a new setting and characters. Despite the story still using science fiction elements, the team worked to distance the setting from those elements by focusing on bright, natural colors for the environments. The biographies of the main cast were put together during the story's creation. Originally, according to Hatano, the game's theme was to have been the [...] "all-important drama that takes place {{between a man and a}} woman", but as development progressed it was changed to a theme of general companionship, although the original story remained the same. Hatano suggested incorporating dialogue into the gameplay rather than restricting it to cutscenes. This approach was inspired by both Uncharted and television series The West Wing. The concept was initially put forward as a joke about Zael's habit of kicking doors open, and how his companions would comment on how he always did this. After receiving positive feedback, they implemented it and kept in Zael's behavior. Sakaguchi used this in-game dialogue to help convey the characters' personalities: as part of this, adlibs from the actors were included, and continual adjustments were made to the script. The characters' artwork also prompted Sakaguchi to make changes so the characters better fitted their presentation. The game's voiced dialogue was estimated at 12,000 lines. The option for players to skip through dialogue was a feature that Sakaguchi did not like, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> some players would not like necessary long cutscenes, so gave them the option of going through them while still following the story. This meant that all the cutscenes needed to be done using the in-game engine rather than pre-rendered graphics.|$|E

2500|$|The largest {{remaining}} Ming {{fighting force}} in North China {{at the time}} of Beijing's fall was Wu Sangui's 40,000-man frontier force, who had abandoned the Ningyuan garrison to come to the emperor's aid. Halfway to Beijing, Wu received news of Chongzhen's death, so he went back to garrison the Shanhai Pass, the eastern terminus of the main Great Wall line. He and his men were now caught between the rebels within the Great Wall and the Manchus without. After some deliberation, Wu Sangui decided to resist the new Shun regime, having heard that Li Zicheng had ordered Wu's family executed. On May3 and May10 Wu Sangui twice defeated the Shun vanguard led by the turncoat Tang Tong, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> his force alone was insufficient to fight Li Zicheng's main army. Wu Sangui wrote to the Manchus for help, promising [...] "great profits" [...] if they assisted him in defeating the rebels. The Manchu prince-regent Dorgon (Hung Taiji had died in 1643) determined that this was the opportunity to claim the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing. Dorgon made clear in his reply that the Manchus would help Wu Sangui, but Wu would have to submit to the Qing; Wu {{had little choice but to}} accept.|$|E

2500|$|It {{took the}} {{energetic}} 1968 television special Elvis, which the Singer Company sponsored, and a subsequent series of acclaimed recording sessions in Memphis, Tennessee that included {{songs such as}} [...] "Suspicious Minds" [...] and [...] "In the Ghetto", to restore Presley's musical reputation. However, the music scene and the culture {{in the latter part}} of the decade had radically changed. The [...] "Singer Special" [...] TV show was not intended to turn out the way it did. Parker was adamant that Presley would wear a Santa suit and other holiday garb and sing Christmas songs, as the show was to be broadcast in December 1968. (Several Presley historians have noted the original title for the special was to be Elvis and the Wonderful World of Christmas.) It was the producer of the show, Steve Binder, who put forward the idea of Presley singing his old hits and even the staged section with his old band, Scotty Moore and DJ Fontana, the latter inspired by a post-rehearsal informal jam in Presley's dressing room. Presley was never one to stand up against Parker, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> this TV show was his one chance at a true comeback, and with Binder backing him, Presley told Parker he was doing it [...] "Binder's way." [...] This was the first time in the partnership that Presley fully rebelled against Parker.|$|E

He tied his canoe here and took out his pole, a long shaft used to pull along the river. He put moss around the pole, then placed the pole down. So when the fish touch the pole, their slime was wiped on the moss. He knew that the Transformers were coming further down river. He grabbed the pole and waited for a fish to touch it, then would pull out the pole and see where the salmon touched. He took the slime {{and put it in a}} wooden plate and put his pole down again.

2500|$|Colonel Caldwell {{knew he was}} outnumbered so {{he chose}} {{a course of action}} which called for some of his militia to lure the Mexicans out of the {{fortified}} city and into the prairie around Salado Creek. The remaining Texians would be positioned within the creek bed where they had good cover. Caldwell never anticipated victory <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> with his men positioned in the creek bed could cause considerable damage to the Mexicans without being too exposed to enemy fire. Only thirty-eight horses were found to be fit for duty among the Texan camp so only thirty-eight men could be sent to lure out the Mexicans. Captain John C. Hays, with his fourteen Texas Rangers were assigned to the mission along with Henry E. McCulloch, William A. A. Wallace, Robert Addison Gillespie and sixteen others. The thirty-eight men were sent from the Salado to San Antonio on the morning of September 17 (some accounts say the engagement occurred September 18, but Caldwell's own report contradicts this), where they arrived outside the city sometime after 9:00am at dawn [...] Hays ordered his men dismounted and prepared an ambush while he and eight others remounted and proceeded to within a half mile of the Alamo where Woll was based. Hays hoped to lure out around fifty of the Mexicans. [...] But when the Texans were spotted, 200 Mexican cavalrymen and forty Cherokees were sent after them, followed by about 300 more men led by Woll himself.|$|E
