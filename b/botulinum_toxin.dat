40|$|Abstract: This article {{provides}} an evidence-based {{review of the}} biological properties of <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins</b> and the correlation with observed therapeutic properties which have provided a conceptual framework for incremental clinical applications. Current pre-clinical and clinical research provides evidence for use of these biologicals for {{a wide array of}} chronic pain syndromes which are reviewed in this article, including widely documented applications and techniques for the management of headaches, myofascial pain syndrome, low back pain and piriformis syndrome. Also, this review article summarizes the mounting evidence for novel clinical applications of <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins</b> for the management of other chronic pain syndromes such as intractable osteoarticular pain, lateral epicondylitis, plantar fasciitis, orofacial pain syndromes, post-radiation fibrosis, and focal peripheral nerve injuries, among others. The authors summarize the available clinical studies where <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins</b> have been used for a variety of painful syndromes along with their own clinical experience...|$|R
40|$|<b>Botulinum</b> <b>toxins</b> are metalloproteases {{that act}} inside nerve {{terminals}} and block neurotransmitter release through their cleavage of {{components of the}} exocytosis machinery. These toxins are used to treat human diseases that are characterized by hyperfunction of cholinergic terminals. Recently, evidence has accumulated that gangliosides and synaptic vesicle proteins cooperate to mediate toxin binding to the presynaptic terminal. The differential distribution of synaptic vesicle protein receptors, gangliosides and toxin substrates in distinct neuronal populations opens up {{the possibility of using}} different serotypes of <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins</b> for the treatment of central nervous system diseases caused by altered activity of selected neuronal populations...|$|R

25|$|The former US {{biological}} warfare program categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either Lethal Agents (Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, <b>Botulinum</b> <b>toxin)</b> or Incapacitating Agents (Brucella suis, Coxiella burnetii, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).|$|E
25|$|As {{neurotoxins}} are compounds which {{adversely affect}} the nervous system, {{a number of}} mechanisms through which they function are through the inhibition of neuron cellular processes. These inhibited processes can range from membrane depolarization mechanisms to inter-neuron communication. By inhibiting the ability for neurons to perform their expected intracellular functions, or pass a signal to a neighboring cell, neurotoxins can induce systemic nervous system arrest {{as in the case}} of <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin,</b> or even nervous tissue death. The time required for the onset of symptoms upon neurotoxin exposure can vary between different toxins, being on the order of hours for <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> and years for lead.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{assessed}} the response in knockout mice lacking the b-series (GD 2, GD 1 b, GT 1 b and GQ 1 b) gangliosides against Clostridium botulinum (types A, B and E) and tetani toxins. We found that <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins</b> were fully toxic, while tetanus toxin {{was much less}} toxic in the knockout mice. Combining the present results with our previous finding that tetanus <b>toxin</b> and <b>botulinum</b> types A and B toxins showed essentially no toxic activity in the knockout mice lacking both the a-series and b-series gangliosides (complex gangliosides), we concluded that the b-series gangliosides is the major essential substance for tetanus toxin, while b-series gangliosides may be not the essential substance for <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins,</b> at the initial step during the intoxication process in mouse...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{intracellular}} {{action on}} exocytosis of botulinim A toxin and constituent chains was studied using permeabilized isolated nerve endings from the rat neural lobe. The {{release of the}} neuropeptide vasopressin was measured by radioimmunoassay. In the presence ofthe reducing agent dithiothreitol, the two-chain form of <b>botulinum</b> A <b>toxin</b> inhibited vasopressin release induced by 10 Jl M free calcium. Half maximal inhibition was obtained with 15 nM <b>botulinum</b> A <b>toxin.</b> In {{the absence of the}} heavy chain the light chain of the toxin strongly inhibited exocytosis with a half maximal effect of 2. 5 nM. The inhibitory effects on secretion could be prevented by incubating the light chain with an immune serum against <b>botulinum</b> A <b>toxin.</b> The heavy chain of <b>botulinum</b> A <b>toxin</b> did not affect vasopressin release. However, it prevented the inhibitory effects of the light chain on stimulated exocytosis. It is concluded that <b>botulinum</b> A <b>toxin</b> inhibits the calcium-dependent step leading to exocytosis by interfering with a target present in the isolated and permeabilized nerve terminals. The functional domain of this neurotoxin, which is responsible for the inhibition of vasopressin release, is present in its light chain. <b>Botulinum</b> A <b>toxin</b> belongs to a family of cIosely reIated neurotoxins.

25|$|In all cases, {{illness is}} caused by the <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> {{produced}} by the bacterium C. botulinum in anaerobic conditions and not by the bacterium itself. The pattern of damage occurs because the toxin affects nerves that fire (depolarize) at a higher frequency first.|$|E
25|$|<b>Botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> type A (BTX-A) is {{best known}} by its trade name, Botox. Local {{intradermal}} injection of BTX-A is helpful in chronic focal painful neuropathies.

25|$|<b>Botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> {{is broken}} into 8 {{neurotoxins}} (labeled as types A, B, C , D, E, F, and G), which are antigenically and serologically distinct but structurally similar. Human botulism is caused mainly by types A, B, E, and (rarely) F. Types C and D cause toxicity only in other animals.|$|E

40|$|The botulinum {{neurotoxins}} are {{the most}} dangerous toxins known (BoNTs serotypes A-G) and induce profound flaccid neuromuscular paralysis by blocking nerve-muscle communication. Poisoned motoneurons react by emitting a sprouting network known to establish novel functional synapses with the abutting muscle fiber. Understanding how our motoneurons are capable of bypassing such transmission blockade, thereby overcoming paralysis, by an astonishing display of plasticity {{is one of the}} research goals that have numerous therapeutic ramifications. This Review aims at giving a brief update on the recent discoveries regarding the molecular mechanism of <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins</b> intoxication. Curing botulism still is a challenge once the toxin has found his way inside motoneurons. In view of the potential use of <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins</b> as biological weapon, {{more research is needed to}} find efficient ways of curing this disease. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
50|$|Some neurotoxins, such as batrachotoxin, {{are known}} to destroy {{synaptic}} vesicles. The tetanus toxin damages vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMP), a type of v-SNARE, while <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins</b> damage t-SNARES and v-SNARES and thus inhibit synaptic transmission. A spider toxin called alpha-Latrotoxin binds to neurexins, damaging vesicles and causing massive release of neurotransmitters.|$|R
25|$|Toxins {{that can}} be used as weapons include ricin, staphylococcal {{enterotoxin}} B, <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin,</b> saxitoxin, and many mycotoxins.

25|$|<b>Botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> (BTX) is a {{neurotoxic}} protein {{produced by}} the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species. It prevents {{the release of the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction and thus causes flaccid paralysis. Infection with the bacterium causes the disease botulism. The toxin is also used commercially in medicine, cosmetics and research.|$|E
25|$|<b>Botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> (Botox) acts by {{suppressing the}} release of acetylcholine, whereas the venom from a black widow spider (alpha-latrotoxin) has the reverse effect. ACh {{inhibition}} causes paralysis. When bitten by a black widow spider, one experiences the wastage of ACh supplies and the muscles begin to contract. If and when the supply is depleted, paralysis occurs.|$|E

25|$|Physicians may {{consider}} diagnosing botulism if the patient's history and physical examination suggest botulism. However, these clues {{are often not}} enough to allow a diagnosis. Other diseases such as GuillainâBarrÃ© syndrome, stroke, and myasthenia gravis can appear similar to botulism, and special tests {{may be needed to}} exclude these other conditions. These tests may include a brain scan, cerebrospinal fluid examination, nerve conduction test (electromyography, or EMG), and an edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) test for myasthenia gravis. A definite diagnosis can be made if <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> is identified in the food, stomach or intestinal contents, vomit or feces. The toxin is occasionally found in the blood in peracute cases. <b>Botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> can be detected by a variety of techniques, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), electrochemiluminescent (ECL) tests and mouse inoculation or feeding trials. The toxins can be typed with neutralization tests in mice. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism can be cultured from tissues. On egg yolk medium, toxin-producing colonies usually display surface iridescence that extends beyond the colony.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} the spores {{releases}} <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin,</b> which is then absorbed into the bloodstream and taken throughout the body, causing paralysis by blocking the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.
