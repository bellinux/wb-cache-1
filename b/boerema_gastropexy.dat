40|$|Thirty-one infants {{less than}} a year of age {{underwent}} surgery for correction of pernicious gastroesophageal reflux. Severe growth retardation from persistent vomiting was the single most important indication for surgery (25 patients). Recurrent aspiration penumonitis was another serious sequella of reflux and necessitated surgery in six patients. The diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux was confirmed by barium swallow in all children, and in 17 a concomitant hiatal hernia was demonstrated. Patients selected for surgery were first treated conservatively unless they showed significant esophagitis or had a major portion of stomach in the chest. Babies treated early in the series had Allison repairs (7 transabdominal, 2 thoracic). Twenty-two subsequent patients have had Nissen fundoplication, and two gastropexies were performed. In 15 patients, significant gastric outlet obstruction required a complementary pyloroplasty. Four infants required a second surgical procedure because of recurrence. Two of the four patients had Nissen procedures with good results, one following a <b>Boerema</b> <b>gastropexy</b> and one following an Allison repair. The other two patients needed revision after fundoplication. There was no mortality. Twenty-eight children have been followed 6 months– 8 ½ years. All have excellent nutritional status and are following normal growth curves. Study of these patients indicates the need for early diagnosis and medical or surgical therapy for all infants with major gastroesophageal reflux...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{analyze the}} {{long-term}} results of <b>Boerema</b> anterior <b>gastropexy</b> using the Visick grading {{system in a}} university teaching hospital. METHODS: Retrospective review of 247 children with severe or complicated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Patients who underwent primary gastropexy between 1990 and 2001 were divided in 3 groups: (A) neurologic impaired patients (n = 83); (B) esophageal atresia patients (n = 36); and (C) patients without underlying disease (n = 128). The median length of follow-up after gastropexy was 7 years and 8 months (range, 1. 5 - 13 years). Follow-up was carried out using a standardized questionnaire and was obtained by telephone. Postoperative recurrence of symptoms during follow-up was considered as failure of the operation. RESULTS: Postoperative complications occurred in 20 patients (24 %) in group A, in 13 patients (36 %) in group B and in 23 patients (18 %) in group C. Thirty-three patients died during the follow-up period, 5 of whom during the postoperative period. Six children could not be traced; thus, 208 were available for long-term follow-up. Postoperative failures occurred in 12 patients (23 %) in group A, in 11 patients (31 %) in group B and in 17 patients in group C (14 %). Reoperation for recurrence of symptoms due to GERD was performed in 6 patients in group A, in 7 patients in group B and in 2 patients in group C. The final outcome {{at the time of}} interview was successful in 81 % of group A, in 88 % of group B and in 91 % of group C. CONCLUSIONS: In the long term, <b>Boerema</b> anterior <b>gastropexy</b> is an effective operation for complicated GERD in children without underlying disease as well as in neurologically impaired children and patients with esophageal atresi...|$|R
