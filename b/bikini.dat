The <b>bikini</b> line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a <b>bikini,</b> which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{underwear}} {{are described as}} <b>bikini</b> underwear and designed for men and women. For women, <b>bikini</b> or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular <b>bikini.</b> It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, <b>bikini</b> briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's <b>bikini</b> briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String <b>bikini</b> briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bikinis</b> {{have become}} a major {{component}} of marketing various women's sports. It is an official uniform for beach volleyball and is widely worn in athletics and other sports. Sports <b>bikinis</b> have gained popularity since the 1990s. However, the trend has raised some criticism as an attempt to sell sex. Female swimmers do not normally wear <b>bikinis</b> in competitive swimming. The International Swimming Federation (FINA) voted to prohibit female swimmers from racing in <b>bikinis</b> in its meeting at Rome in 1960.|$|R
50|$|Also, Jungle Girl is {{familiar}} with the jungle as some parts of it has hidden compartments to store her back-up jungle <b>bikinis</b> (whether if they are fur jungle <b>bikinis</b> or leather jungle <b>bikinis)</b> in the event that the one she is wearing ends up ripped in battle or if she is rendered naked in battle.|$|R
5|$|Indian {{women wear}} <b>bikinis</b> when they {{vacation}} abroad or in Goa without the family. Despite the conservative ideas prevalent in India, <b>bikinis</b> {{have become more}} popular. In summer, when women take up swimming, often in a public space, a lot of tankinis, shorts and single-piece swimsuits are sold. The maximum sales for <b>bikinis</b> happen in the winter, the honeymoon season.|$|R
5|$|String bikinis {{and other}} {{revealing}} clothes {{are common in}} surfing, though most surfing bikinis are more robust with more coverage than sunning bikinis. Surfing Magazine printed a pictorial of Kymberly Herrin, Playboy Playmate March 1981, surfing in a revealing <b>bikini,</b> and eventually started an annual <b>bikini</b> issue. The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with <b>bikini</b> contests, an issue that divides the female pro-surfing community into two parts. It has often been more profitable to win the <b>bikini</b> contest than the female surfing event.|$|E
5|$|The {{name for}} the <b>bikini</b> design was coined in 1946 by Parisian {{engineer}} Louis Réard, the designer of the <b>bikini.</b> He named the swimsuit after <b>Bikini</b> Atoll, where testing on the nuclear bomb was taking place. Fashion designer Jacques Heim, also from Paris, re-released a similar design earlier that same year, the Atome. Due to its controversial and revealing design, the <b>bikini</b> was slow to be adopted. In many countries it was banned from beaches and public places. While still considered risqué, the <b>bikini</b> gradually {{became a part of}} popular culture when film starsBrigitte Bardot, Raquel Welch, Ursula Andress and othersbegan wearing them on public beaches and in film.|$|E
5|$|Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{appeared}} in a <b>bikini</b> in An Evening in Paris (1967), a film mostly remembered for the first <b>bikini</b> appearance of an Indian actress. She also posed in a <b>bikini</b> for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and Dimple Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a <b>bikini</b> put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a transgression of female identity through {{a reversal of the}} state of modesty, which functions as a signifier of femininity in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a dozen times in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a <b>bikini.</b> But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about the rise of the <b>bikini</b> in Indian films.|$|E
5000|$|Since May 2015, the <b>Bikinis</b> {{located in}} the DFW Metroplex, which have been {{featured}} on Undercover Boss, {{are in the process}} of being rebranded by ATX Brands as Gino's East Pizzerias. This will make DFW the second populated MSA in Texas (besides Houston and San Antonio) to lose their existing <b>Bikinis</b> restaurants. ATX Brands will continue to retain the first two <b>Bikinis</b> located in Austin. DFW locations (Arlington, Richardson) have been shuttered since February 11, 2015, with the Mesquite location following suit after April 15, 2015. As of December 2015, just one <b>Bikinis</b> located in Austin, TX (located in Downtown Austin on Sixth Street) is still in operation, making it the final vestige of a restaurant chain facing extinction.

5|$|By {{that year}} the <b>bikini</b> made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy <b>bikini</b> decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the <b>bikini</b> came back again. US market research company NPD Group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years. On one hand the one-piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string <b>bikini</b> in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival <b>Bikini</b> Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a <b>bikini.</b> After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the <b>bikini</b> was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the <b>bikini</b> and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the first}} Miss World contest (originally the Festival <b>Bikini</b> Contest), was {{organized}} by Eric Morley. When the winner, Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a <b>bikini,</b> countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. Håkansson remains {{the first and last}} Miss World to be crowned in her <b>bikini,</b> a crowning that was condemned by Pope Pius XII who declared the swimsuit to be sinful. Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe Shopp on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the <b>bikini</b> for American girls, though she did not mind French girls wearing them. Actresses in movies like My Favorite Brunette (1947) and the model on a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the <b>bikini.</b>|$|E

Once they made 100 proper caipirinhas, they would receive their next clue. In On the Beach, teams {{had to pick up}} an umbrella loaded with <b>bikinis</b> and a mobile changing station and sell the <b>bikinis</b> to people on the beach. The buyers then had to change into the <b>bikinis</b> in the mobile changing station. Once teams earned R$100 (approximately 60), they would receive their next clue.|$|R

It had come under exclusive United States control on January 15, when Truman declared the United States to be the sole trustee of all the Pacific islands captured from Japan during the war. The Navy had been studying test sites since October 1945 and was ready to announce its choice of <b>Bikini</b> soon after Truman's declaration. On February 6, the survey ship Sumner began blasting channels through the <b>Bikini</b> reef into the lagoon. The local residents were not told why.|$|E

5|$|The <b>bikini</b> design became {{common in}} most Western {{countries}} by the mid-1960s as beachwear, swimwear and underwear. By the late 20th century {{it had become}} common as sportswear in sports such as beach volleyball and bodybuilding. Variations of the term are used to describe stylistic variations for promotional purposes and industry classifications, including monokini, microkini, tankini, trikini, pubikini, and skirtini. A man's brief swimsuit may also {{be referred to as}} a <b>bikini.</b> Similarly, a variety of men's and women's underwear types are described as <b>bikini</b> underwear.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bikini</b> has {{gradually}} grown to gain wide acceptance in Western society. By the early 2000s, bikinis {{had become a}} US$811 million business annually, and boosted spin-off services such as <b>bikini</b> waxing and sun tanning.|$|E

5|$|Their {{desire to}} return to <b>Bikini</b> was thwarted indefinitely by the U.S. {{decision}} to resume nuclear testing at <b>Bikini</b> in 1954. During 1954, 1956, and 1958, twenty-one more nuclear bombs were detonated at <b>Bikini,</b> yielding a total of , equivalent to more than three thousand Baker bombs. Only one was an air burst, the 3.8 megaton Redwing Cherokee test. Air bursts distribute fallout in a large area, but surface bursts produce intense local fallout. The first after Crossroads was the dirtiest: the 15 megaton Bravo shot of Operation Castle on March 1, 1954, which was the largest-ever U.S. test. Fallout from Bravo caused radiation injury to <b>Bikini</b> islanders who were living on Rongelap Atoll.|$|E
