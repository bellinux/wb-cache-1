40|$|PROTECTION OF COMPETITION - BLOCK EXEMPTIONS The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to {{describe}} and analyze regulation of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> mainly {{in the light of}} Commission's Guidelines. The function of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> is to exempt certain agreements from the prohibition of distortion of competition. The thesis is composed of five chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects related to the concept of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions.</b> First chapter is an introduction into the topic of protection of competition and explains basic principles and terminology. Chapter two deals with other exemptions from prohibition of distorting competition. The chapter is divided into four subchapters. The first one analyzes four aspects of the exemption under Article 101 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The second subchapter focuses on de minimis rule. Third subchapter deals with exemption in agriculture sector. Finally, the problem of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> is briefly introduced. Third chapter follows the historic development of the concept of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> both in European law and Czech law. Firstly, it describes the reasons for introduction of <b>block</b> <b>exemptions</b> by the Commission and then it focuses on the change of approach in year 2004, when ex post control was introduced.

5000|$|The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> Regulation is an {{exemption}} {{in a business}} line or industry, which debars organizations in the industry from some business activities {{in order to create}} competition. The regulation is highly known in the automobile industry due to the effect caused by the <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> Regulation (BER) from the European Commission. BER has changed the automobile industry in the last decade. Prior to 2003 automobile owners in the EU region risk nullifying their vehicle warranty when the vehicles were serviced or repaired in workshops not belonging to the vehicle manufacturer or its dealers. This barrier was broken in October 2003, when the European Commission (EC) passed a law allowing vehicle owners the freedom of having their servicing and repairs done at their chosen workshop.|$|E

These may also include regional or national chains and franchises including OEM car dealership sites. In the United States, these sites are commonly certified by their respective manufacturer to perform warranty and recall repairs by that manufacturer or distributor.

In the European Union a recent law (The EC <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> Regulation 1400/2002 (October 2003)) allows motorists more flexibility in selecting {{where they can get}} their car serviced.

The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> Regulation (BER) covers service and maintenance during the warranty period and prohibits vehicle manufacturers’ warranties from including conditions that require normal maintenance to be provided within the vehicle manufacturer’s network or that all parts used must be the manufacturer’s original spare parts. This means that motorists benefit from open market competition in aftermarket parts, repairs and services thus reducing the cost of servicing through better labor rates and competitively priced parts.

40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the application of}} Community principles of freedom to provide services and of free competition in international shipping lines in relation to unilateral and bilateral measures implemented by various countries to defend the interests of their flag shipping companies and in relation to agreements between shipowners (conferences, shipping consortia, strategic alliances) {{in order to reduce}} competition. With regard to the latter aspect is taken into account the question of the compatibility between agreements in liner shipping and EU antitrust rules (article 101 and article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) with particular attention to liner conferences. In 1986 a <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> from the application of the European antitrust law had been justified on the assumption that liner conferences brought stability, ensuring shippers reliable services that could not be achieved by less restrictive means. The <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> had been in place for two decades. More recently a study conducted by the European Commission determined that liner conferences operating in EU trades were not producing the anticipated benefits that had justified the original <b>block</b> <b>exemption.</b> So, in 2006 the European Union decided to repeal the <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> from competition law for liner shipping conferences. After a two years transition period, the repeal went into effect in October 2008. It is therefore examined the impact of the repeal of the conference <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> on the shipowners, on the shippers and in general on the international liner trades. The importance and actuality of the subject taken into account in this book are, inter alia, confirmed {{by the fact that the}} Federal Maritime Commission, in a recent study, published in 2012, compares US and EU liner trades in order to identify the effects of the UE repeal of the <b>block</b> <b>exemption...</b>|$|E

State aids can take {{different}} forms: direct (transfers, tax exemptions) or indirect (e. g. the definition of the reserved area in network industries). There are significant cross-country differences both in the magnitude and the type of instruments used for state aids. The European Commission acts as a de-facto regulator by using competition law to approve state aids. We analyze the rationale of this two step process by pointing out the benefits of decentralizing redistributive decisions to the member states and the costs linked to reduced coordination (the use of structural funds, viewed as a complement to state aids, reduces some of these costs). We then point out that in a second best world objectives of redistribution are not incompatible with competition but that their relationship is less straightforward than with perfect markets; this has consequences for the rationale of having <b>block</b> <b>exemptions,</b> and for the effects of structural funds.

40|$|The Master's thesis {{provides}} {{readers with}} a basic analysis of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010. The mentioned regulation confers a benefit of the so called <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> on broad spectrum of vertical agreements including in this context also certain agreements among competing undertakings. Since agreements enjoying {{the benefit of the}} <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> are presumed to meet criteria stipulated in Article 101 (3) TFEU, the <b>block</b> <b>exemption</b> eliminates legal uncertainty which undertakings whose agreements distort competition within the meaning of Article 101 (1) TFEU would otherwise face. It follows that {{it is not necessary to}} examine such agreements on its merits. Thus, transaction costs are reduced. Structure of the thesis is chosen so that it reflects three main questions concerning applicability of the <b>block</b> <b>exemption,</b> namely whether (i) an agreement falls within the scope of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010, whether (ii) it contains black clauses (hard-core restrictions) and whether (iii) it contains (non-severable) grey clauses.

40|$|The idea of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{consequences}} of the new laws regulating vertical relations in automotive retailing. The automotive industry has its own set of competition laws regulating vertical relations, called the Motor Vehicle <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption.</b> The name meaning that the distribution of motor vehicles is exempted as a block from the general European competition policy. The regulation covers the European Economic Area, i. e. The European Union, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. The automotive industry is a large and important industry in Europe. The top manufacturers are some of the largest firms in the world and of high importance to the domestic industries. Certain aspects have for a long time characterized the distribution of cars in Norway and more generally Europe. The up-stream market is more concentrated and relative stronger than the down-stream market. A large majority of the dealers is independent retailers, i. e. not owned by the manufacturers. The brand aspects of the industry are strong; there are distinct differentiated brands with names, logos and attributes well known to most consumers. Cars {{are some of the most}} complex and important consumer products available. Many consumers are dependent on cars and if they malfunction it may have disastrous consequences. Because of the importance of the industry; The European Commission has for a long time recognized that the automotive industry requires its own set of competition rules. The Commission changed the <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> in 2002 because they were of the opinion that the old <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> from 1995 was outdated. The 1995 regulation had for example no rules regulating sales on the Internet. The scope for the thesis is hence to first discuss the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> compared to the old, determine the effects and then analyzing them. The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> also regulates the supply of spare parts and after sale services, but my focus will entirely be on the distribution of new passenger cars. I will first discuss the main effects in a general context and then build a model to analyze them in a vertical framework. I will try to give some answers to the following questions: ·	Why do we have economic regulation in general and why does motor vehicle distribution have its own regulation? ·	Which vertical restraints were affected by changes made in the regulation with the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption?</b> ·	What are the effects normally associated with these vertical restraints? ·	How are the vertical relations between suppliers and dealers in the automotive industry affected by the regulatory changes? In Chapter 2 I will give a brief characterization of the industry. The focus will be on the main aspects, such as market concentration and demand. I will also see if the Norwegian market has any special attributes compared to the rest of Europe. Chapter 3 consists of three parts. In the first part I discuss theories explaining the existence of competition policy. The motivation for this is that it is also important to have in mind why a set of regulation exists when discussing its consequences. I will discuss vertical relations generally in the second part. The <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> concerns vertical relations and a general discussion of this felt necessary before discussing the <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> in detail. The main part of the chapter will be a detailed discussion of the important changes in the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> compared to the old and which forms of vertical restraints that are affected. I will give a discussion of the two important vertical restraints found in Chapter 3, exclusive dealing and exclusive territories, in Chapter 4. I will discuss the important aspects that are normally associated with these vertical restraints and how different settings affect the effects of them. The main model will be found in Chapter 5. The model consists of two producers selling close substitutes and competing in prices. The idea is to observe how the possibility to use different vertical restraints affects the producers’ incentives to use independent retailers. The model is based on several existing papers analyzing vertical relations. I will show that the possibility to use two-part tariffs is necessary for vertical separation to be a dominant strategy. If franchise-fee is possible then nonexclusive dealing will remove the gain that the producers get from using independent retailers, but will not alone give the producers incentives to integrate vertically. I will also show that nonexclusive dealing only leads to lower prices if the producers may use franchise-fees. The conclusion is found in Chapter 6. Here I will sum up the effects the new <b>Block</b> <b>Exemption</b> has and give some remarks on possible developments in the Norwegian market...|$|E

The importance of this {{research is}} to understand the conditions for the selection of strategic choices in the maritime industry. In October 2008, the <b>Exemption</b> <b>Block,</b> created by regulation 4056 - 86, was repealed.

The exemption regards the application of competition rules to certain types of agreements in the insurance sector, joint compilations, tables and studies which involve the exchange of information between insurers; and also the common coverage of risk via co-(re) insurance pools.
