5|$|The {{traditional}} focuses {{of sociology}} include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, sexuality and deviance. As all spheres {{of human activity}} {{are affected by the}} interplay <b>between</b> <b>social</b> structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects, such as health, medical, economy, military and penal institutions, the Internet, education, social capital and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference <b>between</b> <b>social</b> practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions <b>between</b> <b>social</b> groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E
40|$|Social {{capital has}} been shown to be {{positively}} associated with a range of health outcomes, yet few studies have explored the association <b>between</b> mothers’ <b>social</b> capital and child health. We examine the relationship between mothers' access to social capital via participations in community activities and their children's health. Instrumental variable estimator is used to deal with reverse causality. Data come from the Indonesian Family Life Surveys (IFLS) of 1997, 2000, and 2007. We find strong evidence for the association <b>between</b> mother's <b>social</b> capital and child health before and after the Asian financial crisis. In contrast, there is no relation <b>between</b> mother's <b>social</b> capital and child health during the crisis. The results suggest that the link <b>between</b> mother's <b>social</b> capital and child health is severely ruptured during the period of the crisis, possibly by reducing the number of available community activities and the ability of mothers to participate in such activities. ...|$|R

Other areas of New Labour's policy maintained a traditional approach to crime; {{the prison population}} in 2005 rose to over 76,000, mostly owing to the increasing length of sentences. Following the September 11 attacks, the Labour government attempted to emphasise counter-terrorism measures. From 2002, the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour; in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, Labour introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs).|$|E
5|$|The film drew {{heavily from}} the {{conventions}} of Westerns, and is a defining example of the masala film, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate <b>between</b> <b>social</b> order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of India's daily vernacular. In January 2014, Sholay was re-released to theatres in the 3D format.|$|E

West et al. (1993 a) report that the relationship <b>between</b> mild <b>social</b> deviance and accident rates was partly mediated by faster driving speed. The aim of the present research {{was to determine whether}} a broader measure of road traffic violations would fully mediate the relationship <b>between</b> mild <b>social</b> deviance and accident rates. Self-reports of violations (using the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire), mild social deviance and accident rates were collected for 830 drivers, together with information about age, sex and annual mileage. A series of Poisson regressions were computed to investigate the relationship between these predictor variables and accident rates. The data confirmed the relationship <b>between</b> mild <b>social</b> deviance and accident rates. However, this relationship appeared to be mediated by the propensity to commit driving violations and unspecified factors associated with age. The results of the analysis are discussed with reference to the appropriateness of various intervention strategies to promote safer driving...|$|R
