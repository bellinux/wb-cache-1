5000|$|In percussion, cymbal choke is a drum stroke which {{consists}} of striking a cymbal with a drum stick held {{in one hand and}} then immediately grabbing the cymbal with another hand, or more rarely, with the same hand. The cymbal choke produces a <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> which is abruptly silenced, which can be used for punctuation or dramatic fortissimo effects. In some modern music, namely heavy metal, it is [...] "often employed to emphasize a particular beat or signal an abrupt conclusion to a passage." [...] Cymbal chokes are used extensively by classical percussionists to muffle the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a cymbal in accordance with the composer's notation, or in an attempt to match the sustain of other instruments in the ensemble. [...] "The effect, a sudden <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> is often further strengthened by a single, simultaneous kick with the bass drum." ...|$|R

His rooms were in the highest flat of a lofty building, and his glance could travel afar beyond the clear panes of glass, {{as though he were}} looking out of the lantern of a lighthouse. The slopes of the roofs glistened, the dark broken ridges succeeded each other without end like sombre, uncrested waves, and from the depths of the town under his feet ascended a {{confused}} and unceasing mutter. The spires of churches, numerous, scattered haphazard, uprose like beacons on a maze of shoals without a channel; the driving rain mingled with the falling dusk of a winter's evening; and the booming of a big clock on a tower, striking the hour, rolled past in voluminous, austere <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> with a shrill vibrating cry at the core.

60|$|Northwick's man {{met him at}} {{the station}} with the cutter. The train was a little late, and Elbridge was a little early; after a few moments of formal waiting, he began to walk the clipped horses up and down the street. As they walked they sent those quivers and thrills over their thin coats which horses can give at will; they moved their heads up and down, slowly and easily, and made their bells jangle noisily together; the <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> evoked by their firm and nervous pace died back in showers and falling drops of music. All the time Elbridge swore at them affectionately, with the {{unconscious}} profanity of the rustic Yankee whose lot has been much cast with horses. In the halts he made at each return to the station, he let his blasphemies bubble sociably from him in response to the friendly imprecations of the three or four other drivers who were waiting for the train; they had apparently no other parlance. The drivers of the hotel 'bus and of the local express wagon were particular friends; they gave each other to perdition at every other word; a growing boy, who had come to meet Mr. Gerrish, the merchant, with the family sleigh, made himself a fountain of meaningless maledictions; the public hackman, who admired Elbridge almost as much as he respected Elbridge's horses (they were really Northwick's, but the professional convention was that they were Elbridge's), clothed them with fond curses as with a garment. He was himself, more literally speaking, clothed in an old ulster, much frayed about the wrists and skirts, and polished across the middle of the back by rubbing against counters and window-sills. He was bearded like a patriarch, and he wore a rusty fur cap pulled down over his ears, though it was not very cold; its peak rested on the point of his nose, so that he had to throw his head far back to get Elbridge in the field of his vision. Elbridge had on a high hat, and was smoothly buttoned to his throat in a plain coachman's coat of black; Northwick had never cared to have him make a closer approach to a livery; and it is doubtful if Elbridge would have done it if he had asked or ordered it of him. He deferred to Northwick in a measure as the owner of his horses, but he did not defer to him in any other quality.|$|E

50|$|Vocalization {{has been}} {{described}} in 30 families <b>of</b> fishes. Aggressive <b>sounds</b> tend to be middle-frequency (about one kHz). Distressed sounds {{can be a bit}} higher frequency (about 6 kHz). Longspine squirrelfish make two kinds <b>of</b> <b>sounds,</b> a single “grunt” and a short <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> called a “staccato.” The grunt sounds are used mostly to defend their territory. The staccato sound indicates alarm. Other longspine squirrelfish hearing the staccato sound will first retreat into their crevices, then come out to investigate the threat. Sometimes several of them make staccato sounds to scare away predators like the moray eel. This behavior is called “mobbing.” Researchers have observed that the longspine squirrelfish makes sounds more frequently at dusk.|$|R

5000|$|Sound is {{produced}} simply by expelling {{air from the}} lungs. However, to vary the sound quality in a way useful for speaking, two speech organs normally move towards each other to contact each other to create an obstruction that shapes the air in a particular fashion. The point of maximum obstruction is called the place of articulation, {{and the way the}} obstruction forms and releases is the manner of articulation. For example, when making a p sound, the lips come together tightly, blocking the air momentarily and causing a buildup of air pressure. The lips then release suddenly, causing a <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> The place <b>of</b> articulation <b>of</b> this <b>sound</b> is therefore called , and the manner is called [...] (also known as a plosive).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{a method for}} an experiment to create dark soliton-like waves in a trapped atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). With the phase imprinting method, a soliton-like disturbance is produced along the x-axis. The method is used in two cases (with and without rotation of an asymmetric trapping potential). The disturbance in a two-dimensional system is unstable. The soliton-like perturbation is found to decay into more stable vortex pairs together with a <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> wave. The simulations are performed by solving the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation (2 D GPE).

5000|$|A basic {{outline of}} Peter dolphin's {{linguistic}} progress is as follows: early lessons involved mostly noise and interruptions from Peter during English lessons, and a food reward of fish {{was necessary for}} him to 'attend class.' After several weeks, a concerted effort by Peter to imitate the instructor's speech was evident, and human-like sounds were apparent, and recorded. More interesting was the dolphin's immediate grasp of basic semantics, such as the different aural indicators for 'ball' and 'doll' and other toys present in the aquarium. Peter was able to perform tasks such as retrieval on the (aurally) indicated object without fail. Later in the project the dolphin's ability to process linguistic syntax was made apparent, in that Peter could distinguish between the commands (e.g., only) [...] "Bring {{the ball to the}} doll," [...] and [...] "Bring the doll to the ball." [...] This ability not only demonstrates the bottlenose dolphin's grasp of basic grammar, but also implies the dolphins' own language must include some such syntactical rules. The correlation between length and 'syllables' (bursts of the dolphin's sound) with the instructor's speech also went from essentially zero {{at the beginning of the}} session to almost a perfect correlation by its completion. I.e., a sentence spoken by the instructor involving 35 syllables and lasting 8 seconds would be met with an 8-second burst of sound from Peter dolphin involving 35 easily discernible 'syllables' or <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E

40|$|Since the {{generation}} of granular textures was first automated using a computer (Roads 1978), granular synthesis has grown to become a popular tool for creating new sounds in electro-acoustic music. Many effects can be achieved through the granulation of sampled sound including time compression (Jones and Parks 1988) and expansion (Truax 1990) independent of pitch alterations. Such effects can be created using Cycling 74 's Max/MSP software, allowing them to be utilized in real-time. However, the software does not include sufficient externals to meet the efficiency and flexibility needs for creating such effects. This paper details a collection of externals and abstractions for Max/MSP that the author has created {{with the aim of}} meeting these needs.
