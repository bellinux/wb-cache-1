5|$|For {{the first}} time all four Canadian {{divisions}} were assembled to participate in a battle. The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions. This brought the nominal strength of the Canadian Corps to about 170,000 men, of whom 97,184 were Canadian.|$|E
5|$|Gaza is {{composed}} of thirteen districts (hayy) outside of the Old City. The first extension of Gaza <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> city center was the district of Shuja'iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period. In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City's walls.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{introductions of}} A. altissima to countries outside of its native range {{were to the}} southern areas of Korea {{as well as to}} Japan. It is possible that the tree is native to these areas, but it is generally agreed that the tree was a very early introduction. Within China itself it has also been naturalised <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> native range in areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang.|$|E

5|$|After the missed kick, California {{took over}} at its 12-yard line. Aaron Rodgers {{completed}} three passes for 58yards and Arrington added 15yards on an end-around run. It took California 2:44 in game time to advance 88yards for a touchdown. The score tied {{the game at}} 28–28 with 10:12 {{to go in the}} quarter. Tech received the post-touchdown kickoff and gained two quick first downs, but after advancing the ball <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> own 40-yard line, was forced to punt it back to California.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E

5|$|As combat {{operations}} quickly revealed, {{the two sides}} were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it {{in the months following}} the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E
5|$|As it grew <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, {{college football}} garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.|$|E
5|$|By mid-November, the Germans {{had nearly}} taken Stalingrad in bitter street {{fighting}} when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and {{an assault on}} the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to surrender, and the front-line had been pushed back <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Russian city of Kursk.|$|E

5|$|By the 1950s, {{with the}} area around Woking by this time heavily populated, rental income from the LNC's land {{holdings}} was an extremely valuable asset, and in May 1955 the Alliance Property Company launched a hostile takeover bid {{with the aim of}} using the cemetery's land for property development. The bid failed, but prompted the LNC to secure the passing of the London Necropolis Act 1956, allowing the sale of all remaining surplus land. A new company, the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company, was founded to oversee the disposal of the remaining unsold lands as well as the cemetery reserve, finally formally recognising that Brookwood Cemetery would never expand <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> original boundaries.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Space Travel was fully ported to the PDP-7, Thompson had {{expanded}} his software suite to a full, basic operating system, {{in a way}} he had been unable to with the Multics project and the GE 635. The operating system he designed spread to other users in the company, and formed the core of what would be named in 1970 the Unix operating system. Space Travel was one of the early mainframe games developed before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games, and was never distributed <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> initial locations. As a result, it had no effect on future video games, and its primary legacy is that of sparking the creation of Unix.|$|E
5|$|Development for Final Fantasy XII {{began in}} December 2000 and was headed by Final Fantasy Tactics {{director}} Yasumi Matsuno and Final Fantasy IX director Hiroyuki Ito. Matsuno provided the original concept and plot but {{was forced to}} bow out of his roles midway through production due to health concerns. The team was restructured as a consequence: the new directorial duo consisted of Ito and Hiroshi Minagawa, while Akitoshi Kawazu of SaGa series fame became the game's executive producer. Series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi was disappointed by Matsuno's departure and declined {{to play the game}} <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> introduction.|$|E

5|$|During the Hellenistic period {{under the}} Seleucids (between 312 and 64 BC), Palmyra became a prosperous {{settlement}} owing {{allegiance to the}} Seleucid king. In 217 BC, a Palmyrene force led by Zabdibel joined the army of King Antiochus III in the Battle of Raphia which ended in a Seleucid defeat by Ptolemaic Egypt. In {{the middle of the}} Hellenistic era, Palmyra, formerly south of the al-Qubur wadi, began to expand <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> northern bank. By the late second centuryBC, the tower tombs in the Palmyrene Valley of Tombs and the city temples (most notably, the temples of Baalshamin, Al-lāt and the Hellenistic temple) began to be built.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have also}} been {{captured}} and bred by zoos, {{but they are not}} a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. Yet {{there is at least one}} example of a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be ten years old, and one case of a fisher living to be approximately 14 years old, well <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> natural lifespan of 7 years.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist <b>beyond</b> <b>its</b> orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and culminated {{at the start of the}} 20th with Percival Lowell's quest for PlanetX. Lowell proposed the PlanetX hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.|$|E
