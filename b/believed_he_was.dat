5|$|In 2005, Jessica White, Ne-Yo's girlfriend at the time, {{gave birth}} to a boy, naming him Chimere after Ne-Yo's middle name. Though Ne-Yo <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the father, he later {{discovered}} the child was not his.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{commitments}} to his job, raising a family, school, {{and his political}} volunteerism, Gygax continued to play wargames. It reached the point that Mary Jo, pregnant with their second child, <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> having an affair and confronted him in a friend's basement only to discover him and his friends sitting around a map-covered table.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{initially}} {{worked for}} the woman who sponsored her passage to the United States and then {{took a job as}} a maid with a family named Jost. Julio was the maitre d' at the Palace Hotel. Julio courted Maria until she realized she was pregnant. Their son José was born on December 12. His birth certificate reads 1923 but Sarria <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in 1922. Julio and Maria never married.|$|E
50|$|There are {{conflicting}} versions as to García's birthplace. The police file {{states that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Yauco, Puerto Rico, but journalist and writer Alexis Morales Cales {{who specialized in}} the criminal's life, <b>believes</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Maricao, specifically in the Indiera Alta ward. Others still <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Lares.|$|R
50|$|Despite his prodigious arcane talents, Camber {{repeatedly}} expresses {{his frustration}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not born a Healer. Camber is a modest man whose faked death forces him {{to conceal his}} irritation and frustration with his admirers who <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a saint and pursue his canonization. Camber firmly <b>believes</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> unworthy of such status.|$|R

5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she never <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that"—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and {{innuendo}} following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was about them.|$|E
5|$|An {{experienced}} right-handed opening batsman, Brown was on {{his third}} campaign in England, having first toured in 1934 before the World War II. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948, Barnes and Morris had risen above him in the pecking order and become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown {{was selected as the}} reserve opener, a decision that generated controversy among pundits who <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> past his best.|$|E
5|$|Around 1749, Priestley became {{seriously ill}} and <b>{{believed}}</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dying. Raised as a devout Calvinist, he believed a conversion experience {{was necessary for}} salvation, but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject election and to accept universal salvation. As a result, the elders of his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission as a full member.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the house across the street after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, though this was changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E
5|$|In January 1918, Andrić joined several South Slav nationalists in editing a {{short-lived}} pan-Yugoslav periodical called Književni jug (Literary South). Here {{and in other}} periodicals, Andrić published book reviews, plays, verse, and translations. Over {{the course of several}} months in early 1918, Andrić's health began to deteriorate, and his friends <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> nearing death. However, he recovered and spent the spring of 1918 in Krapina writing Ex ponto, a book of prose poetry that was published in July. It was his first book.|$|E
5|$|MalcolmX had by {{now become}} a media favorite, and some Nation members <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a threat to Muhammad's leadership. Publishers had shown {{interest}} in MalcolmX's autobiography, and when Louis Lomax wrote his 1963 book about the Nation, When the Word Is Given, he used a photograph of MalcolmX on the cover. He also reproduced five of his speeches, but featured only one of Muhammad'sall of which greatly upset Muhammad and made him envious.|$|E

5|$|The libertines {{continued}} organizing opposition, insulting {{the appointed}} ministers, and challenging {{the authority of}} the Consistory. The council straddled both sides of the conflict, alternately admonishing and upholding Calvin. When Perrin was elected first syndic in February 1552, Calvin's authority appeared to be at its lowest point. After some losses before the council, Calvin <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> defeated; on 24 July 1553 he asked the council to allow him to resign. Although the libertines controlled the council, his request was refused. The opposition realised that they could curb Calvin's authority, but they did not have enough power to banish him.|$|E
5|$|Although Baggio {{initially}} {{struggled with}} injuries {{at the beginning}} of his first season with Milan, he came back into the starting line-up and was appointed the main penalty taker. He helped Milan win the Serie A title, notably scoring a goal against his former team Fiorentina from a penalty in the title-deciding match. Baggio finished the season with 10 goals in all competitions, in 34 appearances; 7 of his goals were scored in Serie A, in 28 appearances, and he also provided 10 assists in Serie A. He became one of the six players to win the Scudetto in consecutive years with different teams, and was voted the club's best player of the season by the fans, despite playing a more creative role. Towards the end of the season, Baggio had disagreements with Capello due to limited playing time, as Capello <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no longer fit enough to play for 90 minutes; although Baggio frequently started matches, he was often substituted during the second half.|$|E
5|$|As a captain, Jardine {{inspired}} great loyalty in his players, even if {{they did}} not approve of his tactics. Christopher Douglas judges that Jardine did very well to keep the team united and loyal on the Bodyline tour. He points out that team spirit was always excellent and the players showed great determination and resolve. Jardine particularly impressed Yorkshiremen who played under him, as they believed he thought about cricket in a similar way to their county colleagues. He became close to Herbert Sutcliffe during the Bodyline tour, even though Sutcliffe was sceptical about Jardine on the previous Australian tour in 1928–29. Hedley Verity was impressed by Jardine's tactical understanding and named his younger son Douglas after the captain. Bill Bowes expressed approval of his leadership after initial misgivings, and went on to call him England's greatest captain. Nevertheless, some players such as Arthur Mitchell who played under Jardine <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> intolerant and unsupportive of players of lesser talent, expecting everyone to perform at world-class standards.|$|E

5|$|As {{the coal}} boom began to wane, Patton sold {{most of his}} coal {{interests}} in 1978. After a meeting with allies of his friend, First District Congressman Carroll Hubbard, in Madisonville on September 20, 1978, Patton considered running for governor in 1979. However, he subsequently decided that he lacked the time to organize a campaign before the May primary election; a letter leaked to the Paducah Sun showed that he <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> losing Hubbard's support. He joined Terry McBrayer's campaign during the primary, and after McBrayer lost, he worked to elect John Y. Brown, Jr., the Democratic nominee. Brown won the election, and Patton was appointed deputy secretary of transportation. He served only three months before resigning to protest Brown's proposal for a coal severance tax.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E
5|$|Byrne {{fought in}} an era when English boxing, {{although}} illegal, was patronised by many powerful individuals. Its patronage and popularity did not, however, free it from corruption, heavy betting, and staged fights. Byrne fought eight recorded matches, but accounts of his career focus on the last three, against the Scottish champion Alexander McKay, the English champion Jem Ward, and James Burke for the vacant championship of England. The injuries McKay received in his fight with Byrne resulted in his death the following day, and rioting in his home country of Scotland. Byrne went on to lose his next match against Jem Ward, which some commentators <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not sufficiently in condition to fight. His final contest in May 1833 was a gruelling 99rounds against James Burke that lasted for 3hours and 6minutes, the longest ever recorded prize fight. Byrne died three days later as the result of damage to his brain caused by the beating he had received.|$|E

5|$|Charles Spencer Chaplin {{was born}} on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. There is no {{official}} record of his birth, although Chaplin <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. His mother and father had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal carer of Hannah's illegitimate son, Sydney John Hill. At {{the time of his}} birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, was a popular singer. Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891. The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son – George Wheeler Dryden – fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, {{the couple}} moved to Washington, D.C., where Nixon {{took a job}} at the Office of Price Administration. In his {{political}} campaigns, Nixon would suggest that this was his response to Pearl Harbor, but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941. Both Nixon and his wife <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier. He was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence. He did not enjoy the role, and four months later, applied to join the United States Navy. As a birthright Quaker, he could have claimed exemption from the draft; he might also have been deferred because he worked in government service. But instead of exploiting his circumstance, Nixon sought a commission in the navy. His application was successful, and he was appointed a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S Naval Reserve (U.S. Navy Reserve) on June 15, 1942.|$|E
5|$|In late September, the Italian fleet, {{including}} Fiume, made a sweep for a British troop convoy from Alexandria to Malta, {{but it made}} {{no contact}} with the British ships. Fiume was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier strike on Taranto {{on the night of}} 1112 November, but she was not attacked in the raid. Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and clashed with the British fleet the next day, in an engagement that lasted for about an hour. Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance. The British heavy cruiser HMS Berwick was hit twice by 203mm rounds during the engagement, either fired by Fiume or her sister Pola.|$|E
