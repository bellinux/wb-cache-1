40|$|Seafloor lithologic maps {{have been}} widely used to {{identify}} conservation sites. In this study, a lithologic interpretation of Oregon’s territorial seafloor was created as an interim product in response to the need for a comprehensive lithologic map that will be used in the identification, evaluation and design of marine reserves in Oregon. While future multibeam mapping of the Oregon Territorial Sea will likely replace this product in the next few years, the ground truth data from which the map is constructed will continue in use in future efforts. This mapping project utilized a classical geologic approach aided by GIS technology in which all relevant thematic geologic layers were applied to interpret patterns of seafloor lithology. The discovery of approximately 9, 600 NOS <b>bottom</b> <b>samples</b> from the National Ocean Service (NOS) historic hydrographic smooth sheet archives has tremendously improved upon the original <b>sample</b> dataset (305 <b>bottom</b> <b>samples)</b> used in previous characterization of Oregon’s territorial seabed.

This method uses a rectangular dredge to sample a constant and small surface of sediments in soft substrate areas. It was compared to a classical point abundance sampling by electrofishing. Both methods generated large numbers of small samples encompassing the spatial heterogeneity of ammocoete distributions. However, the <b>bottom</b> <b>sampler</b> provided samples with higher abundance and was more efficient for small individuals. Furthermore, the equipment is cheap and the method is cost-effective, since it can be operated by only two people.

30|$|Also, we {{separated}} our whole sample into two sub-samples such as low dividend pay-out ratio firms and high dividend pay-out ratio firms. Further, Following Lin et al. (2012) and Kadapakkam et al. (1998), we divided all total assets value (market capitalization) in three sub-sample such as top, middle and <b>bottom</b> <b>sample</b> {{based on the}} tercile approach. A large size dummy variable BIG takes the value 1 if the value of total assets comes in the top sample (upper tercile) and zero otherwise. Similarly we use a dummy variable 1 for construct a small size dummy variable SMALL which indicates that total assets value comes in the <b>bottom</b> <b>sample</b> (lower tercile) and zero otherwise. The total assets value come under the middle sample (middle tercile) considered as medium size firms. The firm’s affiliation to any group is represented as a dummy variable GROUP and take value 1 and the remaining firms as STAND and take value zero. The firm’s which are not affiliated to any group represented as a dummy variable STAND and takes value 1 and the remaining firms as GROUP and take value zero.|$|E
30|$|As {{the iron}} and {{manganese}} levels in raw produced water were 68, 792 and 53, 142 times the background, they made good tracers. The results for iron and manganese {{were similar to}} those for ammonia, and their elevated concentrations are shown in the <b>bottom</b> <b>sample</b> from NE 50 (Figs.  9, 10). This confirms the presence of produced water at NE 50. The initial concentration of copper in raw produced water is 103 times less than the background, so dilution has reduced its concentration, even at NE 50, to near background.|$|E
30|$|To help {{interpret}} the measured data {{and understand the}} transport behaviour of produced water, a modeling study was performed. Modeling revealed that the near background level concentrations detected at the 26 stations were due to sampling outside the narrow plume boundary. This {{indicated that there was}} no accumulation of pollutants near the platform except inside the narrow plume. The ratios of measured to predicted concentrations for the near <b>bottom</b> <b>sample</b> were 1.25 for naphthalene, indicating a slight underestimation of the model. For the mid-depth sample, the model predicted a naphthalene concentration below the detection limit which agreed with the non-detectable level of naphthalene for this sample.|$|E

30|$|The {{strain in}} the bulging part can be {{calculated}} from the initial length of the sample and {{the width of the}} bulging section. We used a relatively linear sample segment in Fig.  5, where the deformation appears to have been accommodated only by bulging. The difference between the initial sample length (10.2  mm) and the linear segment in Fig.  5 (9.0  mm) gives the initial length of the bulging part (1.2  mm). The strain calculated from the initial sample length and the linear segment in the deformed sample is consistent with a total permanent strain of 12 % in the mechanical data, which also uses the initial sample length (Fig.  3). The length of the bulging part in the deformed sample corresponds to the width (0.7  mm) of the transparent portion around the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>sample</b> core boundaries. The calculated strain in the bulging part determined from the initial length of the bulging segment and the length of the transparent portion in the deformed sample is ca. 40 %, which is approximately four times the permanent strain of the sample in the mechanical data (Fig.  3).|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The use of boat motors on lakes {{is allowed}} on some {{but not all}} lakes. Does the use of {{motorized}} boats {{have an effect on}} the quality of water? Objective or Hypotheses: We will investigate the water quality in lakes to determine if there is a difference in water quality due to boat motors. We hypothesize that lakes where boat motors are allowed will have lower water quality than lakes where boat motors are not allowed. Methods: Four different water quality parameters were measured (pH, Alkalinity, Hardness and Conductivity), from six different lakes. Water samples were taken from each lake using a Beta bottle at. 5 meters down and at the deepest depth and analyzed back in the lab. The HydrolabTM was used out in the field. The parameters measured by the Hydrolab™ (pH and Conductivity) were collected at. 5 meters down and at the deepest depth. The parameters that were measured in the lab were the Hardness and Alkalinity. Historical data from 2004 - 2014 was used to complete the data set.

40|$|Gypsum {{efflorescence}} (GE) is {{a recent}} problem affecting modern clay brick masonry and permanently alters an aesthetic aspect of a building. This type of efflorescence affects exclusively masonry built in the last 30 years and usually appears {{a couple of years}} after construction. The GE characteristics indicate that the components are derived from the masonry itself and not from the atmosphere. The GE genesis and mechanism, and specifically the gypsum crystallisation behaviour in porous materials, are poorly understood. We have designed and executed a series of crystallisation experiments, to compare gypsum behaviour with common efflorescing salts: NaCl and Na 2 SO 4. Our experimental wick test setup consists of a brick sample mounted in a cell. The salt solution is supplied to the <b>bottom</b> <b>sample</b> side while the drying process exclusively occurs at the top. The experiments are carried out under three drying regimes: ‘accelerated’ (35 °C, 19 % RH), ‘laboratory’ (24 °C, 58 % RH) and ‘cold’ (12 °C, 80 % RH). The first simulates accelerated efflorescence formation, the second is comparable to common wick tests while the third and last imitates early spring conditions. The experiments demonstrated that gypsum accumulates below the surface, unlike natural GE occurrences. Since the basic wick test does not simulate frequent masonry wetting, we have implemented wetting cycles which resulted in a considerable GE formation. We conclude that gypsum intrinsically has a subflorescing tendency, but frequent surface wetting progressively leads to GE formation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Extraction {{from the}} Booster to the Main Ring {{occurred}} at Long Straight 13. The {{nature of the}} extraction process was such that 1 % to 2 % of the beam was lost in this region. There was an appreciable amount of beam extracted as shown in Table 1, which gives the yearly integrated intensities from 1973 to 1997. A simple model of the extraction losses {{was set up by}} Chandra Bhat utilizing the program CASIM. A sample output I shown in figure 1 which gives contours of stars/cm 3 in the dirt, also schematically depicted are the three six feet deep sampling holes which were drilled to map out this cascade. One aspect of this study has been the study of the production of non-migrating nuclides and further study may in fact yield better values for the K parameter, the probability per star that an atom of the particular nuclide will be produced. Also {{the results of this study}} can give experimental numbers for the production of other nuclides when the amount of Na 22 has been calculated. However, the most important part of this study has been the determination of the amount of tritium produced by extraction from the Booster and the experimentally determined migration rate. If we look at the top sample result in hole S 2 of 777 pCi/ml of tritium and use the experimentally determined rate of migration and the depth to the aquifer of 13. 1 m, they calculate that the concentration will have decayed away to 1. 1 E- 8 pCi/ml. If we look at the <b>bottom</b> <b>sample,</b> which is 11. 3 m away from the aquifer, they calculate that the 116 pCi/ml will have decayed to 5. 2 E- 8 pCi/ml. The conclusions is that the rate of migration determined over the 24 year irradiation history of the Booster extraction point is small enough that there is no problem with migration of tritium to the aquifer...|$|E

MBC and VV samples were taken from three depths (20, 30 and 60 m) in two sites. Total densities sampled with the MBC were up to 10 times higher than those obtained with van Veen grab. VV samples might lead to faunistic abundance underestimation compared to the MBC samples.
