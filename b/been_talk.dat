5|$|Designed {{for future}} {{expansion}} to accommodate additional aircraft, there has <b>been</b> <b>talk</b> of a terminal expansion, though official plans {{have yet to}} be announced. However, with the gate space being used to 100 percent capacity at peak times, there is very little capacity available for new flights unless they arrive and depart at off-peak times (10 AM-12 PM),(7 PM-10 PM).|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} {{a small group}} of Cuban iguanas was {{released}} from a zoo on Isla Magueyes, southwest of Puerto Rico, forming an independent free-ranging feral population. As of 2000, there has <b>been</b> <b>talk</b> of removing or relocating this population of iguanas by the US Department of Interior. This feral population is the source for 90% of the captive Cuban iguanas held in private collections and was the source for part of a study on animal communication and evolution conducted by Emilia Martins, a biologist at Indiana University.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} there has <b>been</b> <b>talk</b> of {{building}} {{a replica of the}} memorial. On 31 May 2008 on Anzac Parade, Canberra, the formal dedication of a site in which will be placed a new national Boer War memorial was held. A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date, and they will be conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial. In the design brief for the memorial, the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide's: {{going so far as to}} say that they would be willing to accept a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced.|$|E
30|$|The Poisson model {{indicates}} {{that the number of}} segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>is</b> not different for CoP instructors while controlling for other factors (p =. 52).

This came to naught, however, and Ferrari ran smaller lighter 156 cars for the 1963 Formula One season. This time the team depended on drivers Bandini, John Surtees, Willy Mairesse and Ludovico Scarfiotti. Surtees won the 1963 German Grand Prix, at which Mairesse crashed heavily, rendering him unable to drive again.|$|E

25|$|When {{compared}} to other countries, Dutch drug consumption falls in the European average at six per cent regular use (twenty-one per cent {{at some point in}} life) and considerably lower than the Anglo-Saxon countries headed by the United States with an eight per cent recurring use (thirty-four at some point in life). Experts {{have come to the conclusion}} that the policies applied do not play a striking role in these statistics, though there is debate over this issue (CEDRO, 2004). While there has <b>been</b> <b>talk</b> for over a decade about preventing foreigners from entering Dutch cannabis coffeeshops by requiring customers to possess a 'weedpass', this legislation has not been enacted, so Dutch coffeeshops continue to sell cannabis openly to both locals and foreigners. However a small number of southern municipalities (including Roosendaal and Maastricht) in the Netherlands now require customers to carry identification proving that they are resident in the Netherlands.|$|E
60|$|Yet this {{universal}} language has not succeeded, {{at a moment}} of crisis, in imposing itself on the whole world.

I do not know whether French or Flemish was Vandervelde's nursery speech, but I am quite certain he will know more of it after this struggle than he knew before. In short, whether or no there be a new union of hearts, there has really and truly been a new division of tongues.|$|R

25|$|For many years, {{there had}} <b>been</b> <b>talk</b> of an {{existing}} American League team relocating to Los Angeles. In 1940, the St. Louis Browns asked AL owners for permission to move to Los Angeles, but were turned down. They planned another move for the 1942 season, and this time got permission from the league. A schedule was even drawn up including Los Angeles, but the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 made major-league sports of any sort on the West Coast unviable. In 1953, there was again talk of the Browns moving to L.A. for the 1954 season, but the team was sold and moved to Baltimore instead as the Orioles. There were on-again, off-again discussions between city officials and the Washington Senators regarding a possible move. There were also rumors that the Philadelphia Athletics' move to Kansas City in 1955 was a temporary stop {{on the way to}} Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Flight 901, in {{conjunction}} with the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 in Chicago six months earlier, severely hurt the reputation of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. ZK-NZP, along with the other seven Air New Zealand DC-10s, had only just returned to service after being grounded following the crash of Flight 191 when the crash of Flight 901 occurred. Flight 901 was the third deadliest accident involving a DC-10, following Turkish Airlines Flight 981 and American Airlines Flight 191. The event {{marked the beginning of the}} end for Air New Zealand's DC-10 fleet, although there had <b>been</b> <b>talk</b> before the accident of replacing the aircraft; DC-10s were replaced by Boeing 747s from mid-1981, and the last Air New Zealand DC-10 flew in December 1982. The occurrence also spelled the end of commercially operated Antarctic sightseeing flights – Air New Zealand cancelled all its Antarctic flights after Flight 901, and Qantas suspended its Antarctic flights in February 1980, only returning on a limited basis again in 1994.|$|E
