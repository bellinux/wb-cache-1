40|$|Flax fibres were {{modified}} by radiation induced graft copolymerization of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) by pre-irradiation method in an emulsion medium. The effect of reaction parameters {{on the degree}} of grafting (DOG) such as concentration of bleaching agent, absorbed dose, monomer concentration, temperature and reaction time were investigated. The DOG was found to be dependent on the investigated parameters. The incorporation of poly(GMA) grafts in the <b>bleached</b> <b>flax</b> fibres was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The structural and mechanical changes were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and mechanical tester, respectively. The results revealed that reacting <b>bleached</b> <b>flax</b> fibres irradiated with 20 kGy with 5 % GMA emulsion containing 0. 5 % polyoxyethylene-sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) surfactant at 40. °C for 1 h led to a maximum DOG of 148 %. The grafted fibres showed sufficient mechanical strength and hydrophobicity which make them promising precursors for development of adsorbents after appropriate chemical treatments...|$|E

Seli et al.[31] (1998) studied the kinetics of degradation of cellulosic fabrics (cotton, linen) by artificial aging at constant temperature (123 - 192 °C), {{as well as in}} combination to the effect of light (280 - 380 nm) in the temperature range of 50 - 85 °C and RH 10 % and 70 %. The natural aging of cellulosic materials (high purity paper, cotton, raw and <b>bleached</b> <b>flax,</b> viscose) was simulated by thermal oxidation in air at the constant temperature and the synergetic effect of light.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, {{a large number}} of animal-derived {{materials}} have been introduced for several biomedical applications. Surprisingly, the use of plant-based materials has lagged behind. To study the feasibility of plant-derived biomedical materials, we chose flax (Linum usitatissimum). Flax fibers possess excellent physical-mechanical properties, are nonbiodegradable, and there is extensive know-how on weaving/knitting of them. One area where they could be useful is as implantable mesh structures in surgery, in particular for the repair of incisional hernias of the abdominal wall. Starting with a <b>bleached</b> <b>flax</b> thread, a prototype mesh was specifically knitted for this study, and its cytocompatibility was studied in vitro and in vivo. The experimental data revealed that application of flax in surgery first requires a robust method to remove endotoxins and purify the flax fiber. Such a method was developed, and purified meshes did not cause loss of cell viability in vitro. In addition, endotoxins determined using limulus amebocyte lysate test were at acceptable levels. In vivo, the flax meshes showed only mild inflammation, comparable to commercial polypropylene meshes. This study revealed that plant-derived biomaterials can provide a new class of implantable materials that could be used as surgical meshes or for other biomedical applications.

40|$|Research on lignin {{biodegradation}} {{has become}} of great interest, {{due to the}} fact that lignin is one of the most abundant renewable materials, next to cellulose. Lignin is also the substance that gives color to raw flax fibers. In order to <b>bleach</b> the <b>flax</b> and to keep its tenacity high enough for textile applications, it is necessary to remove the lignin and partially to preserve the pectin. Lignin and pectin are the main constituents of the layer which sticks the flax cells together within the multicellular technical fiber. White-rot fungi and their oxidative enzymes, laccases and peroxid-ases (lignin peroxidases and manganese peroxidases), are being applied for the biobleaching of papermaking pulp, thereby reducing the need for environmentally harmful chemicals. Some data also suggest that it is possible to use other phenolytic enzymes, such as pure laccase, for this purpose. The objective of the present work was to study the possibility of <b>bleaching</b> <b>flax</b> fibers by pure laccase and combined laccase peroxide treatment, aimed at obtaining fibers with high whiteness and well-preserved tenacity...|$|R
40|$|The phenols syringaldehyde (SA), acetosyringone (AS) and p-coumaric acid (PCA) {{were used}} as natural laccase {{mediators}} in combination with a laccase from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus to <b>bleach</b> <b>flax</b> fibres. Their performance was compared with 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) in terms of enzyme stability, and pulp and effluent properties. HBT and PCA were found to inactivate laccase {{in the absence of}} pulp. However, in the presence of unbleached flax pulp stability was increased; for example with PCA, laccase retained 77 % of its initial activity, in contrast with complete inactivation in the absence of pulp. This suggests a protective effect of the pulp against denaturalization of the enzyme. All natural mediators resulted in a reduced kappa number after the subsequent alkaline treatment with hydrogen peroxide; the reduction being especially marked with SA (about 2 units – with respect to the control sample) and comparable to that obtained by HBT. Brightness was significantly increased by all natural mediators, but especially by AS and SA (23 % with both), which performed very similarly to HBT in this respect. Natural mediators therefore might constitute an effective alternative to synthetic mediators for flax pulp biobleaching. This paper demonstrates {{for the first time the}} use of natural mediators in the laccase-assisted delignification of flax pulp and their effect on the properties of the resulting effluents.

Pulp and paper research is focussing through enzyme systems investigation for developing green chemistry technologies due to existing environmental concerns and to legal restrictions. Moreover, it exists also an increasing strategic interest in using flax fibres to obtain high-quality specialty papers. That is why we study the application of biotechnology as an efficient alternative to traditional industrial processes based {{on the use of}} chemical agents. This work is framed by two of the main research topics of the Paper and Graphic Specialty Laboratory in the Textile and Paper Engineering Department of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. One research line is based on pulp bleaching and is focused basically on the study of enzymatic systems as biobleaching agents; the other research topic that has been recently introduced in our investigation group is the use of enzymes as functionalisation agents by promoting the grafting of several compounds. Laccase is the main enzyme used in this thesis; it is an oxidoreductase that can assist reactions in an eco-friendly way since laccase uses air and produces water as the only by-product. Moreover, laccase can work under mill conditions and has wide application potential. The first part of this thesis involved the use of enzymes to <b>bleach</b> <b>flax</b> pulp. The aim was to explore the potential of various natural mediators (lignin-derived compounds) for delignifying flax fibres in order to identify the most efficient and ecofriendly choice among them. Afterwards, we assessed the use of various enzyme delignification stages in an industrial bleaching sequence. The ensuing totally chlorine free (TCF) sequence comprised various laccase-mediator system treatments (L stage) followed by a by a chelating stage (Q stage) and a subsequent bleaching step with hydrogen peroxide (Po stage). A xylanase pretreatment was additionally carried out. Laccases used came from the fungi Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Myceliophthora thermophila; the performance of several natural mediators was compared with the obtained with the application of various synthetic mediators. In addition, the lack of studies on the properties of effluents from the treatment of non-wood pulp with laccase and natural mediators led A- 1 A- 2 us to examine effluent properties upon biotreatments and after different bleaching stages.

40|$|High-quality <b>flax</b> pulp was <b>bleached</b> in a totally-chlorine-free (TCF) {{sequence}} using a laccase-mediator system. Three fungal laccases (from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus eryngii) and two mediators, 2, 2 ′-azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 sulfonic acid) and 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), were compared. P. cinnabarinus and T. versicolor laccases in {{the presence}} of HBT gave the best results in terms of high brightness and low lignin content (kappa number). The former laccase also resulted in the best preservation of cellulose and the largest removal of residual lignin as revealed by analytical pyrolysis, and was selected for subsequent TCF bleaching. Up to 90 % delignification and strong brightness increase were attained after a laccase-mediator treatment followed by H 2 O 2 bleaching. This TCF sequence was further improved by applying H 2 O 2 under pressurized O 2. In this way, we obtained up to 82 % ISO brightness (compared with 37 % in the initial pulp, and 60 % in the peroxide-bleached control) and very low kappa number (near 1). Good results were also found when the laccase-mediator treatment was performed in a bioreactor under pressurized oxygen. The pulp properties obtained, which could not be attained by conventional TCF <b>bleaching</b> of <b>flax</b> pulp, demonstrate the feasibility of enzymatic bleaching to substitute chlorine-containing reagents in manufacturing of these high-price paper pulps. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Enzymatic <b>bleaching</b> of <b>flax</b> {{alkaline}} pulp {{is intended}} here by using laccase-mediator systems (LMS) based on Pleurotus eryngii, Trametes versicolor and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus laccases and two mediators. The {{efficiency of the}} different LMS treatments was compared in terms of brightness, kappa number and viscosity modifications. Furthermore, changes in the molecular structure of residual lignin and lignin/carbohydrate ratio were analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the treated pulps. Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and T. versicolor laccases {{in the presence of}} 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), were the most effective for flax pulp delignification. Up to 20 % ISO brightness increase with respect to the initial pulp and a decrease of kappa number from 9 to 3 were attained after alkaline extraction of the pulps treated with those LMS. Pycnoporus cinnabarinus laccase plus HBT gave also the best selectivity in lignin removal. Analytical pyrolysis of the LMS-treated pulps showed a selective removal of lignin against cellulose and a strong alteration of the residual lignin with preferential removal of the syringyl units. Pycnoporus cinnabrinus LMSHBT gave the best results in terms of decrease of lignin/cellulose and syringyl/guaiacyl ratios, in agreement with data from pulp parameters. For the above reasons laccase from P. cinnabarinus and HBT were selected for further assays including a peroxide step. Up to 89 % relative selignification rate (attaining 1. 3 kappa number) and an incease of 44 % ISO brightness were atained after LMSHBT-peroxide bleaching.
