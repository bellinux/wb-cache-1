40|$|Oxygen-rich deep {{interiors}} of the Giant Planets cannot explain {{the discovery of}} H 2 O and CO 2 in the stratospheres of the Giant Planets by Feuchtgruber et al. (1997) because these species are trapped by condensation around their tropopause levels (except CO 2 in Jupiter and Saturn). Therefore, several sources in the direct or far environment of the Giant Planets have been proposed: icy rings and/or satellites, interplanetary dust particles and large comet impacts. CO does not condense at the tropopauses of Giant Planets, so that oxygen-rich interiors are a valid source. An internal component has indeed been observed in the vertical profile of CO in Jupiter (<b>Bézard</b> et al., 2002) and in Neptune (Lellouch et al., 2005), while an upper limit has been set on its magnitude by for Saturn (Cavalié et al., 2009). In addition to interiors, large comets {{seem to be the}} dominant external source, as shown by various studies: <b>Bézard</b> et al. (2002) for Jupiter, Cavalié et al. (2010) for Saturn and Lellouch et al. (2005) for Neptune. The first detection of CO in Uranus was obtained by Encrenaz et al. (2004) from fluorescent emission at 4. 7 microns. Assuming a uniform distribution, a mixing ratio of 2 x 10 - 8 was derived. Despite this first detection almost a decade ago, the situation has remained unclear ever since. In this paper, we will present the first submillimeter detection of CO in Uranus, carried out with Herschel in 2011 - 2012. Using a simple diffusion model, we review the various possible sources of CO (internal and external). We show that CO is mostly external. We also derive an upper limit for the internal source. And with the thermochemical model of Venot et al. (2012), adapted to the interior of Uranus, we derive an upper limit on its deep O/H ratio from it. Acknowledgments T.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of water vapour in the Venus {{troposphere}} obtained by modelling specific water vapour absorption bands within the 1. 18 μ m window. We compare the results with the normal technique of obtaining the abundance by matching {{the peak of the}} 1. 18 μ m window. Ground-based infrared imaging spectroscopy of the night side of Venus was obtained with the Anglo-Australian Telescope and IRIS 2 instrument with a spectral resolving power of R 2400. The spectra have been fitted with modelled spectra simulated using the radiative transfer model VSTAR. We find a best fit abundance of 31 ppmv (- 6 + 9 ppmv), which is in agreement with recent results by <b>Bézard</b> et al. 2011 using VEX/SPICAV (R 1700) and contrary to prior results by <b>Bézard</b> et al. 2009 of 44 ppmv (+/- 9 ppmv) using VEX/VIRTIS-M (R 200) data analyses. Comparison studies are made between water vapour abundances determined from the peak of the 1. 18 μ m window and abundances determined from different water vapour absorption features within the near infrared window. We find that water vapour abundances determined over the peak of the 1. 18 μ m window results in plots with less scatter than those of the individual water vapour features and that analyses conducted over some individual water vapour features are more sensitive to variation in water vapour than those over the peak of the 1. 18 μ m window. No evidence for horizontal spatial variations across the night side of the disk are found within the limits of our data {{with the exception of a}} possible small decrease in water vapour from the equator to the north pole.

40|$|Interferometric {{observations}} of the atmosphere of Titan were performed with the Submillimeter Array on two nights in February 2004 to investigate the global average vertical distributions of several molecular species above the tropopause. Rotational transitions of CO, isomers of HCN, and HC 3 N were simultaneously recorded. The abundance of CO is determined to be 51 +/- 4 ppm, constant with altitude. The vertical profile of HCN is dependent upon the assumed temperature but generally increases from 30 ppb at the condensation altitude (~ 83 km) to 5 ppm at ~ 300 km. Further, the central core of the HCN emission is strong and can be reproduced only if the upper stratospheric temperature increases with altitude. The isotopic ratios are determined to be 12 C/ 13 C= 132 +/- 25 and 14 N/ 15 N= 94 +/- 13 assuming the Coustenis & <b>Bezard</b> (1995) temperature profile.

[2012]. Icarus 219, 110 - 128) have been applied {{to the analysis of}} Gemini-N/NIFS observations of Neptune made in 2009 and VLT/CRIRES observations made in 2010. The new line data are found to greatly improve the fit to the observed spectra and present a considerable advance over previous methane datasets. The improved fits lead to an empirically derived wavelength-dependent correction to the scattering properties of the main observable cloud deck at 2 - 3 bars that is very similar to the correction determined for Uranus' lower cloud using the same line dataset by Irwin et al. (Irwin, P. G. J., de Bergh, C., Courtin, R., <b>Bézard,</b> B., Teanby, N. A., Davis, G. R., Fletcher, L. N., Orton, G. S., Calcutt, S. B., Tice, D., Hurley, J. [2012]. Icarus 220, 369 - 382). By varying the abundance of CH 3 D in our simulations, analysis of the Gemini/NIFS observations leads to a new determination of the CH 3 D/CH 4 ratio for Neptune of 3. 0 - 0. 9 + 1. 0 × 10 - 4, which is smaller than previous determinations, but is identical (to within error) with the CH 3 D/CH 4 ratio of 2. 9 - 0. 5 + 0. 9 × 10 - 4 derived by a similar analysis of Gemini/NIFS observations of Uranus made in the same year. Thus it appears that the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune have an almost identical D/H ratio, which suggests that the icy planetisimals forming these planets came from the same source reservoir, or a reservoir that was well-mixed at the locations of ice giant formation, assuming complete mixing between the atmosphere and interior of both these planets. VLT/CRIRES observations of Neptune have also been analysed with the WKMC- 80 K methane line database, yielding very good fits, with little evidence for missing absorption features. The CRIRES spectra indicate that the mole fraction of CO at the 2 - 3 bar level must be substantially less than its estimated stratospheric value of 1 × 10 - 6, which suggests that the predominant source of CO in Neptune's atmosphere is external, through the influx of micrometeorites and comets, although these data cannot rule out an additional internal source. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) {{patients}} experience postural instability as {{a primary}} motor symptom (Parkinson, 1817). The majority of PD patients use L-dopa to treat motor symptoms associated with the disease; however, extended use of L-dopa can cause involuntary movement production termed L-dopa induced dyskinesia (LID) (<b>Bezard</b> et al., 2001). Recently, researchers have speculated that postural sway variability (CoP variability) is associated with clinically unapparent LID (Rocchi et al., 2004). This experiment sought to determine the relationship between CoP variability and LID in PD patients. Eight PD patients on L-dopa medication and eight age matched neurologically healthy control subjects performed a precision aiming task where we manipulated the orientation, size and distance of the target. We recorded CoP fluctuations using two force plates and kinematics of the head, torso, arm and leg segments using the VICON 3 -D motion capture system. The results indicate that decreased joint coordination of the head, arm and torso segments contribute to greater CoP variability in PD patients, particularly in the ML direction. Our results also reveal that increased task difficulty by manipulation of target distance increases movement amplitude, and consequently CoP variability. These findings suggest a causal relationship between LID and CoP variability in PD patients...|$|E

Surprisingly, the different contributions of parkin-sonism and L-Dopa treatment on monoaminergic changes remain largely unknown. Here, both the consequences of vehicle or 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) exposure and the sub-sequent effects of acute or chronic L-Dopa treatment were evaluated in macaques. Monoamine levels were measured in the putamen, the motor and prefrontal cortices, the hippocampus, and the amygdala using postmortem high-pressure liquid chromatography. In normal monkeys, L-Dopa treatment increased DA in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, but decreased serotonin levels in motor domains. Chronic L-Dopa treatment elevated monoamine levels in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala in both normal and MPTP-treated monkeys. A substantial increase in DA levels in these regions, paral-leled by a decrease in serotonin concentrations were related with dys-kinesia severity, demonstrating that major changes in monoamine release also occur in nonmotor regions. Such monoaminergic dysregu-lation in limbic domains may also directly contribute to the expression of motor complications, such as dyskinesia, by impairing integrative processes upstream from motor execution...|$|E

H., Pollack, J. B., Sitton, B. R., Carlson, R. W., Kamp, L. W., Baines, K. H., Encrenaz, T., Taylor, F. W. [1993]. Planet. Space Sci. 41, 515 - 542) and Crisp (Crisp, D. [1986]. Icarus 67, 484 - 514), and assumes a composition for the cloud particles of sulfuric acid and water, with acid concentration as a free parameter to be determined. Other retrieved parameters are the average size of the particles and the altitude of the cloud base in the model. Latitudinal variation in the atmospheric temperature structure was incorporated using data from the Venus Radio Science experiment (VeRa). Values are estimated initially using wavelength pairs selected for their unique sensitivity to each parameter, and then validated by comparing measured to calculated spectra over the entire wavelength range, the latter generated using the NEMESIS radiative transfer and retrieval code (Irwin, P. G. J., Teanby, N. A., de Kok, R., Fletcher, L. N., Howett, C. J. A., Tsang, C. C. C., Wilson, C. F., Calcutt, S. B., Nixon, C. A., Parrish, P. D. [2008]. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 109, 1136 - 1150). The sulfuric acid concentration in the cloud particles is found to be higher in regions of optically thick cloud. The cloud base altitude shows a dependence on latitude, reaching a maximum height near - 50 °. The increased average particle size near the pole found by Wilson et al. (Wilson, C. F., Guerlet, S., Irwin, P. G. J., Tsang, C. C. C., Taylor, F. W., Carlson, R. W., Drossart, P., Piccioni, G. [2008]. J. Geophys. Res. (Planets) 113, E 12) and the finding of spatially variable water vapor abundance at 35 - 40. km altitude first reported by Tsang et al. (Tsang, C. C. C., Wilson, C. F., Barstow, J. K., Irwin, P. G. J., Taylor, F. W., McGouldrick, K., Piccioni, G., Drossart, P., Svedhem, H. [2010]. Geophys. Res. Lett. 37, L 02202) are both confirmed. The implications of these improved descriptions of cloud structure and variability for the chemistry, meteorology, and radiative energy balance on Venus are briefly discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
