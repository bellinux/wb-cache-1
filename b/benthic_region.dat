50|$|The <b>benthic</b> <b>region</b> of {{the ocean}} begins at the shore line (intertidal or eulittoral zone) and extends {{downward}} along {{the surface of the}} continental shelf out to sea. The continental shelf is a gently sloping <b>benthic</b> <b>region</b> that extends away from the land mass. At the continental shelf edge, usually about 200 meters deep, the gradient greatly increases and is known as the continental slope. The continental slope drops down to the deep sea floor. The deep-sea floor is called the abyssal plain and is usually about 4,000 meters deep. The ocean floor is not all flat but has submarine ridges and deep ocean trenches known as the hadal zone.|$|E
50|$|During his career, Taggart {{served for}} a {{combined}} seven years aboard five survey ships. At sea, {{he served as}} the co-director of geophysical studies of plate tectonics that determined how the crustal plates of North America, the Pacific Ocean, and Asia are connected. He also served in the Gulf of Mexico where he conducted geophysical surveys that identified underwater salt domes for the stocking of U.S. strategic oil reserves. He was the operations officer for the International Air-Sea Interaction Project in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, coordinating the activities of six research ships, 15 aircraft, and 20 university and government research agencies from three countries.

50|$|Meroplankton is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} {{a wide variety of}} planktonic organisms, which spend a portion of their lives in the <b>benthic</b> <b>region</b> of the ocean. These organisms do not remain as plankton permanently, rather, they are planktonic components in transition, which eventually become larger organisms. After a period of time in the plankton, meroplankton either graduate to the nekton or adopt a benthic (often sessile) lifestyle on the seafloor. Meroplankton consists of larval stages of organisms such as sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans and dinoflagellates and diatoms. Meroplankton forms an algal medium that is found between the loosely mixed sediments and water. This layer can be re-suspended in the water column by turbulent mixing. Success of meroplankton populations depends on many factors, such as adult fecundity, fertilization success, growth and larval stage duration, behaviour, dispersal, and settlement. Mortality depends on many factors, such as predation, competition, disease, parasites, and physiological stresses. Survival and mortality of meroplankton has a direct effect on adult population numbers of many species. Many of the common, well-known animals found on the Great Barrier Reef spend time as free-swimming meroplankton, bearing little or no resemblance to the adult they will become. The differences between the appearance of larval and adult stages led to much confusion in the past when larval forms were often believed to be completely different species from the adults. Larvae spend varying amounts of time in the plankton, from minutes to over a year. However, just how long these tiny animals can be considered truly planktonic is under some debate.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the primary}} goals of hypolimnetic {{oxygenation}} systems (HOx) from a drinking water perspective is to suppress sediment-water fluxes of reduced chemical species (e. g., manganese and iron) by replenishing dissolved oxygen (O 2) in the hypolimnion. Manganese (Mn) in particular is becoming a serious problem for water treatment on a global scale. While it has been established that HOx can increase sediment O 2 uptake rates and subsequently enhance the sediment oxic zone via elevated near-sediment O 2 and mixing, the influence of HOx on sediment-water fluxes of chemical species with more complicated redox kinetics like Mn has not been comprehensively evaluated. This study was based on Mn and O 2 data collected primarily in-situ to characterize both the sediment and water column in a drinking-water-supply reservoir equipped with an HOx. While diffusive Mn flux out of the sediment was enhanced by HOx operation due to an increased concentration driving force across the sediment-water interface, oxygenation maintained elevated near-sediment and porewater O 2 levels that facilitated biogeochemical cycling and subsequent retention of released Mn within the <b>benthic</b> <b>region.</b> Results show that soluble Mn levels in the lower hypolimnion increased substantially when the HOx was turned off {{for as little as}} âˆ¼ 48 h and the upper sediment became anoxic. Turning off the HOx for longer periods (i. e., several weeks) significantly impaired water quality due to sediment Mn release. Continual oxygenation maintained an oxic <b>benthic</b> <b>region</b> sufficient to prevent Mn release to the overlying source water...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{diet and}} feeding habits of armado catfish, Pterodoras granulosus (Valenciennes, 1821), were {{studied in the}} Lajeado Reservoir, Tocantins, Brazil, and the mouth of its tributaries. Stomach {{contents}} of 327 specimens were analyzed by the percentage composition and volumetric methods. The feeding of armado {{on a wide variety}} of foods, including both animal and plant items, leads to its classification as a euriphagic species with herbivorous tendency. However, it should be noted that armado showed a strong ontogenetic diet shift, with the gradual replacement of detritus and sediment by plant items, especially terrestrial ones. The environmental use pattern of P. granulosus corroborates the ontogenetic shift observed in its diet. Small fish predominated mainly in the <b>benthic</b> <b>region</b> and detritus and sediment represented an important resource, whereas large fish fed mainly on terrestrial plants, as they explore open water sites and the surface of the water column...|$|E

As surface feeders, they eat primarily aquatic and terrestrial insects, {{but they are also}} known to eat crustaceans, mollusks, and small fish. Young mooneyes tend to feed in more <b>benthic</b> <b>regions,</b> eating immature caddisflies, mayflies, midges, corixids, and plecopterans. Although no predators of adult mooneyes are known, young mooneyes are susceptible to predation by larger piscivorous fish. Two trematode parasites specific to H. tergisus are Crepidostomum hiodontos and Paurorhynchus hiodontis. Researchers believe these parasites are derived from ingested food items. Thus far, no research has been done on how or if these parasites affect populations and ecology of mooneyes. [...] H. tergisus has latitudinal variation in growth rates in which northern populations mature faster than southern populations. This may be due to less turbidity in the northern latitudes.|$|R
40|$|Nonindigenous {{species may}} exert strong effects on {{ecosystem}} structure and function. The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) has been attributed with profound changes in invaded ecosystems across eastern North America. We explored vertical profiles of water flow velocity and chlorophyll a concentration in western Lake Erie, over rocky substrates encrusted with Dreissena, {{to assess the}} extent to which mussels influence coupling between <b>benthic</b> and pelagic <b>regions</b> of the lake. Flow velocity was always low at surveyed sites (less than or equal to 2. 9 cm s- 1) and declined in direct proximity to the lakebed. Mean chlorophyll a concentration was also low (less than 5 Î¼g L- 1) at all sites and depths. Chlorophyll a concentration was positively correlated with distance above lakebed and was lowest (0. 3 Î¼g L- 1) directly adjacent to the lakebed. Spatial patterns of zooplankton grazers could not explain observed vertical gradients in chlorophyll concentration. Hydrodynamic modeling revealed that filtering effects of Dreissena in a nonstratified, shallow basin depend mainly on upstream chlorophyll con- centration, intensity of turbulent diffusion, feeding efficiency of the mussel colony, and the distance downstream from {{the leading edge of the}} mussel colony. In contrast to widespread perceptions that molluscs reduce phytoplankton concentration only adjacent to the lakebed, modeling scenarios indicated that depletion occurs throughout the water column. Depletion was, however, inversely proportional to distance above the lakebed. Simulation results are consistent with field-based observations made in shallow water habitats populated by large Dreissena populations in the Great Lakes and elsewhere. Results from this study indicate that zebra mussels strongly enhance coupling between pelagic and <b>benthic</b> <b>regions</b> in shallow lakes. Enhanced coupling between these regions explains, in part, high population densities of Dreissena and of many benthic invertebrates in ecosystems invaded by zebra mussels...|$|R
40|$|Nuisance {{growth of}} the {{filamentous}} green alga, Cladophora glomerata, {{has been a problem}} in Lake Michigan for decades. Phosphorous loading restrictions implemented throughout the Great Lakes region in the 1970 â€™s were successful in reducing the standing crop levels of Cladophora. Since the early 2000 â€™s there has been a resurgence of Cladophora growth in near-shore Lake Michigan. This resurgence has been attributed to the activities of the invasive species of mussels known as Dreissena rostriformis burgensis, which was first discovered in Lake Michigan in 1998. This paper builds on the Great Lakes Cladophora Model developed by Tomlinson et. al. in 2010; and explicitly takes into account the feeding activity of the mussel population which supplies phosphorus to the <b>benthic</b> <b>region</b> that stimulates Cladophora growth. The new model demonstrates good agreement between simulation and measured data for Cladophora biomass during a growing season. The mechanistic model is used to provide a quantitative analysis of the contribution of and sensitivity to key environmental factors in Cladophora biomass.

30|$|The {{archipelago}} {{system has}} been playing an important role {{for the protection of}} marine biodiversity and comprised of nine species of seagrass (Jagtap 1991). Earlier studies have dealt mainly with the taxonomic and distributional aspects and environmental assessment of Indian seagrass (Jagtap and Inamdar 1991; Thangaradjou et al. 2007, 2010; Umamaheswari et al. 2009; Nobi et al. 2011; Sulochanan et al. 2011). However, with a sole reference work of Das (1996), the structure and function of the seagrass of Andaman and Nicobar Islands remain poorly understood. The importance of such fragile communities as a major ecosystem that improves the fishery productivity of the marine systems (De Troch et al. 1998; Unsworth et al. 2014) remains largely unevaluated. The studies relating meiofaunal assemblage with the seagrass ecosystem around the Indian waters are meager (Arunachalam and Nair 1988; Jayabarathi et al. 2012). Further, the knowledge of abundance and composition of faunal assemblages in seagrass beds compared to unvegetated sediment will provide information on the structuring factors and the phytal preferences of meiobenthic invertebrates. The epiphytic load and organic nutrients are often associated with macrophyte production in the <b>benthic</b> <b>region,</b> and thus, differences in density and diversity of meiobenthos may be expected between vegetative and un-vegetative areas. In the present study, the meiofaunal assemblage was investigated by comparing sediments of seagrass vegetation and the adjacent bare region.|$|E
40|$|After {{the zebra}} mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, was first {{discovered}} in Lake St. Clair in 1988 and rapidly {{spread throughout the}} Great Lakes, broad ecological changes became apparent in regions where this species was most abundant. Previous investigations documented dramatic increases in water clarity (Hebert et al. 1991, Marsden et al. 1993, Leach 1993), declines in chlorophyll and phytoplankton abundances (Leach 1993, Nicholls and Hopkins 1993, Holland 1993), and changes in benthic invertebrate communities (Griffiths 1993, Dermott et al. 1993, Stewart and Haynes 1994). These studies were conducted in various regions and defined impacts on a specific ecosystem component. Taken together, results indicate {{a major shift in}} energy flow patterns from the pelagic to the <b>benthic</b> <b>region.</b> Such a shift is so fundamental that every component of the food web from bacteria to fish would likely be affected either directly or indirectly. Thus, to truly understand the significance of shifts in energy flow patterns, impact assessments should be as holistic as possible within a given ecosystem. Despite the magnitude of observed impacts, however, establishing cause-effect relationships at the ecosystem-level is not an easy task. Not all changes occur at the same rate, and natural variation, along with man-induced influences such as nutrient abatement programs, confound interpretations of any mussel-induced impacts. For this reason, ecosystem- 411 level impacts can best be examined, interpreted, and certainly modeled, by integrating studies of both ecosystem structure and function within a specific, well-defined region...|$|E
5000|$|According to a 1982 {{study by}} Burr, the {{quantitative}} diet of the brindled madtom was determined via dissection of stomach contents which [...] "â€¦ contained mostly dipteran larvae and pupae, ephemeropteran naiads, trichopteran larvae and adult isopods, â€¦, chironomids and simuliids were most frequently eaten.

Worms, other microcrustaceans, other aquatic insects and fish and plant material made only small contributions to the total diet,". Predation upon adult brindled madtoms is primarily from upper trophic level aquatic predators such as the longnose gar. Brindled madtom egg clutches are a viable food source for multiple opportunistic species including crustaceans, insects, and other fishes.

Images were collected in water depths less than 10 m at an approximately constant height above the bottom of 2 m. Images were processed using a semi-automated procedure to determine the ratio of the lakebed covered by exposed C. flumineashells. A visual review was conducted on a subset of the images to determine presence of filamentous algae that has been observed in association with C. fluminea. Nearly 100 km of shoreline was covered over a 7 -d period, and C. fluminea presence was reconfirmed in 4 regions and additional 10 regions identified. In regions where the presence of C. fluminea was confirmed, C. fluminea depth distribution was validated by comparing image detection counts and results from a benthic sediment grab sample survey. Three regions around the lake were identified to have filamentous green algae or charophyte species. It was impossible to identify species of the known filamentous algal taxa (Cladophora glomerata, Spirogyra spp., and Zygnema spp.).

40|$|Partial migration, whereby populations {{consist of}} {{residents}} and migrants, is common among migrating organisms. Partial migration of aquatic organisms, however, remains largely under-studied {{even though many}} aquatic animals exhibit horizontal and vertical migrations during their lifetime. Macroinvertebrates of the genus Mysis exhibit diel vertical migrations (DVM). Some species have recently been observed to exhibit partial diel migrations where some individuals reside on the bottom throughout the night while others migrate into the water column. To test the hypothesis that individuals are fixed as residents or migrants, we compared demographic information and C and N isotope compositions of M. diluviana caught at night in pelagic and <b>benthic</b> <b>regions</b> of Lake Champlain. Our results suggest there are two distinct ecotypes of M. diluviana separated by migration behavior. The migrating ecotype was smaller than the resident ecotype and enriched in Î´ 15 N while the resident ecotype had a higher C:N ratio. Because we did not allow for gut evacuation prior to our analyses, we conducted a follow-up experiment to test the effect of gut content on isotope composition of M. diluviana. The experiments confirmed that differences between benthic- and pelagic-caught M. diluviana were not a result of gut contents {{at the time of}} capture. Fixed partial migration behavior in M. diluviana in Lake Champlain indicates that DVM of M. diluviana may be more complex than previously thought. Additionally, partially migrating Mysis spp. may represent a model study organism to test hypotheses about the causes and consequences of partial DVM behavior in aquatic invertebrates...|$|R

The behavior of soluble and particulate Fe and Mn was studied following the installation of a hypolimnetic oxygenation system in Carvins Cove Reservoir, a water-supply impoundment managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority. During oxygenation, manganese concentrations were very low in the bulk hypolimnion (2. 0 mg lâˆ’ 1) were still observed in the <b>benthic</b> <b>region</b> close to the sediment, despite near-sediment dissolved oxygen concentrations in excess of 5. 0 mg lâˆ’ 1. Oxygenation appears to affect {{the location of the}} oxic/anoxic boundary sufficiently to restrict substantial transport of soluble Mn to the bulk water of the hypolimnion. However, the position of the oxic/anoxic boundary was not uniformly affected along the reservoir bottom, allowing horizontal transport of soluble Mn from higher elevations in contact with hypoxic sediments. During one summer, when the oxygen system was turned off for a month, the soluble Mn in the bulk hypolimnion increased substantially. Oxygen concentrations were quickly restored after the system was turned back on, but elevated levels of soluble Mn persisted until the sedimentation rate of detritus through the hypolimnion increased. When operated without interruption, the oxygenation system was able to reduce the bulk average hypolimnion soluble Mn concentration by up to 97 %, indicating that source water control of soluble Mn and Fe can be accomplished with hypolimnetic oxygenation in water-supply reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Mixing between {{water from}} free surface flow and {{subsurface}} pore-water in the sediment bed {{is known as}} hyporheic exchange. At local scales, flushing through porous sediments purifies streamborne water and biogeochemical cycling of oxygen and nutrients supports organisms in the <b>benthic</b> <b>region</b> of the sediment bed. At larger scales, hyporheic exchange provides the connectivity between streams, adjacent aquifers and floodplain networks, providing a critical link for the distribution and retention of nutrients and pollutants throughout the environment. This thesis proposes a framework to upscale advective hyporheic exchange processes using mass transfer coefficients, assuming a thin-film model and is presented in four key contributions: (1) an explicit derivation of the mass transfer coefficient for generic downwelling-upwelling cells based on the geometric addition of regional fluxes with periodic flushing of the hyporheic zone; (2) an examination of steady-state and turbulent mass transfer, demonstrating that steady and unsteady processes can each be represented by a mass transfer coefficient; (3) experiments indicate downwelling and upwelling cells are associated with steady and unsteady mass transfer coefficients; and (4) the analogy between the thin-film model and Ohmâ€™s Law is used to shown that resistors representing steady and unsteady mass transfer are best aligned in parallel, suggesting mass transfer coefficients are additive. This provides a framework to model hyporheic exchange at different spatial and temporal scales, in which no contributing scale is rate limiting. It is anticipated that this will enhance existing predictive hyporheic exchange models, making them more applicable to the study and management of natural water resources at any scale...|$|E

Subsurface bacteria were randomly collected from two locations at different depths and were examined using the 16 S rDNA V 3 -V 4 marker gene on the Illuminaâ„¢ Miseq platform. In addition, the physiochemical parameters of the sediment were also measured. Surprisingly, the results show a high diversity of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in the surveyed area, where Sulfurovum sp. was identified to predominate the overall bacterial community. The physiochemical parameters reveal insufficient evidence of hydrothermal vents in the surveyed area. However, there are traces of hydrocarbon pollutants such as gasoline, diesel, and mineral oil in this area. It is assumed that sediment accumulation in the lee of breakwater {{plays an important role in}} trapping the runoff from the nearby harbor, which includes oil spills. Based on the common knowledge, Sulvurofum sp. is a native bacterium that exists in deep hydrothermal vents and volcanic territories. Although the reason for the abundance of Sulfurovum sp. in the surveyed area is still unclear, there is a possibility that metabolic adaptation plays an important role in regulating hydrocarbon pollutants for survival. The work presented in this paper therefore has profound implications for future studies on Sulfurovum sp. versatility. However, future research is needed to strengthen the findings of this study and to provide a better evidence regarding the metabolic response of this bacterium toward hydrocarbon pollutants...|$|E

The MAREANO project (Marine AREA database for NOrwegian coasts and sea areas) aims at addressing the knowledge gaps on the seabed and environment as the base for a sustainable management. Therefore, {{large parts of the}} northern Norwegian shelf have been intensively studied with multibeam echosounder, providing detailed bathymetry data for terrain analysis and backscatter data, which aids sediment interpretation. The area has also been sampled by different biological gears (video, beam trawl, grab, epibenthic sled) to investigate benthic habitat distribution. Species diversity, abundance and biomass have been determined, and secondary production and productivity of macrozoobenthic organisms modeled. Here, we present results from data covering an area of 48 000 km 2 of the Norwegian continental margin between the Lofoten islands and North Cape and from the Norwegian and Barents Sea. The study area stretches from banks on the shelf (80 m depth) to the deep-sea plains (2750 m), and has been samples with 101 stations during seven cruises from 2006 - 2009.

40|$|Feeding {{mechanisms}} of aquatic vertebrates {{has been extensively}} studied in the past, while that of elasmobranchs remains limited. Skates and rays {{are believed to have}} evolved from a shark ancestor, thus they represent the most derived group. All skates are dorsoventrally compressed, have a unique jaw suspension type and head skeleton and live in benthic environments. It is unknown whether these derived features of skates have altered the ancestral shark feeding mechanism. Comparing feeding mechanisms in skates and sharks may shed light on morphological transformations that have arisen after the evolutionary split of these two groups. In this study prey capture and manipulation behaviors are compared and contrasted with the white-spotted bamboo shark. Jaw kinematics and buccal pressure during feeding events are investigated using sonomicrometry simultaneously with pressure transducers. Little skates capture prey primarily using biting but sometimes utilize weak suction as well. Pressure in the buccal cavity during prey capture varies around ambient ranging from slightly positive to slightly negative. In contrast bamboo sharks always use strong suction to capture prey with greater subambient buccal pressures. However, both species extensively process prey using strong suction alternately with compression. Such cycles can last several seconds, eventually ending in transport of the prey item. Greater subambient pressure develops in the buccal cavity during manipulation, indicating that skates are capable of generating stronger suction than that used to capture prey. Gape area during capture events is greater than during manipulation. Hyoid area attains similar magnitudes in both capture and manipulation events. Time of mean onset and peak gape and hyoid expansion occurs prior to peak buccal pressure in captures and manipulations. Although both occupy <b>benthic</b> <b>regions</b> of the ocean, prey capture in the two species appears to be quite different while manipulations are similar. Morphological differences in the jaw and hyoid apparatus of sharks and skates may be partly responsible for the functional differences in the generation of suction...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} a species to show {{plasticity}} throughout its range is suggested to be significant to the survival, maintenance, and expansion of populations. In the Southern Ocean, plastic traits may have enabled resilience since the onset of cooling, and given species the capacity to exploit empty niches after the retreat of ice in interglacial periods. Phenotypic plasticity has rarely been investigated in Southern Ocean invertebrates however, and the cold stenothermal environment, which prevails, has often been considered homogenous in its selection on fauna. Previous ecological studies have often pooled together material collected within predetermined biogeographic regions to overcome the limitations of sampling difficulties. Subtle differences between environments may however, be forcing ecological divergence in species, with possible implications for speciation processes. This thesis investigates the phenotypic plasticity and reproduction among populations of the small shallow-water brooding bivalve Lissarca miliaris over its Antarctic range, and of deep-sea protobranch bivalves Yoldiella ecaudata, Y. sabrina, and Y. valettei from contrasting <b>benthic</b> <b>regions.</b> The reproductive studies of L. miliaris revealed a previously unknown hermaphrodite trait, maximising the reproductive efficiency in a short-lived species where the femaleâ€™s capacity to brood its young is limited. Reproduction is also described {{for the first time}} in deep-sea Antarctic protobranch bivalves and demonstrates lecithotrophic larval development. Additionally, Y. valettei shows evidence of simultaneous hermaphroditism, which may increase the likelihood of successful reproduction in low population densities. Phenotypic plasticity is observed among populations of bivalves, irrespective of geographical proximity, and with no latitudinal trends, but subtle differences in the environment. Significant differences in morphology and growth rates are identified among populations, and reproductive plasticity identified in L. miliaris and Y. sabrina. Increasing atmospheric temperature is also measured to show an effect on the ecophysiology of intertidal populations of L. miliaris at Signy Island over the past 40 years, with increasing growth rates at the cost of smaller offspring and pressure from endolithic algal decay...|$|R
40|$|Tidally-induced head {{fluctuation}} is {{a natural}} phenomenon in coastal regions. The discharge of groundwater through sediments will occur anywhere that the aquifer is hydraulically connected to a surface water body and the time averaged tidally-influenced water level in the aquifer is higher than sea level, and almost all coastal regions are subject to such flow. With the development of coastal areas, the discharge of groundwater contaminants into tidally affected coastal water bodies has become a significant problem. Biota {{that live in the}} <b>benthic</b> <b>region</b> are known {{to be sensitive to the}} concentration of discharging anthropogenic chemical compounds. Thus the contaminant concentration entering the benthos is of very significant practical importance and its study is the focus of this dissertation. An investigation of the effect of tides on the concentration of groundwater contaminants discharging to a surface water body is studied using a one-dimensional homogeneous sand column. Results of the experiment are confirmed using a three-dimensional heterogeneous groundwater tank model. A constant water level is imposed upgradient, and the downgradient water level is controlled by a wave generator that controls the hydraulic head to mimic a 12 hour tidal fluctuation. The experimental results demonstrate that the tidal fluctuations in the downgradient reservoir result in a decrease in average contaminant concentration at the point of groundwater discharge to the surface-water body. The further upstream the well is located, the smaller the amplitude of the concentration oscillation. In addition, upstream migration of concentration oscillations is observed in spite of a net downgradient flow. Fourier analysis suggests that the dominant frequency of the peaks of pressure and chemical data at different locations along the length of the column is identically two cycles per day and that the amplitudes of the concentration oscillations increase with time at measurement locations at the upstream responding probes. As the classical groundwater flow and transport model cannot reproduce the phenomena we observed, an innovative multi-mobility model, is proposed with one highly mobile liquid phase, one less mobile liquid phase and a solid phase. Averaging theory is applied to develop the mass conservation equation from the microscale to the macroscale and facilitate the reduction of dimensionality to obtain one-dimensional governing equations with closure relations. A new finite volume method is utilized to solve the resulting equations. The simulation confirms the existence of the enhanced tidally-induced mixing process...|$|E
40|$|Ascidians (invertebrate chordates) are {{abundant}} in many ports around the world. Most {{of them are}} nonindigenous species that tolerate wide fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and even pollution. These sessile suspension feeders have a rapid growth rate, usually a short life span of a few months, reach sexual maturity when {{only a few weeks}} old, and produce large numbers of shortlived nonfeeding planktonic larvae. They thrive on marina floats, pilings, buoys, and boat bottoms in protected harbors where there is reduced wave action and enhanced nutrients from anthropogenic activities. Nonindigenous ascidians frequently overgrow oysters and mussels, which are often cultivated in or near busy harbors. Adult ascidians on ship or barge hulls may survive transport over thousands of kilometers to harbors with conditions similar to those they left; occasionally live larvae have also been recovered from ships' ballast water. U. S. Navy dry dock movements between major Pacific ports have transported large masses of fouling nonindigenous taxa, including ascidians. Transfer between culture sites of oysters, mussels, and associated lines and nets may provide an additional mode of transport. Once nonindigenous ascidians become established, they provide large local sources of larvae for further possible invasions into additional harbors and nearby natural marine communities. Invasive species include both solitary and colonial forms, with a preponderance of large solitary species that thrive in highly disturbed habitats. In Guam, for example, most nonindigenous ascidians are confined to harbor structures and have not as yet significantly colonized natural reefs. In contrast, healthy natural <b>benthic</b> <b>regions</b> {{both inside and outside the}} harbors of Guam are usually stable coral reef communities containing a high diversity, but very low biomass, of native colonial ascidian species. However, in several areas of the Caribbean a native colonial didemnid has recently begun overgrowing coral reefs. In the Gulf of Mexico a nonindigenous didemnid now covers many offshore oil rigs and may become a threat to neighboring natural reefs.

These communities play {{a large role in}} detrital decomposition, nutrient cycling, and provide an important food source for fish. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities have been used extensively for monitoring environmental condition for many years and can be good indicators of sediment quality (Rosenberg and Resh 1993). This study examined benthic communities in the vicinity of two US EPA superfund sites adjacent to the St. Louis River Estuary.

Total dissolvable iron (TD-Fe) concentrations in the surface layers ( 2. 2 nM observed in surface waters in these <b>regions.</b> <b>Benthic</b> fluxes provided {{a significant amount of}} Fe (2 â€“ 38 nM) {{to the base of the}} water column in coastal zones. In addition, samples collected from one Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) expedition were re-analysed after a 16 month acidification period and showed significant increases over shipboard analyses (average values increasing to 2. 26 Â± 1. 50 nM), indicating the extended release of Fe from leachable particulate material in the stored samples. Detailed profiling through the euphotic zone revealed TD-Fe distributions that exhibited strong relationships with biological uptake, regeneration and water column hydrography. In equatorial and tropical North Atlantic waters, trace elemental distributions showed evidence of recent atmospheric deposition through a history of stratified mixed layers...|$|R

The demise of this once ubiquitous herbivore is one factor contributing to wider Caribbean reef change during the past 25 years. Over an 8 -year period from 1999 - 2007, we examined densities and test sizes of D. antillarum at 786 sites from the northern extent of the Florida Reef Tract to the Dry Tortugas, including two National Parks and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Visual surveys along belt transects were used to enumerate individuals and test sizes in a two-stage stratified random sampling design that incorporated cross-shelf <b>benthic</b> habitats, geographic <b>regions,</b> and no-fishing management zones. While pre- 1983 densities were as high as 5 individuals/m 2, surveys since 1999 from 5 cm test diameter) individuals reported from only a few locations. The relative contributions of larval survivorship, predation, suitable recruitment sites, and reduced fertilization success to Diadema recovery are still largely unknown...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{vertical}} turbulent mixing on {{the dynamics of}} Persistent Organic Pollutants has long been overlooked and its role is still hardly understood. Here we present the first comprehensive analysis {{of the role of}} turbulent diffusion on the distribution of those contaminants and its interplay with sinking fluxes. To this end, a 1 D dynamic coupled hydrodynamic-contaminant model has been developed and applied to a Mediterranean continental shelf environment. The hydrodynamic sub-model is adapted from COHERENS, the contaminant sub-model is an improvement from the BIODEP model and considers the contaminant in 3 states: dissolved-colloidal-particulate. The simulation highlights the role of the turbulent processes in determining the POP distribution and variability in the water column. In short, turbulent flux of contaminants strengthens the upward diffusion of sediment entrained column. It acts in parallel with. degradation and sinking fluxes, the combined effect yielding a surface enriched â€“ depth depleted â€“ <b>benthic</b> layer enriched <b>region</b> distribution, which presents similarities to reported experimental measures.

40|$|A strong oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ) {{currently}} exists {{along the}} California margin {{because of a}} combination of high surface-water productivity and poor intermediate-water ventilation. However, the strength of this OMZ may have been sensitive to late Quaternary ocean-circulation and productivity changes along the margin. Although sediment-lamination strength has been used to trace ocean-oxygenation changes in the past, oxygen levels on the open margin are not sufficiently low for laminations to form. In these <b>regions,</b> <b>benthic</b> foraminifera are highly sensitive monitors of OMZ strength, and their fossil assemblages can be used to reconstruct past fluctuations. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1017, off Point Conception, exhibit major and rapid faunal oscillations in response to late Quaternary millennial-scale climate change (Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles) on the open central California margin. These faunal oscillations can be correlated to and are apparently synchronous with those reported from Santa Barbara Basin. Together they represent major fluctuations in the strength of the OMZ which were intimately associated with global climate change-weakening, perhaps disappearing, during cool periods and strengthening during warm periods. These rapid, major OMZ strength fluctuations were apparently widespread on the Northeast Pacific margin and must have influenced the evolution of margin biota and altered biogeochemical cycles with potential feedbacks to global climate change...|$|R
40|$|Major {{advances}} in the scientific understanding and management of eutrophication have been made since the late 1960 s. The control of point sources of phosphorus reduced algal blooms in many lakes. Diffuse nutrient sources from land use changes and urbanization in the catchments of lakes have proved possible to control but require many years of restoration efforts. The importance of water residence time to eutrophication has been recognized. Changes in aquatic communities contribute to eutrophication via the trophic cascade, nutrient stoichiometry, and transport of nutrients from <b>benthic</b> to pelagic <b>regions.</b> Overexploitation of piscivorous fishes {{appears to be a}} particularly common amplifier of eutrophication. Internal nutrient loading can be controlled by reducing external loading, although the full response of lakes may take decades. In the years ahead, climate warming will aggravate eutrophication in lakes receiving point sources of nutrients, as a result of increasing water residence times. Decreased silica supplies from dwindling inflows may increasingly favor the replacement of diatoms by nitrogen-fixing Cyanobacteria. Increases in transport of nitrogen by rivers to estuaries and coastal oceans have followed increased use of nitrogen in agriculture and increasing emissions to the atmosphere. Our understanding of eutrophication and its management has evolved from simple control of nutrient sources to recognition that it is often a cumulative effects problem that will require protection and restoration of many features of a lakeâ€™s community and its catchment...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} and productivity of benthic microalgae in coral reef sediments are poorly known compared with other, more conspicuous (e. g. coral zooxanthellae, macroalgae) primary producers of coral reef habitats. A {{survey of the}} distribution, biomass, and productivity of benthic microalgae on a platform reef flat and in a cross-shelf transect in the southern Great Barrier Reef indicated that benthic microalgae are ubiquitous, abundant (up to 995. 0 mg chlorophyll (chl) a m(- 2)), and productive (up to 110 mg O- 2 m(- 2) h(- 1)) components of the reef ecosystem. Concentrations of benthic microalgae, expressed as chlorophyll a per surface area, were approximately 100 -fold greater than the integrated water column concentrations of microalgae throughout the <b>region.</b> <b>Benthic</b> microalgal biomass was greater on the shallow water platform reef than in the deeper waters of the cross-shelf transect. In both areas the benthic microalgal communities had a similar composition, dominated by pennate diatoms, dinoflagellates, and cyanobacteria. Benthic microalgal populations were potentially nutrient-limited, based on responses to nitrogen and phosphorus enrichments in short-term (7 -day) microcosm experiments. Benthic microalgal productivity, measured by O- 2 evolution, indicated productive communities responsive to light and nutrient availability. The benthic microalgal concentrations observed (92 - 995 mg chl a m(- 2)) were high relative to other reports, particularly compared with temperate regions. This abundance of productive plants in both reef and shelf sediments in the southern Great Barrier Reef suggests that benthic microalgae are key components of coral reef ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Spring {{phytoplankton}} blooms are {{the baseline}} for any food web. At the seabed, <b>benthic</b> and pelagic <b>regions</b> are linked by sinking microalgal-derived material (phytodetritus), which triggers benthic response. The few existing studies on relationship between temporary and permanent meiofauna state predation activity from permanent on temporary meiofauna. This study wants to describe meiofauna response to phytodetritus and relationships between permanent and temporary components. To this end, meiofauna samples were obtained {{on a weekly}} basis from early March to early June 2012 at Western Channel Observatoryâ€™s L 4 site during the spring phytoplankton bloom. Organisms were identified to genus level and their biomass was determined by volumetric method. Results showed that nematode communities dominated meiofauna assemblages. The most abundant taxa for temporary meiofauna were polychaete juvenile stages. Meiofauna abundances decreased overall during this period probably due to macrofauna predation. However, meiofauna quickly responded to phytodetritus deposition. Initially, predators were the most abundant groups, becoming less important as the bloom started. Then, more opportunistic species (deposit feeders and epigrowth species) increased in abundance, probably feeding on bacteria at first and on phytodetritus eventually. Late, {{at the end of the}} bloom, predators increased in abundance, possibly predating on temporary meiofauna. Meiofauna, were shown to feature an important link between pelagic and higher benthic trophic levels as they respond to phytodetritus and act as both a bottom-up and top-down control. Further effort should be made toward the study of these groups, possibly considering regime shift effects, as it might critically influence benthic ecosystems.

40|$|The {{remote and}} hostile Southern Ocean {{is home to}} a diverse and rich {{community}} of life that thrives in an environment dominated by glaciations and strong currents. Marine biological studies in the region date back to the nineteenth century, but despite this long history of research, relatively {{little is known about the}} complex interactions between the highly seasonal physical environment and the species that inhabit the Southern Ocean. Oceanographically, the Southern Ocean is a major driver of global ocean circulation and plays a vital role in interacting with the deep water circulation in each of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans. The Census of Antarctic Marine Life and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Marine Biodiversity Information Network (SCAR-MarBIN) have strived to coordinate and unify the available scientific expertise and biodiversity data to improve our understanding of Southern Ocean biodiversity. Taxonomic lists for all marine species have been compiled to form the Register of Antarctic Marine Species, which currently includes over 8, 200 species. SCAR-MarBIN has brought together over 1 million distribution records for Southern Ocean species, forming a baseline against which future change can be judged. The sample locations and numbers of known species from different regions were mapped and the depth distributions of benthic samples plotted. Our knowledge of the biodiversity of the Southern Ocean is largely determined by the relative inaccessibility of the <b>region.</b> <b>Benthic</b> sampling is largely restricted to the shelf; little is known about the fauna of the deep sea. The location of scientific bases heavily influences the distribution pattern of sample and observation data, and the logistical supply routes are the focus of much of the at-sea and pelagic work.

Other taxa, including the species-rich nematodes, are represented by just a handful of digital records...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} (N) fixation {{of atmospheric}} N 2 by free-living cyanobacteria in aquatic environments is common, {{and in many}} ecosystems, it can account for {{a significant portion of}} the biologically available N inputs. Although N fixation can compensate for N limitation, N limitation is maintained over relatively long time scales in many oligotrophic lake ecosystems. This dissertation examines the importance of benthic and pelagic N fixation in the N economies of oligotrophic lakes in arctic Alaska (Chapter 1) and examines nutrient, light, and grazer controls on benthic N fixation (Chapters 2 and 3). Both benthic and pelagic N fixation are prevalent in many lakes across the Alaskan arctic landscape, ranging from 0. 12 ? 1. 5 mg N m- 2 day- 1 and 0 ? 2. 56 mg N m- 2 day- 1 respectively. Pelagic N fixation is much higher than has been reported elsewhere for oligotrophic lakes, and is more important than previously thought, comprising ~ 75 % of N inputs to one lake. Benthic N fixation is lower than has been reported for other oligotrophic systems, and is roughly equivalent to N inputs from atmospheric deposition on an areal basis (~ 25 mg N m- 2 year- 1). On the landscape scale, N fixation in lakes roughly equal that in terrestrial ecosystems in this Arctic <b>region.</b> <b>Benthic</b> N fixation generally appears to have a saturating response to light availability within individual lakes, but light does not explain variation in benthic N fixation across lakes or years. Whole-lake fertilization and laboratory experiments indicate that P input stimulates benthic N fixation while N input suppresses N fixation when N is added either alone or in conjunction with P in Redfield proportion. Snails at ambient density cause a small decline in benthic N fixation (0. 85 ? 1. 8 % reduction over the summer). These patterns are corroborated in the landscape: lakes on younger surfaces have higher P, more snails, and higher rates of N-fixation than lakes on older surfaces...|$|R
