5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. <b>Because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E

Then I start working on the most basic thing— the look. It's very important that the physical appearance of the character gets decided <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> look the character, it makes it all the more believable. Once that is achieved, I go into the finer nuances of what the girl is like, her background. And then from there [...] I have to get the accent right".|$|E
500|$|Corgan {{has said}} that [...] "For the solo in 'Fuck You (An Ode to No One),' I played until my fingers saw blood, You can't play a weak guitar solo in such a propulsive song. It's got to be attack-style." [...] He {{explains}} this method by saying [...] "... I put on the headphones and stand one foot away from the amp. I turn the amp up so loud that I literally have to play harder than the feedback, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> stop playing even for an instant, the whole thing explodes." ...|$|E

6000|$|Brooke laughed hoarsely. [...] "I believe I {{must have}} left it at the ranch. Still, that's not so very astonishing, <b>because,</b> even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't do it altogether, I came very near losing my head." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1904, in {{his early}} twenties, Joyce emigrated {{permanently}} to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) Nora Barnacle. They lived in Trieste, Paris and Zurich. Though {{most of his adult}} life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin, and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of Ulysses, he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, [...] "For myself, I always write about Dublin, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{successful}} summer {{followed for}} the Argentine. In July, del Potro {{and his team}} decided to remain in Europe to test his fitness. [...] "We decided to play on clay courts for my back <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> start to play again on hard courts, maybe I will injure it again", he recalled. Del Potro won his first career ATP tour title at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, defeating Gasquet in straight sets in the final. A week later, del Potro reached his second career ATP Tour final at the Austrian Open in Kitzbühel, where he beat local hope and sixth seed Melzer {{in less than an}} hour, to claim his second title in two weeks. Having competed in just two clay tournaments all of the 2007 season, he never thought he would win his first two titles on clay courts.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{constant}} media attention, Mukerji remains guarded {{about her}} personal life. Unlike many other celebrities, Mukerji limits her {{interactions with the}} media and is sometimes labelled a recluse; {{she said in a}} 2011 interview, [...] "Today actors have become more open with the media. But this has posed a problem for actors like me <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't do that, then I end up being called reclusive. So now I have changed myself and am easily approachable." [...] Mukerji has collaborated frequently and maintained a close friendship with actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and filmmaker Karan Johar. The nature of Mukerji's relationship with filmmaker Aditya Chopra was the topic of fervent tabloid reporting in India, though she refused to publicly talk about it. On 21 April 2014, she married Chopra at a private ceremony in Italy. On 9 December 2015, she gave birth to their daughter, named Adira.|$|E

500|$|World {{number one}} Mark Williams was {{defeated}} 1–5 by Anthony Hamilton, {{who made a}} break of 133. Williams refused to answer questions at the post-match press conference, explaining: [...] "I'm not saying anything <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> do I could be in trouble so I'm keeping my mouth shut." [...] Hunter and Hendry made high breaks of 49 and 55 in defeating Brian Morgan and Jimmy Michie 5–1, respectively. After the match Hendry—the world number two and a seven-time world champion said [...] "I feel like going to apologise to each fan one by one because {{it was such a}} bad match". John Higgins whitewashed Barry Pinches 5–0, compiling a 132 break in the last frame in a match where Pinches made a high break of 33. Jimmy White overcame James Wattana 5–4 having trailed 2–3. Graeme Dott defeated Drew Henry 5-3 and Quinten Hann beat Simon Bedford 5–0. In the last game of the day, Drago beat Alan McManus 5–4.|$|E
500|$|... "I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] {{and it was not}} my {{favorite}} song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{causing the}} {{collision}} with Will Stevens, Romain Grosjean was given two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence and {{said after the}} race: [...] "I thought I was past the Manor, but it was soon clear that I wasn't. It was my fault entirely and I apologise for it. You never stop learning as a driver." [...] Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel insisted that [...] "it was fairly clear [...] When I got close enough I went around the outside, braking later and still managing to get the corner. I was clearly ahead and then I saw him opening the brakes into {{the last part of}} the chicane, so I reacted and jumped the second part <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> started on the track, we would have crashed." [...] Nico Hülkenberg in turn declared that Vettel [...] "didn't leave me anywhere to go so to avoid contact I kept braking, lost the rear and spun". He did however voice satisfaction with his result, finishing eighth and taking four championship points.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not as yet. So far I {{have been}} trusted with no {{original}} documents. Is it your will that I {{should try to}} possess myself of these? <b>Because,</b> <b>if</b> so, <b>I</b> will do my best, provided----" [...] {{and he looked at}} the pocket of Acour's robe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh heavens, how grave you all are! A gentleman and his promise! Do {{you mean}} to assert that Sir Francis is no gentleman, and does not keep his promises? <b>Because</b> <b>if</b> so <b>I</b> shall be angry." [...] Then there was an end of that conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>Because</b> <b>if</b> she would, <b>I</b> {{should be}} very glad to marry her. D'ye know if she's got any other young man hanging about her at all?" ...|$|R

500|$|... "Scorsese is {{an actor}} magnet," [...] commented Winter. [...] "Everybody {{wants to work}} with him. I had all these {{pictures}} on my wall and I thought, 'I'd really better write some good stuff for these people. In casting the role of Nucky Thompson (based upon real-life Atlantic City political boss Enoch L. Johnson), Winter wanted to stray from the real life Johnson as much as possible. [...] "If {{we were going to}} cast accurately what the real Nucky looked like, we'd have cast Jim Gandolfini." [...] The idea of casting Steve Buscemi in the lead role came about when Scorsese mentioned wanting to work with the actor, whom Winter knew well having worked with him on The Sopranos. Winter sent the script out to Buscemi, who responded very enthusiastically. [...] "I just thought, 'Wow. I'm almost sorry I've read this, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't get it, I'm going to be so sad.' My response was 'Terry, I know you're looking at other actors'... and he said, 'No, no, Steve, I said we want you. Explained Scorsese, [...] "I love the range he has, his dramatic sense, but also his sense of humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, President Hafez al-Assad {{explained}} why {{he refused to}} allow Jewish emigration: [...] "I cannot let them go, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> let them go how can I stop the Soviet Union sending its Jews to Israel, where they will strengthen my enemy?" ...|$|E

"Let him learn it--when {{we reach}} his court," [...] {{answered}} Lozelle, with meaning; then added, [...] "Have you aught {{else to say}} to me, prince Hassan? <b>Because</b> <b>if</b> not, <b>I</b> must be attending {{to the business of}} my ship, which you suppose that I was about to abandon to win a lady's smile." ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{the project}} {{proceeded}} there was increasing tension between Richard Thompson and Rafferty. Thompson preferred a spontaneous approach to recording and found Rafferty's time-consuming and perfectionist approach hard to cope with. He also felt increasingly frozen {{out of the}} project: [...] "When {{he got to the}} mixing, I just didn’t bother to turn up [...] [...] [...] <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> said something it was totally ignored and I thought 'hey, whose record is this anyway?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hunt said in 1991 {{that there}} is a pain inflicted by the black {{community}} on itself, which it fears to communicate openly. She also says that living overseas for most of her life has made her a foreigner in the US. She said, [...] "I'm scared to walk through Harlem... more scared than you, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> walked through Harlem with the weird shoes and the weird accent, I'd get my butt kicked faster than you. In a way, I'm the betrayer." ...|$|E
2500|$|This led to {{increased}} {{pressures on the}} two creators (and the team which they formed to help them), including a prolonged period (about a year) of artist's block in Laird. The [...] "incredible growth {{and complexity of the}} business" [...] that sprang up around their instantly-successful Turtles properties, led to Laird: [...] "suddenly discover to my horror that I no longer enjoyed drawing. It was a real shock, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever had anything that I could rely on... it was that I loved to draw." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, he also highlights: [...] "I’ve said it before: {{there are}} two sorts of atheists. One sort claims {{that there is no}} deity, the other claims that there is no {{evidence}} that proves the existence of a deity; I belong to the latter group, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to claim that no god exists, I would have to produce evidence to establish that claim, and I cannot. Religious persons have by far the easier position; they say they believe in a deity because that’s their preference, and they’ve read it in a book. That’s their right." ...|$|E
2500|$|When it {{was decided}} to make the movie about his life called Serpico, Al Pacino invited Serpico to stay with him at a house that Pacino had rented in Montauk, New York. When Pacino asked why he had stepped forward, Serpico replied, [...] "Well, Al, I don't know. I guess I would have to say it would be <b>because...</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't, who would I be when I listened to a piece of music?" [...] He has {{credited}} his grandfather who had once been assaulted and robbed and his uncle, a respected policeman in Italy, with his sense of justice.|$|E
2500|$|When {{you lose}} your {{confidence}} you don't want to bowl again. When I went on the West Indies tour I had no confidence, even though I got 17 wickets {{at an average of}} about 25, and 10 of them were in first-class games. I only bowled about 78 overs on tour. When {{you lose your}} confidence it's not a nice feeling – you can't do what you used to do, but I'm only sorry it was the wrong day at the wrong time , <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was myself, I assure you, in my opinion, I would have played more Test cricket, but that's only my assumption.

6000|$|... "Have you any ship fit for sea, signor, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> so, <b>I</b> pray {{you to send}} me away, {{no matter}} where. I cannot stand this.
