By the October 7 <b>bid</b> <b>opening</b> date, the MBTA had received six bid packages for the project, which had an estimated value of $19,620,700. The apparent low bidder and eventual awardee of the contract was S&R Construction Enterprises of Newton, New Hampshire with a bid of $17,687,300.75.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} choice of the <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> on eBay by sellers of US Morgan dollar coins. We find that the <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> is a {{function}} of the observed characteristics of the past transaction prices for the coin, the seller's characteristics and the fee structure imposed by the auctioneer. The results demonstrate that increasing the <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> fee structure induces a lower optimal <b>opening</b> <b>bid,</b> while an increase in the degree of risk in the price distribution increases the <b>opening</b> <b>bid.</b> These results have important implications for market structure of online auction sites.

50|$|Structure {{and meaning}} of <b>opening</b> <b>bids</b> are the common {{determining}} factor for system classification: in most modern natural systems, <b>opening</b> <b>bids</b> of 1 through 2 have the same or similar meaning, with level-one bids denoting length in a suit. Artificial systems typically reserve at least one one-level suit <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> for special purposes, unrelated to the suit.|$|R
50|$|The central {{feature of}} the Precision system is that an <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> of one club is used for any hand with 16 or more high card points (HCP), {{regardless}} of distribution. An <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> of one of a major suit signifies a five-card suit and 11-15 HCP. A one notrump <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> signifies a balanced hand (no five-card major suit) and 13-15 HCP.|$|R

40|$|<b>Bid</b> <b>opening</b> in sealed-bid {{e-auction}} is efficient when a homomorphic {{encryption algorithm}} is employed {{to seal the}} bids and homomorphic <b>bid</b> <b>opening</b> is employed to open the bids. Such e-auction schemes are called homomorphic auctions. However, high efficiency of homomorphic auctions {{is based on an}} assumption: the bids are valid (e. g. within a special range). An undetected invalid bid can compromise correctness and fairness of the auction. Unfortunately, in most existing homomorphic auction schemes, proof and verification of validity of the bids is either ignored or too inefficient. Recently, a technique called batched bid validity check [25] is proposed to improve efficiency of proof and verification of bid validity in a special kind of homomorphic auction schemes: secret-sharing-based homomorphic auctions. However, secret-sharing-based homomorphic auction schemes [13, 15, 26, 24] are not a main stream in homomorphic auction schemes as they employ threshold secret sharing techniques to seal the bids. Main stream homomorphic auction schemes employ a homomorphic encryption algorithm with threshold distributed decryption to seal the bids as it is simpler and more efficient than secret sharing. In this paper, an ElGamal-encryption-based homomorphic encryption scheme is proposed. It employs a batched proof and verification of bid validity to achieve high efficiency in bid validity check. Its batch proof and verification technique is more advanced than that in [25], so it is simpler and more efficient than the homomorphic auction scheme in [25]...|$|E
50|$|In {{most natural}} bridge <b>bidding</b> systems, the <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> of 2 is used {{exclusively}} for hands {{too strong for}} an <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> at the one-level. Typically, the bid is reserved for hands that are almost strong enough to bid to the game level on their own power, or even stronger. The exact requirements for the bid vary considerably depending upon the system used and partnership agreement.|$|R

50|$|One major {{advantage}} of the artificial <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> of 2 {{for all types of}} strong hands is that other <b>opening</b> <b>bids</b> at the two-level (2, 2 and 2) become available for weak two bids, thus eliminating many possible bids for the opponents. These weak two hands appear 20 times as often as the very strong hands, which illustrates the inefficiency of reserving all <b>opening</b> <b>bids</b> at the two-level for very strong hands.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bid</b> <b>opening</b> in {{e-auction}} is e#cient when a homomorphic {{secret sharing}} function is employed {{to seal the}} bids and homomorphic secret reconstruction is employed to open the bids. However, this high e#ciency {{is based on an}} assumption: the bids are valid (e. g. within a special range). An undetected invalid bid can compromise correctness and fairness of the auction. Unfortunately, validity verification of the bids is ignored in the auction schemes employing homomorphic secret sharing (called homomorphic auction in this paper). In this paper, an attack against the homomorphic auction in the absence of bid validity check is presented and a necessary bid validity check mechanism is proposed. Then a batch cryptographic technique is introduced and applied to improve the e#ciency of bid validity check...|$|E

50|$|Another {{advantage}} is the relative precision with which strong balanced hands can be <b>bid.</b> An <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> of 2 NT indicates a balanced hand with 20-21 HCP in Standard American or 20-22 HCP in standard Acol, and for even stronger balanced hands, the <b>opening</b> <b>bid</b> of 2 can be used. The opener's rebid (in these cases always in No Trump) then indicates {{the strength of}} the hand using steps of 2-3 HCP. Hence 2 - 2 - 2NT shows 22-24 HCP's in Standard American or 23-24 HCP in Acol, while a 3NT rebid can show 25+ HCP's.|$|R
