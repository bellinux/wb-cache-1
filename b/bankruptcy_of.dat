40|$|This paper {{gives the}} {{analysis}} of the most important novelties that the new <b>Bankruptcy</b> Act <b>of</b> 2015 brought into Croatian bankruptcy law. The author points at many contradictory, imprecise and defective provisions <b>of</b> the new <b>Bankruptcy</b> Act, especially provisions regarding a pre-bankruptcy reason (ground), pre-bankruptcy proceedings, advance payment for the costs <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> proceedings, appointment <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> administrators (bankruptcy trustees), action to contest legal transactions of the debtor, liquidation of objects on which the right for separate satisfaction exists, <b>bankruptcy</b> plan, group <b>of</b> companies (connected companies), bankruptcy proceedings against liquidation estate and international bankruptcy. Due to numerousness of the defective legal solutions and disturbing easiness with which some of the basic principles <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> law and civil procedure law generally have been directly broken, it is necessary to prepare new legal provisions that shall change and amend the <b>Bankruptcy</b> Act <b>of</b> 2015...|$|R

5|$|During the 1860s and the American Civil War, the {{legislature}} {{was the scene}} of intense debate.

Morton even had some members of the body arrested or detained on suspicions of disloyalty. The lack of funding created by this crisis again led to the near <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> the state. In 1864, the Republicans gained a majority and convened the General Assembly to remedy the state's funding problems.|$|E
