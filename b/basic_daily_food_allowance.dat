Shackleton had {{calculated}} the return {{distance to the}} Pole as [...] His initial plan allowed 91days for the return journey, requiring a daily average distance of about [...] After a slow start due {{to a combination of}} poor weather and lameness in the horses, Shackleton reduced the <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> <b>allowance</b> to extend the total available journey time to 110days. This required a shorter daily average of around 13½ nautical miles. Between 9 and 21 November they made good progress, but the ponies suffered on the difficult Barrier surface, and the first of the four had to be shot when the party reached 81°S. On 26 November a new farthest south record was established as they passed the 82°17' mark set by Scott's southern march in December 1902. Shackleton's party covered the distance in 29days compared with Scott's 59, using a track considerably east of Scott's to avoid the surface problems the earlier journey had encountered.|$|R
40|$|The {{voluntary}} {{feed intake}} (VFI) and {{growth rate of}} sea bass were studied for 147 days, based on different starting live   weights, under natural photoperiods and varied water temperatures. Sea bass (n = 720) were divided into five weight   classes (60 - 70, 90 - 110, 130 - 150, 160 - 180 and 230 - 250 g) and distributed among 20 tanks. Seven different water tem-   peratures were compared: 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28 and 31 °C. A commercial extruded diet (N x 6. 25, 43. 7 % DM; crude   fat, 25. 7 % DM) was used. The trial was performed in a closed-circuit plant, with a daily water turnover rate of 10 %. Each   tank was fitted with an apparatus for collecting the uneaten food. Automatic feeders distributed equal amounts of food   for ten meals per day. The <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> <b>allowance</b> was adjusted, based on fish biomass, to permit ad libitum feeding and   to leave approximately 20 % uneaten.

5000|$|Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Moore {{began playing}} after graduating Booker T. Washington High School in 1933 with Atlanta Black Crackers. Over {{the next six}} years, Moore moved among that team, Macon Peaches, Chattanooga Choo-Choos, Schenectady Black Socks, Newark Eagles and Baltimore Elite Giants, {{gradually}} earning a reputation according to Voices from the Negro Leagues as perhaps [...] "the best fielding basemen of all time" [...] in his league. In 1940, after finishing the regular season in Baltimore, Moore played in a winter season in Los Angeles, California that allowed white and black players to compete against each other, a competition that was first allowed and then halted by Major League Baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Moore himself believed that the games were halted because the black players were too successful, stating that [...] "The public, they liked to see the competition, but the commissioner, he didn't have that attitude after {{he found out that}} we were drawin' real good crowds and we were beatin' 'em a lot." [...] Moore registered for military draft in October 1940 and served from 1942 to 1945. For the three years after World War II, he returned to baseball with the Black Crackers. At his most highly paid, prior to the war, he earned $250 a month with a $1.50 <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> <b>allowance.</b>|$|R
40|$|A nationally {{representative}} sample of 3380 rural households from General Household Survey-panel data that adopt the World Bank Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS) technique was used for this study. Based on 2120 kcal Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) recommended per adult equivalent and USD 0. 87 purchasing power parity (PPP), an annual food poverty threshold of (N 50, 331. 67) equivalent to USD 317. 55 per annum was derived for Nigeria. This threshold is the cost for purchasing recommended <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> <b>allowances</b> (RDA) of an adult equivalent for healthy life in rural Nigeria estimated at N 138. Despite the fact that agricultural sector employed over 70 % of the country’s population overwhelmingly large segment of Nigerians especially farming families in rural areas are the most food insecure. The food security situation in Nigeria was examined using the Foster Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) class of decomposable food poverty measures that satisfy both monotonicity and transfer axioms. The food insecurity indices at national level was reported as (∝= 0, 46. 36, ∝= 1, 0. 43 and ∝= 2, 1. 11 for and ∝= 0, 42. 78, ∝= 1, 0. 348 and ∝= 2, 7. 45) for post-harvest seasons respectively. This implies that {{almost half of the}} rural households in Nigeria are food insecure subsisting on less the RDAs, however, depth and severity of food insecurity also differ.

40|$|Wheat {{grain and}} its {{products}} are widely consumed as fodder and <b>basic</b> <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> stuffs in Kyrgyzstan. Mycobiota {{is known to}} produce hazardous effects to a consumer since it produces mycotoxins. Henceforth, mycobiota starting from the field stage to flour, grain and flour samples were selected for mycological analysis from eight sites of flour manufacture: grain stored in storehouses before milling, mechanically cleaned grain, washed grain, grain dried and prepared for mill, roughly-milled flour, first grade flour and high grade flour. The samples were analyzed using classical mycological and immunoassay methods in order to detect mycotoxins producing fungi species. We isolated overall 27 species belonging to 7 genera. Mycotoxins producing species like Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus ochraceus and Penicillium cyclopium were detected in the stored grains and in mechanically-cleaned grains. The species of Penicillium, Alternaria and Fusarium genera dominated in roughly-milled flour samples, so this site of flour manufacture still has a risk and danger of contamination with mycotoxins producing fungus. Only the final product i. e. the high grade flour lacked any fungal contamination. We recommend to scrutinize flour samples at the last stages of processing, particularly in the mills like B 1, C 1 and C 4...|$|R
40|$|Protein supplementation {{can improve}} the {{resistance}} to parasites of periparturient ewes, as indicated by reduced nematode egg excretion and worm burdens. However, {{the rate at which}} this improvement can occur is largely unknown. We investigated the rate of improvement by assessing temporal changes in faecal egg counts after we experimentally reduced nutrient demand. Three groups of nine pregnant ewes each were trickle infected with Teladorsagia circumcincta from day(- 70) to day(16) (parturition is day(0)). Two groups of twin-rearing ewes were fed at 0. 8 (L 22) or 1. 2 (H 22) times their assumed metabolizable protein requirements, and a third group was fed the same <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> <b>allowances</b> as L 22 ewes, but one of their lambs was removed on day(10) (L 21). Ewes were slaughtered on day(21) to assess worm burdens, in vitro larval establishment on abomasal explants, and mucosal inflammatory cells. Faecal egg counts of L 22 ewes were higher than H 22 ewes throughout lactation. After the removal of one lamb, faecal egg counts of L 21 ewes decreased within 5 days to levels similar to H 22 ewes. Relative to L 22 ewes, L 21 and H 22 ewes had lower worm burdens, parasite per capita fecundity and in vitro establishment rates of both T. circumcincta and Haemonchus contortus. Mucosal mast cell and eosinophil counts were similar for all ewes, but H 22 ewes had higher globule leukocyte counts than L 22 and L 21 ewes. The data Suggest that a reduction in protein demand can rapidly improve periparturient immunity to T. circumcincta. This may be associated with increased parasite expulsion, reduced fecundity and non-parasite specific reduction of in vitro larval establishment. (C) 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

40|$|Nowadays in Ukraine {{there is}} a trend of {{increased}} use of mixed fungicides, containing compounds of certain classes in the formulation and new classes of active substances including anilinopyrimidines compounds. The aim of our work was hygienic assessment of dynamics of anilinopyrimidines pesticide residues in the soil, pit fruits, pomes fruits, vegetables, grapes and estimation of their risk for population. The content of tested substances in the samples was determined by gas-liquid and high performance liquid chromatography. Full-scale field {{studies have shown that}} in soil and climatic conditions of Ukraine dynamics of residues of anilinopyrimidines obeys an exponential dependence. Mean values of anilinopyrimidines fungicides  50 were equal to 10. 7 ± 0. 8 days in soil, 7. 9 ± 0. 2 days – in fruits, 5. 7 ± 0. 6 days – in verdurous plant mass. Pyrimethanil and cyprodinil (according to SsanN&R 8. 8. 1. 002 - 98) were referred to class III of hazard by persistency in soil, and valifenal – to IV class; tested substances were classified as hazard pesticides class III by persistency in plants. Comparative analysis of degradation rates of tested compounds in different matrices showed that degradation processes occur significantly faster in the verdurous mass of plants than in the fruits (p< 0. 05; t= 3, 75); and in fruits – significantly faster than in the soil (p< 0. 05; t= 3. 35). 0. 0413 mg of cyprodinil, 0. 0555 mg of valifenal and 0. 0385 mg of pyrimethanil can get into human body with <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> <b>allowance,</b> which is 3. 3 %, 26. 4 % and 4. 6 % of the acceptable daily intake, correspondingly.

40|$|Long-term {{enalapril}} and verapamil in rats {{with reduced}} renal mass. The effect of long-term treatment with either enalapril or high dose verapamil on survival, proteinuria, {{blood pressure and}} renal morphology was studied in female Wistar rats with markedly reduced renal mass. Four weeks were allowed for remnant kidney hypertrophy before determining the response to renal ablation of individual animals regarding proteinuria and hypertension. At this time, five groups of 18 rats were formed with equal levels of proteinuria and hypertension. Groups E 1 and E 2 were treated with enalapril, groups V 1 and V 2 with verapamil, and one group served as control. The <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> <b>allowance</b> was 14 g/rat of a standard rat diet, containing 30 % protein and 100 mmol NaCl/kg food in groups E 1 and V 1. NaCl content was reduced to 20 mmol/kg food in groups E 2, V 2 and control. The drugs {{were added to the}} drinking water, enalapril at a dose of 0. 1 g/liter, verapamil at 0. 5 to 0. 7 g/liter. Drug intake thus amounted to 10 to 25 mg/kg for enalapril and 50 to 140 mg/kg for verapamil. Treatment was continued for 15 weeks. Three of the 18 control rats did not survive up to 15 weeks. Mortality was lower in the enalapril treated groups with a single nonsurvivor in group E 1. In contrast, mortality was higher in the verapamil treated animals with seven nonsurvivors in group V 1 and eight in group V 2. Blood pressure control was excellent in both enalapril treated groups, and proteinuria decreased in most animals of group E 1 and all of group E 2. Glomerulosclerosis did not develop in the majority of the enalapril treated animals. Despite the high dose, verapamil barely lowered blood pressure. However, proteinuria rose markedly in response to verapamil causing hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidemia. Increased proteinuria was associated with a higher percentage of sclerotic glomeruli in the verapamil treated groups. Kidney weight was highly significantly correlated with proteinuria. Kidney enlargement thus appeared to be caused by tubular dilatation and filling with proteinaceous casts depending on the level of proteinuria. The favorable effect of enalapril on remnant kidney function and morphology was confirmed. In contrast, verapamil worsened proteinuria, tended to promote glomerulosclerosis and shortened survival of rats with reduced renal mass...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted on 382 males {{over the age of}} 65 during the time span from late December 1998 to late January of 1999. The {{research was}} conducted through a questionnaire asking the number of times participants passed bowel movements and asking about their daily diet and amount of food intake. The following results were discovered. 1) The percentage of men who passed daily bowel movements was 64. 9 %. Those with a tendency for constipation, passing less than three bowel movements a week, were 19. 4 %. Men who considered themselves irregular were only 3. 8 %. 2) 87. 8 % responded that they took in an appropriate <b>daily</b> intake of <b>food</b> or almost did, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. 81. 8 % responded that they knew or almost knew the suitable amount of <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> intake. 3) 97. 9 % answered that they thought there was a correlation between constipation and general health; 82. 6 % felt that it was appropriate to pass bowel movements daily. Looking at this response by age categories the following results were seen; 75 years of age or older, 75. 3 %; 65 to 69 years of age 88. 9 %, it was notable that the percentage was lower in men age 75 and older. 4) In examining the time when bowel movements were passed in men who reported daily bowel movements, 50. 5 % occurred between the time they awoke in the morning and right after finishing breakfast. For men who had irregular bowel movements, the percentage was 18. 2 %. It was notable that the percentage of early morning bowel movements was higher in men who reported daily bowel movements. 5) In regard to having a sense of <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> intake <b>allowances,</b> many men answered that they intake an ordinary amount of food. On the other hand, the percentage of men who answered that they were unaware of their <b>daily</b> <b>food</b> intake was less than 0. 3 %.
