40|$|The longer {{lactation}} period {{required in}} organic piglet producing herds reduces the potential number of produced litters per sow per year {{compared with that}} of conventional production. Induction and use of lactational estrus may be a way to increase the productivity in organic production. However, if lactational estrus is to be beneficial under practical husbandry conditions, it is crucial that the majority of sows are successfully mated within a few days to make <b>batch</b> <b>farrowing</b> procedures possible. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the occurrence and timing of lactational estrus in an organic outdoor system based on ad libitum feeding, individual housing until Day 35 in lactation, followed by grouping and introduction of a boar and weaning of piglets after 8 wk. Five groups with four sows ((Danish Yorkshire � Danish Landrace) � Danish Duroc) in each were observed, and rank was determined by a food competition test. All sows showed lactational estrus, and 84 % of these sows showed estrus within 1 wk, on average 43. 5 d and 7. 3 d after farrowing and boar introduction, respectively. The number of days from boar introduction to estrus increased significantly with increasing feed competition rank (the lowest number being the top rank position). Eighty-four percent of all sows were diagnosed pregnant 5 wk after estrus. Behavioral observations revealed that the average total number of copulations per estrus sow was 2. 3 with a range of 0 to 5 copulations. The findings of the current study indicate that it is possible to combine lactational estrus and <b>batch</b> <b>farrowing</b> procedures to increase the number of weaned piglets per year per sow in organic piglet production based on 8 wk of lactation or more...|$|E

40|$|The word {{strategy}} is often confused with tactics. In modern usage, strategy and tactics might refer {{not only to}} warfare, but {{to a variety of}} business practices, including pig business. There {{is no doubt that the}} 2000 ’ (r) evolution is sow herd is the strategy of hyperprolificacy. Essentially, {{strategy is}} the thinking aspect of planning a change, organizing something, or planning a war. Strategy lays out the goals that need to be accomplished and the ideas for achieving those goals. Strategy can be complex multi-layered plans for accomplishing objectives and may give consideration to tactics. Relative to our subject, an example of a relatively new global strategy for the sow herd is the <b>batch</b> <b>farrowing</b> management system mainly adopted for farrowing sows and piglets management, which is the topic of this presentation. Tactics are the meat and bread of the strategy. They are the “doing ” aspect that follows the planning. Tactics refer specifically to action. In the strategy phase of a plan, the thinkers decide how to achieve their goals. In other words they think about how people will act, i. e., tactics. They decide on what tactics will be employed to fulfill the strategy. The tactics themselves are the things that get the job done. Strategies can comprise numerous tactics, with many people involved in attempting to reach an overall goal. While strategy tends to involve the higher ups of an organization, tactics tend to involve all members of the organization, including pig workers. Relative to our subject, there are many tactical management measures for the supernumerary piglets (crossfostering), each of them with advantages but also disadvantages and many constraints. Finally, we will discuss on some never reported “counterintuitive ” (and negative) consequences of the strategy of <b>batch</b> <b>farrowing</b> and some other “counterintuitive” results of some tactical managements measures on neonatal piglets implemented to increase productivity in “ 5 H-herds”: High Health, High Hygiene and in...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this controlled, blinded and {{randomised}} study, Circovac®, an inactivated PCV 2 vaccine {{was used}} for active immunisation of 3 -week-old piglets (0. 5 ml, i. m., one-shot). In a PCVD affected farm, a total of 1105 piglets from three consecutive <b>farrowing</b> <b>batches</b> were included. The vaccine efficacy was assessed by clinical parameters such as mortality, underweight pigs and improvement of average daily weight gain (ADWG) during the fattening period. Additionally, {{the effect of the}} vaccination over time on viremia and seroconversion was investigated in animals from the 1 st and the 3 rd batch. Mortality rate from start of fattening until slaughter was reduced by 7. 40 % in the vaccinated group (p < 0. 0001). ADWG from 13 th to 21 st week was improved in the vaccinated group by 64. 83 g/day (p < 0. 0001) and by 41. 43 g/day during the whole fattening stage. Furthermore, vaccination reduced the rate of underweight animals, especially for the obtained weight data in the 21 st week of life with 5. 15 % difference (p = 0. 044). The percentage of recently infected animals, characterised by being positive for IgM antibodies, as well as the detection of specific PCV 2 DNA, was reduced in the vaccinated animals and it was found concomitant with higher mortality and underweight animals in the non-vaccinated group. From the study results it can be concluded that the vaccination of piglets with Circovac® reduced the viral shedding and protected the animals successfully as shown by the improvement of clinical parameters, and that it can be utilised as a valuable instrument against PCVD...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the associations between hematological parameters at weaning and post-weaning weight gain in piglets. Five well-managed conventional herds of average herd size of 1000 sows were selected. All herds provided a single injectable iron (either i. m. or s. c, 200 mg) supplementation from different commerical products at 3 – 4 days of life. Within each herd, litters belonging to a weekly <b>farrowing</b> <b>batch</b> close to weaning were identified and among them 20 litters were chosen randomly after exclusion of nursing sows. Within each litter, a random piglet was selected. EDTA and non-stabilized blood sample was taken from the anterior Vena cava of each piglet 1 – 3 days before weaning (average weaning age of 25. 7 days) and analyzed by complete hematology including serum iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC). The associations between each measured hematological parameter and the average daily gain (ADG) of piglets in a three-week period were tested using PROC MIXED procedure in SAS. A total of 99 piglets were included in the study but 3 were lost during follow up. The average hemoglobin concentration of piglets was 121. 5 ± 15 gl− 1 and the ADG was 202. 9 ± 78. 4 g day− 1. A positive association between hemoglobin and ADG in the three-week period (p= 0. 0003) was observed. Also, red blood cells (p< 0. 0001) and hematocrit (p= 0. 0005) had positive association with ADG while red blood cell distribution width (p= 0. 05), hemoglobin distribution width (p= 0. 04), and reticulocyte red cell distribution width (p= 0. 01) had a negative association with ADG. Hence the results indicate that improved hematological status at weaning is positively correlated to weight gain post-weaning. An increase in 10 g hemoglobin/l blood corresponded to a weight gain improvement of 17. 2 g daily weight gain in the 3 weeks post-weaning period. The strategies for improving the hematological values of piglets at weaning need to be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lameness in piglets {{is a major}} {{animal welfare}} issue. Floor {{abrasiveness}} is a common cause of superficial injury in piglets in farrowing pens. The abrasion achieved may act as a gate for infections, which in turn may induce development of infectious arthritis. In this study, the influence of improvements of the floor quality and of increased ratios of straw in identical farrowing pens was measured. Methods The study was carried out at a herd with four identical farrowing units with solid concrete floor bedded with 1 kg chopped straw per sow and 1 hg per piglet and day. Nothing was changed {{in the management of}} the four identical farrowing units, but four experimental groups were created: Group I – control, Group II – the amount of bedding was doubled. The surface of the floor was repaired in two units, Group III – Piglet Floor ®, Flowcrete Sweden AB, Perstorp, Sweden and Group IV – Thorocrete SL ®, Växa Halland, Sweden. Three <b>farrowing</b> <b>batches</b> were studies in each unit. In total, 93 litters (1, 073 piglets) were examined for foot and skin lesions until the age of 3 weeks. The occurrence of lameness was registered until weaning at an average age of 4. 5 weeks. Twenty seven lame piglets were culled instead of medicinally treated and subjected to necropsy including histopathological and microbiological examinations. Isolates of streptococci, staphylococci and E. coli were tested with respect to antimicrobial resistance. Results Piglet born on the repaired floors had the lowest prevalences of abrasions at carpus. Also the doubled straw ration decreased the abrasions. Skin lesions at carpus decreased significantly in magnitude in all four systems from day 10. At day 3, the sole bruising scores of the control unit were greater than the other three units (p Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (60 %), Staphylococcus hyicus subsp. hyicus (35 %) and Escherichia coli (5 %). These isolates were sensitive to all antibiotics included in the antimicrobial panels. Conclusion The results suggest that proper maintenance of the floor can prevent the degree of roughness and abrasiveness of the floors, which in turn can contribute significantly to prevention of abrasions, sole bruising and lameness in piglets. Maintaining the surface of concrete floors with two different commercially available solutions both decreased the incidence of abrasions and sole bruisings and thereby also of arthritis significantly. Also doubling the amount of chopped straw turned out to prevent development of skin lesions and sole bruisings to some extent, and subsequently also the incidence of arthritis. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Gestation {{length in}} swine has a {{considerable}} amplitude and both early and delayed parturition are common. This variation increases {{the occurrence of}} unassisted farrowing and {{could lead to a}} wide-ranging age at weaning for piglets born from one batch. Supervision of sow parturition is crucial to reduce mortality of neonate piglets. To facilitate assistance, induction of farrowing using prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF) has been widely used in <b>batch</b> <b>farrowing</b> systems, whereby synchronization would concentrate the time of farrowing, allowing for better organization of employees. However, a viable alternative method that can be implemented to manage farrowing is to sustain high progestagen levels {{in the final days of}} gestation and, consequently, prevent early parturition. Efficient techniques to delay farrowing such as using oral progestagen supplementation have been previously described, but are only recently being considered for commercial use. The present manuscript reviews publications regarding delaying parturition and discusses the use of intravaginal devices (IVDs) containing progestagen. There is limited data addressing the effect of progestagen treatment during gestation on productive and reproductive performance. Therefore, future studies should focus on improving synchronization protocols following progestagen supplementation and evaluating piglet viability and sow fertility, before widely using progestagen supplementation to manipulate parturition...|$|E

Farrowing was recorded as being interrupted in 15. 2 % of 1, 975 farrowings {{as a result of}} inadequate contractions during labour and where the time-interval between the expulsion of consecutive piglets exceeded 40 minutes. 143 affected farrowing sows were allocated into three treatment groups and received an intramuscular injection of 20 I. U. Oxytocin (Group A, n = 44); 140 μg of the agent Carbetocin (contained in 2 ml of the long acting oxytocin preparation Depotocin ®; Group B, n = 47) and respectively 70 μg Carbetocin per sow (Group C, n = 52) to stimulate labour contractions. The oxytocin preparation was applied on average 148 minutes following the expulsion of the first piglet. On average 4. 2 piglets had been born prior to this point in time. Following the injection of Carbetocin the time required for each piglet to be born, as well as the time to the completion of farrowing, were reduced significantly compared to Group A (p < 0. 05) and there was a tendency for a reduction in the proportion of piglets born dead. The various treatments had no fundamental influence on the proportion of those requiring manual assistance at farrowing. The labour contraction inducing injection of 70 μg Carbetocin proved effective; this dosage rate is to be recommended for application during parturition in the pig...|$|E
40|$|Every year around 100 million male piglets are {{castrated}} in the EU, usually without anaesthesia or post-operative analgesia. This surgical {{intervention is}} painful and stressful. Several main players within the pig industry have voluntarily agreed {{to end the}} practice of surgical pig castration in the EU by 2018. One alternative to castration is entire male pig production. However, entire males behave differently than castrates, for example, by performing more mounting behaviour, which is suggested to be a welfare problem. The aim of our study {{was to develop a}} comprehensive ethogram of different types of mounting and to investigate properties, causes and consequences of mounting behaviour in finishing pigs. The study included 80 entire male and 80 female pigs from two <b>farrowing</b> <b>batches</b> born six weeks apart. Mixed sex and single-sex housing of pigs are both common in pig farming, so to ensure our study was representative, the 160 pigs were assigned to social groups of 20 in three treatments: entire male pigs only (MM, 2 groups, n = 40), entire females only (FF, 2 groups, n = 40) and entire males and females mixed together (MF, 4 groups, n = 80). Measurements took place during the final six weeks before slaughter (between 63. 5 and 105. 5 kg). Observations of mounting behaviour on 12 days per batch suggested that: (i) males mounted more than females, (ii) within sex, there was no effect of treatment on the amount of mounting (although the statistical power of the study to detect these effects was low), and (iii) there were individual differences in mounting that were stable over time (within sex). Classification of mounting into different categories revealed that sexual mounting was most common overall and in males but only rare in females. Compared to other types of mounting (e. g. caused by crowding or during a fight), sexual mounts lasted longer and provoked more screaming by the recipient. There were no relationships between mounting behaviour {{on the one hand and}} dominance rank in food competition tests, the circulating levels of sex hormones (oestradiol, testosterone and progesterone) at the end of the study, the health scores (lameness and scratches) or weight gain on the other hand. The stable individual differences of mounting over time suggest that mounting behaviour is a trait of the individual rather than the appearance of random outbreaks. However, these differences in mounting cannot be explained by dominance behaviour or by differences in sex hormone concentrations that could indicate the onset of puberty. Mounting behaviour and in particular sexual mounting provoked high pitched screaming of the recipients indicating that mounting is a welfare problem. For the welfare assessment of entire male pig production the performance of mounting behaviour should be considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of selection for RFI on digestive and metabolic utilization of energy in 2 lines of purebred French Large White castrated male pigs obtained from a divergent selection experiment over 6 generations. The RFI(+) (high RFI) line consumed more feed than predicted from performance compared with the RFI(-) (low RFI) line. Digestibility of energy and nutrients, total heat production (HP), HP related to physical activity, and energy and N balance were measured in respiration chambers for a 6 -d period in pigs offered feed ad libitum. Pigs remained in the chamber for an additional day and did not receive any feed to estimate the fasting HP and calculate the thermic effect of feeding. Five pairs of 2 littermates from the same <b>farrowing</b> <b>batch</b> were used in each line. Because 2 respiration chambers were available for the trial, pigs were measured regularly during the 25 - to 95 -kg growing period. Two pigs per chamber were used until pigs reached 45 kg of BW, and 1 pig per chamber was used thereafter. Individual feed intake and BW gain were measured continuously from weaning to the end of the trial. Pigs were fed 3 diets with decreasing CP contents during the 25 to 45 (period 1), 45 to 65 (period 2), and 65 to 95 (period 3) kg of BW periods. Average daily feed intake was greater in RFI(+) pigs than in RFI(-) pigs between 25 and 65 kg of BW (2, 128 vs. 1, 891 g/d; P < 0. 01) and G: F was 8 % greater in RFI(-) pigs compared with RFI(+) pigs (P < 0. 01). There was no line effect on digestibility coefficients or N retention, irrespective of the experimental period studied. Nitrogen retention was 31. 2, 28. 7, and 20. 8 g/d at periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P < 0. 001). The HP was greater in RFI(+) pigs than in RFI(-) pigs (1, 497 vs. 1, 383 kJ. kg of BW(- 0. 60). d(- 1); P < 0. 01), with no subsequent line effect on energy retention. The activity-related HP tended to be greater in RFI(+) pigs than in RFI(-) pigs (250 vs. 218 kJ. kg of BW(- 0. 60). d(- 1); P = 0. 09), and the fasting HP was 10 % greater (P = 0. 04) in RFI(+) pigs than in RFI(-) pigs (846 vs. 771 kJ. kg of BW(- 0. 60). d(- 1)). The thermic effect of feeding, expressed as a percentage of ME intake, was the same for both lines of pigs (average, 14. 7 %). In conclusion, the RFI(+) pigs are energetically less efficient because of their greater HP related to physical activity and basal metabolic rate...|$|R
40|$|In the {{farrowing}} pens {{the amount}} of bedding material {{and the quality of}} the concrete floor has a huge impact on both the sow and the piglets. In this study imbedding of rubber flooring on the solid area in the farrowing pen was used to see if it had any effects on the sows lying behaviour when compared to concrete. Another important aspect was to evaluate if the rubber floorings had a high enough durability to resist the normal wear in a farrowing pen. Concrete flooring is assumed to have a higher thermally conductive effect then rubber which can affect the sow’s chance to cool down. Therefore the temperature in the farrowing compartment was measured to see if there was a correlation between the sows lying behaviour and the temperature. In total, the study was performed during five <b>farrowing</b> <b>batches,</b> in total about 30 weeks observation period. In each batch, two “rubber” pens and two “concrete” pens were included in the behavioural observations. Three different rubber floorings were included in the study; ProCoat rubber compound, Porca relax, and KKM Porca prototype. Continuous video recordings for the behavioural observations were made twice during the suckling period of five weeks. The video recordings were 24 hours each and took place at about one and three weeks after farrowing. The different behaviours that were noted were standing/walking, lying on the side, lying on the abdomen and sitting. The floor in the farrowing pen was divided into three different zones: solid flooring, slatted flooring and transition zone between solid and slatted flooring. In the behavioural study there was a significant difference one week after farrowing and a trend three weeks after farrowing, that the sows in the rubber pens lay down less than the sows in the concrete pens. This difference was not due to less lying on the solid floor area in the “rubber” pens, but was due to significantly less lying in the transition zone. In contrary, when only looking at the behaviour lying and recalculating the figures for this there was a weak, but not significant, trend that the sows chose to lie more on the solid rubber area than on the solid concrete area in the pen. The highest mean temperature was 21. 9 °C and the lowest mean temperature was 15. 1 °C. The assumption that sows could be more sensitive to higher temperatures when on the rubber floor, due to less thermal conductivity, could not be confirmed nor disregarded because the temperature during the observation period did not exceed the sows’ thermo neutral zone (15 - 20 °C) by much. The relation between temperature and lying percent on the slatted area showed a large variation between individual sows. The time it took for the sows to lie down showed no significant difference between the treatments, but a great variation between individual sows could be noted. The good durability of the Porca relax and of the KKM Porca prototype rubber mats were convincing during the whole study. In contrast ProCoat rubber flooring did not sustain the tough rooting behaviour of a sow in a farrowing pen and broke down. In conclusion there were large individual variations in sow behaviour in the study and the sows, in the farrowing pens, choose between different surfaces with different thermal and comfort properties. The use of rubber flooring instead of concrete on the solid area in the farrowing pen did not seem to be a great advantage in this herd. But the study showed that there are now rubber mats on the market, which can sustain the weight and behavioral activity of sows. I grisningsboxar påverkar mängden och kvaliteten strö samt golvets typ och kvalitet både suggan och smågrisarna. I denna studie lades gummimattor alternativt en gummimassa in på grisningsboxens betonggolv för att se om det hade någon inverkan på suggornas liggbeteende jämfört med de suggor som hölls på betong. En annan aspekt som också var viktig att utvärdera var om gummimattorna och gummimassan hade en så pass hög hållbarhet att de kunde motstå påfrestningarna som uppstår i en grisningsbox. Betonggolv har en viss värmeledande effekt som antas vara högre än den hos gummigolv. För att se om det fanns ett samband mellan liggbeteende och temperatur mättes därför också temperaturen i grisningsavdelningen. Studien utfördes under totalt fem grisningsomgångar under sammanlagt ca 30 veckor. I varje omgång av beteendeobservationer ingick två boxar med gummigolv och två med betonggolv. Tre olika sorters gummigolv användes: ProCoat gummimassa, Porca relax och KKM Porca prototyp. Dygnsvisa videoinspelningar gjordes en och tre veckor efter grisning. Dessa inspelningar användes för att observera suggans beteende. De beteende som noterades var står/går, ligger, sidoligger/sidobukligger och sitter. En indelning av golvet i grisningsboxen gjordes också och de olika zonerna var: helt golv, spaltgolv och övergång mellan helt golv och spaltgolv. I beteendestudierna av suggorna var det en signifikant skillnad en vecka efter grisning, och tre veckor efter grisning sågs en trend att suggor i boxar med gummigolv låg mindre än de med betonggolv. Denna skillnad berodde dock inte på att suggorna låg mindre på det hela golvet utan på att de låg signifikant mindre på övergången mellan helt golv och spaltgolv. Då en omräkning av siffrorna gjordes och endast beteendet Ligger studerades fanns en svag, men ej signifikant, trend att suggor valde att ligga mer på det hela gummiområdet än på det hela betongområdet. Den högsta medeltemperaturen var 21. 9 °C och den lägsta temperaturen var 15. 1 ° C. Hypotesen att suggor kan vara mer känsliga för högre temperaturer på gummigolv, på grund av sämre värmeledningsförmåga, kunde varken bekräftas eller förkastas eftersom medeltemperaturen inte mer än marginellt översteg den termiska komfort zonen (15 - 20 °C) under observationsperioden. Förhållandet mellan temperatur och liggtiden i procent på spalten visade en stor variation mellan suggorna. Tiden det tog för suggorna att lägga sig ner visade också på en stor variation mellan suggorna, men ingen signifikant skillnad mellan behandlingarna kunde ses. Porca relax och KKM Porca prototyp visade god hållbarhet under hela studien. Däremot kunde inte ProCoat gummimassa stå emot suggans bökande i grisningsboxen utan gick sönder. Slutsatserna av studien var att det fanns en stor variation mellan suggor och att icke fixerade suggor själva kan bestämma vilken yta i boxen med olika komfort och termiska egenskaper som de vill uppehålla sig på. Gummigolv istället för betong på den fasta ytan i grisningsboxen verkade inte vara någon fördel i den här studien. Undersökningen visade att det finns gummimattor på marknaden som kan motstå suggors vikt och bökande beteende i grisningsboxen...|$|R
