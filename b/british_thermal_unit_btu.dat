These engines rotate compressors to facilitate the natural gas transmission. These compressors are required in the mid-stream line to pressurize and to re-pressurize the natural gas in the transmission line as the gas travels. The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a <b>British</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>BTU)</b> value between 950 and 1050BTUs.

50|$|According to the Energy Information Administration's statistics, the per-capita energy {{consumption}} in the US has been somewhat consistent from the 1970s to today. The average has been 334 million <b>British</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>units</b> (<b>BTUs)</b> per person from 1980 to 2010. One explanation suggested {{for this is that}} the energy required to produce the increase in US consumption of manufactured equipment, cars, and other goods has been shifted to other countries producing and transporting those goods to the US with a corresponding shift of green house gases and pollution. In comparison, the world average has increased from 63.7 in 1980 to 75 million BTUs per person in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Natural {{gas in the}} US is {{measured}} in CCF (100 cubic feet), which is converted to a standardized energy unit called the therm, which is equal to 100,000 <b>British</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>units</b> (<b>BTU).</b> A BTU is the energy required to raise one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. A US gallon of water weighs 8.3 lbs kg. To raise 60 gallons of water from [...] to [...] requires , or approximately 0.359 CCF (35856/100,000), at 88% efficiency.

50|$|The SEER {{rating of}} a unit is the cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total {{electric}} energy input during the same period. The higher the unit's SEER rating the more energy efficient it is. In the U.S., the SEER is the ratio of cooling in <b>British</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>BTU)</b> to the energy consumed in watt-hours. The coefficient of performance (COP), a more universal unit-less measure of efficiency, is discussed in the following section.|$|E
50|$|Automobile fuel {{efficiency}} is most commonly {{expressed in terms}} of the volume of fuel consumed per one hundred kilometres (L/100 km), but in some countries (including the USA, UK and India) it is more commonly {{expressed in terms of}} the distance per volume fuel consumed (km/L or miles per US or imperial gallon). This is complicated by the different energy content of fuels such as petrol and diesel. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) states that the energy content of unleaded gasoline is 115,000 <b>British</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>BTU)</b> per US gallon (32 MJ/L) compared to 130,500 BTU per US gallon (36.4 MJ/L) for diesel.|$|E
30|$|Most {{residential}} clothes washers in the US and Asia {{have been}} traditionally top-loading, vertical-axis washers (Pakula and Stamminger 2010). As estimated by Tomlinson and Rizy (1998), top-loading, vertical axis washers use {{an average of}} over 40 gallons of water and over 7700 <b>British</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>units</b> (<b>Btu)</b> of energy per load of laundry. From these averages, the authors estimated that nearly 1.4 trillion gallons of water and 270 trillion Btu of energy were used by these vertical axis washers annually nationwide. Clothes dryers are also significant energy users. According to the Annual Energy Outlook reported by the United States Energy Information Administration (2016), clothes dryers in the US consumed 660 trillion Btu of energy in 2015.|$|R

Moreover, energy use in the residential sector accounted for about 15 % of world delivered {{energy consumption}} in 2006 [15].

50|$|Natural gas has {{a variety}} of {{chemical}} constituents that must be removed or diluted with other gas to achieve consistent pipeline quality.

5000|$|The <b>British</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>Btu</b> or BTU) is a {{traditional}} unit of heat; it {{is defined as the}} amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. It is part of the British Imperial system of units. Its counterpart in the metric system is the calorie, which is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. Heat is now known to be equivalent to energy, for which the SI unit is the joule; one BTU is about 1055 joules. While units of heat are often supplanted by energy units in scientific work, they are still important in many fields.

The rule of thumb for {{the nation as a whole}} is about 25 percent. The difference may reflect a traditional assumption of single-pane windows while this assessment analyzed installed window types in the region. Based on the often-quoted assumption, in the United States some 3. 5 quadrillion <b>British</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>units</b> (<b>Btu)</b> of primary energy, costing some $ 20 billion, is annually consumed as a result of energy lost through windows.

5000|$|In 1994, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defined [...] "gasoline gallon {{equivalent}} (GGE) means 5.660 {{pounds of}} natural gas." [...] Compressed natural gas (CNG), for example, is a gas {{rather than a}} liquid.

It is difficult to compare the cost of gasoline with other fuels if they are sold in different units. GGE solves this.

50|$|The Barnett Shale is {{thermally}} mature for hydrocarbon generation {{over most}} of its area. Barnett source rock is presently in the oil-generation window along {{the north and west}} parts of the province, and in the gas window on the east half of the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS. Expulsion of high-quality oil from the Barnett was episodic and began at low (Ro = 0.6%) thermal maturity. Thirty-two oils from Wise and Jack Counties were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the generating source rock. API gravity and sulfur content were integrated with high-resolution gas chromatography (GC) and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analyses. The API gravity of the oils ranges from 35° to 62° and sulfur contents are low (<0.2%), which is characteristic of high thermal maturity oils. Biomarkers from GCMS analyses show oils were sourced from marine shale, based on sterane distribution and the presence of diasteranes. Carbon isotopic analyses of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions support hydrocarbon generation from a single-source unit. In the main gas-producing area of fractured Barnett Shale, the gas generation window is along a trend sub-parallel to the Ouachita thrust front. Jarvie (2001) reported the <b>British</b> <b>Thermal</b> <b>Unit</b> (<b>BTU)</b> content of Barnett gas is directly proportional to Ro levels.|$|E

2500|$|The {{price of}} natural gas varies greatly {{depending}} on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet (about 25 cents per m3) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value {{of natural gas}} is roughly 1,000 <b>British</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>units</b> (<b>BTU)</b> per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU, or around $7 per gigajoule. In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per [...] ($10/MMBTU). The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price. At the end of 2007, this was $12–$16 per 1000 cubic feet (about 50 cents per m3). Natural gas in the United States is traded as a futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Each contract is for 10,000MMBTU (~10,550 gigajoules), or 10 billion BTU.
