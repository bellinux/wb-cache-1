40|$|Case StudyDuring the startup {{of one of}} the {{compression}} trains of an offshore platform, in August/ 2006, excessively high vibrations were observed at the high pressure compressor. The same problem was also verified one week later, during the preliminary tests of the String Test for the compressors of other two offshore platforms, which were supplied by the same vendor. The vibration records showed that the high vibration was due to the synchronous vibration component (1 X vibration) and that it increased with the gas temperature. The Vendor?s previous experience with this problem, which was designated as Thermal Induced Unbalance Vibration, indicated that this could happen when there were mounted components secured to the shaft through two interference fits. This was true for the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> of the high pressure compressor of P- 50. The design of this component, with a cylindrical shape, was not usual, but was employed because of the small diameter of the component.

In order to obtain an effective tool for predicting the leakage and the dynamic response of honeycomb seals, a bulk flow model has been devised in the past and, implemented in numerical codes, it is presently used in the design process. This kind of codes, however, require simplifying assumptions: in particular, one reference code available to the authors adopts the hypothesis of isothermal process.

These valves will remain closed until the inlet pressure exceeds the set point/nitrogen pressure, at which time the valve will open from the high pressure and remain open as long as the process pressure is above the nitrogen pressure.

40|$|LectureThe {{residual}} {{axial thrust}} {{acting on the}} rotor of a centrifugal compressor {{is the result of}} the non-uniform pressure distribution on the surfaces in contact with the process gas, plus the differential pressure acting on the faces of the <b>balance</b> <b>piston(s)</b> and the contribution due to the momentum variation of the process gas. During the design phase the axial load shall be verified to remain safely lower than the thrust bearing capacity, under all possible operating conditions; this requires a high degree of accuracy in the calculation model used to evaluate each thrust component. Errors in this calculation may lead to high bearing pad temperature during operation, to early wearing of the pad surfaces and ultimately to the damage or failure of the thrust bearing (Moll and Postill, 2011), thus jeopardizing the integrity of the whole compressor. The main difficulty of axial thrust calculation lies in the correct prediction of the static pressure distribution over the external surface of the impeller hub and shroud. This distribution depends on a large set of parameters, including rotor geometry, operating conditions, properties of the process gas, leakages flows across the rotor-stator seals. A detailed fluid-dynamic model of the gas in the cavities between impeller and diaphragm was developed and applied first to stage model tests and then to high-pressure centrifugal compressors, and its predictability was assessed by direct comparison with experimental data.

40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 20 This paper {{discusses}} the rotordynamic instability problems experienced with two separate centrifugal compressors. While {{the root causes}} of the instabilities are very different, the analysis methodology of reconciling the rotordynamic model with measured vibration data was the same. The first problem occurred with a propylene compressor in a Gulf Coast chemical plant that had experienced high journal bearing temperatures for several years. A modified bearing was installed to alleviate the temperature problem; however, a large subsynchronous vibration appeared after the new bearings were installed. A lateral stability analysis shows that the compressor with the modified bearings was very stable with the aerodynamic destabilizing effect predicted by the Alford and/or Wachel equation. A comparison analysis was made of the stability predicted with the original bearings (which were stable) as well as the modified bearings (which were not). This allowed the user to determine the magnitude of the destabilizing forces present in the compressor and design a new bearing that was both stable and would operate at an acceptable temperature. The new bearing was installed and the compressor has operated without the subsynchronous vibration for {{the past year and a}} half. The second problem occurred with a very similar ethylene compressor in a Midwest ethylene plant. The compressor had operated for over two years after an overhaul with low vibration. Then a subsynchronous vibration appeared that was very erratic, but was slowly increasing in amplitude over time. To solve the problem, a rotordynamic analysis was performed that suggested that replacing the bearing would solve the stability problem However, comparison between the measure field vibration and the rotordynamic model did not agree on all points. A more indepth look at the compressor revealed that the increase in subsynchronous vibration was tracking very closely with the balance line differential pressure. This fact, along with the characteristics of the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> seal, suggested that a bearing change alone may not completely address the problem A new <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> seal was designed to reduce its destabilizing effects on the rotor. The compressor was inspected during the next scheduled downtime to determine the cause of the high vibration and install the new <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> seal and bearings. Examination of the internals revealed a large seal rub in the compressor, but at the dry gas seals, not the <b>balance</b> <b>piston.</b> The rub was addressed and the subsynchronous vibration was eliminated. While the exact source of the destabilizing force was not correctly ?guessed? before disassembly, the indepth rotordynamic analysis did reveal that there was a large destabilizing force in the compressor, and a bearing change alone would not eliminate the vibration.

The compressor is driven at 7850 rpm by a 6000 hp electric motor, through a speed-increasing gearbox, and compresses hydrocarbon gases from 20 psig to 235 psig. A rotordynarnic analysis of the compressor determined {{that even though the}} compressor had a long history (approximately 25 years) of smooth operation (overall amplitudes less than 0. 5 mils), it had a very low margin of stability. This lack of stability was caused by a high bearing to shaft stiffness ratio as well as destabilizing forces in the <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> and shaft seals. The pressure dam bearing design is not destabilizing to the rotor system because the journal is very heavily loaded; however, the high direct stiffness that is produced reduces the effective damping of the system. Labyrinth and oil seals are usually not considered to have large effects on a compressor with such low pressures. However, the atmospheric side of the oil seal was determined to contribute the largest destabilizing effect. The effective length to diameter (LID) ratio of the oil seal was reduced by 50 percent to lower the amount of cross-coupled stiffness the seal produces. This modification reduced the subsynchronous vibration from 3. 5 mils to 0. 1 mils. The rotordynarnic analysis also identified other modifications to the bearing and <b>balance</b> <b>piston</b> design that should be made to increase the rotor's margin of stability.

Unlike smaller 2-10-0s that preceded them, the I1s design was huge, taking advantage of the PRR's heavy trackage and high allowed axle load, with a wide, free-steaming boiler. Large cylinders enabled the I1s to apply that power to the rails. Their power was undeniable, but they were not popular with the crews, for they were hard riding at all but low speeds. One author described them as the holy terror of the PRR. The large boiler limited the size of the driving wheels, which made it impossible to mount counterweights large enough to <b>balance</b> the <b>piston</b> thrusts. Their factor of adhesion is low, so they were prone to slipping.|$|R

A ball {{in a ball}} bearing also slides as the diameter of inner and outer races are different and the distance of circumference differs from the inside and out. When a ball bearing is used as the main bearing on a crankshaft (which rarely is the case), eccentricity of the cage (race) normally creates a phase imbalance in slide friction. Friction forces for plain/shell bearings (the {{most common type of}} bearings) are dependent upon diameter and width, which determine bearing surface area. This needs to be balanced for the pressure and the rotational speed of the load. Different main bearing sizes on a crankshaft create plane imbalance in slide friction.|$|R
