5|$|A {{motto is}} a short phrase usually {{appearing}} below the shield as a statement of belief.

5|$|From the 12th century onwards, large mansions {{lined the}} Strand {{including}} several palaces and townhouses inhabited by <b>bishops</b> <b>and</b> royal courtiers, {{mainly on the}} south side, with their own river gates and landings directly on the Thames.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 303, {{following}} a series of rebellions in Melitene (Malatya, Turkey) and Syria, a second edict was published, ordering the arrest and imprisonment of all <b>bishops</b> <b>and</b> priests. In the judgment of historian Roger Rees, there was no logical necessity for this second edict; that Diocletian issued one indicates that he was either unaware the first edict was being carried out, or that {{he felt it was}} not working as quickly as he needed it to. Following the publication of the second edict, prisons began to fillthe underdeveloped prison system of the time could not handle the deacons, lectors, priests, <b>bishops,</b> <b>and</b> exorcists forced upon it. Eusebius writes that the edict netted so many priests that ordinary criminals were crowded out, and had to be released.|$|E

50|$|In the {{remaining}} combinations of material, <b>bishop</b> <b>and</b> champion, champion <b>and</b> wizard, <b>bishop</b> <b>and</b> knight, and knight and wizard, {{the requirement for}} winning is that the enemy king should be {{kept out of the}} wrong colored corner since the knight alone, or the champion alone cannot defeat the king. Having met this requirement, the mating technique for <b>bishop</b> <b>and</b> champion, and wizard and champion are fairly straightforward, while the technique for <b>bishop</b> <b>and</b> knight is somewhat more complicated. As for knight and wizard, it is possible to set up positions in which the enemy king is corralled, leading to checkmate, but there doesn't seem to be a way of forcing these positions.|$|R
5|$|On 2 July, Pope John Paul II {{condemned}} the consecration in his apostolic letter Ecclesia Dei, {{in which he}} stated that the consecration constituted a schismatic act and that by virtue of Canon 1382 of the Code of Canon Law, the <b>bishops</b> <b>and</b> priests involved were automatically excommunicated.|$|E

5|$|Despite these setbacks, Sharp's efforts {{did have}} some success. In April 1783, he sent {{an account of the}} {{massacre}} to William Dillwyn, a Quaker, who had asked to see evidence that was critical of the slave trade. The London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783. Sharp also sent letters to Anglican <b>bishops</b> <b>and</b> clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.|$|E
5|$|Eighteenth-century prisons were {{effectively}} lodging houses. Poorly {{maintained and}} often filthy, they might {{consist of a}} couple of rooms in a cellar.
