40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{to use a}} novel network {{architecture}} of multiple optical <b>burst</b> <b>rings</b> to improve the interpod communications of the internal networks of data centers. In the proposed network architecture, bursty and fast-changing interpod traffic is handled by the electrical core switches, while the relatively stationary traffic is handled via optical <b>burst</b> <b>rings.</b> Compared to previously proposed hybrid optical/electrical switching schemes of using optical circuit switches, the proposed scheme offers high interpod transmission bandwidth, supports large number of pods, requires smaller connection reconfiguration time, and has better bandwidth utilization. Moreover, the proposed scheme only employs relatively low-cost commercial optical components, making it more practical for near-term implementations.

40|$|Review of data {{obtained}} on turbulent burst geometry and growth characteristics for cone boundary-layer transition in a helium wind tunnel at a boundary-layer edge Mach number (Me) of 7. 6. Detailed data concerning turbulent spot geometry and downstream propagation velocities were obtained using a spark schlieren system with sequential spark capability. In one particular test {{evidence of a}} symmetrical turbulent <b>burst</b> <b>ring</b> was obtained; all other bursts developed in a singular random manner. Profiles of the apparent outer edges of the bursts were obtained, and the velocities of the {{leading and trailing edges}} of the bursts relative to the local velocity were determined.

Smith {{was one of}} the final three {{participants}} along with Jeff Sword and Ronnie Garvin. As Garvin was attempting a piledriver on Sword, a masked man entered the ring, climbed to the top rope and hit Garvin with a 2x4. This allowed Sword to toss Garvin out of the ring. The masked wrestler, later called The Destroyer, turned his attention towards the two remaining men. Still holding the 2x4, The Destroyer stared them down but withdrew when Doug Vines joined his teammates. Smith was declared the winner of the battle royal. On {{his way out of the}} ring, Smith dropped the $10,000 check. A fan picked it up and saw it had [...] "void" [...] written across it. The promotion explained this by claiming that the <b>ring</b> <b>check</b> was ceremonial and that the winner would be given the actual one within a few days.|$|R

5000|$|By 2009, {{the scene}} {{subculture}} {{had become a}} common sight in Britain and the United States, superseding the earlier emos, goths, skater subculture, and Moshers. Users from Social Network site MySpace started to upload selfie photos showing hairstyles with dyed hair and spikes, black skinny jeans, heavy silver necklaces, bright pink or turquoise plastic bangles, heavy makeup, and multicolored or black T-shirts with a flashy, intricate graphic design. [...] At this time, the fashion took on and evolved into androgynous, matted, flat and straight hair sometimes dyed bright colors, drainpipe jeans, cartoon print hoodies, shutter shades, promise <b>rings,</b> <b>checked</b> shirts, and lots of very bright colors. Scene girls often wear thick eyeliner, brightly colored hair clips, and children's jewelery featuring 80s and 90s cartoon characters like the Care Bears, Pokémon, Transformers, or My Little Pony.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{study of the}} time evolution of perturbations of rotating black holes. The solutions are obtained by integrating the Teukolsky equation written as a first order in time, coupled system of equations. We address the numerical difficulties of solving the equation in its original form.

In particular, we calculate the effects due to {{the rotation of the}} black hole on the scattering of incident gravitational wave pulses. These effects include the amplitude enhancement due to so-called super-radiance. The results may help explain how the angular momentum of the black hole affects the gravitational waves that are generated during the final stages of black hole coalescence...|$|R

40|$|Sixty-nine Chiropsalmus quadrigatus medusae were {{collected}} from Okinawa Island, Japan, in June-August 2000. The bell height ranged from 2. 5 to 97. 6 mm. The numbers of fine rings on polished statoliths were counted, and the coefficient of variation for the within-individual counts for the four statoliths was 3. 3 ± 1. 9 % (mean::tSD, n= 17). The slope of the linear regression {{of the number of}} rings against collecting date in 61 medusae was near 1. 0, suggesting that the statolith rings are daily increments. The relationship between bell height and number of rings fitted a logistic growth curve. And, the relationship between statolith length and number of rings fitted the Gompertz growth curve.
