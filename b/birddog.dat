2500|$|Although the Rhodesian ridgeback's {{bird hunting}} prowess {{has been well}} known {{throughout}} the breed's history (the original description from the South African parent club belabors this point in fact), {{it is important to}} note that the [...] "gundog" [...] classification made in 1920s Southern Rhodesia and South Africa was not specifically about bird hunting. To understand this it is necessary to understand the union's classification system at that time. The two likely categories Barnes could have chosen from within the SAKU classification system at that time were, [...] "sporting" [...] and [...] "gundog". In the [...] "sporting" [...] group were the sighthounds and scenthounds.

The union's [...] "sporting" [...] dogs were those that would find game above ground, and were then expected to dispatch the game without assistance. The union's [...] "gundogs" [...] were those that find game above ground, and the human hunter was then expected to dispatch the game by means of a firearm.

25|$|General Bouathong {{moved from}} {{command of the}} Combined Operations Center to overall command of the RLAF in 1973. By early 1973, the RLAF's {{strength}} reached its zenith, with 2,150 personnel and 180 aircraft. The aircraft inventory included 75 AT-28s and eight AC-47s for combat use. Transport and light aircraft encompassed 15 O-1 <b>Birddogs</b> and 18 C-47s. The Americans decided to hand over some excess aircraft at the last moment, to augment the RLAF. The RLAF helicopter inventory was augmented by 24 UH-34s from the Vietnamese Air Force, bringing the total to 43, {{in an attempt to}} replace Air America's lift capacity as it departed Laos. Air America gave the RLAF ten Cessna T-41 Mescalero trainers and ten C-123K transports. General Bouathong plead in vain for newer and more sufficient aircraft, but was refused by the Americans. In that same month, January 1973, the RLAF flew 4,482 sorties before an armistice was signed on the 22nd.|$|R
5000|$|Through the years, the Hollywood Community {{began to}} change. The {{junior high school}} was closed and its {{students}} were bused to Douglass in the Douglass Community. Hollywood school never went beyond the ninth grade but its junior high basketball team, the maroon and white <b>Birddogs,</b> were a force in the 1940s and early 1950s. It's 1949 City Championship team was undoubtedly the most successful for that era. Students from Hollywood during the late 1940s and 1950s and 1960s went on to high school primarily to Memphis Technical or [...] "Tech" [...] with some going on to Humes High School, in 1954 a few started going east to Treadwell High School. Hollywood had very good, competent and dedicated long-tenured principals and teachers also during those days, as was later evidenced by their students' high school and later-life accomplishments. The movie theater began to play re-runs daily of old Bruce Lee movies. Many of the families {{moved out of the}} community despite the newly built clinic just off the main street of Chelsea in the approximate year of 1980. Soon, all the major stores except Piggly Wiggly were closed as well. Hollywood remains one of North Memphis's high crime areas.

5000|$|Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records is an American {{independent}} {{record label}} based in Athens, Georgia. Its catalogue was originally heavily weighted towards twee indie pop music, {{with several of}} its bands being associated with or influenced by The Elephant 6 Recording Company. The label originally began as a compilation CD, Happy Happy Birthday To Me Volume 1, before it expanded into a 7" [...] singles club, which released records by, among others, Of Montreal, Marshmallow Coast, The Essex Green, Great Lakes and Masters of the Hemisphere, while also releasing several tape and CD compilations. The singles club was noted for its individuality, with each individual record by an artist often being different. For example, each copy of The Essex Green's single came with a different original photograph on the sleeve, while Marshmallow Coast's were hand-drawn by school children. The label then began to release full-length CDs for the first time, {{the first of these}} being <b>Birddog's</b> A Sweet and Bitter Fancy. The label also continued to release 7"s, compilations and T-shirts, as well as a video compilation DVD, and a further singles club featuring Bunnygrunt, Casper and the Cookies, and Andy From Denver. There are currently over 150 releases on the label, and an even larger catalogue of distributed titles. Today, its catalogue has expanded to span several genres.|$|R

2500|$|In 1964 a new {{aircraft}} the squadron received it first UH-1E Iroquois. In August 1965 VMO-6 departed {{as part of}} Marine Aircraft Group 36 on board the [...] for Vietnam. On September 1, 1965 the squadron began operating from Chu Lai.
