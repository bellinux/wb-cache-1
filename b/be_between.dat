5|$|On May16, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) {{issued a}} {{forecast}} of a slightly below-average season. It predicted 10 named storms with a 70% {{chance that the}} number would <b>be</b> <b>between</b> 7 and 13 and 6 hurricanes with a 70% chance that the number would <b>be</b> <b>between</b> 3 and 9. It also predicted an ACE index of 84 with a 70% chance that the index {{would be in the}} range 47 to 121. NOAA released their pre-season forecasts on May22 and called for a 70% chance that there would <b>be</b> <b>between</b> 8 and 13 named storms, 3 to 6 hurricanes, and 1 to 2 major hurricanes. On May 29, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies, FSU COAPS, issued its first and only prediction for the season. The organization called for five to nine named storms, of which two to six would further intensify into hurricanes; one to two of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane intensity. In addition, an ACE index of 60units was forecast.|$|E
