5|$|An acute nosebleed may <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> with {{a variety}} of measures, such as packing of the nasal cavity with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding may lead to reopening of the fragile vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients may wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{about the}} {{management}} of the drainage and flood protection has previously involved the activities of IDBs.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of Windows Mobile devices were able to <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> and synced from a remote {{computer}} using ActiveSync; a data synchronization technology and protocol developed by Microsoft, originally released in 1996. This allowed servers running Microsoft Exchange Server, or other third party variants, to act as a personal information manager and share information such as email, calendar appointments, contacts or internet favorites.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{graphical}} BitLocker interface in Windows Vista {{could only}} encrypt {{the operating system}} volume.

5|$|Those with {{relatively}} mild visual field loss or double vision only may <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> conservatively, with close {{observation of the}} level of consciousness, visual fields, and results of routine blood tests.

If the apoplexy occurred in a prolactin-secreting tumor, this may respond to dopamine agonist treatment.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} tansy beetle {{occupancy}} amongst 1305 patches (stems separated by {{no more than}} 50cm) of the tansy plant {{on the banks of the}} River Ouse (York, UK) intended to establish data on the distribution of tansy plants and relate this to existing tansy beetle populations in order to contribute to the conservation effort of the species. The results were analysed using generalised additive models to conclude that the tansy patches should <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> towards volumes of 3m and that these patches should be targeted within 200m of existing beetle subpopulations on the same river bank in order to help the beetle population disperse and survive.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome can <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans {{may be caused}} by a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
5|$|American football's parent {{sport of}} rugby {{continued}} to evolve. Today, two distinct codes known as rugby union and rugby league are played throughout the world. Since the two codes split following a schism {{on how the}} sport should <b>be</b> <b>managed</b> in 1895, the history of rugby league {{and the history of}} rugby union have evolved separately. Both codes have adopted innovations parallel to the American game; the rugby union scoring system is almost identical to the American game, while rugby league uses a gridiron-style field and a six-tackle rule similar to the system of downs in American Football.|$|E
