5|$|With these {{hypotheses}} ruled out, the best-supported hypothesis for crest function {{seems to}} <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sexual display.

5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of an increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|Final {{assembly}} for the A321 would <b>be,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{first for}} any Airbus, {{carried out in}} Germany (then West Germany). This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant, and the Germans, arguing {{it would be more}} productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480million (€475 million) to finance development costs. An additional $180million (€175 million) was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} upon joining his new club, Gromek allowed nine earned runs in one inning in a 23–3 blowout loss to the Boston Red Sox. Despite the poor first outing, Tigers manager Fred Hutchinson decided that the veteran Gromek's best fit would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> starter with his staff of young pitchers. His confidence paid off, as Gromek shut out Philadelphia in his next appearance, allowing four hits and cementing {{his role in the}} starting rotation {{for the rest of the}} season. In his third start for the Tigers on July 2, he faced the Indians, and defeated the team who had traded him three weeks prior, 4–2. He ended up facing the Indians two more times, winning in August and losing in September, his final start of the year. In his first season in Detroit, Gromek went 6–8 with a 4.51 ERA in 19 games, 17 of them starts.|$|E
5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert {{together}} that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, {{declined to give}} him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament {{voted to}} scrap tolls {{on the bridge}} from February 2008. The bridge was {{nearing the end of}} its life in the 2010s, and a {{parallel}} replacement was built. On 5September 2017 the bridge carried its final private cars, as the vast majority of traffic was transferred to the new Queensferry Crossing. Following a few weeks closure for repairs, the new role of the Forth Road Bridge will <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> public transport corridor, open only to buses, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians. At its peak, the Forth Road Bridge carried 65,000 vehicles per day (vpd), which is now expected to drop to only a few hundred following the opening of the Queensferry Crossing.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} no therapeutic approaches targeting CASS4, {{and in the}} absence of a catalytic domain and no extracellular moieties, it may be challenging to generate such an agent. However, CASS4 may ultimately be relevant in clinical practice as a possible marker to assess prognosis and outcome in cases of NSCLC (and possibly other types of cancer). At present, its greatest clinical value is likely to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> predictive variant for severity and onset of Alzheimer's disease and cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|Under French law, both Sally and James {{could have}} petitioned for their freedom, as the 1789 revolutionary {{constitution}} in France abolished slavery in principle. Hemings had {{the legal right}} to remain in France as a free person; if she returned to Virginia with Jefferson, it would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> slave. According to her son Madison's memoir, Hemings became pregnant by Jefferson in Paris. She was about 16 at the time. She agreed to return with him to the United States based on his promise to free their children when they reached the age of 21 years. Hemings' strong ties to her mother, siblings and extended family probably drew her back to Monticello.|$|E
5|$|When World War II broke out, Shaw took a {{break from}} acting and joined the Royal Air Force. He was {{commissioned}} as an Acting-Pilot Officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 25 April 1941 {{and over the next}} three months was promoted to Pilot Officer on probation, then Flying Officer and then Flight Lieutenant. According to his obituary in the Guardian, he saw little action in the service and was told the only chance he would have to fly would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rear gunner. Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs while others mocked his posh accent, to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech. He continued to hold a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve commission after the war until he resigned the commission on 10 February 1954; he was permitted to retain his rank.|$|E

5|$|After an {{extended}} period of inactivity lasting nearly a month, the ITCZ produced an area of convection on March1 between Diego Garcia and the Seychelles. There were initially two weak circulations, although the one south-southwest of Diego Garcia ultimately became Cyclone Dera. It moved southwestward without much development at first due to hostile wind shear, with the circulation often exposed from the thunderstorms. On March4, the system developed into a tropical disturbance off the northeast coast of Madagascar. Two days later, the storm moved ashore Madagascar about 50km (30mi) southeast of Antsiranana. It weakened and became indistinct over land, emerging into the Mozambique Channel near Nosy <b>Be</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weak low. Convection gradually increased across the region as the track shifted westward. After moving toward Mozambique, the system rounded the ridge and turned to the south just off the coast, passing only 10km (6mi) east of Angoche. Around that time, the thunderstorms began organizing more, allowing the disturbance to intensify into a tropical depression on March8. With warm waters and an anticyclone providing outflow, the depression quickly intensified, becoming Tropical Storm Dera on March9 and soon after developing an eye feature. Also on that day, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 15S.|$|E
