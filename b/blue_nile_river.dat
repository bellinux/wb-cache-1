25|$|Mount Amara is in {{the same}} region as Lake Tana, the source of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>river.</b> Ethiopian {{tradition}} says that the Blue Nile is the River Gihon of the Bible, one of the four rivers that flow out of the Garden of Eden in the Book of Genesis, which says that Gihon flows through the Kingdom of Kush, the Biblical name for Ethiopia and Sudan. In fact the Blue Nile is very far from the other three rivers mentioned in Genesis 2:10–14, but this belief led to the connection in 18th and 19th century English literature between Mount Amara and Paradise.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia {{delivers}} roughly 81% {{of water}} volume to the Nile through the river basins of the Blue Nile, Sobat River and Atbara. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement, which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt {{under international law}} vetoed almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to utilize the local Nile tributaries. This {{had the effect of}} discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. However, Ethiopia {{is in the process of}} constructing a large 6,450 MW hydroelectric dam on the <b>Blue</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>river.</b> When completed, this Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station on the continent. The Gibe III hydroelectric project already generates an estimated 1,870-MW.|$|E

The analysis aims at shedding light over the complex implications that recent {{political and social changes}} have aroused for the water disputes between Jordan and Syria on the one hand, and Ethiopia and Egypt on the other. In both basins, cooperative efforts toward the integrated management of transboundary waters have been only partially effective and largely undermined by the perpetuation of unilateral actions by riparian states. In the case studies, the lack of a basin-wide vision over the control and use of shared waters has resulted in disputes among the basin states and ultimately in an unsustainable, unfair, and unwise utilization of the resources. This paper argues that a substantive and effective integration of national water policies is unlikely to occur, unless power asymmetries are properly addressed in order to overcome the likelihood of hegemonic regimes...|$|R

The major Nile water supply sources are coming from Ethiopian Plateau through the <b>Blue</b> <b>Nile</b> and Atbara during the period from August to December. Following this period, most of the water supply comes from the White Nile and its tributaries (the Sobat at first, then the Great Lakes Plateau). The contribution of these sources are studied and evaluated during this research.

40|$|High-resolution seismic {{data from}} Lake Tana, {{the source of}} the <b>Blue</b> <b>Nile</b> in {{northern}} Ethiopia, reveal a deep sedimentary sequence divided by four strong reflectors. Data from nearshore cores show that the uppermost strong reflector represents a stiff silt unit, interpreted as a desiccation surface.

Periphytic diatoms and peat {{at the base of a}} core from the deepest part of the lake overlie compacted sediments, indicating that desiccation was followed by development of shallow-water environments and papyrus swamp in the central basin between 16, 700 and 15, 100 cal BP. As the lake level rose, open-water evaporation from the closed lake caused it to become slightly saline, as indicated by halophytic diatoms. An abrupt return to freshwater conditions occurred at 14, 750 cal BP, when the lake overflowed into the <b>Blue</b> <b>Nile.</b> Further reflection surfaces with downcut structures are identifiable in seismic images of the overlying sediments, suggesting at least two lesser lake-level falls, tentatively dated to about 12, 000 and 8000 cal BP.

A reliable estimation of the magnitude of these floods with various return periods is of great significance in minimizing a flood damage. This can be achieved through flood frequency analysis. This study aims at conducting flood frequency analysis on the <b>Blue</b> <b>Nile</b> and <b>River</b> Atbra. Annual max instantaneous flood peaks at seven stations were statistically analysed and the underlying frequency distributions for each station was determined. Several ferquency methods have been tested, namely, Extreme Value type 1, Two parameters Log Normal, Three parameters Log Normal and Person type III distribution. The selection of the test frequency method for a particular station was based on the Chi square test, root mean square error and the standard error of estimate. The parameters of the distributions have been determined by two methods, the method of ordinary moment and the method of maximum likelihood. XIII A regional analysis was then carried out using the Index flood method. The results indicate that the seven stations can be grouped into two regions, namely the <b>Blue</b> <b>Nile</b> region and <b>River</b> Atbara region.
