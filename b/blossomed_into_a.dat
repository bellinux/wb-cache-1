25|$|With the {{elevation}} of Christianity {{to the status of}} a legal religion within the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great, with the edict of Milan (313), many Orthodox felt a new decline in the ethical life of Christians. In reaction to this decline, many refused to accept any compromises and fled the world or societies of mankind, to become monastics. Monasticism thrived, especially in Egypt, with two important monastic centers, one in the desert of Wadi Natroun, by the Western Bank of the Nile, with Abba Ammoun (d. 356) as its founder, and one called Scetis in the desert of Skete, south of Nitria, with Saint Makarios of Egypt (d. ca. Egypt 330) as its founder. These monks were anchorites, following the monastic ideal of St. Anthony the Great, Paul of Thebes and Saint Pachomius. They lived by themselves, gathering together for common worship on Saturdays and Sundays only. This {{is not to say that}} Monasticism or Orthodox Asceticism was created whole cloth at the time of legalization but rather at the time it <b>blossomed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mass movement. Charismatics as the ascetic movement was considered had no clerical status as such. Later history developed around the Greek (Mount Athos) and Syrian (Cappadocia) forms of monastic life, along with the formation of Monastic Orders or monastic organization. The three main forms of Ascetics' traditions being Skete, Cenobite and Hermit respectively.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} 13 head coaches for the Pacers {{franchise}}. Larry Staverman {{was the first}} coach of the team in 1967, when the team was in the ABA. Coach Bobby Leonard has the most wins in franchise history, with 529 in his 12 seasons with the team. After Leonard, Jack McKinney, George Irvine, and Dr. Jack Ramsay. When Ramsay abruptly resigned in 1988 after the team {{got off to a}} horrid start, Pacers legend George McGinnis took over on an interim basis for two games, before Irvine returned for 20 more. Dick Versace then led the Pacers through another sub-par stretch before Bob Hill got the Pacers back to the playoffs and into contention. Then in 1993, Larry Brown joined the Pacers franchise and led the team to many playoff appearances as Reggie Miller <b>blossomed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> superstar and eventual Hall of Famer. Larry Bird took over the team in 1997 and coached until 2000. Bird took the Pacers to their only NBA Finals appearance in the 1999–2000 season.

2500|$|The [...] "studio glass movement" [...] {{began in}} 1962 when Harvey Littleton, a {{ceramics}} professor, and Dominick Labino, a chemist and engineer, held two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, {{during which they}} started experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art.

2500|$|In 1997 visual poets Tim Gaze and Jim Leftwich first {{applied the}} word asemic to name their quasi-calligraphic writing gestures. They {{then began to}} {{distribute}} them to poetry magazines both online and in print. The authors explored sub-verbal and sub-letteral forms of writing, and textual asemia as a creative option and as an intentional practice. Since the late 1990s, asemic writing has <b>blossomed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> worldwide literary/art movement. It has especially grown {{in the early part}} of the 21st century, though there is an acknowledgement of a long and complex history, which precedes the activities of the current asemic movement, especially with regards to abstract calligraphy, wordless writing, and verbal writing damaged beyond the point of legibility. Jim Leftwich has recently stated that an asemic condition of an asemic work is an impossible goal, and that it is not possible to create an art/literary work entirely without meaning. He has begun to use the term [...] "pansemic" [...] to describe this type of work. Others such as author Travis Jeppesen have found the term asemic to be problematic because [...] "it seems to infer writing with no meaning." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1933, Anderson {{made her}} European debut in a concert at Wigmore Hall in London, {{where she was}} {{received}} enthusiastically. She spent the early 1930s touring throughout Europe where she did not encounter the racial prejudices she had experienced in America. In the summer of 1930, she went to Scandinavia, where she met the Finnish pianist Kosti Vehanen who became her regular accompanist and her vocal coach for many years. She also met Jean Sibelius through Vehanen after he had heard her in a concert in Helsinki. Moved by her performance, Sibelius invited them to his home and asked his wife to bring champagne {{in place of the}} traditional coffee. Sibelius commented to Anderson of her performance that he felt that she had been able to penetrate the Nordic soul. The two struck up an immediate friendship, which further <b>blossomed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> professional partnership, and for many years Sibelius altered and composed songs for Anderson to perform. He created a new arrangement of the song [...] "Solitude" [...] and dedicated it to Anderson in 1939.

2500|$|Alex Lai of Contactmusic {{likewise}} noted that, [...] "Those who {{are familiar}} with the earlier work of NFG are in for a shock. Beginning in more relaxed fashion than expected, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is a grand love ballad, serious in tone but retaining the group's ability to produce a catchy hook. Far from being a one-off experiment, these are actually the characteristics to the album and like Blink-182 before going on hiatus, New Found Glory have allowed their music to mature." [...] Jack Foley of Indie London, gave the album four stars out of five and described it as [...] "utterly engaging". While mentioning standout tracks, he added, [...] "The low-key [...] "Make Your Move" [...] drops some beautifully cascading riffs, while, the chiming piano chords that open [...] "It’s Not Your Fault" [...] give way into an effortlessly inspiring song." [...] People magazine declared that Coming Home is [...] "their best album yet", while Dan Aquilante of The New York Post awarded a score of three stars out of four and wrote that the album is [...] "a smart, stylistic mix rich in vocal harmonies, it's driven by guitar and piano breaks. The notion of getting back to family, friends and better days connects the 13 tracks." [...] British rock publication Kerrang! awarded the album a [...] "great" [...] four K! rating. Rae Alexandra opined that Coming Home [...] "displays a new level of sensitivity and subtlety; a new take on harmonies and melodies." [...] He noted that while the album isn't as immediate as previous material, it will [...] "move you far more deeply in the long run. It's hopeful; learned; masterfully executed. It's everything New Found Glory have been leading to all this time; and it's everything we never knew they had in them. Absolutely stunning." [...] Florida-based newspaper, The Palm Beach Post were also highly favorable and graded the album as an [...] "A-". They wrote, [...] "It's all written in beautifully vulnerable, snarkless, shout-it-out-loud terms, with an unself-conscious joy in the lyrics, the do-do-dos and the muted hand claps that find a sweet, genuine current of emotion without sacrificing edge. Pundik's delivery is never cloying, ironic or dumb. Underscored by drummer Cyrus Bolooki's strong beat, the songs are like a pre-made mix tape about {{the ups and downs of}} making yourself honestly vulnerable to another human being. Bravo." [...] Rock Sound journalist Tim Newbound rated the album at nine out of ten and particularly praised the band's progression. Writing that, [...] "New Found Glory have come of age. Their punchy punk-pop styling of old may have temporarily waned, but their knack of writing inducing melodies amid sincere delivery has only intensified. Pundik's nasal-edged vocals have now <b>blossomed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fuller pitch, perfectly complimenting his band's more tuneful and matured musicianship. Top notch." ...|$|E
