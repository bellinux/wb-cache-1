5|$|Since the 1996–97 season, European Sports Media have {{awarded the}} Golden Shoe {{based on a}} points system that allows players in tougher leagues to win even if they score fewer goals than a player in a weaker league. The {{weightings}} {{are determined by the}} league's ranking on the UEFA coefficients, which in turn depend on the results of each league's clubs in European competition over the previous five seasons. Goals scored in the top five leagues according to the UEFA coefficients list are multiplied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> two, goals scored in the leagues ranked six to 21 are multiplied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> 1.5, and goals scored in leagues ranked 22 and below are multiplied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> 1. Thus, goals scored in higher ranked leagues will count for more than those scored in weaker leagues. Since this change, there was only been one winner was not playing in one of the top five leagues (Henrik Larsson, 2000–01 Scottish Premier League).|$|E

Methane has an anthropogenic global warming potential (AGWP) of 29, which means that it's 29 times stronger in heat-trapping than carbon dioxide is, over a 100-year time scale.|$|E
5|$|In many European {{countries}} (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) {{the risk}} or dose limit for {{a member of}} the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> 20, and more stringent <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure.

5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

A holographic profiling technique was {{used on the}} surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened {{so that it could}} support heavier receivers.|$|E
5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, {{has the effect of}} enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.|$|E
5|$|Many of Titan's craters or {{probable}} craters display {{evidence of}} extensive erosion, and all show {{some indication of}} modification. Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, {{despite the fact that}} some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons. Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> two.|$|E

5|$|NASA astronauts train {{underwater}} {{to simulate}} the weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40ffw (12mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50fsw (6–15msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be breathed in the preflight surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> seven to nine times compared with air. A study by another military organization, the Special Operations Command also indicated that preflight oxygen might be an effective means for reducing DCS risk.|$|E
5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents.

Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning on Venus, and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning and thunder. The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming {{the occurrence of}} lightning on Venus. One possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.|$|E

5|$|This is {{believed}} to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is around 4–5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios, meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom-free by about 50%. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk significantly. Condom use is much more effective at preventing male-to-female transmission than vice versa. Previous HSV-1 infection may reduce the risk for acquisition of HSV-2 infection among women <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> three, although the one study that states this has a small sample size of 14 transmissions out of 214 couples.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> almost 3:1.
