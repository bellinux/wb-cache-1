Stuever thought the concept of the series had potential, concluding that Tosh can [...] "hold his own" [...] within the concept of redeeming the Internet and [...] "undoing the fail". [...] Five years later, Stuever reevaluated the show positively as a now long-time fan, and addressed his retrospective regret of his [...] "prematurely dismissive" [...] impression by writing a new review to serve as [...] "a long-delayed Valentine to his secret dirty love, Daniel Tosh". He describes Tosh's performance as being the essential self-rationalizing, misanthropic troll who personifies the audience's worst impulses in [...] "a splendid act of pretending to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> enters the world and immediately sets about disliking it". He describes the content as [...] "a digest of shockingly funny, gross or embarrassing ... moments of terrible decisions and painful outcomes" [...] and Tosh's highly rationalized tone of delivery as hilariously cruel, vicious, venomous, shocking, protective, and occasionally redemptive. Stuever says the show's decadent tone is formed around its target audience and its tentatively developing maturity level, [...] "higher learningand guiding set of ethics"—calling the show a good place to be, and to make fun of, [...] "a-holes". He describes Tosh.0 as [...] "a TV show about the Internet, literally and thematically", with a hilarious use of cruelty [...] "as black as the online soul, and as fleeting and ephemeral", yielding a [...] "blundering exploration of race, class, gender, life".|$|E
