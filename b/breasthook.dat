[...] "Oakes and Bluewater were reefers together, under old <b>Breasthook,</b> in the Mermaid; and when the first was made a lieutenant into the Squid, the last followed as a mate. Oakes was first of the Briton, in her action with the Spanish frigates, and Bluewater third. For that affair Oakes got a sloop, and his friend went with him as his first. The next year they had the luck to capture a heavier ship than their own, when, {{for the first time}} in their service, the two young men were separated; Oakes getting a frigate, and Bluewater getting the Squid. Still they cruised in company, until the senior was sent in command of a flying squadron, with a broad pennant, when the junior, who by this time was post, received his old messmate on board his own frigate. In that manner they served together, down to the hour when the first hoisted his flag. From that time, the two old seamen have never been parted; Bluewater acting as the admiral's captain, until he got the square bunting himself. The vice-admiral has never led the van of a fleet, that the rear-admiral did not lead the rear-division; and, now that Sir Gervaise is a commander-in-chief, you see his friend, Dick Bluewater, is cruising in his company." ...|$|E

50|$|Her keel {{was laid}} down on 1 November 1794 at Edmund Hartt's {{shipyard}} in Boston, Massachusetts {{under the supervision}} of Captain Samuel Nicholson and naval constructor Colonel George Claghorn. Constitutions hull was built 21 in thick and her length between perpendiculars was 175 ft, with a 204 ft length overall and a width of 43 ft. In total, 60 acre of trees were needed for her construction. Primary materials used consisted of pine and oak, including southern live oak which was cut from Gascoigne Bluff and milled near St. Simons, Georgia. Paul Revere forged the copper bolts and <b>breasthooks.</b> The copper sheathing was imported from England and installed to prevent shipworm.|$|R
50|$|The weakest {{part of an}} {{enlarged}} hulk would be its stem and stern. Since it has no proper keel or substantial stem or stern posts {{those parts of the}} boat would have to be reinforced by the introduction of substantial aprons and <b>breasthooks,</b> perhaps augmented by sacrificial stem and stern posts between which the unsupported hull planking could be sandwiched. Early hulks, like all of the other northern boat types, were initially shell-built using lapstrake or clinker planking which was subsequently reinforced by the insertion of grown crooks of timber as frames. Using these techniques, perhaps better understood as a result of technological transfers from architectural woodworking, shipwrights were able to extend the hulk in size until it rivaled and surpassed the cog.|$|R
