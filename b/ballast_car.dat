2500|$|One of the [...] "Municipa HaWa" [...] trams {{has been}} {{preserved}} by the Oslo Tramway Museum. Except for the length, {{it has been}} remodeled {{in accordance with the}} delivery design from 1899. They museum attempted to preserve a trailer, but Oslo Sporveier instead chose to scrap the last unit in December 1969. However, the museum has preserved a <b>ballast</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Society's {{permanent}} collection consists of 6 flatcars, 1 caboose, 3 combination cars, 5 boxcars, 1 <b>ballast</b> <b>car,</b> a horse drawn street car, {{and an assortment}} of other small cars. In addition, the Society has a 1927 7-ton Plymouth switch locomotive in its collection and a 1972 5-ton Plymouth switch locomotive used for MOW and operations.|$|E

50|$|Joseph S. Ralston and Anton Becker {{founded the}} Ralston Steel Car Company in 1905 by {{purchasing}} the plant of the Rarig Engineering Company {{on the east}} side of Columbus. Becker had just patented a drop-bottom gondola car which would allow the automatic unloading of coal and <b>ballast</b> <b>cars</b> (hopper cars). Prior to this invention, cars were unloaded by hand shoveling. An example of a Ralston-built drop gondola can be seen here.|$|R
5000|$|The AE&C owned {{a number}} of freight cars, but an office fire in 1913 {{destroyed}} most records. In 1924 an CA&E engineering report showed showed 28 wood gondolas, 10 steel gondolas, 17 wood boxcars, and 16 <b>ballast</b> <b>cars.</b> The table below does not show all cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{railroad}} {{was abandoned}} in 1980, {{a consequence of}} the Milwaukee Road abandoning its line through Ringling. The station in White Sulphur Springs still stands after being restored for the movie Heartland in 1982. A heavyweight coach and sleeper sit in front of the station along with a Milwaukee Road <b>ballast</b> <b>car</b> and a stock car, marooned far away from the nearest rail system. An ancient WSS&YP combination car sits in a farmer's field nearby.|$|E
50|$|The {{excursion}} {{train is}} made up of restored 1920s era coaches, previously owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, Canadian National Railway, Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. The railway's equipment collection also includes rolling stock not used on the excursions, including a former Ontario Northland Railway business car #200, a combination passenger/baggage coach used as a museum, two wooden cabooses, one steel wide-vision ex-CPR caboose, a <b>ballast</b> <b>car,</b> various boxcars, flat cars, and steam generator cars.|$|E
5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, sleet locomotives, pilot motor <b>cars</b> and <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars.</b> Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot motor <b>cars</b> and <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars</b> are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system, while <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars</b> are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|R
50|$|When {{the line}} was completed, the D&TSL had no {{equipment}} except a small locomotive which had been purchased from the contractor and an old dummy saddle tank engine that had formerly run on the New York City elevated. There was some work equipment consisting of Rogers <b>ballast</b> <b>cars</b> but no cabooses or any freight equipment. Only one station had been constructed-at Monroe-but there were few telephone shanties scattered along the road.|$|R
5000|$|Soon after Angola gained its {{independence}} from Portugal in 1975, the Angolan Civil War broke out. The railway was heavily damaged {{during the war and}} progressively fell into disuse. The workshops in Huambo were destroyed. <b>Ballast</b> <b>cars</b> had to be coupled to the front of locomotives to detonate mines. [...] By 1992, only 340 km of the railway remained in operation. [...] When the 99-year concession expired in 2001, only 34 km remained in service, along the coast from Benguela to Lobito.|$|R
5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars.</b> The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars</b> were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a <b>ballast</b> motor <b>car</b> {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars</b> over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} located on an {{embankment}} at Railroad Avenue on the main line. It has two side platforms, and metal orange canopies and walls. The exit {{at the south end}} leads to Old Town Road while an additional staircase {{at the north end of}} the northbound platform leads to a roadway to Dawson Place and Oregon Road, and is used most heavily by students from the adjacent Academy of St. Dorothy, a Roman Catholic elementary school. Just north of this station, a spur that had multiple purposes and served the press building of the Staten Island Advance newspaper is nowadays used as a storage spur for <b>ballast</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also on {{site was}} an old open top hopper car presumably used as <b>ballast</b> {{spreader}} <b>car</b> when the railroad was built. This was kept on a siding next to the displayed 0-6-0 saddle tankers during the parks operation.|$|R
60|$|When {{he opened}} the {{vestibule}} door the train was stopping and the beam from a standing locomotive's head-lamp flooded the track with dazzling light. For a moment the girl hesitated, but when Lister went down the steps she gave him her hand and jumped. Lister felt her tremble and was himself conscious of some excitement. He {{did not know if}} he was rash or not, but since she meant to go, speed was important, because the man from whom she wanted to escape might see them on the line. He went to the waiting engine in front of a long row of <b>ballast</b> <b>cars,</b> on which a big gravel plough loomed faintly in the dark.|$|R
60|$|Lister went to {{the opera}} with his hosts and was moved by {{the music and the}} feeling {{that he was one of}} a careless, pleasure-seeking crowd. For the most part, his life had been strenuous and the crowds he knew were rude. His home was a bare shack, {{sometimes}} built on the wind-swept alkali plains, and sometimes in the tangled woods. From daybreak until dusk fell, hoarse shouts, the clank of rails, the beat of heavy hammers filled his ears, and often the uproar did not stop at dark. When a soft muskeg swallowed the new track, he must watch, by the flaring blast-lamps, noisy ploughs throw showers of gravel from the <b>ballast</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{trailers}} {{also received}} a renovation from 1921 to 1925, although the body and interior remained intact. The main upgrades included new connectors {{to allow them to}} run in multiple with newer trams and track brakes. With these upgrades the trailers normally ran with SS trams. One trailer was requisitioned by the German occupation forces and moved to the Stettin Tramway. It was numbered 519 and remained in service until 1945. One trailer collided on 16 May 1944 and was subsequently retired. The remaining nineteen units remained in service until May 1966 and October 1967, respectively. Many of the older undercarriages were rebuilt to maintenance of way material. This included five <b>ballast</b> <b>cars,</b> six flatcars and various other specialized vehicles. As of 1996 many were still in use.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} motor cars saw further service as {{departmental}} vehicles. 16 {{were used as}} <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars,</b> with many of them lasting until 1978, and four were used as pilot motor cars. Motor car 3327 was displayed in the Science Museum, London, for many years, but returned to the London Transport Museum in 1996.|$|R
50|$|Following withdrawal, {{two of the}} French {{motor cars}} were adapted {{so that they could}} be used as single cars on the Aldwych Shuttle service from Holborn to Aldwych. Others became part of the {{engineering}} stock, working as <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars.</b> The 1920 stock cars were retired from service in 1938. It was intended to recondition them, and use them on the Northern City Line shuttle from Moorgate to Finsbury Park, but the onset of the Second World War prevented that, and they were stored at Cockfosters Depot. After the war ended, 35 of them were sold for scrap, and the remaining five became an instruction train for the Chief Machanical Engineer. The cars were renumbered IC1075-1079, and the train was moved from depot to depot by <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars</b> or battery locomotives. It continued to serve its training function until it was scrapped in 1968.|$|R
60|$|They {{dropped a}} few men at places where work was going on, stopped for water, and crawled at slow speed over half-finished bridges and lengths of roughly graded line. After nightfall it grew bitterly cold and Prescott, lying on the boards with his blanket over him, shivered, half asleep. For the most part, {{darkness}} shut them in, {{but every now and}} then lights blazed beside the line and voices hailed the engineer as the pace decreased. Then, while the whistle shrieked, <b>ballast</b> <b>cars</b> on a side-track and tall iron frameworks slipped by, and they ran out again into the silent waste. Prescott was conscious of a continuous jolting which shook him to and fro; he thought he heard a confused altercation among his companions {{at the end of the}} car, and the clang of wheels and the shaking rails rang in measured cadence in his ears. Then the sounds died away and he fell into a heavy sleep.|$|R
5|$|Four Hungarian-built gate stock {{motor cars}} {{were used as}} <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars,</b> and were {{numbered}} L13 to L16. The final one was stored in 1955, {{in the hope that}} it would be restored and preserved, but by 1960, the project appeared to be too costly, and so the gate end of the car was cut off, {{and the rest of it}} was scrapped. After refurbishment, the gate was displayed at the London Transport Museum. A further four Hungarian motor cars from the Piccadilly line were used as pilot motor cars during the reconstruction of the Hampstead line in 1922, and were numbered L17 to L20. Once a spur between the Hampstead line and the Piccadilly line at Kings Cross station was opened on 27 March 1927, it became much easier to transfer <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars</b> between lines. The 14 departmental vehicles which were operational in 1934 continued to be used until 1953, by which time their age made maintenance very difficult. They were replaced over the next two years and scrapped.|$|R
25|$|The {{railroad}} owned 199 {{freight cars}} in 1912, including 156 flatcars for logs and lumber, six tank cars for locomotive fuel oil, three boxcars, a stock <b>car,</b> and some <b>ballast</b> <b>cars.</b> California Western leased steel freight cars from other railroads when these wooden cars became unsuitable for interchange service. The California Western Railroad was extended ten miles north from Fort Bragg along the Pacific coast to the Ten Mile River in 1916 and 1917; and logging branch lines operated up the Ten Mile River until the extension was dismantled in 1949. Most {{of the old}} wooden cars were scrapped when the extension was dismantled, but a few remained in use for maintenance of way service and to move lumber around the Fort Bragg sawmill yard. Much of the former railroad grade between Fort Bragg and the Ten Mile River is presently used as a MacKerricher State Park coastal trail; and an unused trestle is visible from California State Route 1 {{on the beach at}} the mouth of Pudding Creek.|$|R

60|$|Sable Lake {{shone like}} a mirror among the ragged pines, as it ran back between the rocks, smooth as oil except where {{a puff of}} wind {{streaked}} its flashing surface with faint blue wrinkles. Behind it the lonely woods rolled on, south to Lake Superior and north to Hudson Bay. At one place a new transcontinental railroad cut {{its way through the}} forest; hammers rang and noisy gravel plows emptied the <b>ballast</b> <b>cars</b> along the half-graded track; but these sounds of human activity were quickly lost and in a mile or two only the splash of water and the elfin sighing in the pine-tops broke the deep silence of the woods. This belt of tangled forest, where the trees are stunted and the soil is sterile, offers no attraction to homesteader or lumberman. In consequence, it has lain desolate since the half-breed voyageurs, who crossed it with canoe and dog-team, abandoned the northwest trail when the Canadian Pacific locomotives began to pant through the rock-cuts by Lake Superior.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, {{fourteen}} standard stock {{motor cars}} were withdrawn from passenger service, and {{were converted to}} <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars,</b> with the final one completed in early 1955. All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923, four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co. At least {{three of them were}} chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage. They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and so rather than repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 motor car. The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 motor car was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a new number, becoming L77. During the 1970s, the <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars</b> were gradually withdrawn. The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.|$|R
5|$|The next {{batch of}} <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars</b> were French-built gate stock cars, {{originally}} constructed in 1906, but converted {{in the early}} 1920s to run with the 1920 air-door stock. 20 motor cars were converted, but were replaced by more modern cars in 1930. Although 12 of the displaced cars were scrapped, six were kept as <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars,</b> becoming numbers L24 to L29 in the service fleet. The final two were further converted to run as single cars on the Aldwych shuttle. During the Second World War they were used as pilot motor cars for refreshment trains on the Piccadilly line, which supplied food to people sleeping on the stations {{to escape from the}} bombing of the city. They returned to the Aldwych shuttle between 1946 and 1949, but were again used as pilot motor cars after that, transferring cars between the engineering works at Acton and various depots. They were both coupled to a flat wagon for a period, and were used to transfer stores from Acton Works to Northfields depot, and also took stores to Croxley Green and Queens Park depots on the Bakerloo line.|$|R

50|$|On June 13, 2007, near Cheongdo on the {{upgraded}} Daegu-Busan section, {{a damper}} acting between two cars of a KTX train got free {{at one end}} due to a loose screw and hit the trackbed, throwing up <b>ballast</b> that hit <b>cars</b> and caused bruises to two people on the parallel road, until the train was stopped when passengers noticed smoke.|$|R
5|$|The first <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars</b> were former trailer cars {{built for}} the Central London Railway in 1900, which were {{converted}} to motor cars for trials of the first multiple system {{to be used in}} Britain, and were retained for departmental use after 1903. These were followed by French and Hungarian Gate stock cars, built in 1906, which were converted in the 1920s and 1930s. The next batch consisted on 14 standard stock cars converted in 1953. Rolling stock reorganisation and replacement in the 1970s on the District and Metropolitan lines resulted in a number of surface stock cars being used for pilot motor duties. Subsequently motor cars of 1938 stock and 1960 stock were used for this purpose, and complete 4-car units of 1962 stock.|$|R
5|$|When the Central London Railway {{opened in}} 1900, it used {{camel-back}} electric locomotives hauling six-car trains. The locomotives weighed 44 tons and were largely unsprung, causing severe vibration problems in properties near the line. In {{an effort to}} resolve the problem, four of the coaches were fitted with motors, in the first trial in Britain of the Sprague-Thomson-Houston multiple unit control system. The trials were a success, and multiple unit trains were running by 1903. Two of the trial cars, numbers 201 and 202, were retained {{and became the first}} <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars</b> to work on the Underground. They worked in this form until about 1910, when batteries were fitted. They were renumbered L22 and L23 in 1929, and were scrapped in 1936 and 1937.|$|R

50|$|Two Hungarian gate stock cars, {{which had}} {{previously}} been used as <b>ballast</b> motor <b>cars,</b> were converted to battery operation. When working as passenger vehicles on the Piccadilly line, they had been numbered 34 and 39. In 1929 they were transferred to the Hampstead line, where they were numbered 113 and 118, becoming L11 and L12 in 1936. Shortly afterwards, the numbers were swapped, so that L11 became L12 and L12 became L11. They used batteries made by DP Battery Company, each with 220 cells. The final conversion was of Bakerloo car 66, originally made by the American Car and Foundry Company, and fitted with a 220-cell DP battery weighing 6.5 tons in 1932. It was numbered L32, and was scrapped in 1948.|$|R
