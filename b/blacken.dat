5|$|Thus locked together, both captains ordered {{their ships}} to pour fire into the other. So closely aligned were they that many cannon on both ships {{could not be}} run out, and instead had to be fired from inside the ships. The heat from this {{sustained}} bombardment was so intense that the wood began to <b>blacken</b> and burn as heavy roundshot smashed gaping holes in the sides of each ship: during the combat the ragged holes torn {{in the side of}} Hercule were so extensive that the planking between the gunports was torn away, leaving wide scars along the ship's sides. Casualties were heavy on both sides: 20 minutes after the action began a musket ball struck Hood in the thigh, severing his femoral artery. Fatally wounded and bleeding profusely, Hood was carried below and command passed to Lieutenant William Butterfield. The French casualties were significantly higher than the British, a result of the much higher rate of fire achieved by Hood's well-trained crew.|$|E

30|$|<b>Blackening</b> in {{heartwood}} {{was investigated}} {{in relation to the}} metal contents and the moisture content in xylem of about 50 -year-old seedling sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) planted in a steeply sloped stand in Okutama district (Itsukaichi Tokyo), where <b>blackened</b> heartwood is frequently found. The potassium, calcium, iron, and manganese contents were examined in the variously <b>blackened</b> heartwood and normal heartwood by an atomic absorption method. It was recognized that potassium increased relative to the degree of the <b>blackening</b> of heartwood, resulting in a significant correlation between them. This finding implies that an increase in potassium has {{an important role in the}} <b>blackening</b> of heartwood. Moisture content has a tendency to increase in the <b>blackened</b> heartwood, so it seems that the large accumulation of potassium is associated with the high moisture content in heartwood.|$|R

25|$|Cases of {{traumatic}} insemination between {{animals of different species}} will sometimes provoke a possibly lethal immune reaction. A female Cimex lectularius traumatically inseminated {{by a male}} C. hemipterus will swell up at the site of insemination as the immune system responds to male ejaculates. In the process, the female's lifespan is reduced. In some cases, this immune reaction can be so massive as to be almost immediately fatal. A female Hesperocimex sonorensis will swell up, <b>blacken,</b> and die within 24–48 hours after being traumatically inseminated by a male H. cochimiensis.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{peculiar}} traditions on Amrum. On February 21 the Biakendai is celebrated, where a great bonfire is lit {{to dispel}} winter. On the occasion people <b>blacken</b> each other's faces with soot. The festival originates {{from the old}} liturgical holiday of Cathedra Petri, which was originally celebrated on February 22. The custom is also popular in other North Frisian municipalities. On New Year's Eve the Hulken takes place, where groups of mostly young people dress up in costumes and walk {{from house to house}} to let others guess their true identity (similar to Halloween). Depending on their age, they are either treated with sweets or alcoholic drinks.|$|E
25|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Hygrocybe species are all agaricoid, most (but not all) having smooth to {{slightly}} scaly caps that are convex to conical and waxy to slimy when damp.

Where present, the gills beneath the cap are often equally coloured and usually distant, thick, and waxy. One atypical South American species, Hygrocybe aphylla, lacks gills. The stems of Hygrocybe species lack a ring. The spore print is white. Fruit bodies of some species, notably Hygrocybe conica, <b>blacken</b> with age or when bruised.

25|$|Blackface was an {{important}} performance tradition in the American theater for roughly 100 years beginning around 1830. It quickly became popular elsewhere, particularly so in Britain, where the tradition lasted longer than in the U.S., occurring on primetime TV, most famously in The Black and White Minstrel Show, which ended in 1978, and in Are You Being Served?s Christmas specials in 1976 and finally in 1981. In both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. Early white performers in blackface used burnt cork and later greasepaint or shoe polish to <b>blacken</b> their skin and exaggerate their lips, often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. Later, black artists also performed in blackface.|$|E
25|$|It {{is an old}} {{trick of}} the Indian Office to <b>blacken</b> the {{character}} of any Indian that happens, notwithstanding the retardation caused by the Indian Bureau, to rise a little above the ranks.

The whole Indian Bureau system of managing Indian business {{to the detriment of the}} Indian but for the benefit of a few greedy and voracious whites, is the most dramatic autocracy in existence the world over. Gradually through assistance of the American press, the generous hearted and justice loving American people are learning something of this present day Indian government humbuggery and deceit practiced by the Indian Office forces.|$|E
25|$|Kittens {{are born}} blind and helpless, and {{are covered in}} a fuzzy coat. At birth, the kittens weigh 65-163grams, though kittens under 90grams usually do not survive. They are born with pink paw pads, which <b>blacken</b> {{at the age of}} three months, and blue eyes, which turn amber after five months. Their eyes open after 9–12 days, and their incisors erupt after 14–30 days. The kittens' milk teeth are {{replaced}} by their permanent dentition at the age of 160–240 days. The kittens start hunting with their mother at the age of 60 days, and will start moving independently after 140–150 days. Lactation lasts 3–4 months, though the kittens will eat meat as early as 1.5 months of age. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of 300 days. Similarly to the housecat, the physical development of African wildcat kittens over {{the first two weeks of}} their lives is much faster than that of European wildcats. The kittens are largely fully grown by 10 months, though skeletal growth continues for over 18–19 months. The family dissolves after roughly five months, and the kittens disperse to establish their own territories. The species' maximum life span is 21 years, though it usually only lives up to 13–14 years.|$|E
40|$|Postharvest leaf <b>blackening</b> is a {{significant}} limitation to the commercial viability of several Protea cut flower products particularly those undergoing prolonged low temperature storage. Although postharvest carbohydrate supplementation is successfully used to reduce leaf <b>blackening</b> in susceptible Protea cut flowers the problem persists for prolonged storage. The finding that ethanol vapour exerted some control of leaf <b>blackening</b> in Protea 'Pink Ice' stored at 20 °C led to the current study to determine whether ethanol vapour could further reduce leaf <b>blackening</b> in 'Pink Ice' (P. susannae × P. compacta), 'Syliva' (P. eximia × P. susannae) and P. magnifica cut flowers under prolonged cold storage (4 ± 1 °C). Stems of 'Pink Ice' and 'Sylvia' (prepulsed with 10 % glucose solution) were exposed to concentrations of 0, 1. 5, 2. 5, 3. 5, 4. 5 and 5. 5 g ethanol kg fresh weight- 1. Except for the 5. 5 g ethanol kg fresh weight- 1 treatment Protea magnifica stems received the same ethanol treatments. 'Pink Ice' was stored for two, three and four weeks, whereas 'Sylvia' and P. magnifica were stored for only three weeks.

30|$|The {{heartwood}} of the Japanese persimmon tree (Diospyros kaki) becomes {{black on}} rare occasions and has been highly esteemed {{as a substitute for}} ebony. We attempted to clarify how the physical, mechanical, chemical, and biodegradation properties differ between sapwood and <b>blackened</b> heartwood. The specific gravity, equilibrium moisture content, modulus of rupture, and modulus of elasticity in the <b>blackened</b> heartwood were higher, and the loss tangent was lower, than those in sapwood. Furthermore, the <b>blackened</b> portion was more resistant to fungal and termite attacks. A section of heartwood was dark-brown, and the specific gravity and mechanical properties of this portion were slightly lower than those in sapwood. The dark-brown portion was speculated to be a sign or interrupted state of fungal attack. The <b>blackening</b> substance was bound tightly to cell wall components and could not be extracted with any of the organic solvents used.
