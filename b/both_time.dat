5|$|Edmontosaurus was {{a wide-ranging}} genus in <b>both</b> <b>time</b> and space. The rock units {{from which it}} is known {{can be divided into}} two groups by age: the older Horseshoe Canyon and St. Mary River formations, and the younger Frenchman, Hell Creek, and Lance formations. The time span covered by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and {{equivalents}} is also known as Edmontonian, and the time span covered by the younger units is also known as Lancian. The Edmontonian and Lancian time intervals had distinct dinosaur faunas.|$|E
5|$|The stage 20 {{individual}} {{time trial}} {{was to be}} the Tour's final competitive stage, since its final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial and only competitive at the sprint finish. Voeckler's position was likely secure, being a minute and 13 seconds behind Evans and a minute and 21 seconds ahead of Damiano Cunego, <b>both</b> <b>time</b> gaps unlikely to be recouped due to Voeckler's and Cunego's limited time trial skills. However, Rolland's position as best young rider remained in play due to his minute and 33 seconds advantage over Taaramäe, and Taaramäe's time trial abilities well superior to Rolland's. Rolland rode one of the best time trials of his career to finish 21st. Taaramäe finished tenth, and took back 47 seconds, but it was insufficient to take back the white jersey. Eight of the nine Team Europcar riders completed the Tour, with the lone exception being Kern who had crashed out of stage 5. Voeckler finished fourth overall and Rolland tenth as the best young rider.|$|E

25|$|The {{case was}} widely publicized. (Articles {{appeared}} in <b>both</b> <b>Time</b> and Life magazines.) An {{account of the}} trial was published by Ferlinghetti's lead defense attorney Jake Ehrlich in a book called Howl of the Censor. The 2010 film Howl depicts {{the events of the}} trial. James Franco stars as the young Allen Ginsberg and Andrew Rogers portrays Ferlinghetti.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} {{in general is}} that wavelets are localized in <b>both</b> <b>time</b> and frequency whereas the standard Fourier transform is only localized in frequency. The Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) {{is similar to the}} wavelet transform, in that it is also time and frequency localized, but there are issues with the frequency/time resolution trade-off.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} the {{atmosphere}} {{can be divided into}} distinct areas that depend on <b>both</b> <b>time</b> and spatial scales. At one extreme of this scale is climatology. In the timescales of hours to days, meteorology separates into micro-, meso-, and synoptic scale meteorology. Respectively, the geospatial size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale.|$|E
25|$|The widest {{coverage}} of the event {{and one of the}} best-known photographs of the event appearing in <b>both</b> <b>Time</b> and Life magazines, was documented by Stuart Franklin. He was on the same balcony as Charlie Cole, and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, George Mendonsa filed {{a lawsuit}} against Time Inc. in Rhode Island state court, alleging that he was the sailor in the {{photograph}} and that <b>both</b> <b>Time</b> and Life had violated his right of publicity by using the photograph without his permission. After Time Inc. removed the case to federal court, Mendonsa survived a motion to dismiss.|$|E

25|$|CBWT is CBC Television's {{flagship}} {{station for}} the Central Time Zone, airing the main CBC schedule one {{hour after the}} CBC Television stations in the Eastern Time Zone (for example, The National airs at 10 p.m. ET on CBLT-DT/Toronto and 10 p.m. CT on CBWT). This {{is different from the}} other Canadian television networks, whose stations in the Eastern and Central time zones air programs simultaneously in <b>both</b> <b>time</b> zones.|$|E

Leipheimer won <b>both</b> <b>time</b> trials of the 2008 Vuelta a España, leading the race after the first stage, and placed second overall.|$|E
25|$|FairVote has {{conducted}} research on both presidential and Congressional elections. Most of its presidential election {{research focuses on}} the electoral college's effects on campaigning. In its 2012 Presidential Election analysis, FairVote documented the large disparity in <b>both</b> <b>time</b> and money spent in swing states (e.g., Florida) versus safe states (e.g., Maryland). In addition, FairVote has begun publishing data on how much time sitting presidents spend in swing states.|$|E
25|$|These {{goals for}} {{structural}} change could have improved {{the efficiency of}} resource allocation while doing {{a great deal to}} lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required <b>both</b> <b>time</b> and the ability to restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. The first step was to stop the built-in inflationary process, but to do it without adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.|$|E

In October 2008, {{it was revealed that}} Riccò's teammate and Stage 10 winner Leonardo Piepoli, as well as Stefan Schumacher– who won <b>both</b> <b>time</b> trials– and Bernhard Kohl– third on general classification and King of the Mountains– had tested positive.|$|E
25|$|The {{equations}} used {{in physics}} to model reality do not treat {{time in the}} same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of classical mechanics are symmetric with respect to time, and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if <b>both</b> <b>time</b> and other quantities (such as charge and parity) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the laws of thermodynamics (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing entropy).|$|E
25|$|Direct {{confirmation}} of length contraction {{is hard to}} achieve in practice since {{the dimensions of the}} observed particles are vanishingly small. However, there are indirect confirmations; for example, the behavior of colliding heavy ions can only be explained if their increased density due to Lorentz contraction is considered. Contraction also leads to an increase of the intensity of the Coulomb field perpendicular to the direction of motion, whose effects already have been observed. Consequently, <b>both</b> <b>time</b> dilation and length contraction must be considered when conducting experiments in particle accelerators.|$|E
