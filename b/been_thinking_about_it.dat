During {{his time in}} Rishikesh, Lennon decided to write a song about the recent wave of social upheaval. He recalled, [...] "I thought it was about time we spoke about it , the same as I thought it was about time we stopped not answering about the Vietnamese war. I had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> up in the hills in India." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E

Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1986 season, Weaver retired for good, and Ripken was named {{manager of the}} Orioles. The Orioles were coming off their first last-place finish in Baltimore, but Ripken expressed confidence in the team {{at the beginning of}} the 1987 season, saying, [...] "I know these guys can get the job done. I may be hardheaded, but that's what I believe. We'll be a competitive team." [...] The Orioles got off to a slow start in April 1987, going 9-12 while losing seven of nine games in ones stretch. However, the ballclub would improve in May, moving over [...]500 while setting a May record with 56 home runs. In June, the team fell out of contention, dropping to 28-36, their worst start since 1955. Pitching plagued the club; Harvey Rosenfeld wrote it was [...] "the root cause of the Orioles' problems. In 1987, Ripken became the first—and only—father to manage two sons simultaneously in the majors, as his son Billy was called up at the All-Star break. Ripken managed Cal Jr. and Billy for the first time on July 11, in a 21 loss to the Minnesota Twins. The Havre de Grace Record wrote, [...] "The Ripkens of Aberdeen became the first family of sports." [...] On September 14, during a 173 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, Ripken substituted Cal Jr. with Ron Washington after the eighth inning, ending Cal Jr.'s major-league record streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. Senior said after the game, [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for a long time. I wanted to take the monkey off his back. It was my decision, not his." [...] The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East at 6795, setting a team record with 51 home losses.|$|E

Kirkham told the Yorkshire Post: [...] "It's something that's caused me fitful sleep in the time I've <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] I've no hobby, this is my hobby – it's what I do.
