60|$|When Christianity was {{presented}} to the ancestors of the present Jews, it came from a very suspicious quarter, and was offered in a very questionable shape. Centuries must have passed in many instances <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> colonies heard of the advent, the crucifixion, and the atonement; the latter, however, a doctrine in perfect harmony with Jewish ideas. When they first heard of Christianity, it appeared to be a Gentile religion, accompanied by idolatrous practices, from which severe monotheists, like the Arabians, always recoil, and holding <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> race up to public scorn and hatred. This {{is not the way to}} make converts.|$|R

2500|$|According to Nur Masalha, heavy Zionist {{lobbying}} {{had been}} {{necessary for the}} Peel commission to propose this [...] "in the last resort" [...] compulsory transfer. Shertok, Weizmann and Ben-Gurion had travelled to London to talk it over, not only {{with members of the}} commission, but also with numerous politicians and officials whom the commission would be likely to consult. This solution was embraced by Zionist leaders. Masalha also says that Ben-Gurion saw partition only as an intermediate stage in the establishment of Israel, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> state could expand to all of Palestine using force.|$|R
50|$|The first Roman {{attempt to}} halt {{payments}} {{of the tax}} was made long <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> War on account of customs controls. The Senate had forbidden the export of gold and silver, but the Jews of Italy continued to pay the Temple tax. In 62 BCE L. Valerius Flaccus, governor of the province of Asia, issued an edict forbidding the Jews of his province from sending the tax to Jerusalem. After {{the destruction of the}} Temple in Jerusalem in AD70 a, new Roman tax was imposed for taxation of the Jews, the Fiscus Judaicus diverted into imperial coffers.|$|R

2500|$|The Kohen {{hypothesis}} was first tested through DNA analysis in 1997 by Prof. Karl Skorecki and collaborators from Haifa, Israel. In their study, [...] "Y chromosomes of Jewish priests," [...] {{published in the}} journal Nature, they found that the Kohanim appeared to share a different probability distribution compared to the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> population for <b>the</b> two Y-chromosome markers they tested (YAP and DYS19). They also found that the probabilities appeared to be shared by both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Kohens, pointing to a common Kohen population origin <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> diaspora at <b>the</b> Destruction of the Second Temple. However, this study also indicated that only 48% of Ashkenazi Kohens and 58% of Sephardic Kohens have the J1 Cohen Modal Haplotype.|$|R

5000|$|The Pompeian Era was a {{calendar}} era used by Hellenistic cities in Roman Palestine, {{in particular the}} cities of the Decapolis. The calendar counted the years from the region's conquest by the Roman general Pompey in 63 BCE. Many of these cities had been self-governing poleis <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> Hasmoneans had conquered them in the 2nd century BCE. The Romans restored their self-governing status, so the conquest amounted to a [...] "new foundation" [...] of the cities, and they made that date the epochal year of their calendars. Some other nearby cities, such as Philadelphia, adopted the era {{even though they had}} never been under Hasmonean rule.|$|R
5000|$|The Seal of Solomon, {{also known}} as the {{interlaced}} triangle, is another ancient talisman and amulet that has been commonly used in several religions. Reputed to be the emblem by which King Solomon ruled the Genii, it could not have originated with him. Its use has been traced in different cultures long <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> Dispensation. As a talisman it was believed to be all-powerful, the ideal symbol of the absolute, and was worn for protection against all fatalities, threats, and trouble, and to protect its wearer from all evil. In its constitution, the triangle with its apex upwards represents good, and with the inverted triangle, evil.|$|R

The friend lost touch with Haq six weeks <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> Federation shooting ago when Haq e-mailed him saying he had started work at a Home Depot store in Everett. His friends thought it was odd Haq, who had a degree in engineering, took unskilled jobs. They say Haq had trouble keeping steady employment. Four weeks later, Naveed Haq attended his father's Islamic Center of Tri-Cities and met senior member Muhammad Kaleem Ullah (who had previously bailed him out of jail).|$|R
5000|$|In the {{narrative}} of the Acts of the Apostles, Paul was called to appear <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> Sanhedrin, on <b>the</b> instructions of {{the commander of the}} Roman garrison in Jerusalem. Ananias heard Paul's opening defense and commanded those who stood by him [...] "to strike him on the mouth". Paul described him as a [...] "whitewashed wall" [...] (τοιχε κεκονιαμενε) and testified that God would strike Ananias for this unlawful act. Those who stood by accused Paul of reviling or insulting the High Priest, to which Paul replied {{that he did not know}} that he (or it) was the High Priest, seeing that there were both Pharisees and Sadducees on the Sanhedrin (cf. Acts 23:4-9 for the whole context): ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the Medieval {{adoption}} of [...] "Rahab" [...] to mean demon or sea beast, the name also appears in Psalms 89: 5-12 and Isaiah 51:9-10. Rahab, in these passages, takes {{the meaning of}} primeval, chaotic, multi-headed sea dragon or Leviathan. It can be assumed that long <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> mythos, <b>the</b> ancient Jews emulated the creation fables told by their predecessors. The Babylonians, for example, told of a thunder god, Marduk, and a sea beast, Tiamat, battling for supreme power over the other gods, in the Enûma Eliš. It can be speculated these two characters in the Babylonian myth are parallel to the creation stories found in the Biblical passages containing the name Rahab.|$|R
50|$|Great Jubilee: Russell {{adopted and}} amended Miller's {{teaching}} of a secondary {{indicator of the}} due date for the Millennium. <b>The</b> ancient <b>Jewish</b> law provided {{for a series of}} sabbaths, each culminating in the Jubilee year in the 50th year, when slaves were released and leased property returned to its rightful owners. Like Miller, Russell believed the arrangement foreshadowed the release of humans from the debt of sin and bondage through the intervention of Christ. He taught that the Millennium was the antitypical Great Jubilee (the 50th 50-year jubilee) and {{marked the beginning of the}} second presence of Christ. Using his calculations of the date of <b>the</b> last jubilee <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> exile, he added 2500 years (50 x 50) and calculated it had begun at the end of 1874.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} Kerem Atzmona starts {{prior to the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second Intifada. Between the settlements of Morag and Bnei Atzmon, within Gush Katif, lied several thousand dunams of unused land that until a decade earlier had been a vineyard (kerem in Hebrew translates to vineyard) of Bnei Atzmon. In the summer of 2000, second generation children of the settlement decided to hold a summer camp on the plateau which is sixty meters above sea level. A few months later in <b>the</b> fall, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> holiday of Rosh Hashana (and <b>before</b> <b>the</b> October 2000 riots), two families decided to move to the site and live in a trailer. The following spring, more families decided to move to the location and took up residence in additional trailers that were installed on the site.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> {{population}} of Al-Andalus, the Sephardic Jews, developed their cuisine {{in close contact}} with Christians and Muslims. Influences went in both directions and lasted even after the expulsions and forced conversions of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> population that followed the Reconquista. Among the specialties was adafina (from Arabic al dafina [...] "the buried treasure"), a meat dish that was prepared by burying it in hot coals on <b>the</b> day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Shabbat. <b>Jewish</b> fish pie dishes have survived in Spanish cuisine as empanadas de pescado.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> Emancipation, {{virtually}} all Jewish music in Europe was sacred music, {{with the exception}} of the performances of klezmorim during weddings and other occasions. The result was a lack of a Jewish presence in European classical music until the 19th century, with very few exceptions, normally enabled by specific aristocratic protection, such as Salamone Rossi (whose work is considered the beginning of [...] "Jewish art music"). Although during the Classical period small numbers of Jewish composers were present in Amsterdam, Southern France and Italy, the vast majority of Jewish classical composers were active during the Romantic period (following the French Revolution) and even more so in the 20th century. Paul Johnson summarizes the dynamics of this cultural pattern: ...|$|R
