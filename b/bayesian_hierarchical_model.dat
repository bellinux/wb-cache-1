50|$|Specifying a Bayesian network {{meta-analysis}} model involves {{writing a}} {{directed acyclic graph}} (DAG) model for general-purpose Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software such as WinBUGS. In addition, prior distributions have to be specified {{for a number of}} the parameters, and the data have to be supplied in a specific format. Together, the DAG, priors, and data form a <b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>model.</b> To complicate matters further, {{because of the nature of}} MCMC estimation, overdispersed starting values have to be chosen for a number of independent chains so that convergence can be assessed. Currently, there is no software that automatically generates such models, although there are some tools to aid in the process. The complexity of the Bayesian approach has limited usage of this methodology. Methodology for automation of this method has been suggested but requires that arm-level outcome data are available, and this is usually unavailable. Great claims are sometimes made for the inherent ability of the Bayesian framework to handle network meta-analysis and its greater flexibility. However, this choice of implementation of framework for inference, Bayesian or frequentist, may be less important than other choices regarding the modeling of effects (see discussion on models above).|$|E

We applied the hierarchical method to assess river water quality in an agricultural watershed in eastern China. The procedure followed was developing a hierarchical model relating eutrophication response- the level of chlorophyll(Chla). Through Principal Component Analysis(PCA), five factors strong related with Chlawere selected to establish <b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>model</b> to predict the water quality.

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a {{regional}} <b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>model</b> for flood frequency analysis. The Bayesian method {{is an alternative}} to the traditional regional flood frequency analysis. Instead of relying on the delineation of implicit homogeneous regions, the Bayesian hierarchical method describes the spatial dependence in its inner structure. Similar to the classical <b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>model,</b> the process layer of our model presents the spatial variability of the parameters by considering different covariates (e. g., drainage area, elevation, precipitation). Beyond the three classical layers (data, process, and prior) of the <b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>model,</b> we add a new layer referred to as the “L-moments layer”. The L-moments layer uses L-moments theory to select the best-fit probability distribution based on the available data. This new layer can overcome the subjective selection of the distribution based on extreme value theory and determine the distribution from the data instead. By adding this layer, we can combine the merits of regional flood frequency and Bayesian methods. A standard process of covariates selection is also proposed in the <b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>model.</b> The performance of the Bayesian model is assessed by a case study over the Willamette River Basin in the Pacific Northwest, U. S. The uncertainty of different flood percentiles can be quantified from the posterior distributions using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Temporal changes for the 100 -year flood percentiles are also examined using a 20 - and 30 -year moving window method. The calculated shifts in flood risk can aid future water resources planning and management...|$|E

40|$|<b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>models</b> that {{characterize}} the distributions of (transformed) gene profiles have been proven very useful and flexible in selecting differentially expressed genes across different types of tissue samples (e. g. Lo and Gottardo, 2007). However, the marginal mean and variance of these models {{are assumed to be}} the same for different gene clusters and for different tissue types. Moreover, {{it is not easy to}} determine which of the many competing <b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>models</b> provides the best fit for a specific microarray data set. To address these two issues, we propose a marginal mixture model that directly models the marginal distribution of transformed gene profiles. Specifically, we approximate the marginal distributions of transformed gene profiles via a mixture of three-component multivariate Normal distributions, each component of which has the same structures of marginal mean vector and covariance matrix as those for <b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>models,</b> but the values can differ. Based on the proposed model, a method is derived to select genes differentially expressed across two types of tissue samples. The derived gene selection method performs well on a real microarray data set and consistently has the best performance (based on class agreement indices) compared with several other gene selection methods on simulated microarray data sets generated from three different mixture models. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To further {{understand}} {{the implementation of}} hyperparameters re-estimation technique in <b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>model,</b> we added two more prior assumptions over the weight in BayesPI, namely Laplace prior and Cauchy prior, by using the evidence approximation method. In addition, we divided hyperparameter (regularization constants α of the model) into multiple distinct classes based on either {{the structure of the}} neural networks or the property of the weights. Results The newly implemented BayesPI was tested on both synthetic and real ChIP-based high-throughput datasets to identify the corresponding protein binding energy matrices. The results obtained were encouraging: 1) there was a minor effect on the quality of predictions when prior assumptions over the weights were altered (e. g. the prior probability distributions to the weights and the number of classes to the hyperparameters) in BayesPI; 2) however, there was {{a significant impact on the}} computational speed when tuning the weight prior in the model: for example, BayesPI with a Laplace weight prior achieved the best performance with regard to both the computational speed and the prediction accuracy. Conclusions From this study, we learned that it is absolutely necessary to try different prior assumptions over the weights in <b>Bayesian</b> <b>hierarchical</b> <b>model</b> to design an efficient learning algorithm, though the quality of the final results may not be associated with such changes.
