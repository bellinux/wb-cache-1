40|$|The {{trial was}} carried out for 35 weeks at the trout farm ICAS Gilau, Cluj County. Three groups were implied: a Control group and two {{experimental}} groups (Bio-Mos 0. 2 % and SelPlex 0. 03 %) each consisting of 250 brook trout juveniles. The experimental groups received 0. 2 % Bio-Mos and 0. 03 % SelPlex. At the end fish reached an average weight of 238. 55 g/specimen for experimental group 1 and 212. 2 g/specimen for the second experimental group comparatively to the Control group (204. 65 g/specimen). The analysis of indices regarding the quantification of the health status, survival and losses, shows the <b>benefical</b> biological effects of the additives that had been incorporated in the basal diet of brook trout. The improvement of gluthation-peroxidase blood level in group 3 (5. 63 UGPx/mlPCV) comparative with that registered at the Control group (4. 34 UGPx/mlPCV) is another evidence of the biological <b>benefical</b> effects of Selenium.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of bedside focus {{assessed}} transthoracic echocardiography (FATE) {{is widespread}} in human medicine, {{and the potential}} for veterinary medicine has only recently been investigated.

The aim of this review is to discuss FATE and identify its main applications in veterinary medicine. In this context, FATE has proved to be <b>benefical</b> even when carried out by a non-cardiologist physician or veterinarian. However, a few references on this subject exist in the veterinary literature and there is still a need for standardization of this technique for use in animals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Multilayer neural {{networks}} trained with backpropagation are in general not robust against {{the loss of}} a hidden neuron. In this paper we define a form of robustness called 1 -node robustness and propose methods to improve it. One approach is based on a modification of the error function by the addition of a "robustness error". It leads to more robust networks but at the cost of a reduced accuracy. A second approach, "pruning-and-duplication", consists of duplicating the neurons whose loss is the most damaging for the network. Pruned neurons are used for the duplication. This procedure leads to robust and accurate networks at low computational cost. It may also prove <b>benefical</b> for generalisation. Both methods are evaluated on the XOR function...|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} the MCAP (middle cerebral artery pressure) and MCAP/MSBP (mean systemic blood pressure) ratio in 6 patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion who underwent acute cerebral revascularization. Five patients had proximal occlusion {{of the middle}} cerebral artery and one had trunk occlusion. In these acute stroke patients, average MCAP was 5. 8 ± 5. 8 mmHg (M ± SD) and MCAP/MSBP ratio was 16. 2 ± 5. 4 (M ± SD). These pressure values and ratios were much lower than those reported in chronic stroke patients. It is concluded that the low MCAP and MCAP / MSBP ratio indicate decreased collateral flow capacity in the acute phase of the arterial occlusion. In patients with low MCAP and MCAP/MSBP ratio, the acute cerebral revascularization might be <b>benefical</b> for preventing the development of cerebral infarction...|$|E
