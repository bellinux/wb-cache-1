5|$|Barbara Windsor voiced Mallymkun, the Dormouse. Burton {{said that}} he sought after Windsor for the role <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fan of her TV show EastEnders. Her voice sealed the deal {{for her role as}} the character.|$|E
5|$|Besides poets, at {{high school}} Lewis met Sophie Carson, who {{eventually}} became his wife. Klein, their mutual friend, introduced them. Carson came from a religious Jewish family. Her father did not approve of Lewis, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> recent immigrant to Canada, and in Carson's father's opinion had little to no possibility of success.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau came {{to believe}} he had lost the {{position}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Stalwart. The office-seeker decided {{that the only way}} to end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die—though he had nothing personal against the president. Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.|$|E
5000|$|... "My {{respect for}} Rabindranath <b>is</b> not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{so-called}} superman, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> complete human being." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{pleasant}} task!" [...] said Lydia, ironically. [...] "But I will do it--not so much, perhaps, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> prize-fighter, as <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> impostor. Now {{go to the}} writing-table and draft me {{a proper}} letter to send him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And is not Cathelineau like a postilion?" [...] said Jacques, [...] "and I {{hope you}} will allow <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great soldier. You know nothing of these things yet, Annot. M. Larochejaquelin <b>is</b> so smart <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> young nobleman; not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> general." ...|$|R
5|$|Harlan {{complained to}} Goebbels {{that all the}} {{characters}} were negative; to this, Goebbels retorted that Harlan would not turn down the role of Richard III just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> negative character. However, Goebbels acceded to Harlan's insistence on rewriting the script and Harlan spent from November 1939 to March 1940 revising the script although he kept much of what Metzger and Möller had written.|$|E
5|$|He was {{the first}} Dutch-born astronaut, a fact that is often ignored in the Netherlands <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{naturalized}} American and no longer a Dutch citizen {{at the time of}} flight. He is married and has two children. , he resides in Florida and works as a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Anderson {{was eager}} to invite Niels Bohr to the Tube Alloys project <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> world-famous {{scientist}} who would not only contribute his expertise to the project, but also help the British government gain leverage in dealings with the Manhattan Project.|$|E
6000|$|To such we may answer, hallow your Father's name, and be of good cheer. [...] YOUR FATHER {{has given}} you your work. <b>Because</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Father, <b>He</b> <b>is</b> surely educating {{you for your}} work. <b>Because</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Father, <b>He</b> will surely set you no task which you are unable to fulfil. <b>Because</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Father, <b>He</b> will help you to fulfil your task. Your station and calling is His will; and because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Father's will it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good will.|$|R
50|$|Harms plays {{under the}} {{nickname}} Sparky <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> electrician.|$|R
50|$|Bill Clinton {{avoided the}} draft <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> {{undercover}} CIA agent.|$|R
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> war veteran, Reich {{was allowed}} to {{complete}} a combined bachelor's and M.D. in four years instead of six, and graduated in July 1922. After graduating he worked in internal medicine at the city's University Hospital, and studied neuropsychiatry from 1922 to 1924 at the hospital's neurological and psychiatric clinic under Professor Julius Wagner von Jauregg, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927.|$|E
5|$|He was {{assigned}} to a civil flying school at RAF Prestwick which was run by Scottish Aviation Limited. He formally began his training on 29 June 1936. He progressed well in his theory examinations, gaining 99 percent for gunnery and 91 percent for airmanship. He flew a single-engined De Havilland Tiger Moth training biplane and gained his A Licence {{at the end of}} July, partly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> capable pilot and also because the Air Ministry was anxious to produce trained pilots. He completed his training within two months and was classified as above average after passing his examination with ease.|$|E
5|$|However, Peckham {{worked hard}} to reorganise the estates of the diocese, and held an inquiry in 1283 through 1285 into the {{revenues}} of the see. He set up administrative structures in the manors that divided them into seven administrative groups. Peckham, though, was almost continually in debt, and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Franciscan, he had no personal property to help with his living expenses. He had inherited the diocesan debts that his predecessor had allowed to accumulate, and never managed to clear them.|$|E
5000|$|Quomodo {{enters with}} his {{daughter}}, Susan. Quomodo says that Lethe would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good husband {{for their daughter}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> rich. Susan says that she likes Rearage much better <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> gentleman. Quomodo insists that Susan's [...] "likings" [...] are irrelevant. Thomasine argues that Rearage <b>is</b> <b>a</b> much better match <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> landowner, and collects rent from his lands.|$|R
5000|$|Tureycito: son of Turey, inquisitive, {{acts like}} <b>a</b> child <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> child.|$|R

5|$|In 1930, Houphouët married Kady Racine Sow (1913–2006) in Abengourou; {{their union}} was {{controversial}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> practising Catholic {{and she was}} the daughter of a wealthy Muslim from Senegal. The families of the two eventually overcame their opposition and accepted the interfaith union, the first ever celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire. The couple had five children: Felix (who died in infancy), Augustine, Francis, Guillaume and Marie, all raised as Catholics.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Combs as Special Agent Milton Dammers, an {{eccentric}} FBI agent {{who has a}} vendetta against Bannister. A former undercover agent known for his work with cultists, which caused him to sustain multiple massive mutilations and driven {{to the brink of}} insanity. He has a problem with women screaming at him. Jackson opted to cast Combs as Dammers <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fan of the actor's work in Re-Animator.|$|E
5|$|Leo's {{election}} {{was seen as}} a victory for France, with supporters of the French celebrating in Rome's streets upon his election. Leo's election pleased the French, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> relative of Marie de' Medici who was happy with his election. Leo's reign, however, was limited to the month of April 1605. He caught a cold while appearing in public, and died on 27 April 1605, twenty-six days after his election.|$|E
50|$|Rotinsulu {{reportedly}} became <b>a</b> goalkeeper <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{big fan of}} Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon.|$|R
60|$|BRITANNUS. His manner <b>is</b> {{frivolous}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> Italian; but <b>he</b> {{means what}} he says.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I shall adore him," [...] Lady Anne decided,--"not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{good friend}} of yours, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> working journalist. Why, I saw him sitting waiting for you the day you came and wished me that {{touching}} good-bye," [...] she added. [...] "I liked him even then. It seemed so sweet of him to come and help you through that terrible ordeal." ...|$|R
5|$|Menzies became prime {{minister}} again in December 1949, and he resolved that Blamey should be {{promoted to the}} rank of field marshal, something that had been mooted in 1945. The recommendation went via the Governor-General, William McKell, to the War Office in London, which replied that a dominion officer could not be promoted to the rank. Menzies pointed out that Jan Smuts already had. The War Office then claimed that Blamey could not be promoted to field marshal <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> retired officer, which was not true. Menzies then restored Blamey to active duty. Blamey was duly promoted to field marshal in the King's Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 1564 Knox stirred {{controversy}} again, when {{he married}} Margaret Stewart, {{the daughter of an}} old friend, Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree, a member of the Stuart family and a distant relative of the Queen, Mary Stuart. The marriage was unusual <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> widower of fifty, while the bride was only seventeen. Very few details are known of their domestic life. They had three daughters, Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|Surjik {{personally}} {{asked if}} he could direct the episode <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series. Filming the episode was difficult for the cast and crew due largely {{to the fact that the}} script arrived for the cast and crew to film only two days in advance. Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding a hallway with 3,300 gallons of water. Many of the scenes were filmed at Riverview Hospital, a mental health facility located in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|E
50|$|A {{transfer}} {{student who}} is studying abroad from America. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> fluent in Japanese <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> otaku.|$|R

5000|$|The narrator {{tells his}} {{significant}} other {{to be patient}} with him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> [...] "work in progress".|$|R
5|$|The curial {{cardinals}} {{entered the}} conclave seeking to elect Gregorio Barbarigo as pope. Leopold I, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered {{him to be}} an unacceptable choice <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Venetian. While Leopold did not formally exclude Barbarigo, he did not wish {{for him to be}} elected. In addition to Leopold, the Spanish ambassador in Rome worked against Barbarigo's election, and Louis XIV of France opposed it because of the wishes of his allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{originally}} scheduled {{start date}} was mid-August 1995, but filming was delayed until February 26, 1996. Director Tim Burton hired Peter Suschitzky as the cinematographer, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fan {{of his work}} in David Cronenberg's films. Production designer Thomas Wynn (A Beautiful Mind, Malcolm X) intended to have the war room pay tribute to Dr. Strangelove (1964). During production, Burton insisted that the art direction, cinematography and costume design of Mars Attacks! incorporate {{the look of the}} 1960s trading cards.|$|E
5|$|When World War I {{broke out}} in 1914, Khrushchev was exempt from {{conscription}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> skilled metal worker. He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and {{he was involved in}} several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war. In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the elevator operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.|$|E
5000|$|Sanjūrō is Himeko's father, {{who often}} sleeps while {{seated in the}} toilet due to all-nighters (<b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> policeman).|$|R
60|$|Wom. Yes, said she, and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tinker, and a poor man, {{therefore}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> despised, and cannot have justice.|$|R
