50|$|A <b>bifidus</b> <b>factor</b> (bifidogenic factor) is a {{compound}} that specifically enhances {{the growth of}} bifidobacteria in either a product or in the intestines of humans and/or animals. Several products have been marketed as bifidogenic factors, such as several prebiotics and methyl-N-acetyl D-glucosamine in human milk.|$|E

Both products exhibited selective fermentability throughout the entire colon with a positive and selective <b>bifidus</b> <b>factor.</b> They also demonstrated the possibility of enhancing species belonging to Bacteroidetes, a phylum recently associated with body weight management.|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of human milk {{for the growth}} of Lactobacillus bifidus var. Penn was compared with that of other species. The average relative activity was highest for human colostrum, closely followed by rat colostrum, then by human milk, rat milk, and cow's colostrum. The milk of ruminants (cow, ewe, goat) showed only very slight activity. Somewhat higher activity was found in the milk of cat, monkey, dog, donkey, rabbit, mare, and sow. The bifidus growth factor has been demonstrated in high concentration in various secretions in man, such as saliva, semen, amniotic fluid, meconium, and tears. Hog gastric mucin which has a high blood-group titer has also shown a high titer for <b>bifidus</b> <b>factor,</b> while other nitrogencontaining polysaccharides were free or almost free of <b>bifidus</b> <b>factor.</b> Ammonium salts and N-acetylglucosamine as well as N-acetylgalactosamine, especially the ammonium salts, in high concentration, were active, probably as precursors of the growth factor...|$|E
40|$|A {{strain of}} Bijdobacterium bijidum which was {{dependent}} on <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> was administered to four groups of germ-free mice each receiving a different sample of human milk containing the same concentration of <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors.</b> The strain became established {{in three of the}} four groups in numbers varying between 5 x lo 7 and 1 x lO'O/g faeces. B. hrJidum also became established in numbers varying between 5 x lo 9 and 2 x IO'O/g faeces in mono-associated mice receiving diets containing little or no <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors.</b> The caeca of all the germ-free mice examined contained <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> in higher concentrations than in human milk. This concentration decreased in mice where B. bijidum was established. Thus, no relation was observed between the dietary concentration of <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> and the faecal levels of B. bifidum. In addition, no antagonism was observed between B. bijidum and an Escherichia coli strain, a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain and a Bacteroides sp. strain, all isolated from the stools of newborn babies, although the caecal pH of mice receiving human milk fell to 5. 2.

40|$|The {{buffering}} {{capacity of a}} milk diet {{is known to be}} involved in the control of a newborn's bifidobacterial flora. Other factors could modulate the bifidobacterial flora e. g. <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> present in human milk, which are growth-promoting for Bi 3 dobacterium bi$durn. The aim of this study was to investigate in gnotobiotic mice the effects of human milk <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> upon colonis-ation by bifidobacteria according to the dietary {{buffering capacity}}. A high buffering capacity diet encouraged the implantation of higher numbers of bifidobacteria in monoxenic mice than a low buffering capacity one. However, supplementary feeding with human milk oligosaccharides (gynolactose) did not support the proliferation of B. bijdum, although the gynolactose <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> were not destroyed during digestion. Furthermore the addition of gynolactose to a high buffering capacity diet led to the breakdown of some of the intestinal glycoproteins detected in the bifidogenic extract of stools from germfree mice. In addition, although the human milk oligosaccharides stimulated the excretion of intestinal <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> when supplementing a low buffering capacity diet, they failed to do so on a high buffering capacity diet. These results suggest that the ability of human milk oligosaccharides to encourage the proliferation of B. bijidum depends upon their capacity to stimulate intestinal <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors.</b> This capacity seemed to be related to the buffering capacity of the diet.

The aim of this trial was to investigate whether the supplementation of a follow-up infant formula with prebiotics (only galactooligosaccharides) could influence the composition of the stool flora in older infants (> 4 mo of age).

40|$|A lacto-N-biose {{phosphorylase}} (LNBP) was purified {{from the}} cell extract of Bifidobacterium bifidum. Its N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences were homologous {{with those of}} the hypothetical protein of Bifidobacterium longum NCC 2705 encoded by the BL 1641 gene. The homologous gene of the type strain B. longum JCM 1217, lnpA, was expressed in Escherichia coli to confirm that it encoded LNBP. No significant identity was found with any proteins with known function, indicating that LNBP should be classified in a new family. The lnpA gene is located in a novel putative operon for galactose metabolism that does not contain a galactokinase gene. The operon seems to be involved in intestinal colonization by bifidobacteria mediated by metabolism of mucin sugars. In addition, it may also resolve the question {{of the nature of the}} <b>bifidus</b> <b>factor</b> in human milk as the lacto-N-biose structure found in milk oligosaccharides...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Many glycosidases, which work {{as useful}} {{reagents}} {{for the studies}} of structures and functions of free and conjugated oligosaccharides, have been found and thoroughly purified. These enzymes are classified into exo- and endoglycosidases by their glycon specificities. Their usefulness and limits as reagents are explained in detail in this review. Endoglycosidases, which were originally found in the culture fluid of bacteria and in the extracts of plants, are now widely found in the mammals including humans. The physiological roles of these enzymes are discussed {{in relation to the}} oligosaccharides accumulated in the urine of patients with exoglycosidase deficiencies. Furthermore, PNGase is found to play important roles in the ER-associated degradation pathway of glycoproteins. Recent studies of the glycosidases in Bifidobacteria have revealed that GNB/LNB pathway, which uniquely exist in this bacteria, works for the expression of <b>Bifidus</b> <b>factor</b> activity of human milk oligosaccharides, an important topic in the baby nutrition. This interesting field will be introduced in detail in one section of this article...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Comparative {{study of}} the {{oligosaccharide}} profiles of individual human milk revealed the presence of three different patterns. Four oligosaccharides containing the Fuc, 1 - 2 Gal group were missing in the milk of non-secretor, and three oligosaccharides containing the Fuc, 1 - 4 GlcNAc group were missing in the milk of Lewis negative individuals. Disappearance of some major oligosaccharides in these samples led to the finding of five novel minor oligosaccharides, which were hidden under the missing oligosaccharides. Following these studies, structures of many novel milk oligosaccharides were elucidated. At least 13 core oligosaccharides were found in these oligosaccharides. By adding,-fucosyl residues and sialic acid residues to these core oligosaccharides, {{more than one hundred}} oligosaccharides were formed. All these oligosaccharides contain lactose at their reducing termini. This evidence, together with the deletion phenomena found in the milk oligosaccharides of non-secretor and Lewis negative individuals, suggested that the oligosaccharides are formed from lactose by the concerted action of glycosyltransferases, which are responsible for elongation and branching of the Gal- 1 - 4 GlcNAc group in the sugar chains of glycoconjugates on the surface of epithelial cells. Therefore, oligosaccharides in human milk could include many structures, starting from the Gal- 1 - 4 GlcNAc group in the sugar chains of various glycoconjugates. Many lines of evidence recently indicated that virulent enteric bacteria and viruses start their infection by binding to particular sugar chains of glycoconjugates on the target cell surfaces. Therefore, milk oligosaccharides could be useful for developing drugs, which inhibit the infection of bacteria and viruses.

40|$|Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) from sucrose, new {{alternative}} sweeteners with functional properties, {{also called}} soluble fibers, {{have a number}} of desirable characteristics such as low calories, no cariogenicity, and safety for diabetics and <b>Bifidus</b> stimulating <b>factor.</b> Fructooligosaccharides are also known as prebiotics, since they stimulate probiotic organisms. The production, as well as the application of food-grade fructooligosaccharides, has increased rapidly during last years. In this work, experimental factorial design has been applied to optimize the fructooligosaccharide synthesis conditions by inulinase from Kluyveromyces marxianus var. bulgaricus. The studied variables were: temperature, pH, sucrose and enzyme concentrations. According to the results, only temperature and sucrose concentrations have shown to be significant parameters. The syntheses of the fructooligosaccharides were carried out on stirred reactor and packed bed reactors, using free and immobilized enzymes, with the best conditions obtained from the experimental design. It has been shown that there is no significant difference between these processes. The final sugar concentrations can be tailor made by varying residence time in the reactor to cope with the different standard needs in food industries. A typical solution product consists of a mixture of fructose (155 g/L), glucose (155 g/L), sucrose (132 g/L) and fructooligosaccharides (50 g/L). These concentrations are suitable for applications in most food industries, in products such as sweets, candies, chocolates and yogurts. Besides, the prebiotic function of fructooligosaccharides as stimulants of the beneficial intestinal flora will give the product a functional and differentiated feature...|$|R
