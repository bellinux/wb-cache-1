5|$|The 4th Siege of Badajoz {{took place}} from July to October 1658 during the Portuguese Restoration War. It {{was an attempt}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> Portuguese army {{under the command of}} Joanne Mendes de Vasconcelos, {{governor}} of Alentejo, to capture the Spanish city of Badajoz, which was the headquarters of the Spanish Army of Extremadura. The fortifications of Badajoz were essentially medieval and considered vulnerable by the Portuguese, and had already been attacked by them three times during this war.|$|E

5|$|Before {{heading out}} of Brazil on a mid-1991 European tour, Sepultura {{performed}} one more concert in São Paulo, the country's largest city. It {{took place at}} Praça Charles Miller (in front of Estádio do Pacaembu), on May 11. Local military police expected 10,000 to attend. 30,000 showed up instead, making crowd management nearly impossible. Six people were hurt, 18 were arrested and one was murdered with an axe. A week before, a young man was stabbed to death at a Ramones concert in São Paulo, during a brawl between headbangers and skinheads. These events were followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> mainstream media backlash throughout the country against rock music.|$|E
5|$|In September 1909, Liberté, Justice, and Vérité {{visited the}} United States for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration.

Later that year, in September, Liberté was destroyed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> explosion in her forward propellant magazines. Several nearby warships were damaged by debris, including the battleship République. The explosion aboard Liberté killed some 250 officers and men. The wreck was left in Toulon until 1925, when it was raised and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin was marked <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{investment in the}} construction of houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of the Dome of the Rock to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The Dome of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E

5|$|The near {{simultaneous}} {{appearance of}} nodosaurids in both North America and Europe {{is worthy of}} consideration, because at the time, they were separated from each other <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> body of water. Europelta is the oldest nodosaurid from Europe; it {{is derived from the}} lower Albian Escucha Formation. The oldest western North American nodosaurid is Sauropelta, from the lower Albian Little Sheep Mudstone Member of the Cloverly Formation, at an age of 108.5±0.2million years. Eastern North American fossils seem older. Teeth of Priconodon crassus have been derived from the Arundel Clay of the Potomac Group of Maryland, which dates near the Aptian–Albian boundary. A Propanoplosaurus hatchling was uncovered {{from the base of the}} underlying Patuxent Formation, dated to the upper Aptian, making Propanoplosaurus the oldest nodosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Bain first played {{competitive}} {{ice hockey}} when he answered a classified ad {{placed in a}} newspaper by the Winnipeg Victorias, who were looking for new players. Though he played with a broken stick held together by wire, Bain made the team only five minutes into the tryout. Bain quickly became a star centre and leader for the Victorias. This was proven during a February 14, 1896 game against the Montreal Victorias for the Stanley Cup, the trophy for the national hockey championship in Canada. It was a 2–0 victory for Winnipeg that gave them the Cup. This victory {{marked the first time}} a team outside of Quebec had won the trophy. The team was greeted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> crowd at the Canadian Pacific Railway station when their train, decorated with hockey sticks and the Union Jack, returned to Winnipeg. They were led to a feast in their honour in a parade of open sleighs, where fans gathered to celebrate the championship.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, a {{scientific}} drilling project drilled {{deep into the}} peak ring of the Chicxulub impact crater, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by immense heat and shocked by immense pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; {{the fact that the}} peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, it originates much deeper in the earth and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact; that gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and must therefore have been almost entirely vaporized and entered the atmosphere, and that the event was immediately followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> megatsunami (a massive movement of sea waters) sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above the peak ring.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, Varanasi {{experienced}} a cultural revival under the Mughal emperor Akbar who patronised the city, and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu, though much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the Maratha and Brahmin kings. The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947. The city {{is governed by}} the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the Parliament of India by the current Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, who won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> margin. Silk weaving, carpets and crafts and tourism employ {{a significant number of}} the local population, as do the Diesel Locomotive Works and Bharat Heavy Electricals. Varanasi Hospital was established in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mercer {{had arrived}} in the trenches, a massive German {{artillery}} bombardment began, heavy calibre shells destroying trenches and caving in dugouts, killing many Canadian soldiers. Mercer was trapped in a dugout and then stunned <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> shell burst which wounded most of his staff and the officers of the battalion he was inspecting. The more badly wounded among the officers were transported to an underground field hospital but Mercer was left behind with wounded aide Captain Lynam Gooderham, and so was not present when the hospital was buried by the explosion of four mines which preceded a large-scale German attack. In the confused situation, Mercer and Gooderham attempted to escape the advancing enemy but inadvertently ran into crossfire, where Mercer's leg was broken by a bullet.|$|E

5|$|The major {{effect of}} the apolipoprotein A5 gene (and its variants) is on plasma {{triglyceride}} levels. Minor alleles (C1131 and Trp19) are primarily associated with the elevation of plasma triglyceride levels. The most extensive information available has been drawn from Caucasian populations, particularly {{in relation to the}} rs662799 SNP. Here, one minor allele is associated with an approximate 0,25mmol/L increase of plasma TG levels. A similar effect is associated with the Trp19 allele, even though it has not been confirmed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> number of studies. Original studies have further described that the strongest effect of APOA5 polymorphisms on plasma TG levels is observed among Hispanics, with only minor effects detected among Africans. Among Asians, the effect on plasma TG levels is similar that found among Caucasians. Generally, studies have suggested significant interethnic differences and in some cases sex-dependent associations as well.|$|E
