5|$|Given the inaccessibility {{of much of}} the species' range, {{particularly}} the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600–1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125–180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km2 (2400-mi2) Calakmul <b>Biosphere</b> <b>Reserve,</b> with another 350 in the state of Chiapas. The adjoining Maya <b>Biosphere</b> <b>Reserve</b> in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000km2 (9,000mi2), may have 465–550 animals. Work employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100km2 in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.|$|E
