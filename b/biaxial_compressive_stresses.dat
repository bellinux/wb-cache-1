40|$|To {{study the}} effect of stress within the thin {{amorphous}} film generated atop Si irradiated by Ar+, we model the film as a viscoelastic medium into which the ion beam continually injects <b>biaxial</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>stress.</b> We find that at normal incidence, the model predicts a steady <b>compressive</b> <b>stress</b> of a magnitude comparable to experiment. However, linear stability analysis at normal incidence reveals that this mechanism of stress generation is unconditionally stabilizing due to a purely kinematic material flow, depending on none of the material parameters. Thus, despite plausible conjectures in the literature as to its potential role in pattern formation, we conclude that beam stress at normal incidence {{is unlikely to be}} a source of instability at any energy, supporting recent theories attributing hexagonal ordered dots to the effects of composition. In addition, we find that the elastic moduli appear in neither the steady film stress nor the leading order smoothening, suggesting that the primary effects of stress can be captured even if elasticity is neglected. This should greatly simplify future analytical studies of highly nonplanar surface evolution, in which the beam-injected stress is considered to be an important effect. ...|$|R

For this purpose, one needs good crystalline ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) semiconductors with high Curie temperatures. Rutile CrO_ 2 is a half-metallic spintronic material with Curie temperature 394 K and can have nearly-full spin polarization at room temperature. Here, we find through first-principles investigation that when a <b>biaxial</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>stress</b> is applied on rutile CrO_ 2, the density of states at the Fermi level decreases with the in-plane compressive strain, there is a structural phase transition to an orthorhombic phase at the strain of - 5. 6 %, and then appears an electronic phase transition to a semiconductor phase at - 6. 1 %. Further analysis shows that this structural transition, accompanying the tetragonal symmetry breaking, is induced by the stress-driven distortion and rotation of the oxygen octahedron of Cr, and the half-metal-semiconductor transition originates from the enhancement of the crystal field splitting due to the structural change. Importantly, our systematic total-energy comparison indicates the ferromagnetic Curie temperature remains almost independent of the strain, near 400 K. This biaxial stress can be realized by applying biaxial pressure or growing the CrO_ 2 epitaxially on appropriate substrates.

This process has recently been robotized by the research institute of Hydro-Québec (IREQ), so the hammer-peening performed {{for this study was}} done {{with the help of a}} Scompi robot. The resulting stresses calculated from the strain measurements were compared with residual stress measurements made with the hole drilling technique. The comparison shows a very good correlation of the two sets of measurements. Residual stress measurements were also made in the hammer-peened zone: as expected we found a highly <b>biaxial</b> <b>compressive</b> state of <b>stress</b> in this zone. An unexpected region of transverse tension was found at the end of the hammer-peened zone. This region can be very critical if hammer-peening is made with the objective of improving fatigue behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} strained FeSe 0. 5 Te 0. 5 superconductor has been investigated from first principles. Our calculation {{results indicate that the}} influence of hydrostatic, <b>biaxial</b> or uniaxial <b>compressive</b> <b>stress</b> on the density of states at the Fermi level is insignificant. The overall shape of the Fermi-surface (FS) nesting function for FeSe 0. 5 Te 0. 5 at ambient pressure resembles that of its parent compound, FeSe, but under the ab-plane compressive strain. In these two systems, changes of their FSs under various stress conditions are qualitatively almost the same. However, in FeSe 0. 5 Te 0. 5 the intensity of the perfect Q=(0. 5, 0. 5) *(2 π/a) nesting vector is more diminished. These findings are in good agreement with former experimental data and support the idea of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity in iron chalcogenides...|$|R
40|$|The {{tunability}} of the exciton {{g factor}} in InGaAs quantum dots using <b>compressive</b> <b>biaxial</b> <b>stress</b> applied by piezoelectric actuators is investigated. We find a clear {{relation between the}} exciton g factor and the applied stress. A linear decrease of the g factor with <b>compressive</b> <b>biaxial</b> strain is observed consistently in all investigated dots. A connection is established between {{the response of the}} exciton g factor to the voltage applied to the piezoelectric actuator and the response of the quantum dot emission energy. We employ a numerical model based on eight-band k⋅p theory to calculate the exciton g factor of a typical dot as a function of strain and a good agreement with our experiments is found. Our calculations reveal that the change in exciton g factor is dominated by the contribution of the valence band and originates from increased heavy hole light hole splitting when applying external stress...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the film stresses that {{develop in the}} polymer films and metal electrodes of poly(3 -hexyl thiophene) (P 3 HT) and [6, 6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells. A <b>compressive</b> <b>biaxial</b> <b>stress</b> of ∼- 36 MPa was measured in PEDOT:PSS while a tensile stress of ∼ 6 MPa was measured in the BHJ layer. We then analyze the effect of electrode deposition rate on the film stresses in the Al electrode. <b>Compressive</b> <b>stresses</b> of ∼- 100 to - 145 MPa in the Al electrode lead to a buckling instability resulting in undulating electrode surface topography. The BHJ layer {{was found to have}} the lowest cohesion (∼ 1. 5 - 1. 8 J/m 2) among the layers of the solar cell and dependent on the Al electrode deposition rate. The cohesive failure path in the BHJ layer exhibited the same periodicity and orientation of the Al electrode buckling topography. We discuss the implications of the film stresses on damage processes during device fabrication and operation. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{directional}} {{crack growth}} prediction in a compressed homogenous elastic isotropic material under plane strain conditions is considered. The {{conditions at the}} parent crack tip are evaluated for a straight stationary crack. Remote load is a combined <b>biaxial</b> <b>compressive</b> normal <b>stress</b> and pure shear. Crack surfaces {{are assumed to be}} frictionless and to remain closed during the kink formation wherefore the mode I stress intensity factor KI is vanishing. Hence the mode II stress intensity factor KII remains as the single stress intensity variable for the kinked crack. An expression for the local mode II stress intensity factor k 2 at the tip of a straight kink has been calculated numerically with an integral equation using the solution scheme proposed by Lo (1978) and refined by He and Hutchinson (1989). The confidence of the solution is strengthened by verifications with a boundary element method and by particular analytical solutions. The expression has been found {{as a function of the}} mode II stress intensity factor KII of the parent crack, the direction and length of the kink, and the difference between the remote <b>compressive</b> normal <b>stresses</b> perpendicular to, and parallel with, the plane of the parent crack. Based on the expression, initial crack growth directions have been suggested. At a sufficiently high non-isotropic <b>compressive</b> normal <b>stress,</b> so that the crack remains closed, the crack is predicted to extend along a curved path that maximizes the mode II stress intensity factor k 2. Only at an isotropic remote <b>compressive</b> normal <b>stress</b> the crack will continue straight ahead without change of the direction. Further, an analysis of the shape of the crack path has revealed that the propagation path is, according the model, required to be described by a function y = cxγ, where the exponent γ is equal to 3 / 2. In that case, when γ = 3 / 2, predicts the analytical model a propagation path that is selfsimilar (i. e. the curvature c is independent of any length of a crack extension), and which can be described by a function of only the mode II stress intensity factor KII at the parent crack tip and the difference between the remote <b>compressive</b> normal <b>stress</b> perpendicular to, and parallel with, the parent crack plane. Comparisons with curved shear cracks in brittle materials reported in literature provide limited support for the model discussed...|$|R
