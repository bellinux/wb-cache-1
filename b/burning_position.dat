40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of low-impact broadcast-burning and disk-trenching planting position (control, hinge, trench) on soil characteristics and lodgepole pine foliar nutrition and growth over two decades at a subboreal site in British Columbia, Canada. Broadcast burning had virtually no effect on either the bulk density or chemical properties of soil. In contrast, significant reductions in soil bulk density and increases in soil nutrient availability persisted for 20 years in hinge position soils relative to undisturbed (control) soil between trenches. These effects on bulk density and nutrient availability are associated with significant differences in pine size by year 6. Burning and planting positions interacted significantly in their effect on pine height, diameter, and stem volume for at least 19 years. Pine survival was high regardless of <b>burning</b> or planting <b>position.</b> Neither broadcast <b>burning</b> nor planting <b>position</b> significantly affected lodgepole pine foliar nutrient status in this study...|$|R

30|$|A gas fired {{radiant panel}} {{inclined}} at 30 ° provides a heat flux gradient to a horizontally oriented specimen (size 1050  mm × 230  mm) of ~ 11  kW m- 2 {{at one end}} of the specimen to less than 1  kW m- 2 at the other end. A pilot flame is applied to the hotter end of the sample to ignite the specimen. The spread of flame along the sample is observed, and is related to the critical heat flux to extinguishment. If after 30  minutes, the specimen is still <b>burning,</b> the <b>position</b> of the flame front at this time is taken as the critical heat flux. As such, a higher critical heat flux indicates improved fire performance as opposed to a lower critical heat flux.|$|R

40|$|The {{time-dependent}} {{correspondence between}} maps of surface brightness temperature derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper data and mapped terrain variables over a tallgrass prairie in northeastern Kansas is examined. Individual terrain variables including burning treatment, vegetation cover type (agriculture, prairie, woody vegetation), hillslope position, and greenness exhibit {{varying degrees of}} association with surface temperature. Burning treatment is most strongly associated with mid-morning surface temperature. Examination of terrain strata based on combinations of terrain variables, notably burning treatment and hillslope position, suggest that terrain variables interact in affecting surface temperature.

2500|$|In 1975, legal scholar John Hart Ely found {{fault with}} O'Brien. He {{pointed out that}} the draft-card-burning {{question}} was not decided in relation to the similar one surrounding the act of flag burning; an issue which the court had avoided for years. Ely's analysis was aided by that of Thomas Scanlon in 1972, in A Theory of Freedom of Expression, which interpreted the freedom of speech broadly, including such public and political acts as self-immolation. In 1990 O'Brien was analyzed again by critics following the case United States v. Eichman which determined that flag burning was a form of free speech, and some made comparisons to the earlier 1984 case Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence which determined that sleeping at a protest rally location in a downtown park was valid as a symbolic expression intended to bring attention to the plight of the homeless. These expansive interpretations of the freedom of speech appeared large enough to include draft-card <b>burning.</b> The <b>position</b> taken in O'Brien was that the individual's right to freedom of speech did not limit the government in prohibiting harmful conduct. However, the harmful conduct of burning a draft card did not have the normal test applied: it was not determined to be a case of [...] "clear and present danger".|$|R
50|$|On {{the first}} day, around 300 of Zapata's {{soldiers}} were killed in {{an attack on the}} town. On May 14, his troops managed to cut the federal troops off from water supplies. The next day, Zapata launched a general assault and had his troops pour gasoline into the empty aqueducts and set them alight. The fire dislodged the soldiers of the Fifth from their excellent <b>positions,</b> <b>burning</b> many of them alive. An empty railroad car which was turned into a bunker, complete with a machine gun nest was also doused with gasoline and set alight burning to death all the federal soldiers inside. Most of the fighting was hand to hand, with machetes and bayonets, and soldiers and rebels often fired at each other at point blank range. No prisoners were taken by either side. In the end, that day's assault was repulsed.|$|R
40|$|The metal-halide (MH) lamp {{shows an}} {{unwanted}} axial non-uniform {{distribution of the}} metal additives when <b>burning</b> in vertical <b>position,</b> which {{is caused by the}} interplay between convection and diffusion. Various MH lamps are investigated by means of emission spectroscopy under varying gravity conditions (1 - 10 g) in a centrifuge. The method yields spectra, axial inhomogeneity parameters and axially integrated intensities. The method is easier than methods used before on the same type of lamp. Measurements on lamps with DyI 3 as salt filling are used as a calibration of the setup. After comparison with the earlier measurements, we conclude that the new emission spectroscopy is valid for characterization of MH lamps. Next, we apply the method on commercial lamps (Philips MASTER CosmoWhite). For these lamps, in addition NaI densities at the wall and axial temperature profiles are obtained by using self-reversed lines of Na and Hg, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Process {{control systems}} of modern EDM-machines offer several {{opportunities}} for gap status detection. The method described {{here is the}} threshold technology at which the voltage course of a discharge can be classified in normal pulses, open circuits, short circuits and arcs by different voltage thresholds in combination with time recording. Especially in arc detection a new path will be treated by using a <b>burning</b> voltage threshold <b>positioned</b> slight below the effective burning voltage of a normal discharge. Its determination depending mainly from the electrode/workpiece material combination and the adjusted amperage will be described in detail. Moreover a fuzzy gap width control system will be established only based on the relative number of open and short circuits ascertained within a time period. Also {{in this case the}} threshold technology will be applied. This gets completed by a neural network. The efficiency of the different systems will be demonstrated at roughing and smoothing experiments in comparison to a ignition-delay-time (td) – based solution...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 95 - 102). In this study, I explored {{factors that}} influence forest colonization in a South African savanna. I used a 50 year fire experiment in the Kruger National Park to explore patterns of forest colonization in a mesic Terminalia sericea savanna. I studied woody seedling and sapling distribution in relation to different burning treatments, including no <b>burning,</b> and microsite <b>position</b> - in the open or under the canopy of tall trees. The study showed that species richness and abundance was greatest under Sclerocarya birrea, low under Terminalia sericea and lowest in the open habitats. Low fire frequency increased species richness and abundance under S. biirea, but not under T. sericea or the open habitats. Fire sensitive or fire-intolerant species were highest under tree canopies on unburnt and triennial burn plots, whereas frequently burnt (annual or biennial) plots, had fire tolerant and typical savanna species. Frequent burning reduced woody plant biomass by killing seedlings, saplings and adult trees. Fire exclusion led to a higher seedling and sapling recruitment under S. birrea and T. sericea than open habitats...|$|R
40|$|Sampling {{design is}} {{critical}} in locating ground sampling stations for large-scale climatological field experiments. In the stratified sampling design adopted for the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE), the study region was stratified into 14 different terrain units based on land use/land cover and topographic variables that were hypothe-sized {{to have a strong}} influence on surface biophysical properties. Digital terrain maps were produced to facilitate ground data integration and extrapolation. This paper describes the biophysical stratifi-cation of the FIFE site, implementation of the stratification using geographic information system (GIS) techniques, and validation of the stratification with respect to field measurements of biomass, soil moisture, Bowen ratio (/ 3), and the greenness vegetation index (GVI) derived from thematic mapper satellite data. Maps of <b>burning</b> and topographic <b>position</b> were significantly associated with variation in biomass, GVI, and / 3. The effects of burning and topography were stronger for the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research (KPLTER) site than {{for the rest of the}} FIFE site, where cattle grazing was a major confounding effect. The stratified design did not appreciably change the estimated site-wide means for surface climate parameters but accounted for between 25 and 45 % of the sample variance depending on the variable. The design was weakened by undersampling of several strata, b...|$|R
40|$|Aims. Our aim is {{to study}} {{deuterium}} burning in objects forming according to the core accretion scenario in the hot and cold start assumption and what minimum deuterium burning mass limit is found for these objects. We also study how the burning process influences the structure and luminosity of the objects. Furthermore we want to test and verify our results by comparing them to already existing hot start simulations which did not consider, however, the formation process. Methods. We present a new method to calculate deuterium burning of objects in a self-consistently coupled model of planet formation and evolution. We discuss which theory is {{used to describe the}} process of deuterium burning and how it was implemented. Results. We find that the objects forming according to a hot start scenario behave approximately {{in the same way as}} found in previous works of evolutionary calculations, which did not consider the formation. However, for cold start objects one finds that the objects expand during deuterium burning instead of being partially stabilized against contraction. In both cases, hot and cold start, the mass of the solid core has an influence on the minimum mass limit of deuterium <b>burning.</b> The general <b>position</b> of the mass limit, 13 MJ, stays however approximately the same. None of the investigated parameters was able to change this mass limit by more than 0. 8 MJ. Due to deuterium burning, the luminosity of hot and cold start objects becomes comparable after ~ 200 Myrs. Comment: Accepted to A&A.
