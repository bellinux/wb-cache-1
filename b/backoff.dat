2500|$|The search service {{consists}} of several components, including the Gatherer, the Merger, the <b>Backoff</b> Controller, and the Query Processor, among others. The Gatherer retrieves {{the list of}} URIs {{that need to be}} crawled and invokes proper protocol handler to access the store that hosts the URI, and then the proper property-handler (to extract metadata) and IFilter to extract the document text. Different indices are created during different runs; it is the job of the Merger to periodically merge the indices. While indexing, the indices are generally maintained in-memory and then flushed to disk after a merge to reduce disk I/O. The metadata is stored in property store, which is a database maintained by the ESE database engine. The text is tokenized and the tokens are stored in a custom database built using Inverted Indices. Apart from the indices and property store, another persistent data structure is maintained: the Gather Queue. The Gather Queue maintains a prioritized queue of URIs that needs indexing.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} a small, stable backlog at the router buffer, active queue management (AQM) algorithms drop packets probabilistically {{at the onset of}} congestion, leading to <b>backoffs</b> by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) flows. However, wireless losses may be misinterpreted as congestive losses and induce spurious <b>backoffs.</b> In this paper, we raise the basic question: Can AQM maintain a stable, small backlog under wireless losses? We find that the representative AQM, random early detection (RED), fails to maintain a stable backlog under time-varying wireless losses. We find that the key to resolving the problem is to robustly track the backlog to a preset reference level, and apply the control-theoretic vehicle, internal model principle, to realize such tracking. We further devise the integral controller (IC) as an embodiment of the principle. Our simulation results show that IC is robust against time-varying wireless losses under various network scenarios. © 2012 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

30|$|Figure 8 (b) {{depicts the}} {{measured}} packet loss rate. We observe {{that with the}} same BO value, a larger MaxNB {{can lead to a}} lower packet loss rate. On the other hand, with the same MaxNB, a smaller BO yields a higher packet loss rate. The reason for this phenomenon is that a larger MaxNB means a larger number of CSMA <b>backoffs,</b> resulting in more packets that can be transmitted successfully. In addition, a lower BO implies that beacons become more frequent. This is because the probability of packet collision becomes higher {{at the beginning of a}} new superframe.|$|R

30|$|Figure 4 (c) {{shows the}} {{measured}} {{end to end}} delay. We can see that when the packet generation interval is less than 1 [*]s, the end-to-end delay grows significantly with increasing number of transmitters. The {{reason for this is}} that for smaller packet generation intervals, the traffic load grows significantly as the number of transmitters increases. As a result, the competition of channel access is fierce and more <b>backoffs</b> and retransmissions are needed. On the other hand, when the packet generation interval is 1 [*]s or 10 [*]s, the end-to-end delay is close to zero and changes hardly as the number of transmitters increases.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Due {{to their}} {{embedding}} into an unknown environment, {{wireless sensor networks}} are susceptible to adverse environmental conditions. A prime example is external interference, typically caused by 802. 11, electric devices or co-located sensor networks, which can drastically influence communication performance. However, radios on sensor nodes provide multiple channels, which can help to alleviate interference problems on a particular channel. In this work, we introduce Chamaeleon, a novel lean, cross-layer protocol extension that helps to overcome external interference problems. Chamaeleon switches an affected set of nodes to a new channel if the need arises based on key network parameters e. g., packet loss and channel <b>backoffs.</b> We present Chamaeleon, detail its TinyOS implementation, and evaluate its performance in diverse scenarios.

40|$|Disruptions in {{end-to-end}} path connectivity, {{which last}} longer than one retransmission timeout, cause suboptimal TCP performance. The reason for this performance degradation is that TCP interprets segment loss induced by long connectivity disruptions {{as a sign of}} congestion, resulting in repeated retransmission timer <b>backoffs.</b> This, in turn, leads to a delayed detection of the re-establishment of the connection since TCP waits for the next retransmission timeout before it attempts a retransmission. This document proposes an algorithm to make TCP more robust to long connectivity disruptions (TCP-LCD). It describes how standard ICMP messages can be exploited during timeout-based loss recovery to disambiguate true congestion loss from non-congestion loss caused by connectivity disruptions.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{performance}} of the ALOHA and CSMA MAC protocols are analyzed in spatially distributed wireless networks. The main system objective is correct reception of packets, and thus the analysis is performed in terms of outage probability. In our network model, packets belonging to specific transmitters arrive randomly in space and time according to a 3 -D Poisson point process, and are then transmitted to their intended destinations using a fully-distributed MAC protocol. A packet transmission is considered successful if the received SINR is above a predefined threshold {{for the duration of the}} packet. Accurate bounds on the outage probabilities are derived as a function of the transmitter density, the number of <b>backoffs</b> and retransmissions, and in the case of CSMA, also the sensing threshold.
