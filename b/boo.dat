5|$|Canada's Wonderland's first {{interactive}} dark {{ride was}} Scooby-Doo's Haunted Mansion (renamed <b>Boo</b> Blasters on <b>Boo</b> Hill after Cedar Fair's {{purchase of the}} park), which opened in 2000. It was designed by Sally Corporation and relies entirely on physical sets and theming rather than projected animations, and uses basic, moving props. About four years later, park management began discussing {{the addition of a}} new attraction inside Wonder Mountain. The technology available at the time meant the cost of building a more advanced dark ride was too expensive for a regional amusement park. In 2011, as technology improved and the costs decreased, the park started planning a second interactive dark ride. Several companies were contacted to design the audio-visual portion of the future ride; park management chose Triotech to do so.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Big <b>Boo</b> and Doggett's {{friendship}} continues to develop. Seeing that Doggett bears strong {{feelings of guilt}} relating to the six abortions that she has had, Big <b>Boo</b> makes reference to the book Freakonomics, which suggests that crime rates in the 1990s fell because of Roe v. Wade. Following Lorna Morello (played by Yael Stone) being relieved of her duty of driving the prison van, the role is given to Doggett. She comes into contact {{with one of the}} new correctional officers called Charlie Coates (played by James McMenamin). Coates is initially friendly towards Doggett. Despite relationships between prison staff and prisoners being forbidden, Coates kisses Doggett, against her will, after feeding some ducks. Following another outing, Coates gets in trouble with his boss Joe Caputo (played by Nick Sandow) for being late for count and is placed on probation. Doggett apologises for having caused him trouble, and he rapes her {{in the back of the}} prison van.|$|E

5|$|Nine power-ups each supply Mario with {{a special}} costume that grants him {{temporary}} abilities. For example, special mushrooms bestow the player with a Bee, <b>Boo,</b> or Spring Suit. The Bee Suit allows Mario to temporarily hover through the air, climb special walls, and walk on clouds and flowers; the <b>Boo</b> Suit allows him to float through the air, as well as become transparent and move through certain obstacles; and the Spring Suit allows him to jump to high areas that would be otherwise inaccessible, yet lowering his mobility. The recurring Fire Flower allows Mario to throw fireballs at enemies, and the newly introduced Ice Flower allows Mario to create hexagonal tiles of ice to cover any liquid surface he walks on. The Rainbow Star grants Mario invincibility, allowing him to destroy any enemies that he touches, {{as well as being}} able to run faster.|$|E

5000|$|In 2007, {{documentary}} director Murray Lerner {{released on}} DVD his complete footage of Dylan's three appearances at Newport: The Other Side of the Mirror: Bob Dylan Live at the Newport Folk Festival 1963-1965. When interviewed by Mojo magazine, Lerner was asked: [...] "There’s {{been a lot}} of debate over the years as to who exactly was doing the <b>booing</b> and who were they <b>booing?</b> Dylan? The organizers? The shortness of the set?" [...] Lerner replied: [...] "It's a good question. When we showed the film at The New York Film Festival October 2007 one kid gets up and says, 'About this <b>booing...</b> I was sitting {{right in front of the}} stage, there was no <b>booing</b> in the audience whatsoever. There was <b>booing</b> from the performers'. So I said, Well, I don't think you're right. Then another kid gets up and says 'I was a little further back and it was the press section that was <b>booing,</b> not the audience', and I said, Well, I don't think you're right. A third guy gets up and says 'I was there, and there was no question, it was the audience that was <b>booing</b> and there was no <b>booing</b> from the stage'. It was fascinating. People remember hearing what they thought they should hear. I think they were definitely <b>booing</b> Dylan and a little bit Pete Yarrow because he was so flustered. He was not expecting that audience's reaction and he was concerned about Bob’s image, since they were part of the same family of artists through Al Grossman. But I absolutely think that they were <b>booing</b> Dylan going electric." ...|$|R
50|$|Haemanthus amarylloides Jacq. is an endemic South African {{bulbous plant}} first {{described}} in 1804 by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin from specimens {{sent to the}} Schönbrunn Palace gardens by the collectors <b>Boos</b> and Scholl.

5000|$|... 2015 - Adam Goodes during matches played outside Sydney was {{constantly}} <b>booed</b> by spectators. It was suggested that Goodes was <b>booed</b> {{as a result}} of an incident in 2013 with a 13-year-old girl who called him an ape, comments made during his 2014 Australian of the Year award and the way he plays and stages for free kicks. After the match between the Sydney Swans and the West Coast Eagles at Domain Stadium, Goodes stepped down from playing as he believed the sustained <b>booing</b> had racist overtones. Whilst there were several commentators arguing that the <b>booing</b> was not due to racism, the AFL community including clubs and players and political and community leaders stated that the <b>booing</b> had cease as it was racist.|$|R

She is replaced as prison van driver by another inmate, Maritza Ramos (played by Diane Guerrero).|$|E
5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures {{for this}} section of the park, as well as some smaller works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management decided they liked it enough for it to be a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, <b>Boo</b> Boo's Buggys, an ice cream cone, and for a popcorn counter.|$|E

5|$|During a {{game against}} the Canucks on March 8, 2004, Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado's Steve Moore from behind, leaving Moore unconscious. It was said to be {{retaliation}} for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before. Because of the punch and the consequent fall on the ice with Bertuzzi on top of him, and numerous other players from both teams piling on top, Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries, that ended his career. Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions. In Denver, ever since the Moore hit, it has become tradition for the home fans to <b>boo</b> Todd Bertuzzi every time he gains possession of the puck, whenever his team faces the Avalanche at Pepsi Center.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can choose}} from a cast of 20 playable drivers divided in 10 pairs.

50|$|Over the {{following}} years, {{and particularly in}} 2015, Goodes was repeatedly and loudly <b>booed</b> by opposition fans at most matches. The motivation for and acceptability of the <b>booing</b> generated wide public debate, which dominated media coverage from both sports and political commentators {{for weeks at a}} time during the year, and even drew comment from then Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Many considered the <b>booing</b> to be unacceptable and motivated by racism—either because those <b>booing</b> felt affronted by his race or by the strong political positions Goodes had taken on racial issues—and called on the AFL to take direct action to stop it. Others defended the rights of fans to continue <b>booing</b> as a show of disapproval for Goodes' actions, including a perception that his approach in dealing with the Collingwood fan who called him an ape was heavy-handed, and for statements he had made during his time as Australian of the Year which had been seen to denigrate the history of European settlement of Australia. The <b>booing</b> of Goodes has also been described as a symptom of tall poppy syndrome.|$|R
