40|$|Abstract—A new {{technique}} for designing digital linear-phase FIR crossover systems for loudspeakers is proposed. The approach {{is based on}} the principle of vector space projections. We describe the constraint sets and their projections that capture the properties of the desired crossover filters. The proposed approach is capable of designing crossover networks for multiple <b>bandsplitting</b> as well as for equalization. Designs that demonstrate the advantages and flexibility of this method are furnished...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this {{contribution}} a new {{combination of}} methods for noise and artifact reduction is presented. The new noise reduction system has successfully {{been applied to}} magnetic resonace tomography (MRT) sequences. For this purpose a system {{which is based on}} a nonlinear <b>bandsplitting</b> has been elaborated and optimized. In order to cope with motion artifacts and with ghosting effects, the motion detection is performed in only one of the resulting nonlinear subbands where noise, ghosting effects and objects can be effectively differentiated. This motion information is applied then to adjust the coefficients of subsequent recursive filtering processes. Furthermore, a coring is applied in each subband. The new system has been applied to a variety of MRT test sequences and yields a good noise and artifact reduction which is evaluated by Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) gains over a wide range of input SNRs. In this application, the new approach outperforms classical noise reduction techniques and achieves Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio gains of up to 7 dB for typical input sequences. Additionally, an implementation study has been performed in order to compare different implementation alternatives for this new method. Keywords — magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), image quality enhancement, motion adaptive noise reduction, nonlinear filter bank I...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} analog speech encryption algorithms. It focuses specifically on schemes which are able to be used over narrowband communication channels, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network. The performance of the devices studied is evaluated according to three criteria. The scrambled speech derived from the encryption algorithm must have a low residual intelligibility. The encryption and decryption processes should have a minimal effect {{on the quality of}} the speech recovered by the intended recipient. Finally, the scrambler must be secure from cryptanalytic attack. Time domain, frequency domain and combined time and frequency domain scrambling procedures are considered initially. A review of their respective advantages and disadvantages is included which aims to facilitate the development of improved speech security systems. Original methods for the cryptanalysis of time element and frequency domain <b>bandsplitting</b> scramblers are presented. These attacks are applicable when the cryptanalyst has access to the scrambled speech only. In particular a novel cryptanalytic procedure is introduced which exploits the redundancy of speech using a frequency domain vector codebook. Attacks are also described which utilise plaintext with corresponding ciphertext to recover the encryption permutations used in the encryption process. It is shown that the two scramblers examined, are extremely vulnerable to the proposed cryptanalytic techniques...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an adaptive multi rate wideband (AMR-WB) speech codec {{proposed for the}} GSM system and also for the evolving Third Generation (3 G) mobile speech services. The coder is a multi rate SB-CELP (Subband-Code-Excited Linear Prediction) with five modes operating at bit rates from 24 kbit/s down to 9. 1 kbit/s. Our basic approach consists of an unequal <b>bandsplitting</b> of the input signal into two subbands (SB). A variable rate, multi-mode ACELP coder {{is applied to the}} lower subband (0 - 6 kHz). The various bit rates are integrated in a common structure where the scalability is realized by exchanging the fixed excitation codebooks while leaving all other codec parameters invariant. For the GSM re-lated modes (9. 1 - 17. 8 kbit/s), the upper subband (6 - 7 kHz) is coded using a very low bit rate representation based on bandwidth expansion techniques. In case of the 3 G application (24 kbit/s) the upper band is coded using a 4 kbit/s ADPCM coding scheme. In addition the analysis by synthesis (AbS) coder of the lower band employs a novel closed loop gain re-quantization technique controlled by the character of the speech signal. Thereby the codec achieves an enhanced performance for background noise while maintaining its clean speech quality. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{progress}} on compression of video sequences is discussed. The overall {{goal of the}} research was the development of data compression algorithms for high-definition television (HDTV) sequences, but most of our research is general enough to be applicable to much more general problems. We have concentrated on coding algorithms based on both sub-band and transform approaches. Two very fundamental issues arise in designing a sub-band coder. First, {{the form of the}} signal decomposition must be chosen to yield band-pass images with characteristics favorable to efficient coding. A second basic consideration, whether coding is to be done in two or three dimensions, is the form of the coders to be applied to each sub-band. Computational simplicity is of essence. We review the first portion of the year, during which we improved and extended some of the previous grant period's results. The pyramid nonrectangular sub-band coder limited to intra-frame application is discussed. Perhaps the most critical component of the sub-band structure is the design of <b>bandsplitting</b> filters. We apply very simple recursive filters, which operate at alternating levels on rectangularly sampled, and quincunx sampled images. We will also cover the techniques we have studied for the coding of the resulting bandpass signals. We discuss adaptive three-dimensional coding which takes advantage of the detection algorithm developed last year. To this point, all the work on this project has been done without the benefit of motion compensation (MC). Motion compensation is included in many proposed codecs, but adds significant computational burden and hardware expense. We have sought to find a lower-cost alternative featuring a simple adaptation to motion {{in the form of the}} codec. In sequences of high spatial detail and zooming or panning, it appears that MC will likely be necessary for the proposed quality and bit rates...|$|E
