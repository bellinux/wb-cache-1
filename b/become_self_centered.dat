30|$|In {{this paper}} {{the idea of}} strong sum {{distance}} which is a metric, in a fuzzy graph is introduced. Based on this metric the concepts of eccentricity, radius, diameter, <b>center</b> and <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> fuzzy graphs are studied. Some properties of eccentric nodes, peripheral nodes and central nodes are obtained. A characterisation of <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> complete fuzzy graph is obtained and conditions under which a fuzzy cycle is <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> are established. We have proved that based on this metric, an eccentric node of a fuzzy tree G is a fuzzy end node of G and a node is an eccentric node of a fuzzy tree {{if and only if}} it is a peripheral node of G and the center of a fuzzy tree consists of either one or two neighboring nodes. The concepts of boundary nodes and interior nodes in a fuzzy graph based on strong sum distance are introduced. Some properties of boundary nodes, interior nodes and complete nodes are studied.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we are characterizing the {{different}} types of graphs based on the value of DRI of each vertex and degree of graph. Here the degree of graph means the maximum degree. The DRI of each vertex has some specific properties for some basic class of graphs. For example if graph is of degree 2 and the DRI sequence then the graph is a path. Using these observations we can determine the class of graph. Some classes that are covered in this paper are complete graphs, paths, cycles, star graphs, <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> and almost <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> graphs...|$|R

In the case of illiterate respondents they require 100 % conformity values with not at all emphasize on <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> achievement.

The Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ) and Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) were used for measuring variables. Data normality was analysid via Kolmogrove- Smirnove test. Kronback used for Questionnaires validity testing. Pearson correlation coefficient used for determining relationship between Goal Orientations and Athletic Burnout.

The concepts of eccentricity, radius, diameter, <b>center,</b> <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> f-graphs etc. are studied using this metric.

A necessary and sufficient condition for all paths in a CFG with n≥ 3 to be strongest paths is obtained.

We have proved that based on this metric, an eccentric node of a fuzzy tree G is a fuzzy end node of G and a node is an eccentric node of a fuzzy tree if and only if it is a peripheral node of G and the center of a fuzzy tree consists of either one or two neighboring nodes. The concepts of boundary nodes and interior nodes in a fuzzy graph based on strong sum distance are introduced. Some properties of boundary nodes, interior nodes and complete nodes are studied.|$|R

30|$|Section 2 {{contains}} preliminaries and {{in section}} 3, strong sum distance in fuzzy graphs is defined and proved {{that it is}} a metric. Based on this metric, eccentricity, radius, diameter, center in fuzzy graphs are defined. Necessary conditions for a fuzzy graph to be <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> are obtained in this section. By an example it is shown that a unique eccentric node fuzzy graph with each node eccentric need not be <b>self</b> <b>centered.</b> Sufficient conditions for a fuzzy cycle to be <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> is given in section 4. A necessary and sufficient condition for a complete fuzzy graph to be <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> is given in section 5. In section 6 we have the embedding theorem i.e; construction of fuzzy graph G from a given fuzzy graph H such that <C(G)> ≅H. In section 7, based on this metric it is proved that an eccentric node of a fuzzy tree G is a fuzzy end node of G and a node is an eccentric node of a fuzzy tree if and only if it is a peripheral node of G and the center of a fuzzy tree consists of either one or two neighboring nodes. In section 8 boundary node of a fuzzy graph based on strong sum distance is defined. Boundary nodes of fuzzy tree and complete fuzzy graph are discussed in this section. A complete node is defined and it is showed by an example that a complete node need not be a boundary node. Also an example to show that fuzzy cut node can be a boundary node is given in this section. Interior of a fuzzy graph based on strong sum distance is defined in Section 9. In a fuzzy graph there are nodes which are neither boundary nodes nor interior nodes. Interior node in complete fuzzy graph and boundary nodes in a cycle are also discussed in this section.|$|R
