5|$|Kripke was {{developing}} the concept {{for ten years}} before it was greenlit as a television series. <b>Before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> filmed, the script underwent numerous revisions. The episode was produced in Los Angeles, though future episodes were filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, to save money. The episode established the series' tradition of a rock-music soundtrack, and included background music scored by Kripke's friend Christopher Lennertz. It received mixed reviews, with critics praising the horror elements but having varying opinions of the lead actors' performances.|$|E
5|$|The CSBS and the {{improved}} version, the Mk. X were insufficient, as both were {{too large to}} easily stabilize. Because {{of the way it}} was built, the Automatic Bomb Sight could be equipped with a stabilizer but it was estimated that it would be some time <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> modified and brought into production. The Norden did offer stabilization but it also required relatively long setup times and was still not available for purchase.|$|E

However, in 2007 the CPHC revised the four rotating lists of tropical cyclone names and replaced the name Io with Iona <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used. Iwa was the first retired hurricane in the Central Pacific since the modern system of using Hawaiian naming began in the early 1980s, and it remains one of only four to be retired as of 2015.|$|E

5|$|The {{final month}} of the war offered little respite to the battalion. In {{the days leading up}} to the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the Liverpool Scottish helped to secure {{numerous}} villages without opposition and crossed the River Scheldt on 9 November. On the day of the Armistice, the Liverpool Scottish was situated at Villers-Notre-Dame. With the 165th and 166th brigades, the battalion had been readied to assault German positions obstructing passage into the town of Ath. Such a prospect was averted, however, when the 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers attacked and seized one of the bridges <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> demolished.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. <b>Before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|The lancers {{advanced}} {{from the}} east onto the ridge overlooking Beit Hanun, and despite meeting considerable resistance, captured the position. In the process, they secured twenty-three prisoners, some artillery pieces and a large quantity of ammunition. They also captured the town's water pumping machinery intact, but were forced to withdraw back to Jebaliye for water as the equipment ran on gas made from charcoal, {{which had to be}} converted <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|E

5|$|The {{residential}} college Bruce Hall {{was named}} in his honour, and he remained {{active in the}} life of the university until his retirement from the position in 1961. Bruce sat as director on many corporate boards in retirement, notably the National Bank of Australia, P and the National Mutual Life Association. In 1947 he became the first Australian to sit in the House of Lords (Sir John Forrest had been granted a peerage but died <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> invested).|$|E
5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{launched}} in late 1921, {{but the first}} ship, , was cancelled {{in accordance with the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> completed, and was used in experiments testing the effectiveness of its armor scheme before being scuttled in the Bungo Channel. The hull of the second ship, , was converted into an aircraft carrier of the same name. The carrier supported Japanese troops in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War of the late 1930s, and took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin, Australia, during the Dutch East Indies campaign. She was sunk during the Battle of Midway in 1942.|$|E

40|$|Laparoscopic {{assisted}} {{vaginal hysterectomy}} {{has changed the}} face of gynecologic surgery. Unfortunately it became a "standard" procedure <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> adequately <b>be</b> studied. Therefore most studies are either descriptive or a retrospective comparison to abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy is not a substitute for vaginal hysterectomy. It should be used to convert an abdominal procedure, to one which can be performed vaginally. Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy may have a place in gynecologic surgery if selected wisely...|$|R

5|$|During the US {{invasion}} of Saipan in June 1944, Japanese troop ships attempting {{to reinforce the}} defenses were sunk by submarines. Shigenori Kami, chief of operations of the Navy Staff, volunteered to command Yamashiro to carry troops and equipment to Saipan. If the ship actually reached the island, he intended to deliberately beach the ship <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> sunk and to use its artillery to defend the island. After Ryūnosuke Kusaka, Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet, also volunteered to go, Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō approved the plan, known as Operation Y-GO, but the operation was cancelled after the decisive defeat in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt {{started to}} push for {{improvements}} to U.S. coins, and arranged for the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign coins which could be changed under the 1890 act. Before his death in 1907, the sculptor provided designs for the double eagle and eagle, though the double eagle required adjustment by Barber to lower the relief <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> released as a circulating coin. Redesign of the smaller gold pieces, Lincoln cent, and Buffalo nickel followed between 1908 and 1913. By then, the dime, quarter, and half dollar were the only coins being struck which had not received a redesign in the 20th century. As the 1916 date approached when the Barber coins could be changed without an act of Congress, calls for a new design increased.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not long}} before the PVA 173rd Regiment {{attacked}} the western and the southern perimeter, while the 172nd Regiment struck the hills on the northern perimeter. Despite the preparations, the understrength garrison was overwhelmed, with the Chinese opening several gaps in the defenses and reaching the rear areas. The resulting chaos, however, caused a breakdown in discipline among the Chinese soldiers, who began looting food and clothing instead of exploiting the situation. The defending Americans managed to destroy the Chinese forces in counterattacks, while a breakdown of communications between the Chinese regiments allowed the gaps to close. When the fighting stopped, the Chinese had only gained the East Hill on the northern perimeter. Another attack was planned for the night of 29 November, but air raids by VMF-542 broke up the Chinese formations <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> carried out.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, Lamborghini sent an LM002 {{to a team}} of {{engineers}} {{with the intention of}} making it capable of participating in the Paris Dakar Rally. They stripped it of all unnecessary weight and gave it an upgraded suspension, engine modifications which brought it to , full roll cage, plexiglas windows, and GPS equipment.

5|$|On 20 October, Bazaine's {{infantry}} conducted reconnaissance toward Kherson and met no organized resistance before withdrawing. After {{they returned}} to Kinburn, the French and British commanders determined that the fort could be rebuilt and held through the upcoming winter. A force of 1,700 men was left behind to garrison the position, along with the three ironclad batteries. The rest of the force returned to the Crimea. Though the British had initially considered continuing up the Dneiper to capture Nikolaev, it became clear after the seizure of Kinburn that {{to do so would}} require much larger numbers of soldiers to clear the cliffs that dominated the river than had been originally estimated. The British planned to eventually launch an offensive to take Nikolaev in 1856, but the war ended <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> begun.|$|E
5|$|Teachers {{continued}} to be trained at the college (officially called the Chichester Diocesan Training College for Schoolmistresses) until 1939. As World War II approached, the institution closed and the building was auctioned; but <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> sold, the Royal Engineers requisitioned it for their use during wartime. They {{used it as a}} base for their operations, then after the war it became their archives and records office. In 1987, they moved out, and the vacant building was threatened with demolition. A local campaign helped it receive listed status, offering a degree of protection, and the building's future was secured when it was bought and converted into a complex of serviced offices. It opened in November 1988 as the Brighton Business Centre, and was later renamed the Brighton Forum.|$|E
5|$|The Army was {{nonetheless}} overruled by Hitler, {{who had a}} long-standing preference for huge, grandiose constructions. He preferred fixed installations {{along the lines of}} the virtually impregnable U-boat pens that had been built to protect Germany's U-boat fleet. In March 1943, he ordered the construction of a massive bunker (now known as the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques) in the Forest of Éperlecques near Watten, north of Saint-Omer. The bunker was soon spotted by Allied reconnaissance, and on 27 August 1943, a raid by 187 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers wrecked the construction site <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> completed. A surviving portion was reused by the Germans as a LOX production facility.|$|E
50|$|Both {{theories}} find part {{of their}} inspiration in the theories of Jean-Philippe Rameau, starting with his Traité d'harmonie of 1722. Even if the concept of harmonic function was not so named <b>before</b> 1893, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> shown to exist, explicitly or implicitly, in many theories of harmony before that date. Early usages of the term in music (not necessarily in the sense implied here, or only vaguely so) include those by Fétis (Traité complet de la théorie et de la pratique de l'harmonie, 1844), Durutte (Esthétique musicale, 1855), Loquin (Notions élémentaires d'harmonie moderne, 1862), etc.|$|R
