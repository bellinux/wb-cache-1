The production rate of the vendor is assumed fixed and the demand rate of the buyer is assumed to take some general form and is a function of time. It is shown that for a fixed number of replenishment schedules, n, the optimal times of ordering are unique and can be found as a solution of some system of nonlinear equations. These in turn give the optimal order quantities of the buyer in each period. Moreover, the optimal value function is shown to be convex in n...|$|R

We show that this policy can be computed easily. We can use this to evaluate any discount schedule characterized by a set of (price discount, minimum commitment) pairs. 1...|$|R

Second, FCC ownership rules at the time did not allow a new owner outside of broadcasting - General Electric was a manufacturer - to own both radio and television stations in the same market.

5000|$|Park {{is one of}} {{the most}} in-demand faces in both the Philippines and South Korea, having {{appeared}} in many TV commercials and print ads over the course of her career. Park's huge popularity led to her instantly signing many Philippine and foreign endorsement deals ranging from personal care and food products to everyday items at the end of the competition. Her first endorsement was for Dong-A pens. Along with other Star Circle Quest finalists, Park modeled for and endorsed BNY Jeans in 2004. She served as the face for Tekki Asian Classic Noodles, and helped promote Canon, a Japanese camera brand looking to solidify their power in the Philippines. She endorsed Confident feminine napkins, and Rejoice shampoo as well. In addition to the shampoo's advertisements, Park also contributed a single to go along with the brand. [...] Park also campaigned for Maxi-Peel with Kristine Hermosa. Following the revival of her career as a member of 2NE1, Sandara endorsed high-profile local brands without the group. In 2009, she became the endorsement model for Oriental Brewery's Cass beer series, one of Korea's most famous alcoholic beverages, alongside actor Lee Min-ho. To help promote the beer, an accompanying music video and song was released to nationwide attention. While promoting alongside 2NE1 for an endorsement deal with Mitsubishi's subsidiary Nikon Corporation, Park was solely chosen to become their main model for their new product Nikon Coolpix p300 camera. Dongkook Kim, brand manager of Nikon Korea, stated that signing her would increase their products [...] "attractiveness", and motivate buyers to purchase their items. After her campaign debuted, the company reported a massive increase in sales that put them only behind Samsung, the largest business conglomerate in South Korea, for the year of 2012. The company named the camera after her, going by the official name of [...] "Sandara Digicam". Park is also well known for endorsing makeup brands. Despite having already worked with Etude House in 2010 alongside her group, the makeup brand sought to continue with her for an additional two years with the belief that her image would be a [...] "good influence" [...] to potential <b>buyers.</b> <b>Over</b> the course of her endorsement with Etude, the brand was able to compete with popular local makeup companies and were launched to international success. An umbrella called Sweet Bunny was made available online and in stores to be given to buyers who paid for a certain amount of items. The limited special not only increased Etude House's sales, but also attracted a foreign consumer base who, moments after Park was seen holding the item, visited the South Korean stores specifically to purchase the umbrella, where it was bought in every color. In a week, Etude House sold over 40,000 of the umbrellas, ultimately selling out the product. A representative described the reactions of the public as [...] "surprising". The makeup brand won several web awards for their achievements in marketing, services and makeup as well. In 2013, Sandara became the new makeup model for Clio, a well-established makeup company founded in 1993. Immediately after, sites recorded increased sales and her 'bloody series' makeup became a top-seller. The following year, the company's new mascara, Salon de Cara, was launched with Park as its model and sold out 130,000 units of its initial stock nationwide in only three weeks. The mascara went on to sell a record-breaking 300,000 units in the months following. A fansigning event was held on the 14 of November as a thank you to the buyers. Clio then closed the year with 4 awards, 3 of which were modeled by Park.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of the {{transparency}} of an outside option in bilateral bargaining. A seller posts prices to screen a <b>buyer</b> <b>over</b> time, and the buyer may receive an outside option at a random time. We consider two information regimes, one in which the arrival of the outside option is public and one in which the arrival is private. The public arrival of the outside option works as a commitment device that forces the buyer to opt out immediately. The Coase conjecture holds in the unique equilibrium. In contrast, private information about the outside option leads to additional delay and multiplicity. The Coase conjecture fails in some equilibria. The buyer’s preference about transparency is time-inconsistent: Ex ante, she prefers public arrivals, but ex post she prefers not to disclose her outside option if it is private...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{approach}} to government’s vendor selection decisions in major public procurements. A key challenge is for government purchasing agents to select vendors that deliver the best combination of desired non-price attributes at realistic funding levels. The mechanism proposed in this paper is a multiattribute first price, sealed bid procurement auction. It extends traditional price-only auctions to one in which competition takes place exclusively over attribute bundles. The model is a multiattribute auction in which a set of possible budget levels is specified. This model reveals the benefits of defining a procurement alternative in terms of its value to the <b>buyer</b> <b>over</b> a range of possible expenditures, rather than as a single point in budget-value space. This new approach leads to some interesting results. In particular, it suggests that in a fiscally constrained environment, the traditional approach of eliminating dominated alternatives could lead to sub-optimal decisions. Finally, an extension of the model explicitly examines the buyer’s decision problem under budget uncertainty by applying a utility function assessed over the value measure...|$|R
