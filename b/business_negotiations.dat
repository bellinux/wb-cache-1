5|$|Disney was keen {{to promote}} Mulan to the Chinese, hoping to {{replicate}} their {{success with the}} 1994 film The Lion King, {{which was one of}} the country's highest-grossing Western films at that time. Disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with the Chinese government which had soured after the release of Kundun, a Disney-funded biography of the Dalai Lama that the Chinese government considered politically provocative. China had threatened to curtail <b>business</b> <b>negotiations</b> with Disney over that film and, as the government only accepts ten Western films per year to be shown in their country, Mulans chances of being accepted were low. Finally, after a year's delay, the Chinese government did allow the film a limited Chinese release, but only after the Chinese New Year, so as to ensure that local films dominated the more lucrative holiday market. Box office income was low, due to both the unfavorable release date and rampant piracy. Chinese people also complained about Mulan's depiction as too foreign-looking and the story as too different from the myths.|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers {{circulation}} {{has been}} dropping since the 1980s, {{and except for}} briefly seeing a rise in weekday circulation in 2007, The Philadelphia Inquirers weekday and Sunday circulation has continued to steadily drop since Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at The Inquirer and Daily News since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings. As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has been monitoring things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee they drink, and that Tierney has been patrolling the parking garage seeing what time employees arrive for work. Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the paper, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders. The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing of a lawsuit that accused The Philadelphia Inquirer of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after <b>business</b> <b>negotiations</b> between school operator Vahan H.

While their [...] "people and equipment were on the way", Charles Lutes, {{the head of the}} Maharishi's Spiritual Regeneration Movement in the US arrived and signed a contract with Four Star Films. The contract was negotiated by Horn and John Farrow was scheduled to direct the film. Horn expected that Donovan, the Beatles, the Beach Boys and Mia Farrow would appear in it. When some of the film crew from Four Star Films arrived around 11 April, Harrison and Lennon stayed out of sight.

[...] Evans told Saltzman that the Maharishi wanted the band to deposit up to 25% of their next album's profits in his Swiss bank account as a tithe, to which Lennon replied, [...] "Over my dead body". Mardas pointed to the luxury of the facility and the business acumen of the Maharishi and asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side. Mardas said the Maharishi offered him money to build a high-powered radio station. Lennon later told his wife that he felt that the Maharishi had, in her words, [...] "too much interest in public recognition, celebrities and money" [...] for a spiritual man. According to her sister, Pattie Boyd had dreamt that [...] "the Maharishi wasn't what he seemed". Cynthia Lennon, Cooke de Herrera and authors such as Barry Miles have blamed Mardas for turning Lennon against the Maharishi but Mardas denied this. Meanwhile, the weather, which had been quite cool in February, was growing hot [...] and the Maharishi was planning to move the whole group to Kashmir, at a higher and cooler altitude in a week.|$|E

40|$|Developed {{mainly in}} the broad field of negotiation, the {{existing}} literature on international <b>business</b> <b>negotiation</b> has adopted theoretical perspectives that focus on differences between negotiating parties. In this article, we argue that opportunism is more fundamental than differences {{in our understanding of}} international <b>business</b> <b>negotiation</b> behavior. Parties' concerns over how to mitigate opportunism are the fundamental force that drives such negotiation behavior, and the likelihood of opportunism is affected mostly by the economic nature of the asset parties committed to the business exchange. By synthesizing transaction cost economics and new institutional economics, this paper develops an alternative theoretical model that complements the existing negotiation literature to explain negotiation behavior. Our model theorizes relationships between parties' ex-ante credible commitments and ex-post dispute resolution strategies and explores how institutions moderate such relationships in shaping international <b>business</b> <b>negotiation</b> behavior and process. 34 page(s...|$|R

In this model a human interacts with an intelligent software agent through exchange of messages to reach on an agreement. In this paper, we present a content level ontology by conceptualizing nine types of communication units for human-agent negotiation. This ontology will facilitate to capture human intention contained in the message content. Using this ontology, software agent can understand human behavior and intention and then can reply accordingly. With our ontological approach, human-agent communication ambiguity will decrease and this will result in increase of mutual agreements.

Businessmen from the Czech Republic as well as those from all over the world face Chinese counterparts more and more often. Business relations are becoming deeper and negotiating skills play one of the key roles in the successful process of entering the Chinese market. Good interpersonal relations with Chinese business partners seem to be of great importance for creating and maintaining long-term business relations. This work mainly focuses on fundamental cultural determinants which influence the Chinese business behaviour. The goal of this thesis is to identify the core cultural factors which might cause misunderstandings or even conflicts in cooperation within any Czech-Chinese <b>business</b> <b>negotiation.</b> Through critical interviewing existing relevant literature the author studied specifics of Chinese business behaviour and defined areas requiring further research.
