5|$|The {{house was}} never to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> {{residence}} again. It was offered for sale in 1929, {{and at a time}} when many country houses were being demolished was given a scrap value of £5,882. With the exception of the Phelips family portraits, the historic contents and furnishing were disposed of, and the house, an empty shell, remained on the market for two years.|$|E
5|$|After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother's {{personal}} {{photographs and}} belongings removed {{and some of}} them destroyed, especially material relating to John Brown, whom he detested. Queen Victoria had intended the house to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private,</b> secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life. However, the new King had no need for the house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a convalescent home, opening the state apartments to the public, and constructing a Naval College on the grounds. His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Queen Victoria had bequeathed them houses on the estate, and the privacy promised to them by their mother was threatened. When Edward discussed the fate of the house with them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.|$|E

5|$|Film noir {{encompasses}} {{a range of}} plots: the central figure may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> investigator (The Big Sleep), a plainclothes policeman (The Big Heat), an aging boxer (The Set-Up), a hapless grifter (Night and the City), a law-abiding citizen lured into {{a life of crime}} (Gun Crazy), or simply a victim of circumstance (D.O.A.). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, films now so described have been made around the world. Many pictures released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noir of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir. The clichés of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party {{strongly}} supported {{the restoration of}} Alexandrov's melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem. In March 2010, Boris Kashin, a CPRF member of the Duma, advocated {{for the removal of}} any reference to God in the anthem. Kashin's suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov, a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued that religion should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> matter and should not be used by the state. Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000rubles. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings. Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.|$|E
5|$|The {{climax of}} most Bond films {{is the final}} {{confrontation}} with the villain and his henchmen, sometimes an entire army of cohorts, often in his hard-to-reach lair. The villain's retreat can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> island (Dr. No, The Man with the Golden Gun), underwater (The Spy Who Loved Me), mountaintop retreat (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, For Your Eyes Only) volcano (You Only Live Twice), or underground base (Live and Let Die), a ship (Thunderball, Tomorrow Never Dies), an oil rig (Diamonds Are Forever) or even a space station (Moonraker)—among other variations. Bond usually sabotages the lair and, with time ticking down, dispatches the supervillain, rescues the principal Bond girl and they escape as the place blows up. In some cases, the villain or his primary henchman escapes to launch a final attack on Bond and his lover in the final scene.|$|E

5|$|This {{suggestion}} {{stemmed from}} the observation that many engineers relied on {{the basic principles of}} physics and mechanics to guide their work, and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do. Short of government funding of such research, Evans also attempted to create {{in the aftermath of the}} Steam Engineer's Guide what he called 'The Experiment Company', which would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members. The venture failed and Evans could find no paying stockholders to launch it, possibly due to Evans committing the new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design. The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans's death on similar principles.|$|E

25|$|The {{farmhouse}} came {{to public}} attention {{to be preserved}} after some sections of it were being demolished during refurbishment. Back then Prime Minister in Office Lawrence Gonzi has made reference to the farmhouse and its rich history. Since then measures of preservation have taken place. The building remains to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> residence and not a museum. It is currently being used by its owners as a family home. A plaque is found on the façade of the building, commemorating the Gharghar rise against the French and Vincenzo Borg's heroic role at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The conquests {{destroyed}} little: {{what they}} did suppress were imperial rivalries and sectarian bloodletting among the newly subjected population. The Muslims tolerated Christianity, but they disestablished it; henceforward Christian life and liturgy, its endowments, politics and theology, would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> and not a public affair. By an exquisite irony, Islam reduced the status of Christians to that which the Christians had earlier thrust upon the Jews, with one difference. The reduction in Christian status was merely judicial; it was unaccompanied by either systematic persecution or a blood lust, and generally, though not elsewhere and at all times, unmarred by vexatious behavior.|$|E
25|$|As {{the heir}} of a noble family, Saionji participated in {{politics}} {{from an early}} age and was known for his brilliant talent. He took part in the climactic event of his time, the Boshin War, the revolution in Japan of 1867 and 1868, which overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate and installed the young Emperor Meiji as the (nominal) head of the government. Some noblemen at the Imperial Court considered the war to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> dispute of the samurai of Satsuma and Chōshū against those of the Tokugawa. Saionji held the strong opinion that the nobles of the Imperial Court should seize the initiative and take part in the war. He participated in various battles as an imperial representative.|$|E

25|$|The Genting Sempah–Genting Highlands Highway {{was used}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> highway owned by Genting Highlands Resort. Construction of the access road to Genting Highlands began on 18 August 1965 and would take four years to {{complete}} the access road from Genting Sempah to the peak of Mount Ulu Kali. The access road finally opened on 31 March 1969 {{in conjunction with the}} official laying of the foundation stone for the Genting Hotel (the then Highlands Hotel) by the then first Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj. In the year 2001, a new bypass Chin Swee Bypass which was designed as a downhill route from the summit to the downhill Chin Swee Temple was constructed and was completed in 2005. The construction of the new bypass was {{regarded as one of the}} most astonishing engineering project in Malaysia. Since 1989, there are many serious accidents are rare on the relatively well-maintained roads leading to the area's main resorts.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1890s Oslo had three private tram companies, of which two, Kristiania Sporveisselskab and Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei, {{operated}} each their network of street trams. This {{led to a}} debate of whether tram operation should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> or a municipal affair. The two dominant parties too each their stand: the Conservative Party wished to retain the private operations, while the Liberal Party supported a municipalization of the operations. The issue was split: Oslo Municipality taking over the existing two companies and establishing a new company to operate new lines. The municipality had in 1896 been offered to purchase KSS for its nominal share value plus interest in a move initiated by the tram company itself. Its main concern was its concession would expire in 1905 and that the municipality would then have the right expropriate it. Meanwhile, the company {{was in need of}} new capital and offered to issue new shares to the municipality. Oslo Municipality rejected the offer and the new shares were instead sold to Gesellschaft für elektrische Unternehmungen of Berlin.|$|E
25|$|In 2006-07 nine {{small towns}} (between 5,000 and 25,000 inhabitants) across Peru {{introduced}} a new water and sanitation management model, under which the community is being more empowered, including through deciding themselves about {{a certain level of}} service quality, such as low-cost technologies, and corresponding tariffs. Subsequently the municipality hires a specialized operator who is being regulated by a Community Supervision Board under a Public-Private-Social Partnership. The specialized operator can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> or a mixed company. The aim of the new approach was to break with the low-level equilibrium of poor service quality and poor cost recovery that prevails throughout small towns in Peru, under which poor quality water services are provided directly by the municipality. The new approach was supported through the Small Town Pilot Project (STPP) of the Ministry of Housing, with technical support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and financial support of US$ 6.6 million from the Canadian International Development Agency for limited infrastructure investments and training for both the operator and members of the Community Supervision Boards. After the municipal elections of 2007, 3 new mayors decided to abandon the new approach and to return to the old model of direct municipal management. In the 6 other cities specialized operators continue to operate.|$|E

500|$|The {{gardens and}} the land {{surrounding}} then came up for sale again in the late 1840s. [...] After {{the opening of the}} railway line and Brighton railway station nearby in 1841, the surrounding area developed as a largely working-class area of small terraced houses. In about 1849 Amon Henry Wilds attempted to introduce some higher-class housing with his Park Crescent development. [...] It was envisaged as a long, horseshoe-shaped crescent facing inwards towards the former cricket ground part of the Royal Gardens, which would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> garden for residents. Work started on the 48-house development, described as Wilds's [...] "most ambitious scheme", in 1849.|$|E
500|$|The {{filming of}} the episode's ending caused a [...] "huge divide among the writing {{staff and the}} {{director}} and the cast". Carell, Kwapis, and the actors wanted the moment when Pam and Jim kiss to [...] "follow the characters and the emotion of the moment" [...] by having the action captured in full by the show's cameramen. The writing staff, on the other hand, wanted Pam and Jim's moment to be private and only heard via the mics; Daniels explained, [...] "The writing staff was itching to do something kind of weird [...] and have it <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> moment that the doc crew didn't know {{was going to happen}} and so only heard on their mics and came running around the corner to film." [...] Eventually, both versions were filmed, but the former was broadcast. The alternate version has never been released.|$|E

Norton dismissed this, [...] "Our healthy process , which is and should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted {{to such a degree that}} it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen.
