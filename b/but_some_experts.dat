25|$|Heterosexual {{transmission}} of HIV {{is the primary}} mode of spread in Nigeria, and infections appear to be as numerous in rural areas as in the cities. In other words, HIV is endemic in the general population. The reported rate of infection apparently varies significantly by region, with the lowest reported rate found generally in the predominantly Muslim northern parts of the country. Infections are most numerous among men ages 20 through 24, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> caution that infection rates are rising quickly in young women.|$|E

25|$|The Little Ice Age (LIA) was {{a period}} of cooling that {{occurred}} after the Medieval Warm Period. Although it was not a true ice age, the term was introduced into scientific literature by François E. Matthes in 1939. It has been conventionally defined as a period extending from the 16th to the 19th centuries, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> prefer an alternative timespan from about 1300 to about 1850. Climatologists and historians working with local records no longer expect to agree on either the start or end dates of the period, which varied according to local conditions.|$|E
25|$|Orthalicus reses, {{common name}} the Stock Island, Florida tree snail, is {{a species of}} large {{tropical}} air-breathing land snail, a tree snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Orthalicidae. It was first described in 1830 by the American naturalist Thomas Say. The holotype, a specimen probably collected in Key West, was subsequently lost. Over a hundred years later, in 1946, the American biologist Henry Augustus Pilsbry redescribed the species using a specimen from Stock Island. Orthalicus reses has two subspecies, O. reses reses and O. reses nosodryas. The validity of these two taxa is still being discussed, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> argue that considering them as independent units may be important for management purposes.|$|E
500|$|A {{very rare}} version of Riesling which has {{recently}} received more attention is Red Riesling (Roter Riesling). As the name suggests, {{this is a}} red-skinned clone of Riesling (a skin color commonly found for e.g. Gewürztraminer), but not a dark-skinned clone, i.e., {{it is still a}} white wine grape. It is considered a mutation of White Riesling, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> have suggested the opposite relationship, i.e., that Red Riesling could be the forerunner of White Riesling. Small amounts of Red Riesling are grown in Germany and Austria. In 2006, the Rheingau winery Fritz Allendorf planted what has been claimed to be the first commercial amounts of Red Riesling. To confuse matters, [...] "Red Riesling" [...] has also been used as a synonym for red-skinned Traminer grapes (such as the Savagnin rose of Klevener de Heiligenstein) and the obscure variety Hanns, which is a seed plant of Roter Veltliner. Roter Riesling {{has nothing to do with}} Schwarzriesling.|$|E

An Italian governmental commission studied all the issues after 2006, after an attempt to start works near Susa (Italy) in 2005 resulted in a strong confrontation between opponents and police.Works of the commission between 2007 and 2009 have been collected in seven papers (Quaderni) summarizing the results.

40|$|Legislation on the {{protection}} of biodiversity (e. g., European Union Habitat and Bird Directives) increasingly requires ecological impact assessment of human activities. However, {{knowledge and understanding of}} relevant ecological processes and species responses to different types of impact are often incomplete. In this paper we demonstrate with a case study how impact assessment can be carried out for situations where data are scarce <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>expert</b> knowledge is available. The case study involves two amphibian species, the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) and the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) in the nature reserve the Meinweg in the Netherlands, for which plans are being developed to reopen an old railway track called the Iron Rhine. We assess the effects of this railway track and its proposed alternatives (scenarios) on the metapopulation extinction time and the occupancy times of the patches for both species using a discrete-time stochastic metapopulation model. We quantify the model parameters using expert knowledge and extrapolated data. Because of our uncertainty about these parameter values, we perform a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. This yields an estimate of the probability distribution of the model predictions and insight into the contribution of each distinguished source of uncertainty to this probability distribution. We show that with a simple metapopulation model and an extensive uncertainty analysis it is possible to detect the least harmful scenario. The ranking of the different scenarios is consistent. Thus, uncertainty analysis can enhance the role of ecological impact assessment in decision making by making explicit to what extent incomplete knowledge affects predictions...|$|R
