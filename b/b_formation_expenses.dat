40|$|Chlorophyll b is an {{ubiquitous}} accessory pigment in land plants, green algae, and prochlorophytes. Its biosynthesis plays a {{key role}} in the adaptation to various light environments. We isolated six chlorophyll b-less mutants by insertional mutagenesis by using the nitrate reductase or argininosuccinate lyase genes as tags and examined the rearrangement of mutant genomes. We found that an overlapping region of a nuclear genome was deleted in all mutants and that this encodes a protein whose sequence is similar to those of methyl monooxygenases. This coding sequence also contains putative binding domains for a [2 Fe- 2 S] Rieske center and for a mononuclear iron.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the linkage between climate and ocean circulation under greenhouse conditions we have studied calcareous nannofossils, palynomorphs and benthic foraminifera from the Early Albian Oceanic Anoxic Event 1 b black shale (OAE 1 b) in the Vocontian Basin (SE France). We propose that monsoonal activity resulting from precessional forcing and modulated by eccentricity-driven temperature changes represents the driving factor of OAE 1 <b>b</b> <b>formation</b> in low latitudes. With the onset of OAE 1 b, increasingly warm and humid conditions, stronger winds and enhanced terrestrial input led to higher surface water productivity. Therefore, increased productivity {{is an important factor}} for OAE 1 <b>b</b> <b>formation</b> in the Vocontian Basin. However, monsoonally forced productivity changes are a regional climate signal only. The supraregional occurrence of the OAE 1 b is probably due to a reduction of deep water formation in the low latitudes under extremely warm and humid conditions, leading to enhanced preservation of organic matter. <br/...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of data {{obtained}} by time-resolved X-ray diffraction, we consider in the present article the occurrence and formation pathways of inverted bicontinuous cubic phases, or bilayer cubic phases, Q (II) (B), in diluted dispersions of lipids representing major biomembrane lipid classes [phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), mixtures of PEs and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) with other lipids, glycolipids]. We show that Q (II) (<b>B)</b> <b>formation</b> proceeds much more easily upon cooling from the H(II) phase than upon heating or isothermal conversion from the L(α) phase, thus identifying an indirect but faster route for Q (II) (B) phase induction in lipids. The data collected consistently show {{that the ability to}} convert into cubic phase upon temperature cycling appears to be a general property of all lipids exhibiting an L(α) ↔ H(II) phase transition. Admixtures of charged phospholipids, both anionic and cationic, strongly facilitate Q (II) (<b>B)</b> <b>formation</b> in PEs. Their effect may be attributed to increased electrostatic repulsion between the lipid bilayers that reduces the unbinding energy and facilitates the dissipation of the L(α) phase required for its conversion into bilayer cubic phase...|$|R

Furthermore, geochemistry analyses of two crude oil samples from Wells BM- 29 and BM- 70, which are recovered from the Upper Rudeis Formation were performed.

The geochemical investigations of two oil samples indicate that the Upper Rudeis oil of Belayim Marine was derived from a marine carbonate rich source, which is relatively rich in algal organic matter and has moderate sulfur content.

40|$|The Mount Lofty Ranges lie to {{the east}} of Adelaide and contain a {{significant}} groundwater resource of low salinity. There are three catchments in the Southern Mount Lofty Ranges where minimal information exists on the sustainable groundwater yield - Hindmarsh River, Inman River and Currency Creek. Effective water allocation in this a rea requires information on the extent of the water resource and the relationship between surface and groundwater. As this resource is coming under increasing pressure for development it is important to develop appropriate land and water management strategies {{in order to ensure that}} future development is sustainable. The hydrogeology of all three study catchments is directly related to the underlying geological formations which determine both the quantity and quality of groundwater in the area: Cape Jervis Beds, Kanmantoo Formation, Quaternary and Tertiary Limestone. Except for the clearly defined confined Tertiary Limestone aquifer in the Hindmarsh Tiers valley, there does not appear to be any apparent delineation of aquifers in the other formations. The Cape Jervis <b>Bed</b> <b>formations</b> are a mixture of erratic sand and clay layers and wells are completed in both.

40|$|The biogenetic {{interdependence}} of light-harvesting chlorophyll (Chl) a/b proteins (LHCPs) and antenna pigments has been analyzed for two nuclear mutants of Chlamydomonas that have {{low levels of}} Chl b, neoxanthin, and loroxanthin. In mutant PA 2. 1, the apoprotein precursors (pLHCP II) of the major light-harvesting complex LHC II were synthesized at approximately wild-type rates, processed to their mature size, and rapidly degraded. Because the bulk of labile LHCP II in PA 2. 1 was soluble, a thylakoid integration factor apparently is defective in this strain. Chl a, Chl b, neoxanthin, and loroxanthin synthesis and accumulation were coordinately reduced in PA 2. 1, indicating that LHCP II play important regulatory or substrate roles in de novo synthesis of these pigments. Mutant GE 2. 27 is impaired principally in Chl b synthesis but nonetheless accumulated wild-type levels of all LHCPs. Topology studies of the GE 2. 27 LHCP II demonstrated that their insertion into thylakoids was incomplete {{even though they were}} not structurally altered. Thus, Chl <b>b</b> <b>formation</b> mediates conformational changes of LHCP II after thylakoid integration is initiated. GE 2. 27 also exhibited very low rates of neoxanthin synthesis and was unable to accumulate loroxanthin. Revertant GE 2. 27 strains with varying capacities for Chl <b>b</b> <b>formation</b> provided additional evidence that neoxanthin synthesis and accumulation are coupled with the final steps of LHCP II integration into thylakoids. We propose that biogenesis of LHC includes interdependent pigment synthesis/assembly events that occur during LHCP integration into the thylakoid membrane and that defects in these events account for the pleiotropic characteristics of many Chl b-deficient mutants...|$|R
