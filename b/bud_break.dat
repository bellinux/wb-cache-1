25|$|In {{temperate}} climates, where temperatures {{can reach}} above 10 °C (50 °F) in mid-winter, some early budding varieties (such as Chardonnay) {{can be at}} risk of premature <b>bud</b> <b>break.</b> This is a potential viticultural hazard {{in places like the}} Margaret River region of Western Australia where warm currents from the Indian Ocean can coax Chardonnay vines to prematurely bud in the mid-winter month of July. After <b>bud</b> <b>break,</b> the young shoots are very vulnerable to frost damage with vineyard managers going to great lengths protect the fragile shoots should temperature dramatically drop below freezing. This can include setting up heaters or wind circulators in the vineyard to keep cold air from settling on the vines.|$|E
25|$|The {{annual growth}} cycle of grapevines {{is the process}} {{that takes place in}} the {{vineyard}} each year, beginning with <b>bud</b> <b>break</b> in the spring and culminating in leaf fall in autumn followed by winter dormancy. From a winemaking perspective, each step in the process plays a vital {{role in the development of}} grapes with ideal characteristics for making wine. Viticulturalists and vineyard managers monitor the effect of climate, vine disease and pests in facilitating or impeding the vines progression from <b>bud</b> <b>break,</b> flowering, fruit set, veraison, harvesting, leaf fall and dormancy-reacting if need be with the use of viticultural practices like canopy management, irrigation, vine training and the use of agrochemicals. The stages of the annual growth cycle usually become observable within the first year of a vine's life. The amount of time spent at each stage of the growth cycle depends on a number of factors-most notably the type of climate (warm or cool) and the characteristics of the grape variety.|$|E
25|$|Tiny buds on {{the vine}} start to swell and {{eventually}} shoots begin to grow from the buds. Buds are the {{small part of the}} vine that rest between the vine's stem and the petiole (leaf stem). Inside the buds contain usually three primordial shoots. These buds appear in the summer of previous growth cycle green and covered in scales. During winter dormancy they turn brown until the spring when the vine begins the process of <b>bud</b> <b>break</b> and the first sign of green in the vineyard emerges in the form of tiny shoots. The energy to facilitate this growth comes from reserves of carbohydrate stored in roots and wood of the vine from the last growth cycle. Eventually the shoots sprout tiny leaves that can begin the process of photosynthesis, producing the energy to accelerate growth. In warm climates, after about 4 weeks the growth of the shoots starts to rapidly accelerate with the shoots growing in length an average of 3cm (1in) a day.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary shoot groeth on acacia hybrids (Acacia mangium x A. Auriculiformis) was {{observed}} {{to assess their}} in- vitro shoot initiation. Explants were taken from 4 months old seedlings of A. Mangium, A. Auriculiformis and their hybrid.

40|$|During wintertime Viburnum opulus var. roseum (snowball) shrubs {{are forced}} in warm {{greenhouses}} to harvest early cut flowers. Early forcing is occasionally unsuccessful. This is {{probably due to}} a lack of hours with low temperatures that is needed to <b>break</b> <b>bud</b> dormancy. To gain more insight about the effect of temperature on breaking dormancy and early forcing results, shrubs were transferred into cold storage in week 41, 43 and 45 (2009) for 4, 6 or 8 weeks at a temperature of 2, 5 or 8 °C. After storage, the shrubs were forced at a day-/night temperature of 28 / 23 °C. Shrubs stored for at least 8 weeks from week 41, 6 weeks from week 43 and 4 weeks from week 45 gave good forcing results, regardless of storage temperature. Since growing conditions outside vary every year and differ between nurseries, it is difficult to determine when forcing can be started. To prevent poor forcing results, we aimed to develop a molecular diagnostic assay to determine the moment at which winter dormancy of snowball flower buds is sufficiently broken. In order to identify genes involved in <b>bud</b> <b>breaking</b> dormancy, an experiment was performed on a commercial nursery from October 2010 to January 2011. Flower buds of snowball shrubs outside were sampled weekly and in December and January batches of shrubs were placed every week in a greenhouse to observe forcing results. Genes involved in <b>bud</b> <b>breaking</b> dormancy were identified by performing next generation Illumina RNA sequencing on bud samples with poor and good forcing results. A set of candidate genes was validated during a second trial at two different commercial nurseries in 2011 - 2012...|$|R
2500|$|Peaches grow in {{a fairly}} limited range in dry, {{continental}} or temperate climates, since the trees have a chilling requirement that tropical or subtropical areas generally cannot satisfy except at high altitudes (for example in parts of Ecuador, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, and Nepal). Most cultivars require 500 hours of chilling around [...] During the chilling period, key chemical reactions occur, but the plant appears dormant. Once the chilling period is fulfilled, the plant enters a second type of dormancy, the quiescence period.

2500|$|A serious viticultural {{concern for}} Chablis {{vineyard}} owners is frost protection. During the <b>bud</b> <b>break</b> {{period of a}} grapevine's annual cycle, the Chablis region is vulnerable to springtime frost, from March to early May, which can compromise the crop yield. Formerly, the financial risk involved saw many producers turn to polyculture agriculture, pulling up vineyards to plant alternative crops. The 1957 vintage was hit particularly hard by frost damage: the regional authorities reported that only 11 cases (132 bottles) of wine were produced.|$|E
2500|$|Bonarda/Douce noir is a {{very late}} {{ripening}} grape variety that is often harvested after Cabernet Sauvignon. To extend the growing season, some vignerons will prune early in January {{in order to promote}} early <b>bud</b> <b>break.</b> The grape has very thick skins and a high phenolic content which requires heat in order to achieve physiological ripeness but excessive heat can risk creating [...] "cooked flavors" [...] in the resulting wines. Growers in California have discovered some of the more ideal vineyard locations for Douce noir/Charbono are warm-climate sites with significant diurnal temperature variations from a drop in night time temperature.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on temperatures, 40–80 {{days after}} <b>bud</b> <b>break</b> {{the process of}} {{flowering}} begins with small flower clusters appearing on {{the tips of the}} young shoots looking like buttons. Flowering occurs when average daily temperatures stay between 1520°C (5968°F) which in the Northern Hemisphere wine regions is generally around May and for the Southern Hemisphere regions around November. A few weeks after the initial clusters appear, the flowers start to grow in size with individual flowers becoming observable. It is during this stage of flowering that the pollination and fertilization of the grapevine takes place with the resulting product being a grape berry, containing 1-4 seeds.|$|E

2500|$|The grape starts {{its annual}} growth cycle {{in the spring}} with <b>bud</b> <b>break.</b> In the Northern Hemisphere, this stage begins around March while in the Southern Hemisphere it begins around September when daily {{temperatures}} begin to surpass 10 °C (50 °F). If the vine had been pruned during the winter, {{the start of this}} cycle is signaled by a [...] "bleeding" [...] of the vine. This bleeding occurs when the soil begins to warm and osmotic forces pushes water, containing a low concentration of organic acids, hormones, minerals and sugars, up from the root system of the vine and it is expelled from the cuts (or [...] "wounds") left over from pruning the vine.

40|$|Frost events {{across the}} state have {{resulted}} in the loss of some primary buds. This will result in secondary <b>buds</b> <b>breaking</b> and eventually flowering and producing grape berries. Be aware that in vineyards where frost killed some primary buds, there will be an extended bloom period. In these vineyards, there likely will be asynchronous bloom (that is an extended period in flowering). Within these vineyards will also be grape berries of different maturities. Grape berries arising from primary buds will develop ontogenic (age related) resistance to some grape diseases well ahead of berries arising from secondary buds. This asynchronous bloom will extend the period of susceptibility of the grape berries to disease infections [...] In vineyards with asynchronous bloom, a critical management step will be timing immediate pre-bloom and post-bloom disease management programs...|$|R

50|$|In {{its first}} year, a new stem, the primocane, grows vigorously {{to its full}} length of 3-6 m (in some cases, up to 9 m), arching or {{trailing}} along the ground and bearing large palmately compound leaves with five or seven leaflets; it does not produce any flowers. In its second year, the cane becomes a floricane and the stem does not grow longer, but the lateral <b>buds</b> <b>break</b> to produce flowering laterals (which have smaller leaves with three or five leaflets). First- and second-year shoots usually have numerous short-curved, very sharp prickles that are often erroneously called thorns. These prickles can tear through denim with ease and make the plant very difficult to navigate around. Prickle-free cultivars have been developed. The University of Arkansas has developed primocane fruiting blackberries that grow and flower on first-year growth much as the primocane-fruiting (also called fall bearing or everbearing) red raspberries do.|$|R

30|$|These {{results suggest}} that the {{shortened}} annual cycle system is a potential model for the physiological, cell biological and molecular studies of wood formation with an annual rhythm, at least between the dormant and dormancy-breaking stages. To simulate more precise formation of late wood, improvements can be attempted, specifically in Stage 2. This shortened annual cycle system could also become a useful model system for field studies such as investigating the timing between <b>bud</b> <b>breaking</b> and cambial activity [29 – 32], cambial reaction to partial heating [33 – 35] and partial cooling [36] of tree stem. In fact, using a similar system, it was reported that the roots alter their functions depending on the seasons [17, 18]. This shortened culture system would condense the duration of research study if used as a model to test various hypotheses prior to conducting elaborate field experiments. In addition, it provides an easy control and the ability to manipulate the growth conditions.|$|R
30|$|We {{recently}} {{established a}} shortened annual cycle system for poplar trees using growth chambers [19]. Poplar is widely adopted {{as a model}} angiosperm tree [20], and the author continually maintains a subculture of poplar in the growth room for the past 15  years, and produces transgenic plants for experimental use [21 – 27]. In this shortened annual system for poplar, we mimicked leaf color change, defoliation, dormancy, <b>bud</b> <b>breaking</b> and growing within a period of 4 – 5  months. Furthermore, phosphate retranslocation from leaves to stem during winter condition occurred similar to that seen in the field-grown poplar trees [19], and a heavily branched architecture was formed [28]. In the present study, we grew poplar trees using this system for three cycles, and the resulting wood tissue was {{compared to that of}} wood grown in a field, to verify whether this shortened annual cycle system has the potential to {{serve as a model for}} investigating wood formation with an annual rhythm.|$|R
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} singly {{at the base}} of oak buds in late summer ready to hatch the {{following}} spring as the <b>buds</b> <b>break.</b> Both sessile oak Quercus petraea and pedunculate oak Quercus robur, Britain's two native oaks are used and also some introduced species such as Turkey oak Quercus cerris and evergreen oak Quercus ilex. In winter the eggs are easily found on close examination of bare branches. The caterpillar is fully developed inside the egg after two or three weeks but doesn't hatch until the spring whereupon it burrows into the flower buds to feed safely concealed. As it gets larger and the buds open it spins a silken retreat and feeds only at night. Pupation usually takes place in the leaf litter where it is tended by ants who bury them, but also sometimes in a crevice in the bark of the foodplant. There is one brood a year with adults on the wing in July and August.|$|R
