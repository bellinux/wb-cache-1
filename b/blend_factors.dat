40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the strength development of industrial by-products, namely Recycled Glass (RG) and Fly Ash (FA) in the manufacture of low carbon masonry units. A low carbon concept for manufacturing masonry units using RG-FA geopolymers was explored by applying low curing temperature of 50 &# 0176;C and a low curing period of just 3 &# 8211; 7 days. RG, being rich in silica was used as a filler material. FA, being a silica and alumina rich industrial by-product was used as a precursor in the RG-FA geopolymers. A liquid alkaline activator (L) comprising of a sodium hydroxide-sodium silicate solution was used for the alkali activation of 30 % content of FA in the RG-FA <b>blend.</b> <b>Factors</b> found to affect strength development of the RG-FA geopolymers were: (1) the ratio of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate in the liquid activator, (2) application of a low curing temperature of only 50 &# 0176;C, (3) short curing periods of just 7 days and (4) the L/FA ratios. A geopolymer composed of a 70 % Na 2 SiO 3 : 30 % NaOH ratio with a L/FA ratio of 0. 625 was found to be the most efficient combination to provide the required unconfined compression strengths for manufacturing masonry. The usage of RG-FA geopolymers as low carbon masonry units was found to be viable using a low curing period of just 7 days and a curing temperature of just 50 &# 0176;C. The RG-FA geopolymers had sufficient compressive strength be used as structural masonry units and needed only a low amount of heat treatment to achieve the minimum strength requirement. Optimally, 30 % of FA was found to be sufficient for geopolymerization to occur for this novel low carbon RG-FA masonry units. Furthermore, the core materials needed to produce RG-FA masonry units were industrial by-products, the sustainable usage of which would contribute significantly to efficient waste management, through the production of aesthetically pleasing masonry units...|$|E

This paper focuses on the application of LES quality criteria to ICE and to their correlation, in order to draw a solid background on future LES quality assessments for ICE. In this paper, TCC-III single-cylinder optical engine from University of Michigan is investigated and the analysis is conducted under motored condition. LES quality is mainly affected by grid size and type, sub-grid scale (SGS) model, numeric schemes. In this study, the same grid size and type are used in order to focus on the effect on LES quality of SGS models and <b>blending</b> <b>factors</b> of numeric scheme only. In the first section of the study, single grid estimators are used to compare two sub-filter models which are static Smagorinsky model and dynamic Smagorinsky model.

In the second section, the in-cylinder gas-dynamics and flow structures are analyzed by comparing experimental results (pressure transducers and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) velocity fields) with a dataset of consecutive LES cycles. The flow analysis focuses at four different crank angle positions (bottom dead center (BDC), middle of exhaust and intake valve opening timing and mid-compression stroke) on the same section plane as PIV visualizations. Finally, the connection between the LES quality criteria and the accuracy of simulation results with experiments is discussed and conclusions are drawn to outline a best practice in LES quality for ICE...|$|R

For directly imaging blended VSP measurements, we have used full-wavefield migration (FWM). FWM is an inversion-based imaging scheme that enables us to use any kind of complex source wavefield to estimate the subsurface reflectivity, using all the multiples (surface and internal) in the recorded data. The multiple scattering helps in improving the illumination {{as well as the}} vertical resolution of the image. In this scheme, active deblending is not required because the imaging process itself acts as a deblending procedure. We tested the potential of FWM to image blended VSP data, using simple and complex synthetic models. We clearly determined that using the primaries, surface multiples, and internal multiples enhanced the illumination away from the well trajectory, in which blending noise was suppressed due to the inversion scheme.

30|$|Terrain LOD {{algorithms}} can {{be classified}} [1], {{on the basis of}} the hierarchical structure, into four groups, namely, the triangulated irregular networks (TINs), bin-tree hierarchies, bin-tree regions and tiled blocks. The tessellation, in the last category, is carried out with the square tiles of different resolutions as has been done by Wagner [5]. But the process requires seamless stitching at the boundaries. According to Deb et al. [6], Wagner's technique is not suited for the terrains with large height variations and that is why they tweak the technique by having the projection on real-time average height of terrain for a client/server terrain streaming to handle heterogeneous clients. The <b>blending</b> <b>factors</b> are calculated on a per-tile basis because of the use of a regular tile structure, thus, reducing the amount of computation. Special techniques based on mipmaps and clipmaps [7] can be found in the literature. Losasso and Hoppe [1] break the terrains into geometric clipmaps of varying metric sizes which can be used as LODs through a view-centered hierarchy resulting in a simplified spatial and temporal interlevel continuity. A thresholding scheme based on calculated ground sample distances is proposed by Tsai and Chiu [8] with a nested LOD system for efficient seamless visualization of large datasets. In order to remove the T-junctions they have put forward a mesh refinement algorithm. Ueng and Chuang [9] propose a dike structure between two adjacent blocks,for a smooth blending between two meshes of different LOD. This approach is combined by Li et al. [10] with heuristics to dynamically stitch the tile meshes together seamlessly. For the texture part they use high-resolution aerial photos subjected to the similar LOD mechanism as described for the meshes. Larsen and Christensen [11] try to avoid popping for low-end users by exploiting the low-level hardware programmability in order to maintain interactive frame-rates. They claim their work as pioneering as far as a smooth LOD implementation in commodity hardware is concerned.|$|R

30|$|Despite the {{problems}} with nutrient availability {{that may have been}} expected with the high pH of the guar and jantar blends, the tissue nutrient analysis of transplants grown in these blends showed increasing concentrations of all nutrients with increasing proportions in the compost. Concentrations of all measured nutrients, except P, of transplants grown in the wheat straw and rice hull compost blends did, however, decrease with increasing compost proportions. Because tissue P concentration increased with increasing proportions of rice hull compost, it appears there is more plant available P in rice hull compost than the 1 : 5 extract samples suggested. Nutrients in composts can display varying degrees of extractability when composts are used in potting mixes due to complex interactions between media components (Evans et al. 2011). Interactions between media components could explain some of the discrepancies between nutrients measured in media blends and tissue nutrient concentration. There appears to be no clear relationship between transplant tissue nutrient concentration and transplant growth or field performance. With this in mind, the good performance in rice hull compost blends is likely due to the differences in the physical properties, pH, and EC of rice hull compost, from the other compost <b>blends.</b> Other <b>factors</b> that were not measured may have also contributed to success of the rice hull compost blends. For example, rice hulls contain high levels of silicon (Gachukia and Evans, 2008), which have been shown to alleviate stress and improve plant growth (Neocleous 2015; Shi et al. 2016), and may be helpful in transplant establishment, especially under stressful field conditions.|$|R

The paper next discusses the application of these factors to a postgraduate program in an Australian business school. The implementation of an authentic on-line assessment task is also explored Student reactions to various aspects of the program are reported, based on surveys during the program and post-program completion...|$|R
40|$|Scales {{that measure}} the Big Five {{personality}} factors are often substantially intercorrelated. These correlations are sometimes interpreted as implying {{the existence of}} two higher order factors of personality. The authors show that correlations between measures of broad personality factors do not necessarily imply the existence of higher order factors and might instead be due to variables that represent same-signed <b>blends</b> of orthogonal <b>factors.</b> Therefore, the hypotheses of higher order <b>factors</b> and <b>blended</b> variables can only be tested with data on lower level personality variables that define the personality factors. The authors compared the higher order factor model and the blended variable model in three participant samples using the Big Five Aspect Scales, and found better fit for the latter model. In other analyses using the HEXACO Personality Inventory, they identified mutually uncorrelated markers of six personality factors. The authors conclude that correlations between personality factor scales can be explained without postulating any higher order dimensions of personality. © 2009 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc...|$|R
