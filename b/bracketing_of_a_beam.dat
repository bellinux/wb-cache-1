30|$|Resonance {{frequencies}} of beams with {{various types of}} end supports were examined for flexural vibration. Rectangular beams with dimensions of 300 (L) × 25 (R) × 5 or 10 mm (T) were used as the test specimens. Various compressing stresses were applied to the parts around both ends <b>of</b> <b>a</b> test <b>beam</b> and flexural vibration tests were conducted. The measured resonance frequency started to increase from the resonance frequency <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> with simply supported ends and was stable around the resonance frequency <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> with fixed ends as the compressing stress increased. The stable resonance frequency was lower than the theoretical value because perfect fixation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> to <b>a</b> post was difficult. From these results, the temporal change in resonance frequency itself, rather than the stable resonance frequency, is effective to examine whether <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> has enough strength as a guardrail.|$|R
