5|$|No. 1 Squadron (AFC) patrols {{found the}} Shunet Nimrin {{garrison}} {{still in place}} {{on the morning of}} 22 September, but Rujm el Oshir camp (to the east of Jericho, half way between the Jordan River and the Hedjaz railway) had been broken up, and fires burned west of the Amman railway station. Ain es Sir camp (south east of Es Salt, half way between the Jordan River and Amman) was found to <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> Ottoman troops, but at about midday the Ottoman garrison at Es Salt was hastily packing. Australian airmen reported the whole area east of the Jordan to be on the move towards Amman by between 15:00 and 18:00, when two Bristol Fighters bombed a mass of traffic at Suweile, half-way between Es Salt and Amman, and fired nearly 1,000 machine-gun rounds.|$|E

5|$|The head {{should be}} of {{moderate}} width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop {{at the end of}} the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.|$|E
5|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{was viewed as}} radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay was found to <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact. Shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the K–Pg boundary. Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts. The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact, and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby—as did the discovery that the K–Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The Brahma Vaivarta Purana (related to Rathantara kalpa) {{mentions}} a ten thousand-year period, {{starting from}} the traditional dating of the Kali Yuga epoch, during which bhakti yogis will be present.

25|$|In April 1993, a young Navajo woman {{arrived at}} the Indian Medical Center {{emergency}} room in Gallup, New Mexico, complaining of flu-like symptoms and sudden, severe shortness of breath.

An autopsy revealed the woman’s lung to be twice the normal weight for someone her age. The cause of her death could not be found, and the case was reported to the New Mexico Department of Health.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} to come, Vysotsky's grave became a site of pilgrimage for several generations of his fans, the {{youngest}} of whom were born after his death. His tombstone also {{became the subject of}} controversy, as his widow had wished for a simple abstract slab, while his parents insisted on a realistic gilded statue. Although probably too solemn to have inspired Vysotsky himself, the statue is believed by some to <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> metaphors and symbols reminiscent of the singer's life.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, it came {{to light}} that Network Rail had been hacked four times up to July 2016. As most of the rail network in the United Kingdom is analogue, it would not affect anything, but Network Rail have an {{aspiration}} for the digital rail Traffic Management System to go live in 2018.

25|$|Ralph Waldo Trine {{wrote a book}} {{while at}} Greenacre and {{published}} it in 1903.

Articles based on the work were printed in various journals, some noting Greenacre as well.|$|E
25|$|The naturalism of {{the figures}} {{suggests}} the artist's intention to elicit an immediate emotional response to the viewer. Neptune’s furrowed brow gives a sense of his fierce strength. His stance is set in stone, solidifying his divine power. In contrast, Triton looks somewhat submissive while he is grabbing Neptune’s thigh. His face looks to <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> anxiety as if {{he knows that he}} should obey whatever Neptune commands him to do. His timid nature and Neptune’s dominate presence display the reality of human emotion and brings back the point of Bernini’s plan to convey myths coming to life.|$|E

25|$|Promoted to captain on 30 August 1688, Fairborne {{was given}} {{command of the}} fifth-rate HMS Richmond later that month. The fact {{that his mother had}} been left without a pension by the old regime is likely to have made Fairborne a {{supporter}} of the Glorious Revolution of November 1688. He transferred to the command of the fifth-rate HMS Phoenix in early 1689 and then commanded the third-rate HMS Warspite at the French victory at the Battle of Beachy Head in June 1690 during the Nine Years' War.

25|$|For example, in {{the first}} {{construction}} of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points. Later, in the fourth construction, he used superposition (moving the triangles {{on top of each}} other) to prove that if two sides and their angles are equal, then they are congruent; during these considerations he uses some properties of superposition, but these properties are not described explicitly in the treatise. If superposition is to be considered a valid method of geometric proof, all of geometry would <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> such proofs. For example, propositions I.1I.3 can be proved trivially by using superposition.|$|E
25|$|In 1812 he {{was sitting}} in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to <b>be</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> mistakes, when the idea {{occurred}} to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.|$|E

In 1944, Moorehead wrote that Maletti was wounded while rallying his men, then retreated to his tent with a machine-gun, where he was killed. Maletti's mortal remains were to be seen {{at the entrance of}} his tent when war correspondents visited the camp. Moorehead wrote that he saw unattended donkeys wandering around looking for water and soldiers looting extravagant Italian army uniforms and lunching on luxury foods, wines and Recoaro mineral water.
