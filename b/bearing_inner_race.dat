Case-carburized tapered roller bearings used in the railroad industry are manufactured with a dual-phase microstructure that consists primarily of tempered martensite and retained austenite. The retained austenite phase is metastable, and will transform to martensite with sufficient thermal or mechanical energy during service. The increase in surface volume because of transformation, and the subsequent increase in compressive residual stress could indicate the onset of certain failure modes, including fatigue spalling.

40|$|An image {{dimensionality}} reduction {{method for}} rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on singular value decomposition Yi Wang 1, Dan Liu 1, Guanghua Xu 1, 2 and Kuosheng Jiang 1 The fast kurtogram, a faint signal extraction method, has {{been regarded as}} an effective approach to detect and characterize faint transient features in vibration signals. However, the fast kurtogram, a band-pass filtering method, which extracts transient signals by optimal frequency band selection and leaves the noise in the selected frequency band unprocessed. Therefore, to overcome the shortcoming of the fast kurtogram method, a method which can wipe off the noise in the whole frequency band is necessary. This paper proposes a novel faint signal extraction method by time– frequency distribution image dimensionality reduction. Since time–frequency distribution image can reveal intrinsic fea-ture of nonstationary signals and can make the weak impulses feature prominent, and besides, the transient impulse feature and the noise component lie in different dimensions, so using the dimensionality reduction method based on singular value decomposition to suppress the background noise in the raw time–frequency distribution image is moti-vated.
