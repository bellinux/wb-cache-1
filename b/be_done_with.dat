5|$|The actual welding {{technique}} utilized {{depends on the}} electrode, {{the composition of the}} workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the welding speed.

40|$|This is {{a report}} on {{personal}} experiences with 549 cases of popliteal and tibial artery revascularization. There were 204 cases of femoral-popliteal artery by-pass procedures utilizing vein grafts. In 193 cases, this procedure <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts. The remainder of the cases consisted of arm veins, bank veins and superficial femoral veins. There were 149 femoral-tibial or popliteal-tibial artery bypasses utilizing vein grafts or composite grafts. In 83 cases, tibial artery bypasses <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts. In 30 cases, popliteal-tibial artery bypasses <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> autoge-nous greater saphenous vein grafts.

40|$|Aim:-The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of instrument design on inducing root fracture. Methodology:- 60 single rooted premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were collected. Periapical radiographs were taken from the proximal view to eliminate any teeth with double canal morphology. Each specimen was decoronated 2 mm coronal to cementoenamel junction with the help of diamond disc Specimens were divided into 6 groups of 10 teeth each and instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> files of different designs by Crown-down technique. Group 1 -Instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> stainless steel K hand files Group 2 -Instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> stainless steel H hand files. Group- 3 Instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Protaper NI-TI rotary files. Group- 4 Instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Profile NI-TI rotary files. Group- 5 Instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Hero-Shaper rotary files. Group- 6 Instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> RACE rotary files. The specimens of all the groups were stored for 1 week in 10 % buffered formalin after instrumentation. Each specimen was sectioned horizontally with low speed diamond saw under water cooling into three parts at 3 mm, 6 mm and 9 mm from the apex.

5|$|The {{relation}} of two fields is {{expressed by the}} notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014 the {{kilogram}} was {{the only}} SI unit still defined by an artifact. In 1960 the metre having previously also been defined by reference to an artifact (a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it) was redefined in terms of invariant, fundamental physical constants (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by krypton, and later the speed of light) so that the standard can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. At the 94th Meeting of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) (2005) it was recommended that the same <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the}} world explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered {{general purpose tractor}} in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|E

5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters.

Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E
5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, who underwent a personality change after a blasting accident drove an iron rod completely through his head (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation).

Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E

5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls.

It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. Although the process could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> a machine, {{the large amount of}} time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method.|$|E

Their trip across the British India subcontinent was a sightseeing excursion during their last days before sailing to the Middle East, and they stopped to tour the Ellora Caves prior to reaching Bombay. The King soon tired of the long journey, and was bored and restless by the time they arrived at Bombay, where they remained until the departure of their steamship on June 7. There was more in Bombay to interest him: a shopping trip, the Arab Stallion Stables, the Parsi Towers of Silence, and a visit from businessman Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> <b>with</b> Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued to operate, with a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E
