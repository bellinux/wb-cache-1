40|$|In {{order for}} a {{medicinal}} product to get marketing authorization in Europe, it has to demonstrate a positive <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance.</b> Although {{this has been the}} cornerstone of the evaluation process, there is no standardised methodology that is used in this context. Recognising the need for a structured approach that can enhance the transparency and consistency in assessing the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance,</b> the European Medicines Agency (EMA) began a three-year project in early 2009. This project consists of five consecutive work packages. The first four work packages form a research phase that aims to develop and test tools and methods for balancing benefits and risks of medicinal products. The fifth work package is intended for training and initial implementation. Currently, the project has completed its research phase, which recognised the usefulness of two levels of gradation. The first level is a qualitative approach, mainly consisting of a table listing the key effects of the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> and their uncertainty in a common and concise format. The second level, recommended for more complex situations, is a quantitative method that utilises Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to derive a numerical value for the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance.</b> However, the implementation of MCDA in the assessment of a medicine poses some practical challenges that remain to be addressed in the last work package of the project...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{regulators}} make marketing authorisation {{decisions based}} on the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> of a treatment with little input from patients and the public. The aims of this thesis are to apply systematic methods of benefit-risk assessment proposed for use in regulatory decision-making, and examine how they can incorporate patient and public involvement. These aims were met through the investigation of three case studies: efalizumab, rimonabant, and natalizumab. Efalizumab (indication: plaque psoriasis) was withdrawn from the market due to the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. I examined the feasibility of applying descriptive and quantitative frameworks to determine the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> of efalizumab, and evaluated where patient and public involvement can be applied in the decision-making process. Rimonabant (indication: overweight and obesity) was withdrawn from the market due to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders. I conducted a discrete choice experiment to elicit patient and public preferences regarding the benefits and risks of treatment, and developed a probabilistic analysis method to analyse the preference data and determine the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> of rimonabant. Natalizumab (indication: relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis) received authorisation, but the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> was reassessed due to the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Authorisation was maintained with risk minimisation measures. I developed a framework to guide the application, reporting, and evaluation of patient and public involvement in benefit-risk assessment. I then tested the feasibility of the framework with protocols designed to elicit patient and public preferences on the benefits and risks of natalizumab. Based {{on the findings of}} these case studies, preferences can be elicited from patients and the public and used to determine the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> of a medicine. This thesis provides a methodological foundation to guide the application, reporting and evaluation of PPI in the benefit-risk assessment of medicines and improve the legitimacy, transparency, and quality of regulatory decision-making.

40|$|Background: Anticoagulation with {{warfarin}} {{reduces the}} risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but may increase the risk of bleeding. A positive <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> in the overall AF population has been well established, but hardly studied on an individual level. Objectives: To estimate benefits and risks of warfarin treatment for the individual and identify characteristics determining the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance.</b> Methods: The study cohort consisted of patients with AF exposed to warfarin in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Outcomes of interest were ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack, haemorrhagic stroke and major bleed. The probability of an outcome dur-ing exposure was estimated with a Cox proportional hazard model. Attributable risks for each outcome were estimated using the individual probabilities and relative rates of warfarin effects (based on meta-analyses of trials). Each outcome was weighted by 1 -year mortality. The individual net benefit was calculated as the weighted sum of benefits minus adverse effects and then characterized as being less favourable (net benefit 1. 5). Logistic regression was used to identify characteristics that explained a less favourable net benefit. Results: The study population included 33, 772 patients with AF exposed to warfarin. The mean net benefit was 1. 17 (SD 16. 0) ischaemic stroke cases or equivalent prevented. Characteristics that were associated with a less favourable <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> were age > 85 years (OR 2. 82, 95 % CI 2. 37 - 3. 36), presence of congestive heart failure (OR 2. 67, 2. 27 - 3. 14), cancer (OR 2. 51, 2. 19 - 2. 88), minor bleed (OR 2. 68, 2. 25 - 3. 18) and renal insufficiency (OR 3. 30, 2. 37 - 4. 60). Hypertension (OR 0. 41, 0. 36 - 0. 46) and vascular disease (OR 0. 16, 0. 13 - 0. 19) were associated with a favourable <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance.</b> Conclusions: We confirmed that the net benefit of warfarin for the overall AF population is positive.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: The {{treatment}} of early-stage colorectal cancers removed endoscopically depends on histopathologic findings. This study aimed {{to assess the}} <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> for patients who underwent additional surgery after endoscopic resection of a T 1 carcinoma with unfavorable histology. METHODS: From 2000 to 2010, 64 consecutive patients were included in this retrospective study. Specimens resected after endoscopic polypectomy showed {{at least one of}} the following unfavorable factors: no free margin, lymphovascular invasion, poorly differentiated grade, SM 2 - 3 involvement (submucosal invasion greater than 300 μm from the muscularis mucosae), tumor budding, sessile morphology, and piecemeal resection. The main objective was to assess the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> of an oncological resection performed after the polypectomy. Oncological benefit was measured by the lymph node metastasis rate and the persistence of a residual adenocarcinoma on the specimen. The risk was measured by the occurrence of severe complications of grade III-IV or death. The associations between these end points and clinicopathologic variables were evaluated by univariate analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: Five patients (7. 8 %) had lymph node metastases and two (3. 1 %) had residual carcinomas. Eight patients (12. 5 %) had grade III-IV morbidity. There were no deaths. Oncological benefit was associated by logistic regression analysis with patients who presented multiple criteria (≥ 2) that led to surgery (p[*]=[*] 0. 031). The <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> was favorable only for those patients. CONCLUSIONS: Additional surgery is required for patients who present multiple adverse histological criteria. If only one criterion is selected, the indication should be discussed, especially for patients with multiple comorbidities...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Difficulties may be {{encountered}} when undertaking a {{benefit-risk assessment}} {{for an older}} product with well-established use but with a <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> that may have changed over time. This case study investigates this specific situation by applying a formal benefit-risk framework to assess the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> of warfarin for primary prevention of patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We used the qualitative framework BRAT {{as the starting point}} of the benefit-risk analysis, bringing together the relevant available evidence. We explored the use of a quantitative method (stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis) to demonstrate how uncertainties and preferences on multiple criteria can be integrated into a single measure to reduce cognitive burden and increase transparency in decision making. RESULTS: Our benefit-risk model found that warfarin is favourable compared with placebo for the primary prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. This favourable <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> is fairly robust to differences in preferences. The probability of a favourable benefit-risk for warfarin against placebo is high (0. 99) in our model despite the high uncertainty of randomised clinical trial data. In this case study, we identified major challenges related to the identification of relevant benefit-risk criteria and taking into account the diversity and quality of evidence available to inform the benefit-risk assessment. CONCLUSION: The main challenges in applying formal methods for medical benefit-risk assessment for a marketed drug are related to outcome definitions and data availability. Data exist from many different sources (both randomised clinical trials and observational studies), and the variability in the studies is large. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ Knowledge {{about the}} benefit-risk {{profile of a}} drug is limited {{at the time of}} drug {{approval}} and grows over time when the drug is increasingly used in routine daily practice. After drug approval the drug is used within a broader and more heterogeneous population with more comorbidities, {{for a longer period of}} time and under less controlled circumstances compared with the use during premarketing clinical trials. The dynamics of the benefits and the risks of a drug require a life cycle approach in which the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> is continuously evaluated. Proactive pharmacovigilance is part of the life cycle approach and is aimed at early detection and minimisation of risks. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines pharmacovigilance as the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other possible drug-related problems. The responsible regulatory authorities at European and Dutch level are the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board (CBG-MEB), the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre (LAREB) and the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ). Risk minimisation measures (RMMs) are interventions that aim to optimise the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> of a drug by minimising its risks during drug use in clinical practice. These measures intend to prevent or reduce the occurrence or the severity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) ...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{need for}} formal and {{structured}} approaches for beneﬁt–risk assessment of medicines is increasing, {{as is the}} complexity of the scientiﬁc questions addressed before making decisions on the <b>beneﬁt–risk</b> <b>balance</b> of medicines. We systematically collected, appraised and classiﬁed available beneﬁt–risk methodologies to facilitate and inform their future use. Methods A systematic review of publications identiﬁed beneﬁt–risk assessment methodologies. Methodologies were appraised on their fundamental principles, features, graphical representations, assessability and accessibility. We created a taxonomy of methodologies to facilitate understanding and choice. Results We identiﬁed 49 methodologies, critically appraised and classiﬁed them into four categories: frameworks, metrics, estimation techniques and utility survey techniques. Eight frameworks describe qualitative steps in beneﬁt–risk assessment and eight quantify <b>beneﬁt–risk</b> <b>balance.</b> Nine metric indices include threshold indices to measure either beneﬁt or risk; health indices measure quality-of-life over time; and trade-off indices integrate beneﬁts and risks. Six estimation techniques support beneﬁt–risk modelling and evidence synthesis. Four utility survey techniques elicit robust value preferences from relevant stakeholders to the beneﬁt–risk decisions. Conclusions Methodologies to help beneﬁt– risk assessments of medicines are diverse and each is associated with different limitations and strengths. There is not a ‘one-size-ﬁts-all’ method, and a combination of methods may be needed for each beneﬁt–risk assessment. The taxonomy introduced herein may guide choice of adequate methodologies. Finally, we recommend 13 of 49 methodologies for further appraisal for use in the real-life beneﬁt–risk assessment of medicine...|$|E

This study developed a quantitative benefit–risk assessment (BRA) model for statins using multicriteria decision analysis with discrete choice experiments and compared a recent BRA with {{that at the}} time of approval. Patients and methods: Following a systematic review of the literature, the benefit criteria within the statin BRA model were defined as a reduction in the plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and a reduction in myocardial infarction incidence; the risk criteria were hepatotoxicity (Liv) and fatal rhabdomyolysis (Rha). The scores for these criteria were estimated using mixed treatment comparison methods. Weighting was calculated from a discrete choice experiment involving 203 Korean patients. The scores and weights were integrated to produce an overall value representing the <b>benefit–risk</b> <b>balance,</b> and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: In this BRA model, low-density lipoprotein (relative importance [RI]: 37. 50 %) was found to be a more important benefit criterion than myocardial infarction (RI: 35. 43 %), and Liv (RI: 16. 28 %) was a more important risk criterion than Rha (RI: 10. 79 %). Patients preferred atorvastatin, and the preference ranking of cerivastatin and simvastatin was switched post approval because of the emergence of additional risk information related to cerivastatin. Conclusion: A quantitative statin BRA model confirmed that the preference ranking of statins changed post approval because of the identification of additional benefits or risks.

40|$|Human cells {{tolerate}} UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) by translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), {{carried out}} by DNA polymerase η, the POLH gene product. A deficiency in DNA polymerase η due to germ-line mutations in POLH causes the hereditary disease xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV), which is characterized by sunlight sensitivity and extreme predisposition to sunlight-induced skin cancer. XPV cells are UV hypermutable due to the activity of mutagenic TLS across CPD, which explains the cancer predisposition of the patients. However, {{the identity of the}} backup polymerase that carries out this mutagenic TLS was unclear.

Methods: This analysis included 3881 patients. Patients received 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab every 4 weeks, and were observed for 28 weeks. Data on baseline characteristics and adverse events (AE) were collected. Results: Total and serious AE were reported as 167 and 27 events/ 100 patient-years, respectively. The most frequent AE and serious AE were infections. Logistic regression analysis identified the following risk factors for the development of serious infection: concurrent or medical history of respiratory disorders; prednisolone dose at baseline ≥ 5 mg/day; and age ≥ 65 years. Twenty-five patients died, and the standardised mortality ratio, with the Japanese general population in 2008 as reference, was 1. 66, similar to the results from the Japanese cohort study for RA patients.

40|$|Introduction: Dabigatran etexilate is {{used for}} {{preventing}} blood clots and tends to replace older anticoagulants in many of their indications. However, the ‘one dose fits all’ policy is subject to criticism. Recent findings assert the anxiety {{of the scientific community}} concerning the pharmacokinetic properties of dabigatran etexilate, that is, an important interindividual variability including an important genetic variant with a significant dependence of the renal function as route of elimination. Areas covered: This meta-opinion provides an overview of the current knowledge and evidence on the dose tailoring of dabigatran etexilate. It also discusses the remaining challenges to benefit from this perspective strategy to enhance the <b>benefit–risk</b> <b>balance</b> of dabigatran etexilate. Data were searched in the published literature and on regulatory agencies’ websites. Additionally, unpublished data were searched and discussed. Expert opinion: Causality between dabigatran exposure and bleeding risk is now established and recommendations on how to best estimate the drug exposure are published. Additionally, simulating studies revealed that a dose adaptation based on dabigatran plasma concentration estimations could improve the benefit–risk profile of the drug.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Novelties in the {{management}} of type 2 diabetes are dominated by the commercialisation of new glucose-lowering agents, which offer alternatives to older antidiabetic medications, and by the publication of several prospective placebo-controlled outcome trials, which demonstrated not only cardiovascular safety but also cardiovascular and renal protection with some new medications. Areas covered: Updates regarding the use of glucose-lowering agents are discussed from a clinical point of view. Some new viewpoints concern older antidiabetic agents such as metformin, sulfonylureas and glitazones whose <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> has been revisited, especially in high risk patients. The recent data regarding DPP- 4 inhibitors (gliptins) focused on the safety profile of this pharmacological class, including in patients with impaired renal function. The highlight concerns the cardiovascular (and renal) protection by some GLP- 1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide) and SGLT 2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin) in patients with high cardiovascular risk. Finally, efficacy and safety of new combinations and advances in insulin therapy will be briefly discussed. Expert commentary: The recent data from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses and observational real-life studies should trigger a revision of the algorithm for the treatment of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, especially in patients with high cardiovascular and/or renal risk.

Surface functionalization by acid treatment {{has been described as}} an easy way to reduce the CNT hydrophobicity and biopersistance. Its impact on in vitro cellular response remained however unclear with numerous contradictions between studies. This work aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the acid functionalization effects on cellular activity. The impact of (1) the CNT purification from their catalytic impurities and (2) the presence of surface acid groups have been discriminated. A thermal desorption treatment to remove surface acid groups has been conducted after acid functionalization by HNO 3, H 2 SO 4. After a complete physicochemical characterization, the biological toxicity was evaluated on RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages. Results showed that acid functionalization leads to (1) a decrease of the pro-inflammatory response, oxidative stress {{and to a lesser extent}} cytotoxicity due to the CNT purification, and (2) an increase of the pro-inflammatory response due to the surface acid groups.

40|$|Growing {{awareness}} about the relevance of formal evaluation of the efficacy and safety in children has resulted into important changes in the requirements for the approval of medicines for children. In this thesis a model-based approach is proposed to ensure more efficient use of the evidence available from historical data. The work presented provides a quantitative framework {{for the assessment of}} the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> prior to drug approval. Three central questions are addressed, which refer to the need to ensure that accurate inferences are made about the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic intervention, especially when considering long-term outcome. In brief, we demonstrate how modelling and simulations can be applied together with multi-criteria decision analysis to address essential clinical, scientific and regulatory questions. Focus is given to the opportunity for optimising experimental protocol design (evidence generation) and integrating existing knowledge about the drug and the disease in the target population (evidence synthesis). These concepts are illustrated by real-life examples on the treatment of transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies, but the proposed framework can be extrapolated to a broader range of diseases and conditions. We anticipate that some of the meta-analytical elements presented here will become embedded into daily practice in pharmaceutical R&D. Promotor: M. Danhof, Co-promotor: O. E.

40|$|Therapeutic {{hypothermia}} (TH) {{is considered}} a standard of care in the post-resuscitation phase of cardiac arrest. In experimental models of traumatic brain injury (TBI), TH {{was found to have}} neuroprotective properties. However, TH failed to demonstrate beneficial effects on neurological outcome in patients with TBI. The absence of benefits of TH uniformly applied in TBI patients should not question the use of TH as a second-tier therapy to treat elevated intracranial pressure. The management of all the practical aspects of TH is a key factor to avoid side effects and to optimize the potential benefit of TH in the treatment of intracranial hypertension. Induction of TH can be achieved with external surface cooling or with intra-vascular devices. The therapeutic target should be set at a 35 °C using brain temperature as reference, and should be maintained at least during 48 hours and ideally over the entire period of elevated intracranial pressure. The control of the rewarming phase is crucial to avoid temperature overshooting and should not exceed 1 °C/day. Besides its use in the management of intracranial hypertension, therapeutic cooling is also essential to treat hyperthermia in brain-injured patients. In this review, we will discuss the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> and practical aspects of therapeutic temperature management in TBI patients...|$|E
40|$|Metformin is {{unanimously}} {{considered a}} first-line glucose-lowering agent. Theoretically, however, it cannot be prescribed {{in a large}} proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes because of numerous contraindications that could lead to an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Various observational data from real-life have shown that many diabetic patients considered to be at risk still receive metformin and often without appropriate dose adjustment, yet apparently with no harm done and particularly no increased risk of lactic acidosis. More interestingly, recent data have suggested that type 2 diabetes patients considered at risk {{because of the presence of}} traditional contraindications may still derive benefit from metformin therapy with reductions in morbidity and mortality compared with other glucose-lowering agents, especially sulphonylureas. The present review analyzes the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> of metformin therapy in special populations, namely, patients with stable coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, renal impairment or chronic kidney disease, hepatic dysfunction and chronic respiratory insufficiency, all conditions that could in theory increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Special attention is also paid to elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, a population that is growing rapidly, as older patients can accumulate several comorbidities classically considered contraindications to the use of metformin. A review of the recent scientific literature suggests that reassessment of the contraindications of metformin is now urgently needed to prevent physicians from prescribing the most popular glucose-lowering therapy in everyday clinical practice outside of the official recommendations.

40|$|Pulmonary {{embolism}} (PE) {{cannot be}} diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, {{because of the}} lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20 % or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3 -month period with a 5 -day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2 - 3. This initial period of 3 months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance</b> are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions...|$|E
40|$|Osteoporosis {{accounts}} for about 3 % of total European health-care spending. The low proportion of costs for the pharmacological prevention of osteoporotic fracture means that it is highly cost saving, especially in patient with severe osteoporosis or patients who cannot take certain osteoporosis medications due to issues of contraindications or tolerability. Following recent regulatory changes, strontium ranelate is now indicated in patients with severe osteoporosis for whom treatment with other osteoporosis treatments is not possible, and without contraindications including uncontrolled hypertension, established, current or past history of ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease. We review here today’s evidence for the safety and efficacy of strontium ranelate. The efficacy of strontium ranelate in patients complying with the new prescribing information (i. e. severe osteoporosis without contraindications) has been explored in a multivariate analysis of clinical trial data, which concluded that the antifracture efficacy of strontiumranelate is maintained in patients with severe osteoporosis without contraindications and also demonstrated how the new target population mitigates risk. Strontium ranelate is therefore an important alternative in today’s management of osteoporosis, with a positive <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>balance,</b> provided that the revised indication and contraindications are followed and cardiovascular risk is monitored. The bone community should be reassured that there remain viable alternatives in patients in whom treatment with other agents is not possible and protection against the debilitating effects of fracture is still feasible in patients with severe osteoporosis.
