5|$|Chr√©tien's {{position}} {{was far more}} difficult than Johnson's: Part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> the country away from large scale constitutional debates. Provincial governments were also far more hostile to the constitutional process {{than they had been}} in the decade prior, with even the federal government's typical ally, Ontario, being firmly against any pursuit of constitutional accommodation.|$|E
5|$|International trade, {{facilitated}} by the shipping route in adjacent Strait of Malacca, and manufacturing are the key sectors. Malaysia is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources, and petroleum is a major export. Malaysia has once been the largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil in the world. Manufacturing has a large influence in the country's economy, although Malaysia's economic structure has <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> away from it. Malaysia {{remains one of the}} world's largest producers of palm oil.|$|E
5|$|The Andes are {{a site of}} {{volcanic}} activity, which is usually subdivided into four separate volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. These volcanic zones are separated by gaps where no recent volcanic activity has occurred. These gaps are not static; the gap separating the Austral and the Southern Volcanic Zones has <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> northward for the past 15-20 million years.|$|E

5|$|The {{orbital motion}} of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular {{separation}} of 3arcseconds and a maximum of 11arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300mm (12in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A periastron occurred in 1994 and the pair have since <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.|$|E
5|$|Due to its sudden {{development}} and project track into southwest Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued {{a tropical storm}} warning and hours later a hurricane warning from the Dry Tortugas to Marathon in the Florida Keys and along the southwestern coastline northward to Fort Myers. A hurricane watch was also issued from Marathon to Jupiter Inlet. At {{the time of the}} issuance of the hurricane warning, Alberto had <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> steadily northeastward; extrapolating its motion indicated a landfall on Key West within 12hours and a mainland landfall at Key Largo within 24hours. Additionally, most computer models predicted Alberto to continue northeastward across south Florida. Only one model, not available until later, suggested a weakness in steering currents that would prevent a Florida landfall.|$|E

5|$|In early December, the ITCZ spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} {{near the}} boundary between the south-west Indian and Australian regions. On December8, the MFR estimated that a disturbance formed just within the Australian region, which entered this basin on December9. After the convection developed into a central dense overcast, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Elvina on December10. Later that day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 85km/h (50mph). On December11, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph). By that time, Elvina had <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> steadily west-southwestward, although the storm slowed on December12. A polar trough caused the storm to accelerate to the southwest on December14 while simultaneously increasing wind shear, causing weakening. On December16, Elvina dissipated well to the south of Diego Garcia.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{years before}} Oceanic 815 crashes on the island, Rousseau was a heavily {{pregnant}} {{member of a}} six-person crew aboard a French research vessel three days out of Tahiti. The crew picked up a radio signal emanating from the South Pacific, which was a repeating set of six numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. While attempting to find {{the source of the}} signal, the ship ran aground on rocks surrounding the island. Before reaching the shore, Rousseau and her team found Oceanic 815 survivor Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) in the water, who had been time-travelling {{as a result of the}} time shifts which had <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> him and the flight survivors through the island's history.|$|E
5|$|Several {{more people}} are {{attacked}} and reduced to ash. A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian night nurse Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is gone when they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits the entity needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on their exposure levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and has <b>been</b> <b>moving</b> him around to both protect him and contain the entity. Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought the entity back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally able to solve the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over the phone that his brother and the entity cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, the entity escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop the entity from attacking another victim.|$|E
