5|$|The {{sequence}} of earthquakes caused widespread landslides {{from the coast}} to east of Scotia and from the northern extent of the Eel River basin near Thompson Hill to south of Petrolia. Most of these were existing landslides that had been re-initiated and {{the largest of the}} slides were either slumps or <b>bedding</b> <b>plane</b> failures along the coastal bluffs. Several slump failures between Guthrie Creek and Oil Creek stretched from the bluffs out towards the shore for a distance of , leaving some of the slide to be eroded by the surf. The road between Ferndale and Petrolia was closed {{for more than a week}} where about six mostly minor landslides blocked the passage, with the roadway itself sustaining light damage due to sliding or settlement of the road fill in a few instances. One of the largest slides occurred along the railroad tracks at the Scotia bluffs where previous slides had taken place. That slide also took about a week to clear.|$|E
30|$|In {{the upper}} {{structure}} of {{the central part of}} the Western Annex Hall (N 2), 54 % of sandstone blocks have vertical <b>bedding</b> <b>planes.</b> Many sandstone blocks with square ends are also observed in the platforms of the Eastern Annex Hall (N 1) and U-shaped Extensions (O 1 and O 2), and almost half of them have vertical <b>bedding</b> <b>planes.</b> Similarly, sandstone blocks with square ends are frequently observed in the Gopura V (W) and Gopura IV (T), and almost half of them have vertical <b>bedding</b> <b>planes.</b> In contrast, the large sandstone blocks used in the Central Sanctuary (B), South Gopura (A), Gallery (D), and Eastern Building (F) have mainly horizontal <b>bedding</b> <b>planes.</b> Sandstone blocks with face bedding are also observed in the South Gopura (A) and Gallery (D). In the remaining buildings, horizontally-elongated sandstone blocks, with high width/thickness ratios and primarily horizontal <b>bedding</b> <b>planes,</b> were used.|$|R

25|$|A paraconformity {{is a type}} of {{unconformity}} {{in which}} strata are parallel; there is no apparent erosion and the unconformity surface resembles a simple <b>bedding</b> <b>plane.</b> It is also called nondepositional unconformity or pseudoconformity.|$|E
25|$|A {{disconformity}} is an unconformity between parallel {{layers of}} sedimentary rocks which represents {{a period of}} erosion or non-deposition. Disconformities are marked by features of subaerial erosion. This type of erosion can leave channels and paleosols in the rock record. A paraconformity {{is a type of}} disconformity in which the separation is a simple <b>bedding</b> <b>plane</b> with no obvious buried erosional surface.|$|E

50|$|In a {{flexural}} slip algorithm deformation occurs by unfolding the deformed fault bounded horse by slip along <b>bedding</b> <b>planes.</b> This modelling mechanism does {{represent a}} real geological mechanism, {{as shown by}} slickensides along folded <b>bedding</b> <b>planes.</b> The shape of the unfolded horse is further constrained either by using the restored fault boundary to the previous horse in the restored section of by using an internal pin within the block itself, assuming this was unsheared during the deformation. This algorithm is normally only used in software based restoration. It preserves both area and line length.|$|R
2500|$|Thalassinoides are burrows which occur {{parallel}} to the <b>bedding</b> <b>plane</b> of the rock and are extremely abundant in rocks, worldwide, from the Jurassic period onwards. They are repeatedly branched, with a slight swelling present at the junctions of the tubes. The burrows are cylindrical and vary from 2 to 5nbsp&cm (0.8" [...] to 2") in diameter. Thalassinoides sometimes contain scratch marks, droppings or the bodily remains of the crustaceans which made them.|$|E
2500|$|Landslides {{in which}} the sliding surface is mostly deeply located below the maximum rooting depth of trees (typically to depths greater than ten meters). Deep-seated {{landslides}} usually involve deep regolith, weathered rock, and/or bedrock and include large slope failure associated with translational, rotational, or complex movement. This type of landslide potentially occurs in an tectonic active region like Zagros Mountain in Iran. [...] These typically move slowly, only several meters per year, but occasionally move faster. They tend to be larger than shallow landslides and form along a plane of weakness such as a fault or <b>bedding</b> <b>plane.</b> They can be visually identified by concave scarps {{at the top and}} steep areas at the toe.|$|E

30|$|Figure  12 {{shows that}} the {{groundwater}} flow takes place chiefly through faults and mine shafts. These features form high flow conduits of the groundwater. Fracture networks, joints and <b>bedding</b> <b>planes</b> form other flow paths. Fractures are scattered within the impermeable rock matrix, so that groundwater could also flow through the primary pore space and fracture networks. In addition, the intersection between the faults, joints and <b>bedding</b> <b>planes</b> systems could form local traps of the groundwater. Joints and <b>bedding</b> <b>planes</b> enhance the vertical and semi-vertical groundwater flow. However, the complex interconnection between fractures, fault, shafts and <b>bedding</b> <b>planes</b> increases the heterogeneity and {{the complexity of the}} groundwater flow system in this area. The intersection points between these features and the earth’s surface could contribute in the formation of water springs on the slopes or {{at the bottom of the}} valleys (Fig.  12). Figure  12 also {{shows that the}} groundwater, including the mine water, occurs chiefly by infiltration of the precipitation through the mine facilities, the faults, the joints, the <b>bedding</b> <b>planes</b> and the fracture networks. This hypothesis enhanced by the hydrogeological characteristics of the shallow groundwater, represented by Ca–Na–Mg–Cl–SO 4 water type, where the absence of the predominant ions refers to the contribution of different water sources to the groundwater recharge in this area. The groundwater recharge through the soil cover could be negligible in this area; this related to the hydraulic properties of the soil. However, the infiltration rate through soil profiles is also related to land use (USAD 2000). Thus, the infiltration rates in the arable fields must be much higher than in forests in this area. The impervious area and other urban facilities should significantly reduce the groundwater recharge. Therefore, different mechanism and important spatial variations predominant the groundwater recharge in the Lottenbachtal catchment area.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to the {{experimental}} investigation of the effect of temperature on the mechanical behavior of a typical anisotropic clayey rock, the Tournemire shale. Hydrostatic and conventional triaxial compression tests are first performed under room temperature for two principal loading orientations, respectively parallel and perpendicular to the <b>bedding</b> <b>planes.</b> The obtained results confirm an anisotropic mechanical behavior observed by the previous works. Further, hydrostatic and triaxial compression tests with different confining pressures are carried out under different temperatures up to 250 °C. With the increase of temperature, there is a significant decrease of Young׳s modulus and the compression failure strength but an increase of the overall deformability of material. The temperature change also affects the anisotropic response related to the deformation of <b>bedding</b> <b>planes...</b>|$|R
