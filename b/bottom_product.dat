5000|$|Distillation is {{a process}} in which we {{separate}} two components where one is overhead distillate and the other is the <b>bottom</b> <b>product.</b> The <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> is mostly liquid while the distillate may be liquid or vapour. This separation requires the following three things: ...|$|E

50|$|The liquid {{from the}} gas {{separator}} vessel is routed through a reboiled stripper distillation tower. The <b>bottoms</b> <b>product</b> from the stripper is the final desulfurized liquid product from hydrodesulfurization unit.|$|R
50|$|A forced {{circulation}} reboiler (Image 4) uses a pump to circulate the column bottoms liquid through the reboilers. This is useful if the reboiler must be located {{far from the}} column, or if the <b>bottoms</b> <b>product</b> is extremely viscous.|$|R
50|$|Kettle {{reboilers}} (Image 1) {{are very}} simple and reliable. They may require pumping {{of the column}} bottoms liquid into the kettle, or there may be sufficient liquid head to deliver the liquid into the reboiler. In this reboiler type, steam flows through the tube bundle and exits as condensate. The liquid {{from the bottom of}} the tower, commonly called the bottoms, flows through the shell side. There is a retaining wall or overflow weir separating the tube bundle from the reboiler section where the residual reboiled liquid (called the <b>bottoms</b> <b>product)</b> is withdrawn, so that the tube bundle is kept covered with liquid and reduce the amount of low-boiling compounds in the <b>bottoms</b> <b>product.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> {{from the}} demethanizer is also warmed {{in the cold}} box, as it cools the inlet gas, before it leaves the system as NGL.|$|E
50|$|The {{distillation}} column contains one feed component, xf. The top product is distillate which {{is represented by}} xDand the <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> containing composition ofxB of the light component.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{extractive}} distillation uses a separation solvent, {{which is generally}} non-volatile, has a high boiling point and is miscible with the mixture, but doesn't form an azeotropic mixture. The solvent interacts differently with {{the components of the}} mixture thereby causing their relative volatilities to change. This enables the new three-part mixture to be separated by normal distillation. The original component with the greatest volatility separates out as the top product. The <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> consists of a mixture of the solvent and the other component, which can again be separated easily because the solvent does not form an azeotrope with it. The <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> can be separated by any of the methods available.|$|E
40|$|For the {{conceptual}} design of continuous countercurrent separative reactors, {{there is a}} need to predict the composition of the feasible top and <b>bottom</b> <b>products.</b> These products can be identified as stable singular points of the rectifying and stripping sections at infinite column height. General singular point equations are derived for the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>products</b> of separative reactors at countercurrent operation. They can be applied to phase equilibrium-controlled processes as well as to mass-transfer-controlled processes. For a given reactive mixture, all singular points at the top and at the bottom of a column are located on a unique potential singular point surface. It is demonstrated that interfacial vapour–liquid mass transfer has a strong impact on the feasible reactor products. Reactive distillation and reactive pervaporation of selected ideal and real reaction systems are used as illustrative examples...|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{distillation}} {{increases the}} relative volatility {{of the key}} components in many applications. The higher the relative volatility, the more separable are the two components; this connotes fewer stages in a distillation column in order to effect the same separation between the overhead and <b>bottoms</b> <b>products.</b> Lower pressures increase relative volatilities in most systems.|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} been carried out to apply Fletcher Reeves, Quasi-Newton, BOX, SQP, and Mixed {{optimization}} algorithms to estimate the optimum operating parameters required for the achievement of high purities of trans- 2 -butene and trans- 2 -hexene respectively as the top and the <b>bottom</b> <b>products</b> using olefin metathesis process occurring in a reactive packed distillation column. The process was modeled and optimized with the aid of Aspen HYSYS. The model had a trans- 2 -pentene feed stream containing 1 ppm each of trans- 2 -butene and trans- 2 -hexene flowing at the rate of 35 mL/min into the column at a temperature of 298. 15 K and a pressure of 1. 125 bar. The results obtained from the optimizations of the process revealed that the constrained optimization was better than the unconstrained one for this process because, in the single objective optimizations carried out, the top and the <b>bottom</b> <b>products</b> were desired. It was discovered from the constrained optimizations carried out that Mixed algorithm was the best among the algorithms considered because it was able to give the optimum reflux ratio of 2. 50, the optimum feed flow rate of 43. 75 mL/min and the optimum reboiler duty of 0. 28 kW that yielded trans- 2 -butene of mole fraction value of 1. 0000 and trans- 2 -hexene of mole fraction of 0. 9422 as the top and the <b>bottom</b> <b>products,</b> respectively...|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{requirement}} {{either of the}} phases can be withdrawn as a product and the other phase can be recycled back as reflux. The pure ester i.e. butyl acetate, being the least volatile component in the system, is realized as a <b>bottom</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> {{oil from}} the main {{fractionator}} contains residual catalyst particles which were not completely removed by the cyclones {{in the top of}} the reactor. For that reason, the <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> oil is referred to as a slurry oil. Part of that slurry oil is recycled back into the main fractionator above the entry point of the hot reaction product vapors so as to cool and partially condense the reaction product vapors as they enter the main fractionator. The remainder of the slurry oil is pumped through a slurry settler. The bottom {{oil from the}} slurry settler contains most of the slurry oil catalyst particles and is recycled back into the catalyst riser by combining it with the FCC feedstock oil. The clarified slurry oil or decant oil is withdrawn from the top of slurry settler for use elsewhere in the refinery, as a heavy fuel oil blending component, or as carbon black feedstock.|$|E

40|$|A {{summary of}} basic {{characteristics}} for n-Pentyl Acetate production in a reactive distillation column is achieved.

40|$|The jig is {{efficient}} in separating relatively low density particles such as plastics; however conventional discharge devices attached to jigs cause mechanical {{disruption of the}} stratified layers at the outlet from the separation chamber, and decrease the grade of the recovered <b>bottom</b> layer <b>product.</b> A new device was developed for efficiently separating high grade <b>bottom</b> layer <b>product,</b> better than 99 %, where particles of the bottom and top layers are recovered as overflow products by agitation with water pulsation...|$|R
40|$|When {{operating}} the DCBS (and DCBR) configuration(s) the liquid {{composition of the}} common vessel of the two columns must be kept between the two azeotropic compositions with affecting the flow rates of the two products. These can be varied by changing the reboil ratio and/or ratio of division of the liquid flow leaving the common vessel. The goals of this paper: -to propose and study a simple control scheme with PID parameters (providing good quality of control) for the new configuration, -investigation {{of the influence of}} the liquid division ratio, -determination of optimal value of liquid division ratio (providing the prescribed separation with minimal specific energy consumption). The calculations were made for a minimum (n-pentane - acetone) azeotropic mixture by using a professional dynamic simulator (CCDCOLUMN). By the aid of a PID controller we modified the flow rate of the <b>bottom</b> <b>products</b> (affecting the reboil ratios of the columns). We investigated the action of the control loops and the system for two different set points. In the first case the composition of the <b>bottom</b> <b>products,</b> in the second one – most common in the industry- the bottom temperatures were kept constant...|$|R
50|$|During {{operation}} (after {{charging the}} pot and starting up the system) the high boiling constituents are primarily separated from the charge mixture. The liquid in the pot is depleted in the high boiling constituents, and enriched in low boiling ones. The high boiling product is routed into the <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> receivers. The residual low boiling product is withdrawn from the charge pot. This mode of batch distillation is very seldom applied in industrial processes.|$|E
50|$|MDO is {{made from}} a {{catalytic}} cracking/visbreaking refinery. The catalytic cracking operation breaks large molecules into small molecules. It happens in high temperature and with appropriate catalyst. Visbreaking {{is a process that}} turn the <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> of the vacuum unit, which has extremely high viscosity, into lower viscosity, marketable product. In visbreaking, a relatively mild thermal cracking operation is performed. And the amount of cracking is limited by the overruling requirement to safeguard the heavy fuel stability.|$|E
50|$|Ethylene oxide de-sorber: The aqueous stream {{resulting}} from the above scrubbing process is then sent to the ethylene oxide de-sorber. Here, ethylene oxide is obtained as the overhead product, whereas the <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> obtained {{is known as the}} ‘glycol bleed’. When ethylene oxide is scrubbed from the recycle gas with an aqueous solution, ethylene glycols (viz. mono-ethylene glycol, di-ethylene glycol and other poly-ethylene glycols) get unavoidably produced. Thus, in-order to prevent them from building up in the system, they are continuously bled off.|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} swing {{separation of}} a binary minimum azeotrope (n-pentane-acetone) {{in a double}} column batch stripper is studied by rigorous simulation. For controlling the product compositions a simple scheme is presented. On the basis of temperatures of <b>bottoms</b> <b>product</b> PID controllers manipulate their flow rates varying the reboil ratios. The controllers are tuned. The influence {{of the most important}} operational parameter (division ratio of liquid leaving the common top vessel) is investigated. For rigorous simulation calculations a professional dynamic flowsheet simulator is applied...|$|R
50|$|The <b>bottoms</b> <b>product</b> {{from the}} {{stabilizer}} is the high-octane liquid reformate {{that will become}} {{a component of the}} refinery's product gasoline.Reformate can be blended directly in the gasoline pool but often it is separated in two or more streams. A common refining scheme consists in fractionating the reformate in two streams, light and heavy reformate. The light reformate has lower octane and can be used as isomerization feedstock if this unit is available. The heavy reformate is high in octane and low in benzene, hence it is an excellent blending component for the gasoline pool.|$|R
30|$|In this work, a {{commercial}} process simulator {{was used as}} a tool for evaluating performance of the systems. The base case (direct sequence) was composed of two distillation columns. Generally, degree of freedom of a conventional two-product distillation column with a condenser and reboiler is 2. Therefore, for a two-product column, it is only possible to specify two specifications. In our simulations for two-product columns, recovery and purity of one of the products were the two used design parameters. These specifications, along with feed conditions and feed stage govern performance of the column. So, the other characteristics of the separation processes (including required reflux ratios, boil up ratios, condenser duties and reboiler duties) were obtained by running the simulation and solving Mass balance, Equilibrium, Summation of mole fractions =  1 and Heat balance (MESH equations) at all stages of the column. The energy requirements of the systems were evaluated by solving MESH equations. In designing the proposed bottom flashing configuration, operating parameters were adjusted to supply the same operating conditions for the columns. The main idea was to reduce energy requirements of the system by transferring heat from top to <b>bottom</b> <b>products.</b> For a specific compression ratio, a fraction of required energy was saved through heat transfer from top to <b>bottom</b> <b>products,</b> and the remaining energy was supplied by heaters/coolers.|$|R
50|$|The Union Carbide (UCC) process, {{also known}} as {{low-pressure}} oxo process (LPO), relies on a rhodium catalyst dissolved in high-boiling thick oil, a higher molecular weight condensation product of the primary aldehydes, for the hydroformylation of propene. The reaction mixture is separated in a falling film evaporator from volatile components. The liquid phase is distilled and butyraldehyde is removed as head product while the catalyst containing <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> is recycled to the process. The process is carried out at about 1.8 MPa and 95-100 °C.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to select a suitable separation solvent {{for this type of}} distillation. The solvent must alter the relative volatility by a wide enough margin for a successful result. The quantity, cost and availability of the solvent should be considered. The solvent should be easily separable from the <b>bottom</b> <b>product,</b> and should not react chemically with the components or the mixture, or cause corrosion in the equipment. A classic example to be cited here is the separation of an azeotropic mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, where aniline is one suitable solvent.|$|E
5000|$|To [...] "jump" [...] the {{azeotrope}}, the azeotrope can {{be moved}} by altering the pressure. Typically, pressure will be set such that the azeotrope will differ from the azeotrope at ambient pressure by some percent in either direction. For an ethanol-water mixture, that may be at 93.9% for 20bar overpressure, instead of 95.3% at ambient pressure. The distillation then works in the opposite direction, with the ethanol emerging in the bottoms and {{the water in the}} distillate. While in the low pressure column, ethanol is enriched {{on the way to the}} top end of the column, the high pressure column enriches ethanol on the bottom end, as ethanol is now the highboiler. The top product (water as distillate) is then again fed to the low pressure column, where the normal distillation is done. The <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> of the low pressure column primarily consists of water, while the bottom stream of the high pressure column is nearly pure ethanol at concentrations of 99% or higher. Pressure swing distillation essentially inverts the K-values and subsequently inverts which end of the column each component comes out when compared to standard low pressure distillation.|$|E

[...] The overhead stream may be cooled and condensed using a water-cooled or air-cooled condenser. The bottoms reboiler may be a steam-heated or hot oil-heated heat exchanger, or even a gas or oil-fired furnace.|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} is to draw a {{straight}} line from the origin of the graph to the point where x and y both equal 1.0, which is the x = y line in Figure 1. This 45 degree line is used simply as a graphical aid for drawing the remaining lines. Then draw the equilibrium line using the VLE data points of the lower boiling component, representing the equilibrium vapor phase compositions for each value of liquid phase composition. Also draw vertical lines from the horizontal axis up to the x = y line for the feed and for the desired compositions of the top distillate product and the corresponding <b>bottoms</b> <b>product</b> (shown in red in Figure 1).|$|R
5000|$|The {{industry}} {{has attempted to}} define [...] "flushability". They encourage voluntary testing of flushability by producers.

30|$|Based on the {{obtained}} results, it {{was concluded}} that, for direct sequence, the proposed system will result in energy and costs savings, when the temperature difference between <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> of first column (feed of the second column) and top product of the second column is small (i.e. smaller than °C). Similarly, for indirect sequence, the proposed system will result in energy and costs savings, when the temperature difference between top product of first column (feed of the second column) and <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> of the second column is small (i.e., smaller than 15  °C). Required compression ratio is directly dependent to these temperature differences. For instance, in indirect sequence, the main idea was to transfer heat from top product of the column to the <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> of the first column. Outlet pressure of the valve should be small enough for having a minimum logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD) in the heat exchanger. The larger the temperature difference, the smaller the required outlet pressure of the valve (and compression ratio). Therefore, compression ratio is directly dependent to this parameter, and the mentioned temperature difference {{plays a significant role}} in economic performance of the system.|$|E
30|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> of {{this column}} known as {{kerosene}} should be cooled using an air cooler and a cooler {{to reach the}} ambient temperature. The third side stream of the distillation column exiting from tray 29 went to the gasoil side stripper. The steam at temperature of 350  °C and pressure of 13.8 bara entered this column.|$|E
30|$|Tóth et al. (2011) used {{distillation}} and {{membrane filtration}} process for treatment of PIWW, which contains high chemical oxygen demand and adsorbable organically bound halogens (AOX). The distillation was capable of reducing volatile chemical oxygen demand (VOC-COD) and AOX, while the {{membrane filtration process}} was beneficial {{for the treatment of}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>product</b> of rectification to concentrate the non-volatile pollutants, reducing the COD values close to the emission limits.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a calculation procedure for modeling and control simulation of a condensate distillation column {{based on the}} energy balance (-) structure. In this control, the reflux rate and the boilup rate are used as the inputs to control the outputs of {{the purity of the}} distillate overhead and the impurity of the <b>bottom</b> <b>products.</b> The modeling simulation is important for process dynamic analysis and the plant initial design. In this paper, the modeling and simulation are accomplished over three phases: the basic nonlinear model of the plant, the full-order linearised model, and the reduced-order linear model. The reduced-order linear model is then used as the reference model for a model-reference adaptive control (MRAC) system to verify the applicable ability of a conventional adaptive controller for a distillation column dealing with the disturbance and the model-plant mismatch as the influence of the plant feed disturbances...|$|R
40|$|Heat pump {{assisted}} distillation with {{an external}} working fluid {{is one of}} the most obvious methods to reduce the energy consumption in a distillation process. The heat pump working fluid extracts heat from the top of the column, increases the temperature of the recovered heat and recycles it to provide the heat input to the reboiler. The interaction between the external parameters and the internal parameters for a specially designed heat pump assisted distillation system has been studied experimentally. The external parameters were mass flow rate, temperature and concentration of the feed, the concentration of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>products</b> and the mass flow rate of the working fluid. The effects of the variations of these external parameters on the internal parameters such as the energy (steam) consumption, the actual coefficient of performance and the temperatures at the top and bottom of the column, together with the condensation and evaporation temperatures, are presented. ...|$|R
5000|$|Heterogeneous {{distillation}} {{means that}} during the distillation the liquid phase of the mixture is immiscible.In this case on the plates can be two liquid phases and the top vapour condensate splits in two liquid phases, which can be separated in a decanter.The simplest case of continuous heteroazeotropic distillation is the separation of a binary heterogeneous azeotropic mixture. In this case the system contains two columns and a decanter. The fresh feed (A-B) is added into the first column. (The feed may also be added into the decanter directly or into the second column depending on {{the composition of the}} mixture). From the decanter the A-rich phase is withdrawn as reflux into the first column while the B-rich phase is withdrawn as reflux into the second column. This mean the first column produces [...] "A" [...] and the second column produces [...] "B" [...] as a <b>bottoms</b> <b>product.</b> In the industry the butanol-water mixture is separated with this technique.|$|R
