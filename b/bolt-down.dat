Temporary <b>bolt-down</b> installations can be ideal for planners in testing {{the use and}} positioning of speed bumps before implementing them in a larger project. <b>Bolt-down</b> products can also be removed or relocated during winter snow periods—where speed bumps are easily concealed and may be damaged by snowplows.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the mid-1960s}} {{scientific}} gear was loaded into numerous boxes and carried on board scientific research vessels, sometimes finding that a crucial item {{had been left}} ashore. Frank Snodgrass solved this problem by designing and building a portable laboratory housing the equipment already assembled and pretested. The portable laboratory was then brought aboard, ready for action. Decks were later converted to provide <b>bolt-downs</b> for securing portable laboratories and this became standard practise.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>bolt-down</b> {{design has}} flanges on both its lid and its body for bolts {{to be passed}} through, and usually uses wingnuts that hinge on the body and so are never fully removed from the cooker; this sealing design is {{typically}} used for larger units such as canning retorts and autoclaves. It is very simple to produce, and it can seal with simple and inexpensive gaskets.|$|E
