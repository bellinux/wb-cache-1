To circumvent this restriction, we can instantiate a template for all possible combinations of type arguments at compile time and then select the proper instance at run time by evaluation of some provided conditions.

5000|$|RISC-V {{does not}} support {{predication}} (the conditional execution of instructions) as its designers claim that CPUs without predication are easier to design, and optimizing compilers {{are less likely to}} mistakenly use predication where it should not be used. The designers claim that very fast, out-of-order CPU designs do predication anyway, by doing the comparison <b>branch</b> and conditional <b>code</b> in parallel, then discarding the unused path's effects. They also claim that even in simpler CPUs, predication is less valuable than branch prediction, which can prevent most stalls associated with conditional <b>branches.</b> <b>Code</b> without predication is larger, with more branches, but they also claim that a compressed instruction set (such as RISC-V's set [...] "C") solves that problem in most cases.|$|R
