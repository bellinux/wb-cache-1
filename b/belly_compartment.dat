40|$|An {{investigation}} of a 1 / 24 - scale dynamically similar model of the Douglas C- 124 airplane was made to determine the ditching characteristics and proper technique for ditching the airplane. Various conditions of damage, landing attitude, flap setting, and speed were investigated. The behavior of the model was determined from visual observations, motion- picture records, and time-history deceleration records. The {{results of the investigation}} are presented in table form, photographs, and curves. It was concluded on the basis of results from model tests with scale-strength bottoms (equivalent to 1150 pounds per square foot, full scale) that the airplane should be ditched at a medium nose-high landing attitude (near 7 deg) with flaps full down. The airplane will probably make a smooth run with considerable damage resulting to the fuselage bottom just forward of the wing, but it is not likely that the water inflow will be overwhelming to personnel provided they are not in the <b>belly</b> <b>compartment.</b> Longitudinal decelerations in calm water will be about 2 1 / 2 g and the landing run will be about four fuselage lengths...|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is constructed}} from carbon (fiber)-composite.Two 770 liters air-conditioned cells on its sides {{are designed to}} receive stretchers and casualties. The cells will also have devices for transfusions during flight. Initial interior cabin noise was measured in hover at 95 decibels without any incorporated acoustic treatment or liners.An additional 1,100 liters are available in an optional <b>belly</b> mounted <b>compartment.</b> The fuselage forms an airfoil and generates over 50% of lift at high speed (US Patent # 7,806,362B2). An aerodynamic bulge between the ducted fans keeps the airflow attached to it, hence generating lift, while diverting the airflow into the aft fan for increased thrust.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{intersection}} syndrome, described {{since the}} 19 th century, is an uncommon disorder {{associated with the}} abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis <b>bellies</b> (first dorsal <b>compartment)</b> rubbing against the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis tendons (second dorsal compartment). Overuse occurred in occupational setting was barely described although {{it could lead to}} compensation by the French health insurance system. We reported a case of an intersection syndrome in a 58 -year-old man who recently became a supermarket cashier. This job involved repeated extension and flexion of the wrist. The disorders arose after a minimal traumatism. Since it is recognized as an occupational disease, compensated ending of the activity causing the disorder could have been obtained...|$|R
