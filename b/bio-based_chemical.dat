Process intensification (PI) is a valuable approach in developing economical processes with a minimal global footprint which will require new infrastructure to be designed and built. An attempt is presented to describe the future architecture of the <b>bio-based</b> <b>chemical</b> industry. The field is in its infancy and it is thus instructive to consider specific case studies of biomass based production routes. The first illustrates a route to mono propylene glycol, an established bulk chemical. The thermo-chemical production of hydrogen from waste biomass streams and the production of base chemicals from amino acids highlight the potential of using agricultural rest streams. Two case studies focus on the use of lignocellulosic biomass in the production of platform molecules (isosorbide and hydroxymethylfurfural) and the last case study on the novel combination of two (relatively) new technologies for a genuinely sustainable production: microwave processing and supercritical extraction technology. In all of these case studies PI aspects are present and major technological challenges are addressed.

We have therefore analysed the entire life cycle of biomaterials: the production of <b>bio-based</b> <b>chemicals,</b> the application of bio-based polymers in packaging and finally the waste treatment of biodegradable materials. Numerous <b>bio-based</b> <b>chemicals</b> offer economic opportunities, the extent of which depends on the prices of the petrochemical and bio-based feedstocks and can be further improved by technological progress in the future (chapter 2). Almost all <b>bio-based</b> <b>chemicals</b> have lower carbon and energy footprints than their petrochemical counterparts, and savings can be substantially increased in the future (chapter 3). Bio-based materials also offer savings when used for a specific food packaging application, but these savings can become smaller when the comparison is made not per kg of material but considering the functionality and material properties (chapter 4). Biodegradable materials are advantageous in that they are suitable for biological waste treatment options whose carbon and energy footprints are currently at least equally good as incineration, but have the additional benefit of producing a soil conditioner which can improve soil carbon content (chapter 5). Finally, consistent policy measures supporting bio-based and/or biodegradable materials are necessary to ensure this market’s success (chapter 6). The progress made in terms of quantifying the benefits, the start of major research & development programmes and the start-up of production facilities have increased the likelihood for many <b>bio-based</b> <b>chemicals</b> and plastics to enter the market.

40|$|Historically, {{growth of}} <b>bio-based</b> <b>chemical</b> {{products}} in the world market has typically been stunted due to their higher production costs as compared to crude petroleum derived products. However due to {{the rising cost of}} oil, increasing demand for environmentally friendly products from a growing population and limited amount of nonrenewable resources, growth for <b>bio-based</b> <b>chemical</b> products has increased. This market growth has propelled the number and size of bio-refineries to increase in the past 10 years. However, the rise in the cost of oil has been accompanied by soaring prices for asphalt because of reductions in its supply. This reduction is primarily due to oil refiners maximizing on the production of transportation fuels through coking. As a result, a substantial amount of binder is produced that cannot be used for production of asphalt mixtures. Warm mix asphalt occurs when mixing and compaction temperatures are lowered by 20 °C to 55 °C in the production and laydown of asphalt mix. This has also {{led to the development of}} bio-derived material additives for warm mix asphalt applications. Depending on the production process, bio-refineries can produce a sizable amount of material with surfactant characteristics. Due to surfactant characteristics, these materials can be used as a bio-based warm mix asphalt (WMA) additive technology. Within this thesis, a bio-derived material - isosorbide distillation bottoms (IDB) -was studied as a warm mix asphalt additive technology, as opposed to other commercially available additive technologies, through a thorough examination of binder rheology and mix performance with various asphalt binders. The first step of this study was to investigate binder rheology to determine the optimum dosage rate of the IDB to various asphalt binders for use in warm mix asphalt. This part of the work resulted in an estimated dosage rate of 0. 5 % by weight of the total binder. Then, the additive was blended at the recommended dosage rate of 0. 5 % to create binders for use in mix production. Warm mix asphalt mixtures were produced for testing at intermediate and low temperatures and compared to warm mix asphalt without an additive and with commercially available additives at the recommended dosage rate. The results showed that IDB performs statistically the same as the other commercial additives; as well as, the same as the control mix. IDB neither harms nor benefits the mixes...|$|E

They {{can be obtained by}} the hydrolysis of potentially inexpensive protein streams such as the byproduct of biofuel production. However, individual amino acids are required before they can be used for the further production of chemicals. Here, the separation of L-aspartic acid (Asp) and L-glutamic acid (Glu) mixture, which can be isolated from protein hydrolysis solutions at low pH or from electrodialysis of complex amino acid mixtures, was studied. RESULTS: Glu was converted into L-pyroglutamic acid (pGlu) which can be separated from the mixture of Asp and Glu due to its higher solubility in water. The conversion was carried out under aqueous or melt conditions. Under aqueous conditions, the conversion was studied as a factor of time, temperature and the amount of Glu. The conversion was specific with high yield and not effected by Asp. After pGlu was separated from Asp and residual Glu by solubility difference, it can be transferred back to Glu through hydrolysis.

40|$|Commercialization of {{lignocellulosic}} biomass as a feedstock for <b>bio-based</b> <b>chemical</b> {{production is}} problematic {{due to the}} high processing costs of pretreatment and saccharifying enzymes combined with low product yields. Such low product yield can be attributed, in large part, to the incomplete utilization of the various carbohydrate sugars found in the lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, we demonstrate that Lactobacillus brevis is able to simultaneously metabolize all fermentable carbohydrates in acid pre-processed rice straw hydrolysate, thereby allowing complete utilization of all released sugars. Inhibitors present in rice straw hydrolysate did not affect lactic acid production.

Runtime: 59 : 38 minutesThe development of catalytic processes for generating <b>bio-based</b> <b>chemicals</b> will require the emergence of new catalytic systems. Given the excess oxygen present, acid catalyzed dehydration is an important reaction in producing <b>bio-based</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The limited volatility of many biobased reactants necessitates that catalytic systems need to be developed that can operate in the aqueous phase. Glucose conversion to 5 -hydoxymethylfurfural (HMF) using a combination of Brønsted and Lewis acid catalysts will be discussed in which a key issue is the balance between Brønsted and Lewis acidity. Water compatible Lewis acid catalysts such as lanthanide chlorides were utilized to give respectable yields of HMF while being operated with less Brønsted acid. Ideally, heterogeneous catalysts could be synthesized for these reactions, however, the materials would need to be hydrothermally stable. Sulfonated carbons, which have been proposed as hydrothermally stable solid Brønsted acid catalysts, were examined under relevant reaction conditions.
