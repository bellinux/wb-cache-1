The properties were set as follows. The circular wooden beam sections were 8  mm diameter with Young’s modulus E =  11, 000  N/mm 2. The PET panels were 1  mm thick with E p =  3700  N/mm 2. The prototype was installed on an OSB <b>base</b> <b>panel</b> by means of four stiff FDM special nodes. The latter are fixed through four screws on it. All the internal nodes were three-way connections. The beams were fitted into a 10  mm deep nodal plastic casing. Neither bolted nor glued connection was practiced. The mutual mechanical interaction between nodes and beams was by contact in case of beam compression, while only the friction limited the sliding in case of traction. Shear and bending were fully transmitted from beams to nodes. At this stage, in the FEM model, all the nodes of GS 0 were estimated as rigid, in a simplified approach. External constraints were supposed as all fixed joints, thanks to the stiffness of the OSB <b>base</b> <b>panel.</b> Material properties are defined as their characteristic values.|$|E

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 800 on 27. 03. 2017 by CS (TIS) This research {{has introduced a}} new concept, "stiffness/strength corrector", which more accurately models variation in masonry properties at various locations (zones) within a masonry wall panel. Derivation of these correctors {{was based on a}} closer mapping of the laboratory experimental results to those obtained from a non-linear finite element analysis of full-scale masonry panels subjected to a uniformly distributed lateral load. In this research only one panel, which was tested in a previous research, was used as the "base panel" and correctors for new panels with and without openings with various boundary conditions were derived by matching similar regions and zones between the new panel and the <b>base</b> <b>panel.</b> The research has also derived the concept of zone similarity between the <b>base</b> <b>panel</b> and any new panel. It was discovered that the types of panel boundaries surrounding specific regions within the two panels govern zone similarity. At first, a manual method for matching zone similarity was proposed based on careful visual inspection to identify similar regions within the two panels. It was found that this method is difficult to implement as the user needs to have a deep knowledge of the behaviour of the panel to be able to accurately locate similar regions/zones. As it was established that the zone similarity was mainly related to the panel boundaries, this knowledge was used to derive appropriate rules for matching zone similarity. These rules were implemented in a cellular automata model which was able to automatically locate similar zones between the <b>base</b> <b>panel</b> and a new panel and assign appropriate corrector values to zones within the new panel. The stiffness/strength corrector values were used to modify global material properties of the panel. A specialised non-linear FEA program for masonry panels was used to analyse a number of panels provided by CERAM with modified rigidities or tensile strength values. Comparison of results with laboratory experimental values shows that with this new method an average 18 % improvement in the prediction of failure load, in comparison with the non-linear FEA results with smeared masonry properties, was possible. The failure patterns for the majority of panels with or without openings, having various sizes and boundary conditions, were much closer to the experimental results. The results of case studies using the new method clearly show that the proposed method is a much better representation of the true behaviour of the masonry panels which models variation in masonry properties and the boundary effects more accurately. The corrector values for any type of new panel are derived from a single <b>base</b> <b>panel</b> in which there was not sufficient data available at different locations. on the panel, particularly near the panel boundaries. Thus, in some cases it uses a crude approximation of the boundary types to establish corrector values for a new panel. If sufficient data points were available more accurate results would have been possible to achieve...|$|E

40|$|Out-of-plane {{laterally}} loaded {{masonry wall}} panels are still much used in modem structures. However {{due to their}} anisotropic and highly composite nature, {{it is extremely difficult}} to understand their behaviour and to date there is no analytical method that is capable of accurately predicting the response of masonry panels to the applied loadings. This {{is one of the major}} obstacles in analysing and designing masonry structures. This research studied a new method that accurately predicts the response of laterally loaded masonry wall panels. In this dissertation, the method of using corrector factors developed by previous researchers was further studied using model updating and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques based on previous experimental results of full scale wall panels tested in the University of Plymouth. A specialised non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) program was used to implement the method developed in this study. The analytical response was compared with other experimental results from different laboratories. Initially, it was found that there was some obvious noise in the experimental load deflection data, which made comparison between FEA and the experimental results very difficult. The research therefore proposed a methodology for minimising the experimental noise based on 3 D surface fitting and regression analyses applied to lateral deflection experimental data. The next step was the detailed study of corrector factors using the numerical model updating procedure. Corrector factors were determined for various zones within a masonry panel (the <b>Base</b> <b>Panel)</b> by minimising the discrepancy between the experimental load deflection data and those obtained from non-linear FE analysis. A detailed model updating procedure was studied including the model analysis, the objective function and the constraint function for the genetic algorithm (GA). A uniqueness study to corrector factors was also carried out. The following step was undertaken to analyse general masonry wall panels using the findings of this study. The concept of zone similarities proposed by previous researcher, which was based on the relative distance of each zone from similar boundaries, was used for applying correctors from the <b>base</b> <b>panel</b> to the new panel to be analysed. A modified cellular automata (CA) model was used to match the similar zones between the new panel and the <b>base</b> <b>panel.</b> The generality and robustness of this method was validated using a number of masonry wall panels tested by various organizations. These walls were single leaf masonry wall panels of clay bricks with different boundary types, dimensions, with and without openings. The main finding in this research are that the boundary effects have a major influence on the response of masonry panels subjected to lateral loading, improperly defined boundary conditions in FEA are the main source of error in the past numerical analysis. Using the corrector factors that are able to properly quantify the actual boundary effects and make appropriate revisions, more accurate analysis is achieved and the predicted response of masonry walls match with their experimental results very well.

Cleats connecting the vertical stiffener and horizontal <b>base</b> <b>panel</b> to T-shaped sandwich joints were reinforced in the through-thickness direction with pins. Tensile (stiffener pull-off) tests revealed that pinning increased the ultimate fracture load and fracture energy by resisting crack growth along the cleat-skin and skin-core interfaces, {{which were the}} weakest points in the unpinned joint. The peak fracture load and fracture energy increased with the volume content of z-pins. The strengthening and toughening effect of the pins was analysed using multiple pin pull-out tests performed on the sandwich composite material. It is shown that elastic deformation, debonding and pull-out of the pins from the face skins to the sandwich composite is the primary toughening mechanism of the pinned T-joints. The pin pull-out process, which is the cause for the high strengthening and toughening of the T-joints, is analysed using bridging traction modelling...|$|E
