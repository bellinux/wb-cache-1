Higher NA productivity in the endosperm of this transgenic rice might have improved Fe accumulation in seeds.

40|$|Inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptors (IP 3 R) are {{intracellular}} Ca 2 + channels. Their opening is {{initiated by}} binding of IP 3 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> IP 3 -binding core (IBC; residues 224 – 604 of IP 3 R 1) and transmitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pore via the suppressor domain (SD; residues 1 – 223). The major conformational changes leading to IP 3 R activation occur within the N terminus (NT; residues 1 – 604). We therefore developed a high-throughput fluorescence polarization (FP) assay using a newly synthesized analog of IP 3, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -IP 3, <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> thermodynamics of IP 3 and adenophostin A binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NT</b> and IBC. Using both single-channel recording and the FP assay, we demonstrate that FITC-IP 3 is a high-affinity partial agonist of the IP 3 R. Conventional [3 H]IP 3 and FP assays provide similar {{estimates of the}} KD for both IP 3 and adenophostin A in cytosol-like medium at 4 °C. They further establish that the isolated IBC retains the ability of full-length IP 3 R to bind adenophostin A with ∼ 10 -fold greater affinity than IP 3. By examining the reversible effects of temperature on ligand binding, we established that favorable entropy changes (TΔS) account for the greater affinities of both ligands for <b>the</b> IBC relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NT</b> and for <b>the</b> greater affinity of adenophostin A relative <b>to</b> IP 3. <b>The</b> two agonists differ more substantially in the relative contribution of ΔH and TΔS <b>to</b> binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> IBC relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NT.</b> This suggests that different initial binding events drive the IP 3 R on convergent pathways toward a similar open state...|$|R

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 60) were subdivided into sham control (SC) group and CCI groups, which were divided according to dosage and time of oral alendronate administration: no treatment (NT), low dosage early (LE), high dosage early (HE), low dosage late (LL) and high dosage late (HL). We measured the thickness and temperature of the hind paw, bone mineral density (BMD) of the tibia, along with tibia bone strength. On the 14 th day post-CCI, the HE group showed significant reduction in thickness and temperature (P< 0. 001). On the 42 nd day post-CCI, the HE group showed significant reduction in temperature compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NT</b> group (P< 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractThe amino {{terminal}} domain (<b>NT)</b> of <b>the</b> connexins {{consists of}} their first 22 – 23 amino acids. Site-directed mutagenesis {{studies have demonstrated that}} NT amino acids are determinants of gap junction channel properties including unitary conductance, permeability/selectivity, and gating in response <b>to</b> transjunctional voltage. <b>The</b> importance of this region has also been emphasized by the identification of multiple disease-associated connexin mutants affecting amino acid residues in <b>the</b> <b>NT</b> region. <b>The</b> first part of <b>the</b> <b>NT</b> is α-helical. <b>The</b> structure of the Cx 26 gap junction channel shows that <b>the</b> <b>NT</b> α-helix localizes within the channel, and lines the wall of the pore. Interactions of the amino acid residues in <b>the</b> <b>NT</b> with those in the transmembrane helices may be critical for holding the channel open. The predicted sites of these interactions and the applicability of the Cx 26 structure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NT</b> of other connexins are considered.

The animals were divided into four groups: No treatment (NT group), GLA treatment only (GLA group), irradiation only (XRT group), and GLA treatment plus irradiation (GLA/XRT group). Rats were killed at different time points. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> mRNA expression of TNF-α in the lungs (compared with non-irradiated lungs).

40|$|The key trend {{preventing}} <b>the</b> Northern Territory (<b>NT)</b> from achieving consistent annual {{population growth}} has been the unpredictability and very high levels of Net Interstate Migration (NIM).

First, it has been dominated by net long-term movement of temporary migrants rather than settlers. Second, the overseas-born have higher rates of interstate migration from <b>the</b> <b>NT</b> than do <b>the</b> Australian-born.
