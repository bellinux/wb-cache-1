5000|$|In a {{landmark}} peer-reviewed paper, also mentioned in The Guardian, {{a team of}} six researchers from the University of Minnesota measured the relationship between editors' edit count and the editors' ability to convey their writings to Wikipedia readers, {{measured in terms of}} persistent word views (PWV)—the number of times a word introduced by an edit <b>is</b> <b>viewed.</b> The accounting method is best described using the author's own words: [...] "each time an article <b>is</b> <b>viewed,</b> each of its words <b>is</b> also <b>viewed.</b> When a word written by editor X <b>is</b> <b>viewed,</b> he or she is credited with one PWV."

5|$|Points {{and lines}} may <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines may <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required.

Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as special cases of it.|$|E

40|$|Adults readily detect {{changes in}} face {{patterns}} {{brought about by}} the inversion of eyes and mouth when the faces <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> upright but not when they <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> upside down. Research suggests that this illusion (the Thatcher illusion) is caused by the interfering effects of face inversion on the processing of second-order relational information (fine spatial information such as the distance between the eyes). In the current study, 6 -month-olds discriminated ‘thatcherized’ faces when they <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> upright but not when they <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> upside down. These results are consistent with the notion that 6 -month-olds are sensitive to second-order relational information while processing faces...|$|R
