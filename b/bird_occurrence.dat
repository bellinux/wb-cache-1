50|$|A bird atlas is an ornithological {{work that}} {{attempts}} to provide information on the distribution, abundance, long-term change as well as seasonal patterns of <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> and make extensive use of maps. They often involve a large numbers of volunteers to cover a wide geographic area and the methods used are standardized so that the studies can be continued {{in the future and}} the results remain comparable. In some cases the species covered may be restricted to those that breed or are resident. Migration atlases on the other hand cover migratory birds depict maps showing summaries of ringing and recoveries.Bird atlases vary in methodology but they always involve spatial (locations) and temporal (time) components. A typical bird atlas project collates data on bird presence or abundance with mapping of this information over a significant geographical region over a well-defined period of time. Data gathered in other efforts, such as breeding bird surveys, may also contribute to atlas projects.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Bird-vegetation {{associations}} are {{a base for}} bird conservation and management, {{as well as for}} predictions of the effects of resource management and climate change on wildlife populations. A recent shift in forest management priorities from timber production to native species' habitat conservation on federal lands has emphasized the need to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of vegetation management on wildlife. The assumption of strong bird-vegetation relationships is rarely tested for forest birds, especially at large temporal extents, which are more likely to reveal instabilities in bird-vegetation relationships than short-term studies. This study aimed to quantify bird-vegetation relationships and investigate their strength in young thinned and unthinned Douglas-fir forest stands over ten to years post thinning. Additionally, this study investigated whether disturbance associated with forest thinning decoupled bird-vegetation relationships in the thinned and unthinned stands. I used abundance or occurrence data for eight bird species collected at 58 point count surveys, conducted during six breeding seasons over ten years following forest thinning. I obtained detailed local-scale vegetation characteristics associated with bird sampling points and modeled <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> or abundance as a function of vegetation characteristics. Vegetation characteristics explaining individual species occurrence or abundance varied among species and among years for any given species. Six out of eight species showed responses to examined vegetation characteristics. For three out of six species, the effects of vegetation characteristics on <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> or abundance remained consistently positive or negative over time. For the other three species the absolute effect of vegetation decreased over time to that of not statistically different from zero. The estimates of vegetation effects on bird response varied in size among years, though they were not statistically different among years. Magnitude of vegetation effect on <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> or abundance did not increase with time, nor was it related to species prevalence or abundance. I found evidence of a response threshold for one species, Swainson's thrush. I suggest that changing abundance of resources, associated with thinning disturbance, demographic stochasticity associated with small population sizes, as well as large-scale demographic processes and possibly life history traits of examined species, mediate the strength of local-level bird-vegetation associations. Variability of vegetation effects on <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> or abundance over time suggests a greater uncertainty of results of vegetation-related wildlife management efforts than has previously been suggested by short-term studies. Therefore, incorporation of the uncertainty of bird-vegetation relationships into predictive models and continued long-term monitoring of species response to management may be crucial for future successful and effective management decisions...|$|E

40|$|Marine {{birds are}} highly mobile organisms that range widely {{and respond to}} dynamic {{features}} in their physical and biological environment at time scales from minutes to decades. Marine spatial planning can help minimize risks to marine birds from new offshore ocean uses such as renewable energy facilities, but requires high-quality spatial information. Maps are needed that characterize the persistent spatial features of at-sea marine <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> probability and relative abundance, as well as uncertainties arising from incomplete sampling and inherent variability. Yet, moving from scattered, heterogeneous at-sea survey transect data to gap-free, high-resolution distribution maps at the relatively fine spatial scales (~ 1 km horizontal resolution or better) often needed for marine spatial planning is a formidable statistical challenge. We present a case-study from the U. S. Mid-Atlantic in which we combine > 30 years of at-sea survey data from 32 datasets with a large database of high-resolution oceanographic and environmental predictor variables to predict marine <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> and abundance. An ensemble machine-learning technique known as component-wise boosting was adapted to account for complex interactions and non-linearities, spatial correlation, temporal effects and zero-inflation. We use this model to develop predictions of individual species and functional group occurrence and abundance, as well as community metrics such as species richness and diversity. We show how model outputs can be tailored to maximize their use to planners, decision-makers, and stakeholders in marine spatial planning processes. Finally, we give real-world examples of how modeling products have been used, and are anticipated to be used, to reduce conflicts between marine bird habitat and ocean energy facilities in the U. S.

Early successional bird species we more likely to occur with increased failed regeneration on the landscape. Some forest habitat generalists were less likely to occur with increased failed regeneration cover at the local scale.

40|$|A major current {{threat to}} the {{persistence}} of forest birds in Canada is forest fragmentation caused by industrial timber harvesting. The traditional silvicultural method of clearcutting creates forest fragments delineated by sharp boundaries. Conversely, selective logging techniques strive to mimic natural disturbance patterns and to produce smoother boundaries. Forest boundaries influence the ecological behaviour of forest birds in a species-specific manner. To assess the effect of forest fragmentation on <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> and to derive management guidelines, I investigate the spatial association between boundaries of six bird species and forest features in a moderately harvested landscape (MHL) and an intensively harvested landscape (IHL) in New Brunswick. The focal bird species were used as indicator species {{for the effects of}} forest fragmentation. These analyses were carried out at both stand and landscape scales. I hypothesized that 1) the association of birds with forest variables would be i) species-specific and ii) stronger in the IHL than in the MHL; 2) that birds would have more common boundaries in the in the ML than in the MHL; 3) that both scales would yield complementary results, whereby the stand scale would refine coarse-scale ecological relationships of birds. By means of boundary detection algorithms and overlap statistics, I found that boundary spatial associations between vegetation and birds were more clearly defined at the stand scale in the IHL. I suggest that the spatial confinement of forest birds in clearcut forests fragments accounts for this relationships. Overall, understory forest components primarily influenced <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence,</b> yet bird response to forest features was species-specific. My findings were consistent at both analysis scales. Management efforts to preserve forest birds should strive to recreate the complexity and variability of natural ecosystems. A multi-scale approach is required in ecological research and monitoring of bird species in fragmented landscapes. For further research, I recommend that studies should include uncut controls, a broader range of treatments than the two that I analyzed, and some replication at all spatial scales. New spatial analytical tools such as boundary detection algorithms and overlap statistics are an asset to ecological studies. The methodology I used offers an objective means for evaluating land fragmentation and the effects of edgeslecotones on populations...|$|E
40|$|Coyote (Canis latrans) food habits were detennined from 490 scats {{collected}} from October 1994 to October 1995 at DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR), along the Nebraska/Iowa border. Mammals occurred most frequently, {{as measured by}} percent-of-scats (POS), followed by vegetation, birds, and invertebrates.

40|$|The {{marginal}} and unproductive {{elements of}} farmland landscapes, such as shrubs, hedgerows, isolated trees and uncultivated patches, represent key habitats for many bird species, {{as far as}} nesting, feeding and protection are concerned. Anyway this marginal vegetation has been removed due to the agricultural intensification which occurred in Europe during the last decades. In this study, the environmental variables known as marginal vegetation, which explain the presence and distribution of farmland bird species, were analyzed using Generalized Linear Models and hierarchical partitioning protocol. Our results have quantified the total contribution of marginal vegetation {{on the presence of}} farmland bird species and also the relative importance of every type of marginal vegetation. These results confirm how these elements, used also as one indication of high nature values of farmlands (HNV), are fit for studies on farmland birds distribution in Central Italy. Some species were more related to hedgerows, while others were related primarily to shrubs and others also to uncultivated marginal patches. The quantification of relative importance of each marginal vegetation is an useful tool for landscape restoration planning.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} adjacent elements for a given patch, through their effects on zoochorous dispersion by frugivorous birds. The case study consists of pine plantations (the focal patch) adjacent to other patches of native vegetation (mixed patches of native forest and shrublands), and/or pine plantations. Our hypothesis is that input of native woody species propagules generated by frugivorous birds within plantations strongly depends {{on the nature of}} the surrounding vegetation. To test this hypothesis, we studied frugivorous-bird abundance, seed dispersion, and seedling establishment in nine pine plantation plots in contact with patches of native vegetation. To quantify adjacency arrangement effects, we used the percentage of common border between a patch and each of its adjacent elements. Frugivorous <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> in pine plantations is influenced by the adjacent vegetation: the greater the contact with native vegetation patches, the more abundant were the frugivorous birds within pine plantations. Furthermore, frugivorous birds introduce into plantations the seeds of a large sample of native fleshy-fruited species. The results confirm the hypothesis that zoochorous seed rain is strongly determined by the kind of vegetation surrounding a given plantation. This finding underlines the importance of the composition of the mosaic surrounding plantations and the availability of mobile link species as key landscape features conditioning passive restoration processes...|$|E

Single-species logistic and autologistic models were created using the 1995 - 96 dataset. Using the 2006 - 07 dataset, models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Predictive models performed best for species associated with open habitats and dense understories, suggesting that we have a relatively good understanding of their habitat requirements.

40|$|Land-use {{change is}} one of the main drivers of current and likely future {{biodiversity}} loss. Therefore, understanding how species are affected by it is crucial to guide conservation decisions. Species respond differently to land-use change, possibly related to their traits. Using pan-tropical data on <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> and abundance across a human land-use intensity gradient, we tested the effects of seven traits on observed responses. A likelihood-based approach allowed us to quantify uncertainty in modelled responses, essential for applying the model to project future change. Compared with undisturbed habitats, the average probability of occurrence of bird species was 7. 8 per cent and 31. 4 per cent lower, and abundance declined by 3. 7 per cent and 19. 2 per cent in habitats with low and high human land-use intensity, respectively. Five of the seven traits tested affected the observed responses significantly: long-lived, large, non-migratory, primarily frugivorous or insectivorous forest specialists were both less likely to occur and less abundant in more intensively used habitats than short-lived, small, migratory, nonfrugivorous/insectivorous habitat generalists. The finding that species responses to land use depend on their traits is important for understanding ecosystem functioning, because species’ traits determine their contribution to ecosystem processes. Furthermore, the loss of species with particular traits might have implications for the delivery of ecosystem services...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] associations between animals and vegetation have long been used as a basis for conservation and management, as well as in formulating predictions about the influence of resource management and climate change on populations. A fundamental assumption embedded in the use of such correlations is that they remain relatively consistent over time. However, this assumption of stationarity has been rarely tested – even for forest birds, which are frequently considered to be ‘indicator species’ in management operations. We investigated the temporal dynamics of bird-vegetation relationships in young Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests over more than a decade following initial anthropogenic disturbance (commercial thinning). We modeled <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> or abundance as a function of vegetation characteristics for eight common bird species for each of six breeding seasons following forest thinning. Generally, vegetation relationships were highly inconsistent in magnitude across years, but remained positive or negative within species. For 3 species, relationships that were initially strong dampened over time. For other species, strength of vegetation association was apparently stochastic. These findings indicate that caution should be used when interpreting weak bird-vegetation relationships found in short-term studies and parameterizing predictive models with data collected over the short term...|$|E

No bird species {{appear to have}} been lost from the area. Between 2001 and 2005, a group of observers conducted systematic bird surveys in most months, which allowed the status (resident, migrant or irregular visitor) of most bird species to be determined. At least three species have established breeding populations in the reserve over the past 10 years. Of 302 species reliably recorded to date, 182 (60. 3 %) appear to be resident, 46 (15. 2 %) are seasonal migrants and 74 (24. 5 %) are vagrant visitors. Eight vulnerable and eight near-threatened bird species have been recorded; Blue Crane, Kori Bustard and African Crowned Eagle have bred in the reserve.

40|$|Ecosystem-based forest {{management}} strives to develop silvicultural practices that best emulate natural disturbances such as wildfire to conserve biodiversity representative of natural forest ecosystems. Yet, current logging practices alter forest structure {{and reduce the}} proportion of old-growth forest and, consequently, can exert long-term effects on the dynamics of forest biota. The stand- and landscape-scale factors driving bird community dynamics in post-disturbance environment remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined bird community dynamics along successional gradients in boreal ecosystems originating from fire and logging in landscapes dominated by old-growth forest. We tested if bird species richness and community compositions in clear-cutting stands became comparable to those in natural stands after 70 years, and identified the relative contributions of stand- and landscape-scale forest attributes in bird community dynamics. Based on records of <b>bird</b> <b>occurrences</b> at 185 field sites in natural and clearcutting stands, we demonstrate that (1) both forest structures and bird communities underwent evident changes along successional gradients in post-clearcutting environment; (2) bird species richness and community composition in 60 - to 70 -years-old clearcutting stands still differed from those in 50 - to 79 -years-old natural stands, {{in spite of the}} fact that most forest attributes of clearcutting stands became comparable to those of natural stands after 40 years; and (3) landscape disturbances contributed more than stand characteristics in explaining the lack of convergence of mature forest species, residents, and short-distance migrants in post-clearcutting environment. Our study points out that more regards should be paid to improve the landscape configuration of the managed forests, and implies that old-growth forest retention within logged areas, combined with selection cutting and prolonged logging rotations, can better emulate fire and alleviate forest harvesting effects on bird community assemblages typical of natural boreal ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to predict land-use/land-cover change at the Sakaerat Environmental ResearchStation (SERS) and to analyze its consequences on the distribution for Black-crested Bulbul (Pycnonotus melanicterus),which is a popular species for bird-watching activity. The Dyna-CLUE model {{was used to determine}} land-use allocationbetween 2008 and 2020 under two scenarios. Trend scenario was a continuation of recent land-use change (2002 - 2008),while the integrated land-use management scenario aimed to protect 45 % of study area under intact forest, rehabilitatedforest and reforestation for renewable energy. The maximum entropy model (Maxent), Geographic Information System(GIS) and FRAGSTATS package were used to predict <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> and assess landscape fragmentation indices,respectively. The results revealed that parts of secondary growth, agriculture areas and dry dipterocarp forest close toroad networks would be converted to other land use classes, especially eucalyptus plantation. Distance to dry evergreenforest, distance to secondary growth and distance to road were important factors for Black-crested Bulbul distributionbecause this species prefers to inhabit ecotones between dense forest and open woodland. The predicted for occurrenceof Black-crested Bulbul in 2008 covers an area of 3, 802 ha and relatively reduces to 3, 342 ha in 2020 for trend scenarioand to 3, 627 ha for integrated-land use management scenario. However, intact habitats would be severely fragmented,which can be noticed by total habitat area, largest patch index and total core area indices, especially under the trendscenario. These consequences are likely to diminish the recreation and education values of the SERS to the public...|$|E
40|$|Most {{research}} on steppe bird habitat selection {{has been focused}} on the effects of management regimes or vegetation structure. However, much less is known on how plant composition is related with steppe <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence.</b> We investigated microhabitat of little bustard territorial males and females during the nesting and chick-rearing season in areas with dominance of pastureland focusing on plant composition. We searched for relationships between preferred vegetation and arthropod abundance in order to identify the contribution of different vegetation typologies in providing essential trophic resources for the species. Surveys of little bustards were made using car and foot transects. Plant composition was obtained within a 50 × 50 cm square at four sampling replicates and arthropod availability was sampled using a sweep net. Statistical procedures were conducted in three steps: (1) analysis of variance was used to identify at univariate level the plant composition and arthropod variables that were significantly related with both male and female occurrence sites; (2) principal components analysis was performed using the variables with significant results at univariate level; (3) model averaging on generalized linear and mixed models was applied to evaluate the selection probability of each principal component. The species occurs in sites with high floristic richness and high abundance of Fabaceae species, although plant composition differs from male to female sites. These variables were found to be crucial to provide higher abundances of arthropods, notably of Acrididea, Formicidae and some groups of Coleoptera which are decisive for the selection of displaying or female breeding sites...|$|E
40|$|The {{value for}} {{biodiversity}} of large intact areas of native vegetation is well established. The biodiversity value of regrowth vegetation is also increasingly recognised worldwide. However, {{there can be}} different kinds of revegetation that have different origins. Are there differences in the richness and composition of biotic communities in different kinds of revegetation? The answer remains unknown or poorly known in many ecosystems. We examined the conservation value {{of different kinds of}} revegetation through a comparative study of birds in 193 sites surveyed over ten years in four growth types located in semi-cleared agricultural areas of south-eastern Australia. These growth types were resprout regrowth, seedling regrowth, plantings, and old growth. Our investigation produced several key findings: (1) Marked differences in the bird assemblages of plantings, resprout regrowth, seedling regrowth, and old growth. (2) Differences in the number of species detected significantly more often in the different growth types; 29 species for plantings, 25 for seedling regrowth, 20 for resprout regrowth, and 15 for old growth. (3) Many bird species of conservation concern were significantly more often recorded in resprout regrowth, seedling regrowth or plantings but no species of conservation concern were recorded most often in old growth. We suggest that differences in <b>bird</b> <b>occurrence</b> among different growth types are likely to be strongly associated with growth-type differences in stand structural complexity. Our findings suggest a range of vegetation growth types are likely to be required in a given farmland area to support the diverse array of bird species that have th...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that large {{fragment}} sizes and high connectivity levels are key components for maintaining species in fragments; however, their relative effects are poorly understood, especially in tropical areas. In order to test these effects, we built models for explaining understory <b>birds</b> <b>occurrence</b> in a fragmented Atlantic Rain Forest landscape with intermediate habitat cover (3 %). Data from over 9000 mist-net hours from 17 fragments differing in size (2 - 175 ha) and connectivity (considering corridor linkages and distance to nearby fragments) were ranked under a model selection approach. A total 1293 individuals of 62 species were recorded. Species richness, abundance and compositional variation were mainly affected by connectivity indices that consider the capacity of species to use corridors and/or to cross short distances up to 30 m through the matrix. Bird functional groups were differently affected by area and connectivity: while terrestrial insectivores, omnivores and frugivores were affected by both area and connectivity, the other groups (understory insectivores, nectarivores, and others) were affected only by connectivity. In the studied landscape, well connected fragments can sustain an elevated number of species and individuals. Connectivity gives the opportunity for individuals to use multiple fragments, reducing the influence of fragment size. While preserving large fragments is a conservation target worldwide and should continue to be, our results indicated that connectivity between fragments can enhance the area functionally connected and is beneficial to all functional groups and therefore should be a conservation priority.

40|$|The Official List of the Birds of Nebraska {{was last}} {{published}} in 1988 (NOU Records Committee 1988). That list included 406 species whose occurrence in Nebraska had been documented {{to the satisfaction}} of the NOU Records Committee at that time, following the sequence and nomenclature as outlined by the American ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union (1983, 1985, 1987). The present list includes 427 species based on all changes to the Official List of the Birds of Nebraska as determined by the NOU Records Committee (Mollhoff 1989; Grenon 1990, 1991; Gubanyi 1996 a, 1996 b, 1997; Brogie 1997), as well as sequence and taxonomic changes made by the American ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 union (1989, 1991, 1993, 1995). Additionally, the list reflects changes in frequency of occurrence as determined by the NOU Records Committee, which reviewed records of <b>bird</b> <b>occurrences</b> in Nebraska for 1987 - 1996. Frequency of occurrence is indicated by the following terms (NOU Records Committee 1988) : Regular - acceptably reported in 9 - 10 of the past 10 years Casual - acceptably reported in 4 - 7 of the past 10 years Accidental - acceptably reported in 0 - 2 of the past 10 years Extirpated - not acceptably reported in the past 50 years Extinct - no longer found alive anywhere in the world The frequency of occurrence for any species that was acceptably reported in 3 or 8 of the last 10 years was discussed by the committee and placed in a category felt most appropriate by the committee. The NOU Records Committee seeks documentation for all species of less than regular occurrence in Nebraska as well as for those species whose occurrence has not been documented in Nebraska.

40|$|Collisions between {{birds and}} aircraft, so called bird strikes, pose a {{considerable}} risk for aviation safety. Because risk of bird strike is highest below 3000 ft, current mitigation measures mostly focus on keeping birds away from airport grounds. Despite these efforts, {{the number of}} <b>bird</b> strike <b>occurrences</b> is still significant. The PhD project presented in this poster evaluates a new approach for mitigating bird strike risk: Tower control is provided with information about the current and predicted bird traffic in the arrival and departure corridor.
