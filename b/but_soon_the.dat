In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale buff, <b>but</b> <b>soon</b> <b>the</b> color of the cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears {{to be dependent on}} light, for when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.|$|E
5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, <b>but</b> <b>soon</b> <b>the</b> monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E
5|$|Invasion by Magnus Barefoot in {{the late}} 11th century {{resulted}} in {{a brief period of}} direct Norwegian rule over the kingdom, <b>but</b> <b>soon</b> <b>the</b> descendants of Godred Crovan re-asserted a further period of largely independent overlordship. This came to an end with the emergence of Somerled, on whose death in 1164 the kingdom was split in two. Just over a century later the islands became part of the Kingdom of Scotland, following the 1266 Treaty of Perth.|$|E

The casualties of the Russians in Pratzen included Kutuzov, who was severely wounded, and his son-in-law Ferdinand von Tiesenhausen who was killed.|$|E

5|$|In 1336, an embassy to the French Pope Benedict XII in Avignon {{was sent}} by Toghun Temür, the last Yuan emperor in Dadu. The embassy was led by two Genoese {{travelers}} {{in the service of}} the Mongol emperor, who carried letters representing that the Mongols had been eight years (since Archbishop John of Montecorvino's death) without a spiritual guide, and earnestly desired one. Pope Benedict appointed four ecclesiastics as his legates to the khan's court. In 1338, a total of 50 ecclesiastics were sent by the pope to Peking, among them John of Marignolli, who returned to Avignon in 1353 with a letter from the Yuan emperor to Pope Innocent VI. <b>But</b> <b>soon,</b> <b>the</b> Han Chinese rose up and drove the Mongols out of China, establishing the Ming Dynasty in 1368. By 1369, all foreign influences, from Mongols to Christians, Manichaeans, and Buddhists, were expelled by the Ming Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were {{shot out of}} the sky to strike and humble the pride of the infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their joints and several part, {{followed}} by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. <b>But</b> <b>soon</b> <b>the</b> whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E
5|$|After World War II began, Cariappa {{was posted}} as Brigade Major to the 20th Indian Brigade {{stationed}} in Derajat. Later {{he was appointed}} as the DAQMG of 10th Indian Division which was stationed in Iraq.

He served in Iraq, Iran and Syria in 1941–1942 and then in Burma in 1943–1944. Back in India in March 1942, he was posted as second-in-command of the newly raised 7th Rajput Machine Gun Battalion at Fatehgarh. On 15 April 1942, {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant colonel and was appointed commanding officer of the same battalion. With this appointment he became the first Indian to command a battalion in the Indian Army. Cariappa was successful in stabilising the newly raised battalion in terms of administration, training, and the handling of arms. Later the unit was rechristened as the 52nd Rajput and put under 43rd Indian Armoured Division. Within a span of a few months, the unit observed two transformations and two moves. First, the battalion's machine guns were replaced with tanks in order to convert it into an armoured regiment. <b>But</b> <b>soon</b> <b>the</b> battalion was reverted to infantry and re-designated as 17/7 Rajputs. Subsequently, it was moved to Secunderabad. This move led to unrest among the unit's troops which was successfully handled by Cariappa.|$|E
