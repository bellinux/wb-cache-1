5|$|American Indian lore {{contains}} numerous legends {{to explain}} the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes. The most famous {{of these is the}} <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gods legend told by the Klickitat people. In their tale, the chief of all the gods and his two sons, Pahto (also called Klickitat) and Wy'east, traveled down the Columbia River from the Far North in search for a suitable area to settle.|$|E
5|$|In Bratislava {{there are}} {{currently}} five bridges standing over the Danube (ordered by {{the flow of the}} river): Most Lafranconi (Lafranconi Bridge), Most SNP (<b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Slovak National Uprising), Starý most (The Old Bridge), Most Apollo (Apollo Bridge) and Prístavný most (The Harbor Bridge).|$|E
5|$|Lyrically, “Between You and Me” {{stresses}} the importance of seeking forgiveness from a friend. In addition, the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song addresses the need for confessing one's sins to God. DC Talk member Toby McKeehan, co-writer of the song, said that the lyrics simply describe the way relationships work. McKeehan later elaborated in an interview that the song came from his relationship with fellow band members Michael Tait and Kevin Max.|$|E

5|$|The Stargazer was to {{originally}} {{be represented}} by the movie-era Enterprise model, but producers were convinced to use a design which had appeared on a model in Picard's ready room in the series pilot. Several camera and compositing techniques were used by Bowman in filming the scenes aboard the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stargazer, which was also a re-dressed movie-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge set.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{values for}} the set were quite good. The production staff had reproduced an effective-looking replica of the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S.S Enterprise. As the scene began, the viewscreen of the ship depicted the U.S.S Enterprise being pursued by a type of automobile commonly manufactured in the United States and from the time period when Star Trek was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} {{versions}} of the legend. In another telling, Wy'east (Hood) battles Pahto (Adams) for the fair La-wa-la-clough (St. Helens). Or again Wy'east, {{the chief of the}} Multnomah tribe, competed with the chief of the Klickitat tribe. Their great anger led to their transformation into volcanoes. Their battle is said to have destroyed the <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gods and thus created the great Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River.|$|E

5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at the <b>bridge.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E
5|$|Callaghan's name {{is listed}} on Tablets of the Missing at Manila American Cemetery in the Philippines. Callaghan Hall at Officer Training Command, Newport, Rhode Island, is named in his honor. The Callaghan Fitness Center at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth Virginia is also named for him. A street, Admiral Callaghan Lane in Vallejo, California, is also named after him, and a {{monument}} in Lands End, San Francisco (including {{part of the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USS San Francisco, where he died), honors him and his comrades.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, a 48.9-foot-long {{concrete}} tee {{beam bridge}} was built; this bridge carries Hollow Ave over Leggetts Creek. In 1979, a 37.1-foot-long prestressed box beam or girders bridge was built; it carries Mary Street across the creek. A 44.9-foot-long <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same type {{was built in}} the same year and carries Wells Street over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long bridge of a similar type was built in 2009 and carries T-422/Burcher Ave over the creek.

5|$|In April 1942, he was {{promoted}} to the rank of rear admiral and was appointed as chief of staff to the Commander, South Pacific Area and South Pacific Force Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley. In November, as commander of Task Group 67.4, he led US forces in an engagement off Savo Island during the Guadalcanal Campaign. During this battle, he was on the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USS San Francisco when incoming enemy fire killed him and most of his command staff on November 13, 1942. At that time, he became the third US Navy admiral killed in action during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor posthumously for his efforts in this battle.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{histories}} {{describe the}} formation and destruction of the <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gods, a land bridge that connected the Oregon and Washington sides of the river in the Columbia River Gorge. The bridge, which aligns with geological records of the Bonneville Slide, was described in some stories {{as the result of}} a battle between gods, represented by Mount Adams and Mount Hood, in their competition for the affection of a goddess, represented by Mount St.Helens. Native American stories about the bridge differ in their details but agree in general that the bridge permitted increased interaction between tribes on the north and south sides of the river.|$|E
5|$|Other {{prominent}} 20th-century structures {{include the}} Most Slovenského národného povstania (<b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Slovak national uprising) across the Danube featuring a UFO-like tower restaurant, Slovak Radio's inverted-pyramid-shaped headquarters, and the uniquely designed Kamzík TV Tower with an observation deck and rotating restaurant. In the early 21st century, new edifices have transformed the traditional cityscape. At {{the beginning of}} the 21st Century, a construction boom has spawned new public structures, such as the Most Apollo and a new building of the Slovak National Theatre, as well as private real-estate development.|$|E

5|$|The battle above Khitomer {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{sequences}} to be shot, which proved fortuitous as the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise was damaged by the simulated sparks and explosions. The officer's mess set was blown up for a sequence where the Enterprises hull is compromised by a torpedo. When the set was rebuilt for use on The Next Generation, the forward wall was rebuilt and redesigned. While the Khitomer conference interior and exteriors were filmed at the Brandeis-Bardin Institute in California, the window from which Colonel West prepares to assassinate the president was a separate set built at Paramount. Footage from Brandeis, matte paintings, and the backlot were combined to create an open outdoor view.|$|E
5|$|The film's opening scenes {{aboard the}} {{starship}} Saratoga {{were the first}} to be shot; principal photography commenced on February 24, 1986. The set was a redress of the science vessel Grissoms bridge from The Search for Spock, in turn a redress of the Enterprise bridge created for The Motion Picture. The scenes were filmed first to allow time for the set to be revamped as the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Enterprise-A at the end of filming.|$|E
5|$|By 1954, traffic {{entering}} {{the city by}} the Causeway had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The Narrows. That bridge was eventually built as the Narrows Bridge. Opened in 1959, the Narrows Bridge alleviated the traffic problems at the Causeway; the Narrows and the Causeway continued {{to be the only}} road crossings of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also lowered traffic levels on the Causeway from 107,000 cars per day to 70,000 within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst black spot since 1989, was also remodelled in 2000 into a traffic light controlled raindrop roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on the Causeway.|$|E

5|$|In {{a similar}} legend from the Klickitats, {{there was a}} large inland sea between the Cascades and the Rocky Mountains. The Native Americans lived on the sea and each year they would hold two large powwows at Mount Multnomah, one in the spring and one in the fall. The demigod Koyoda Spielei lived among them and settled {{disputes}} among the living things of the earth, including the mountains Pa-toe (Adams) and Yi-east (Hood), sons of the Great Spirit Soclai Tyee. For many years, peace prevailed over the land. Then a beautiful squaw mountain moved to the valley between Pa-toe and Yi-east. She fell in love with Yi-east, but liked to flirt with Pa-toe. This caused the two mountains to quarrel with each other and it quickly escalated into an all out brawl. Ignoring Koyoda’s calls for peace, they belched forth smoke and ash and threw hot rocks at each other. Some time later, they paused for a rest and discovered the catastrophe they had caused. The forests and meadows had been burnt to the ground and many animals and other living things had been killed. The earth had been shaken so severely that a hole had been created in the mountains and the sea had drained away and the <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gods was formed. The squaw mountain had hid herself in a cave during the battle and because they could no longer find her, they were about to resume fighting. However, while they had been fighting, Koyoda went to Soclai and told him what was happening. Soclai arrived in time to stop them from resuming their quarrel. He decreed that the squaw mountain should remain in the cave forever and the <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gods was to be a covenant of peace between the mountains that he would cause to fall if they ever resumed their quarrel. He also placed an ugly old woman, known as Loo-wit, as a mountain to guard the bridge and remind the brothers that beauty is never permanent. After many years, the signs of the great battle and the evidence of the inland sea had disappeared and there was happiness and contentment over the earth. The squaw mountain wished to come out of her cave and grew very lonely. In an effort to ease her loneliness, Soclai sent the Bats, a tribe of beautiful birds, to be her companions. Yi-east eventually learned that the Bats were her guardians and carried out secret communication with the squaw mountain through them. He befriended Loo-wit and crossed the bridge at night to meet with the squaw mountain. One night, he stayed too long and had to hurry to get back to his proper place. He caused the ground to shake so much in his haste that a large rock fell and blocked the entrance to the cave. When Soclai found this, he was furious with the Bats and punished them by turning them into bats that are seen today. He allowed the squaw mountain to remain out of the cave on her promise to be good, but would not allow her and Yi-east to be married, fearing the inevitable quarrel that might start again. He did promise to look for a mate for Pa-toe, hoping this would initiate a lasting peace. However, because of his many duties, he forgot this promise and the two mountains were only held in check by his threats. Eventually, when Soclai was {{in another part of the}} world, they resumed their quarrel and created chaos again. Their violence broke the <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gods and destroyed the landscape again. Loo-wit, in her attempts to stop the two brothers, was badly burned and scarred; and when the bridge collapsed, she fell with it. Finally, Pa-toe won the battle and Yi-east admitted defeat. Soclai returned from where he had been, but he was too late to avert the disaster. He found Loo-wit and because she had been faithful in her guardianship, he rewarded her by giving her her greatest desire, youth and beauty. Having received this gift, she moved to the west side of the Cascades and remains there to this day as Mount St. Helens. Since Pa-toe won the battle, the squaw mountain belonged to him. She was heart broken, but took her place at his side. She soon fell at his feet and into a deep sleep from which she never awoke. She is now known as Sleeping Beauty. Pa-toe became so sad that he caused her deep sleep, he lowered his own head in remorse.|$|E
5|$|Jiyuan {{was hit by}} a {{multitude}} of shells, disabling her forward-mounted Krupp gun and severely damaging all the structures above her armour belt. Captain Fang gave orders to flee at full speed towards Waihaiwei, with Yoshino in pursuit. Reports differed on why Jiyuan was not overtaken by the faster Japanese cruiser, with one claim stating that Jiyuans aft mounted Krupp gun scored a hit on the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yoshino, and another indicating that shot was fired by the Kuang Yi. While Jiyuan got away, the Kuang Yi fought against the remaining two cruisers until she was holed and sinking, at which point she was beached to allow her crew to escape. As the Tsi Yuan headed to Weihaiwei, she passed the Kowshing which was still heading to Korea. The troop ship was stopped by the Japanese, and after prolonged negotiations she was sunk with loss of a great number of the troops and crew on board.|$|E
5|$|The East River Bridge is a {{multi-span}} {{bridge in}} Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia that carries Trunk7 over the Northeast Arm of Sheet Harbour. It replaced a <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same name {{that was built}} in 1956 and demolished in 2016. Construction began on the current bridge in September 2014 and was finished on 17December 2015, with a bridge walk commemorating {{the closing of the}} old East River Bridge and the opening of the new bridge. The old structure was a green arch bridge with a half-through, two-hinge type arch that was built in 1956, but was nearing the end of its lifespan leading to plans for construction of a new bridge funded by the federal and provincial governments. Nova Scotia had considered repairs to the old bridge in an effort to extend its lifespan, but ultimately elected to construct a new bridge.|$|E
