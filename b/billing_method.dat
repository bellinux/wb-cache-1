As a direct result, most telephone companies allow their customers to block outgoing calls to premium-rate telephone numbers.

40|$|Abstract—Many cloud {{services}} nowadays are running {{on top of}} geographically distributed infrastructures for better reliability and performance. They need {{an effective way to}} direct the user requests to a suitable datacenter, in a cost efficient manner. Previous work focused mostly on the electricity cost of datacenters. The approaches favor datacenters at locations with cheaper electricity prices. In this paper, we augment the picture by considering another significant cost contributor: network bandwidth. We propose to utilize statistical multiplexing to strategically bundle demands at different locations. The anti-correlation between demands effectively smooths out the aggregated bandwidth usage, thereby saving the bandwidth cost calculated by burstable <b>billing</b> <b>methods</b> that charge the peak bandwidth usage. We present an optimization framework that models the realistic environment and practical constraints a cloud faces.

40|$|Objective To {{examine whether}} sepsis is {{accurately}} coded on hospital <b>bills.</b> <b>Methods</b> Hospital inpatient uniform bills (UB- 92) for 122 patients with clinically documented severe sepsis of presumed infectious origin were retrospectively examined. Final UB- 92 hospital bills {{were obtained for}} all study subjects. ICD- 9 -CM diagnosis codes from these bills were then reviewed to ascertain the number of subjects for whom one or more diagnostic codes for septicemia and/or bacteremia were present. Results A total of 92 hospital bills (75. 4 %) contained one or more ICD- 9 -CM diagnostic codes for septicemia and/or bacteremia. Of the 30 that did not, 15 (12. 3 %) had codes for major systemic infection and organ failure. No diagnoses indicative of sepsis (i. e., organ failure and major infection) were present on the remaining 15 (12. 3 %) bills. Conclusions Our findings suggest that use of ICD- 9 -CM codes for identifying patients with sepsis using hospital bills is only moderately sensitive. Strict reliance on administrative data sources for sepsis surveillance or research planning may therefore be prone to substantial error...|$|R
