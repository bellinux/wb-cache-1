40|$|The partial SKL**-logic, {{defined by}} P. Doherty in A Three-Valued Approach to Non-Monotonic Reasoning (1990) {{is based upon}} the three valued logic of S. C. Kleene. The logic of Doherty {{provides}} a flexible framework in defining, we hope in a suitable way, epistemic notions of Knowledge, Belief, Aposteriori Knowledge, and Potential Knowledge, together with some relations between them. The underlying ideas in our definitions of knowledge and belief are the same as those using the semantics of possible worlds proposed by J. Hintikka. Our definitions are constructive and recursive instead. Using the undefined truth value from SKL**, it allows a not known or not <b>believed</b> <b>status</b> for a sentence.

50|$|Agnostics {{generally}} {{hold the}} position that like the existence of God, the existence of supernatural phenomena, such as souls or life after death, is unverifiable and therefore unknowable. Many religions, whether they believe in the soul’s existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many pagan belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, <b>believe</b> that one’s <b>status</b> in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life, {{with the exception of}} Calvinistic variants of Protestant Christianity, which <b>believes</b> one's <b>status</b> in the afterlife is a gift from God and cannot be earned during life.|$|R

25|$|Many Palestinians <b>believe</b> the <b>status</b> quo is {{threatened}} since right-wing Israelis have been challenging it with more force and frequency, asserting a religious right to pray there.

50|$|On 7 June 1063, the Saturday before Pentecost, {{the same}} issue arose during vespers again.

40|$|Labeling {{has a large}} {{effect on}} {{individuals}} {{and how they are}} viewed by society and how they view themselves. Who makes the rules about gang members? What is a gang and what do they represent? Fraternities and street gangs have more similarities than most would imagine. Both take part in illegal activities, however, only one group is criminalized for it. Society labels certain individuals as deviants or gang members and potentially can cause systematic violence. Those with privilege are treated differently and excuses are made for them, leading them to <b>believe</b> that <b>status</b> can excuse anything...|$|R

40|$|Those {{who believe}} the embryo has the moral status of persons expect that the embryo should be accorded all the rights of these individuals. The embryo is vulnerable, under this perspective, and needs protection. Some <b>believe</b> that this <b>status</b> begins during fertilization, when the DNA from the female and male gametes combine to create an entity with a novel genetic composition. Others <b>believe</b> that the <b>status</b> begins later, when the {{primitive}} streak begins to develop approximately 14 days after fertilization and when the embryo will, if it survives, develop into a single individual. Most of {{those who believe that}} the embryo has a status distinct from adults and children regard the embryo as a potential human being worthy of special respect but not entitled to the same rights as persons. This perspective is applied particularly to the embryo used in research, which ranges in developmen...|$|R

That was why he composed the very powerful and memorable pieces of Woman's daily lives in his poems.|$|R
50|$|Jiang Qing {{believed}} that upholding the status quo, {{where she was}} one of the highest-ranked members of the central authorities, would mean that she would effectively hold onto power. In addition, she <b>believed</b> that her <b>status</b> as Mao's widow would make it difficult for her to be removed. She continued to invoke Mao's name in her major decisions, and acted as first-in-charge.|$|R
25|$|The 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, Mahavira, {{stressed}} five vows, including ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truthfulness), asteya (non-stealing) and aparigraha (non-attachment). Jain orthodoxy {{believes the}} teachings of the Tirthankaras predates all known time and scholars <b>believe</b> Parshva, accorded <b>status</b> as the 23rd Tirthankara, was a historical figure. The Vedas are believed to have documented a few Tirthankaras and an ascetic order similar to the shramana movement.|$|R
50|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{people are}} motivated by the desire for ego-justification and group-justification to view themselves and their group positively (which can manifest through feelings of self-esteem and value). The system-justification motive is people’s desire to view the system or status quo in a favorable light as legitimate and fair. Among high status group members, {{all three of these}} motives are congruent with one another. The need to believe the system is just and fair is easy for high status group members because they are the groups benefiting from the system and status quo. Therefore, as the advantaged groups, holding positive regard for the self and group corresponds readily with <b>believing</b> the <b>status</b> quo is legitimate.|$|R
50|$|In particular, as system {{justification}} motives {{increase for}} high status group members, ingroup ambivalence will decrease, levels of self-esteem will increase, and depression and neuroticism levels will decrease. For low status groups, the ego-justification and group-justification motives come {{into conflict with}} the system-justification motive. If low status group members have a desire to <b>believe</b> the <b>status</b> quo and prevailing system is fair and legitimate, then this would conflict with the motivation of these individuals to maintain positive self and group images. Theorists posit that this conflict of justification motives creates conflicting or mixed attitudes in low status groups {{as a result of}} being the disadvantaged group that does not necessarily benefit from the status quo.|$|R

50|$|By 80 BC, it is <b>believed</b> {{that the}} <b>status</b> and {{function}} of the office was changed by the Constitutional reforms of Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Although the term remained, reflecting the senator who was named first in the roll of the Senate issued by the Censors, the prerogatives of the office were restricted. In particular, the honor of speaking first on any topic debated in the Senate, a measure of their political clout, was removed from them and transported to the consul designate.|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s, Gibb came to {{the view}} that Scotland had been ill-served by the union of 1707. His book Scotland in Eclipse (1930) linked the {{economic}} depression with a wider cultural malaise in Scotland. In particular, he <b>believed</b> that Scotland's <b>status</b> as a partner in the imperial mission had been compromised by her lowly status in the United Kingdom. While he moved towards a Scottish nationalist position, he also retained a right-wing world view, and imperial questions remained prominent in his writings.|$|R
50|$|Opinions vary as {{the status}} of this taxon. Zonnefeld (2208) {{discusses}} its <b>status,</b> <b>believing</b> both on genetic information and morphology and distribution {{that it is a}} separate species from Narcissus triandrus. For instance the leaf width at 2mm is much smaller. While Webb (1980) and Barra Lazaro (2000) consider it a variety or subspecies of the type species of the section (N. triandrus). he is supported in this by both Dorda and Fernandez Casas (1989) and Perez-Barrales et al. (2006).|$|R
