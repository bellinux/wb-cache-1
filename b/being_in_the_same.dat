5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
5|$|Barnes went to England in the Australian {{winter of}} 1947. In his autobiography, {{he claimed to}} have gone as a {{representative}} for an alcohol company, although appears to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply due to rationing. Once in England, he was approached by Burnley to play as a professional in Lancashire League cricket, which he did briefly before becoming disinterested and resigning. Barnes returned to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen to win a place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, as the Australian authorities frowned on those who played professionally in England. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian Board of Control's rule that wives were not allowed to travel with players, by <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> overseas country.|$|E
5|$|Nelson, the Hamiltons {{and several}} other British {{travellers}} left Leghorn for Florence on 13 July. They made stops at Trieste and Vienna, spending three weeks in the latter where they were entertained by the local nobility and heard the Missa in Angustiis by Haydn that now bears Nelson's name. By September they were in Prague, and later called at Dresden, Dessau and Hamburg, from where they caught a packet ship to Great Yarmouth, arriving on 6 November. Nelson was given a hero's welcome and after being sworn in as a freeman of the borough and received the massed crowd's applause. He subsequently {{made his way to}} London, arriving on 9 November. He attended court and was guest of honour at a number of banquets and balls. It was during this period that Fanny Nelson and Emma Hamilton met for the first time. During this period, Nelson was reported as being cold and distant to his wife and his attention to Emma became the subject of gossip. With the marriage breaking down, Nelson began to hate even <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> room as Fanny. Events came to a head around Christmas, when according to Nelson's solicitor, Fanny issued an ultimatum on whether he was to choose her or Emma. Nelson replied: I love you sincerely but I cannot forget my obligations to Lady Hamilton or speak of her otherwise than with affection and admiration. The two never lived together again after this.|$|E

25|$|Despite never <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> division, the Giants and 49ers have {{developed}} a heated rivalry over the years.

25|$|The Bills and Chiefs {{were also}} {{original}} {{teams in the}} AFL and have {{had a long history}} against each other, despite never <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> division. This rivalry heated up recently as the Bills and Chiefs met in consecutive years from 2008 to 2015, and will meet again in 2017. The teams have played three playoff games, including the AFL Championship game that determined the AFL's (later AFC) representative in the first Super Bowl, with Kansas City winning and going on to face the Green Bay Packers in the Super Bowl. Buffalo currently leads the series 25-21-1.|$|E

The teams would however not meet in the playoffs until the 2002 season. And <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conference, {{they can no longer}} meet in a Super Bowl rematch unless the NFL radically changes its conference alignment or its playoff structure.|$|E

25|$|In neurologically normal subjects, Blanke {{and colleagues}} then {{showed that the}} {{conscious}} experience {{of the self and}} body <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> location depends on multisensory integration in the TPJ. Using event-related potentials, Blanke and colleagues showed the selective activation of the TPJ 330–400 ms after stimulus onset when healthy volunteers imagined themselves in the position and visual perspective that generally are reported by people experiencing spontaneous OBEs. Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the same subjects impaired mental transformation of the participant's own body. No such effects were found with stimulation of another site or for imagined spatial transformations of external objects, suggesting the selective implication of the TPJ in mental imagery of one's own body.|$|E
25|$|Coordination {{games are}} {{closely linked to}} the {{economic}} concept of externalities, and in particular positive network externalities, the benefit reaped from <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> network as other agents. Conversely, game theorists have modeled behavior under negative externalities where choosing the same action creates a cost rather than a benefit. The generic term for this class of game is anti-coordination game. The best-known example of a 2-player anti-coordination game is the game of Chicken (also known as Hawk-Dove game). Using the payoff matrix in Figure 1, a game is an anti-coordination game if Bnbsp&>nbsp&A and Cnbsp&>nbsp&D for row-player 1 (with lowercase analogues b > d and c > a for column-player 2). {Down, Left} and {Up, Right} are the two pure Nash equilibria. Chicken also requires that Anbsp&>nbsp&C, so a change from {Up, Left} to {Up, Right} improves player 2's payoff but reduces player 1's payoff, introducing conflict. This counters the standard coordination game setup, where all unilateral changes in a strategy lead to either mutual gain or mutual loss.|$|E
