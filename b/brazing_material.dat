50|$|ABFs are {{available}} as strip with a width from 0.5 mm to 125 mm and a thickness from 20 µm to 50 µm. Preforms {{can be easily}} produced by using punch and die, cutting/slitting, photochemical etching, and other methods. It is simple to use foils and preforms at automatic production and assembling steps. The use of foils and preforms reduces waste and enhances manufacturing efficiency. Drying and evaporation operations, which are required with powder/paste and tape forms, are not necessary. The optimal amount of <b>brazing</b> <b>material</b> can be easily applied to the component and, in just one heating cycle, ABFs create uniform braze joints of outstanding quality.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of {{resistance}} welding bonds: solid state, fusion, and reflow braze. In a solid state bond, also called a thermo-compression bond, dissimilar materials with dissimilar grain structure, e.g. molybdenum to tungsten, are joined using {{a very short}} heating time, high weld energy, and high force. There is little melting and minimum grain growth, but a definite bond and grain interface. Thus the materials actually bond while still in the solid state. The bonded materials typically exhibit excellent shear and tensile strength, but poor peel strength. In a fusion bond, either similar or dissimilar materials with similar grain structures are heated to the melting point (liquid state) of both. The subsequent cooling and combination of the materials forms a “nugget” alloy of the two materials with larger grain growth. Typically, high weld energies at either short or long weld times, depending on physical characteristics, are used to produce fusion bonds. The bonded materials usually exhibit excellent tensile, peel and shear strengths. In a reflow braze bond, a resistance heating of a low temperature <b>brazing</b> <b>material,</b> such as gold or solder, is used to join either dissimilar materials or widely varied thick/thin material combinations. The <b>brazing</b> <b>material</b> must “wet” to each part and possess a lower melting point than the two workpieces. The resultant bond has definite interfaces with minimum grain growth. Typically the process requires a longer (2 to 100 ms) heating time at low weld energy. The resultant bond exhibits excellent tensile strength, but poor peel and shear strength.|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{high-performance}} {{cutting tools}} use indexable inserts. There {{are several reasons}} for this. First of all, at the very high cutting speeds and feeds supported by these materials, the cutting tip can reach temperatures high enough to melt the <b>brazing</b> <b>material</b> holding it to the shank. Economics are also important; inserts are made symmetrically {{so that when the}} first cutting edge is dull they can be rotated, presenting a fresh cutting edge. Some inserts are even made {{so that they can be}} flipped over, giving as many as 16 cutting edges per insert. There are many types of inserts: some for roughing, some for finishing. Others are made for specialized jobs like cutting threads or grooves. The industry employs standardized nomenclature to describe inserts by shape, material, coating material, and size.|$|E

Joining and sealing are critical issues that will need to be addressed before SOFCs can truly perform as expected.

40|$|Ceramics {{are being}} used {{increasingly}} in applications where high temperatures are encountered such as automobile and gas turbine engines. However, the use of ceramics is limited {{by a lack of}} methods capable of producing strong, high temperature joints. This is because most ceramic-ceramic joining techniques, such as brazing, require that the entire assembly be exposed to high temperatures in order to assure that the <b>braze</b> <b>material</b> melts. Alternatively, localized heating using high energy electron beams may be used to selectively heat the <b>braze</b> <b>material.</b> In this work, high energy electron beam brazing of a ceramic part is modeled numerically.

50|$|As {{copper and}} nickel alloy {{with each other}} easily and have simple structures, the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated. Strength and {{hardness}} for each individual alloy is increased by cold working; they are not hardened by heat treatment. Joining of 90-10 (C70600) and 70-30 (C71500) is possible by both welding or brazing. They are both weldable {{by the majority of}} techniques, although autogenous (welding without weld consumables) or oxyacetylene methods are not recommended. The 70-30 rather than 90-10 weld consumables are normally preferred for both alloys and no after-welding heat treatment is required. They can also be welded directly to steel, providing a 65% nickel-copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects. The C71640 alloy tends to be used as seamless tubing and expanded rather than welded into the tube plate. Brazing requires appropriate silver-base brazing alloys. However, great care must be taken to ensure that there are no stresses in the Cu-Ni being silver brazed, since any stress can cause intergranulary penetration of the <b>brazing</b> <b>material,</b> and severe stress cracking (see image). Thus, full annealing of any potential mechanical stress is necessary.|$|E

40|$|Nickel {{titanium}} (NiTi) {{plate of}} 1. 2 mm thickness was successfully clad on AISI 316 L {{stainless steel substrate}} by a microwave-assisted brazing process. Brazing was conducted in a multimode microwave oven in air using a copper-based <b>brazing</b> <b>material</b> in tape form. The <b>brazing</b> <b>material</b> was melted {{in a few minutes}} by microwave-induced plasma initiated by conducting wires surrounding the brazing assembly. Metallographic study by scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) and compositional analysis by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of the brazed joint revealed metallurgical bonding formed via inter-diffusion between the brazing filler and the adjacent materials. A shear bonding strength in the range of 100 - 150 MPa was recorded in shear tests of the brazed joint. SEM and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) analysis for the surface of as-received NiTi plate and NiTi cladding showed similar microstructure and phase composition. Nanoindentation tests also indicated that the superelastic properties of NiTi were essentially retained. The cavitation erosion resistance of the NiTi cladding was essentially {{the same as that of}} as-received NiTi plate, and higher than that obtained in laser or TIG (tungsten-inert gas) surfacing. The high resistance could be attributed to avoidance of dilution and defect formation in the NiTi clad since the cladding did not undergo melting and solidification in the brazing process. Electrochemical tests also recorded similar corrosion resistance in both as-received NiTi and NiTi cladding. Thus, the present study indicates that microwave-assisted brazing is a simple, economical, and feasible process for cladding NiTi on 316 L stainless steel for enhancing cavitation erosion resistance. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Some {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in the design and fabrication of blackbody sensors (BBSs) used to measure the temperature of a heater core in a vacuum furnace. Each BBS consists of a ring of thermally conductive, high-melting-temperature material with two tantalum-sheathed thermocouples attached at diametrically opposite points. The name "blackbody sensor" reflects the basic principle of operation. Heat is transferred between the ring and the furnace heater core primarily by blackbody radiation, heat is conducted through the ring to the thermocouples, and the temperature of the ring (and, hence, the temperature of the heater core) is measured by use of the thermocouples. Two main requirements have guided the development of these BBSs: (1) The rings should have as high an emissivity as possible in order to maximize the heat-transfer rate and thereby maximize temperature-monitoring performance and (2) the thermocouples must be joined to the rings in such a way as to ensure long-term, reliable intimate thermal contact. The problem of fabricating a BBS to satisfy these requirements is complicated by an application-specific prohibition against overheating and thereby damaging nearby instrumentation leads through the use of conventional furnace brazing or any other technique that involves heating the entire BBS and its surroundings. The problem is further complicated by another application-specific prohibition against damaging the thin tantalum thermocouple sheaths through the use of conventional welding to join the thermocouples to the ring. The first BBS rings were made of graphite. The tantalum-sheathed thermocouples were attached to the graphite rings by use of high-temperature graphite cements. The ring/thermocouple bonds thus formed were found to be weak and unreliable, and so graphite rings and graphite cements were abandoned. Now, each BBS ring is made from one of two materials: either tantalum or a molybdenum/titanium/zirconium alloy. The tantalum-sheathed thermocouples are bonded to the ring by laser brazing. The primary advantage of laser brazing over furnace brazing is that in laser brazing, it is possible to form a brazed connection locally, without heating nearby parts to the flow temperature of the <b>brazing</b> <b>material.</b> Hence, it is possible to comply with the prohibition against overheating nearby instrumentation leads. Also, in laser brazing, unlike in furnace brazing, it is possible to exert control over the thermal energy to such a high degree that it becomes possible to braze the thermocouples to the ring without burning through the thin tantalum sheaths on the thermocouples. The <b>brazing</b> <b>material</b> used in the laser brazing process is a titanium-boron paste. This <b>brazing</b> <b>material</b> can withstand use at temperatures up to about 1, 400 C. In thermal-cycling tests performed thus far, no debonding between the rings and thermocouples has been observed. Emissivity coatings about 0. 001 in. (. 0. 025 mm) thick applied to the interior surfaces of the rings have been found to improve the performance of the BBS sensors by raising the apparent emissivities of the rings. In thermal-cycling tests, the coatings were found to adhere well to the rings...|$|E
