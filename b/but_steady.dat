5|$|Delaroche's {{attention}} to detail and literal precision in this painting evidences and demonstrates the slow <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> evolution of realism in art during the 19th century, and how its popularity began to rise.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 1943 the Wehrmacht {{launched}} its offensive. On the northern {{side of the}} salient, the German forces bogged down within four days. On the southern side, the German 4th Panzer Army, with Army Detachment Kempf on its eastern flank, attacked the Soviet defences of the Voronezh Front. They made slow <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> progress through the Soviet defensive lines.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{and other}} members of the genus Equus are adapted by {{evolutionary}} biology to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> flow of food that does not change much from day to day.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Starbottle did not move. The colonel {{felt his}} chest slowly collapsing, <b>but</b> <b>steadied</b> himself against a chair, and {{endeavored}} to beam with chivalrous gallantry not unmixed with magisterial firmness upon {{her as she}} sat.|$|R
50|$|In the Kentucky Derby, Big Truck broke {{well from}} the 7 post <b>but</b> <b>steadied</b> after about 6 furlongs because of hard contact with Remsen foe Court Vision. He {{finished}} 18th in the Run for the Roses.|$|R

5|$|John, like Basil II before him, {{was a slow}} <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> campaigner. His armies made careful, {{measured}} gains over time, rarely exposing {{themselves to}} excessive risks, but nevertheless advancing inexorably towards their objectives. However, the Turks were resilient, {{and they did not}} allow themselves to be decisively defeated in any one engagement. They knew that it was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time, as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention.|$|E
5|$|On 23 July 1840, PedroII was {{declared}} {{of age and}} Joaquim Inácio was among the naval officers representing the armada in the delegation that greeted the young emperor. The rise of PedroII to head the central government resulted in a slow, <b>but</b> <b>steady,</b> restoration of order in the country. On 17 December, Joaquim Inácio was named inspetor do arsenal de marinha (inspector of the navy shipyard) in Rio Grande, {{the second most important}} town in Rio Grande do Sul. The province was still troubled by the Ragamuffin rebellion. He led the sailors manning the trenches surrounding Rio Grande and fought the Ragamuffins when they attacked the town in July 1841.|$|E
5|$|The Dark Knight is the highest-grossing film of 2008, the second-highest-grossing superhero film, the second-highest-grossing film {{based on}} comics, {{and the fourth}} highest-grossing North American film of all time. Adjusted for ticket-price {{inflation}} though, it ranks 28th. In contrast to Avatar and Titanic — both which grossed more than The Dark Knight in North America and had slow <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> earnings — The Dark Knight broke records in its opening weekend and slowed down significantly after its first few weekends.|$|E

5|$|The final {{assault on}} Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops {{attacked}} the south gate {{while the other}} contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Provençals at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched {{at both ends of}} the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of both Germany and Russia after World War I empowered Finland {{and made a}} peaceful, domestic Finnish social and political settlement possible. The reconciliation led to a slow and painful, <b>but</b> <b>steady,</b> national unification. In the end, the power vacuum and interregnum of 1917–1919 {{gave way to the}} Finnish compromise. From 1919 to 1991, the democracy and sovereignty of the Finns withstood challenges from right-wing and left-wing political radicalism, the crisis of World War II and pressure from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Various {{species of}} {{cetaceans}} inhabit or migrate through the waters in vicinity, however {{very little about}} their biology in the area is known {{due to lack of}} studies and sighting efforts caused from locational conditions. Bottlenose dolphins are the most commonly observed and is the only species confirmed to be seasonal or yearly residents while some other dolphin species have also been observed. Humpback whales are the only of large whales showing slow <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> recoveries as their numbers annually migrating past the island of Lord Howe are much smaller than that of those migrating along Australian continent.|$|E
50|$|Pakistan {{made the}} perfect start to their innings {{with a steady}} 126 run opening {{partnership}} between Ahmed Shehzad (61) and Sarfraz Ahmed (65). But after both openers went in quick succession Pakistan collapsed to 215 (49.3 overs) with Mitchell Johnson continuing his form from the last match taking 3/40. In reply, Australia lost early wickets <b>but</b> <b>steadied</b> and reached the target with 40 balls remaining. Glenn Maxwell was their top run scorer with a quick knock of 76.|$|R

50|$|The {{constituency}} included Glasgow's business district. The Liberals {{concentrated on}} fiscal issues. The Conservatives successfully raised the Irish problem. Bowles tried to win free trade Conservative votes by qualifying {{his support for}} Home Rule, favouring it only within a United Kingdom framework. There were about 2,000 Irish in the district. The United Irish League did not give Bowles their support until 27 February. The Conservative Chief Whip apparently had some fear of Dickson 'wobbling' over tariff reform <b>but</b> <b>steadied</b> him with a warning letter.|$|R
5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output {{of only a handful of}} canned slugs per day. <b>But</b> <b>steady</b> progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|U-43 was due {{to depart}} Lorient on a war patrol to an area off Freetown, west Africa, but early on 4 February 1941, she sank while tied to Ysere, an old sailing ship which {{was used as a}} {{floating}} pier. Valves and vents had been tampered-with the previous day, but no one had noticed the slow, <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> ingress of water into the bilges. To make matters worse and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U-Boote (BdU—U-boat command headquarters) directive, a hatch had been left open, allowing water to pour into the after torpedo room. Two petty officers were found to be most at fault; but Lüth, as captain, was ultimately responsible. However, according to author Jordan Vause, no record of punishment seems to have survived and Lüth's career {{does not appear to have}} been affected. U-43 was refloated and Lüth took it back out into the North Atlantic in May 1941.|$|E
5|$|In 2015–2016, {{percentage}} {{share of}} Gross Value Added (GVA) at factor cost by Economic Activity at constant price (base year 2011–2012) was Agriculture-Forestry and Fishery – 14.84%, Industry 18.51% and Services 66.65%. It {{has been observed}} {{that there has been}} a slow <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.|$|E
60|$|The whole {{neighbourhood}} of Mount Saint Helena, now {{so quiet}} and sylvan, was once alive with mining camps and villages. Here {{there would be}} two thousand souls under canvas; there one thousand or fifteen hundred ensconced, as if for ever, in a town of comfortable houses. But the luck had failed, the mines petered out; and the army of miners had departed, and left this quarter {{of the world to}} the rattlesnakes and deer and grizzlies, and to the slower <b>but</b> <b>steadier</b> advance of husbandry.|$|R

60|$|So {{the crisis}} had arrived. That night or never Marie must be rescued, and his plan of forging Robespierre's {{signature}} must {{be put into}} effect that day. He opened the next few papers mechanically, <b>but</b> <b>steadied</b> himself upon Robespierre asking him a question. For a time he worked on; but his brain was swimming, {{and he was on}} the point of saying that he felt strangely unwell, and must ask to be excused his work for that day, when he heard a ring at the bell, and a moment later Lebat entered the room.|$|R
5|$|Russian tsar Alexander I, also newly crowned King of Poland, gave Zajączek on 3 December 1815 the {{position}} of the first Namestnik of Kingdom of Poland (tsar's deputized ruler of the territory, a position similar to that of a viceroy). This nomination surprised many, including Zajączek himself, who is said to have at first refused this position, but in the end accepted it after Alexander phrased his request as a direct order. Zajączek's years as a namestnik have garnered mixed reviews, both among his contemporaries, as well as among later historians. He was actively interested in economic development of Polish lands, and contributed to the industrialization and urbanization of the Kingdom's lands; he {{was also one of the}} founders of the University of Warsaw. He has been criticized, however, for being inexperienced for such a major civil leader position, too servile to the wishes of his patron, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and he often disregarded the Constitution of the Congress Poland, which contributed to a slow <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> erosion of the country's freedoms and autonomy. Deferential towards the Russian authorities, he readily let Duke Constantine and Alexander's commissar, Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev, neither of whose positions were envisioned in the Constitution, become the de facto rulers of the Kingdom. In recognition of Zajączek's services, Aleksander I bestowed upon him the title of 'Prince of Poland' on 27 April 1818.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus {{from as far away as}} Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities. Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops.|$|E
5|$|Thermal energy causes {{some of the}} {{molecules}} at {{the outer edge of}} the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
