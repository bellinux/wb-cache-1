Death it self had been better than to have parted in that place.|$|E

I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E

I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least for me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there, it sounds more fun <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> having so much more fun." ...|$|E
