40|$|In this study, a {{dual-band}} filtering {{power divider}} with capacitor-loaded centrally coupled-line resonators (CLCCLRs) is presented. The proposed design utilises four CLCCLRs, two resistors and one inductor {{to achieve the}} dual functions of dual-band filtering and power division.

It is noted that changing one passband will not affect the other. For demonstration, a microstrip filtering power divider is designed, fabricated and measured. Under different values of the loaded capacitors, experimental results show that the lower <b>band</b> <b>centre</b> <b>frequency</b> varies from 0. 7 to 1. 0 GHz with the upper band fixed at 1. 75 GHz, whereas the upper <b>band</b> <b>centre</b> <b>frequency</b> varies from 1. 65 to 1. 95 GHz when the lower band is fixed at 1. 0 GHz.

Two types of adsorbate were identified. On the one hand, strongly adsorbed cyanide which comes from the oxidative adsorption of the molecule. This adsorbate has been isolated and characterized. On the other hand reversibly adsorbed glycinate anions, which adsorb at potentials above 0. 3 V, have been detected. As in the case of acetate anions, glycinate is two-fold coordinated to the Pt(111) surface through the carboxylate group.

40|$|SRM is {{the ability}} to hear target sounds over maskers more easily when the sounds come from {{different}} directions than when all sounds come from the same direction. Old, HI people, struggle to understand a target sound when they are in a noisy environment (Duquesnoy, 1983; Gatehouse and Noble, 2004). This may be because hearing loss is associated with poorer SRM (Marrone et al., 2008; Neher et al., 2009). Andersen et al.

In situ FTIR spectroscopy can be employed to follow the potential dependence of the C–N stretching frequency in acidic electrolytes with quite a low uncertainty. Owing to {{the stability of the}} cyanide adlayer in alkaline solutions, experiments performed in NaOH medium are usually perturbed by the signiﬁcant overlapping of the reference and the sample FTIR spectra. Deconvolution of the spectra was carried out assuming a Lorentz oscillator. The procedure allowed to conﬁrm that two potential regions with diﬀerent <b>band</b> <b>centre</b> <b>frequency</b> tuning coexist for Pt(111) –CN in perchloric acid medium. Conversely, in the alkaline electrolyte a single tuning rate for the band position was found for both surfaces studied. The lack of reorientation of the C–N molecular axis together with the occurrence of a certain screening eﬀect of negatively charged hydroxyl anions on the electric ﬁeld at the interface could be at the origin of the diﬀerent behaviour displayed in both electrolytic media.

Samples were prepared by bonding single and double layers of mass-loaded vinyl (MLV) membrane between extruded polystyrene (XPS) core and aluminium facings. Results show {{that the presence of}} a single MLV sound barrier layer resulted in a three dB improvement in weighted sound reduction index (Rw) over one-third octave <b>band</b> <b>centre</b> <b>frequency</b> of 100 Hz - 3150 Hz, Rw increasing from 35 dB to 38 dB.

40|$|Beamforming is {{a popular}} method of {{acoustic}} source localisation using an array of microphones. When beamforming over a plane or a series of planes, these microphone arrays are often two-dimensional sparse patterns of various designs. The design of these patterns is non-trivial, and influences the achievable resolution, {{also referred to as}} the beamwidth, and the Maximum Sidelobe Levels (MSL), a measure of the ability of the array to reject sources that the array is not focussed on. Although recent deconvolution techniques such as DAMAS aim to remove properties of the array from the results of beamforming, in practice the properties of the array will still influence the quality of the results. For this reason, {{it is important that the}} array exhibit good resolution and MSL for the intended beamforming application. In this paper, several popular two-dimensional array patterns such as the patented Underbrink and B&K spirals, as well as Doherty spirals and log-spirals are critically compared for both resolution and MSL for a variety of source locations, including both near-field (spherical propagation) and far-field (planar propagation) sources. Each array compared has an aperture of 1 m, and uses 63 microphones in a typical arrangement found for each of the types. As array resolution scales linearly with wavelength, the resolution is calculated at a single frequency of 3 kHz, and normalised against wavelength. The MSL levels are calculated at the one-third octave <b>band</b> <b>centre</b> <b>frequencies</b> from 1 – 31 : 5 kHz. Results show that the Underbrink design outperforms other array patterns in both resolution and MSL over the majority of frequencies analysed. Zebb Prime and Con Doolan[URL]...|$|R

Psychophysical response tests of 40 participants (20 mates and 20 females) were performed using a steering wheel rotational vibration simulator using the category-ratio Borg CR 10 scale procedure for direct estimation of perceived intensity. The test stimuli were sinusoidal vibrations at 22 third octave <b>band</b> <b>centre</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the range from 3 to 400 Hz, with acceleration amplitudes in the range from 0. 04 to 27 m/s(2) r. m. s. Multivariate regression procedures were applied to the experimentally acquired data in order to establish a regression model expressing the Borg CR 10 perceived intensity values {{as a function of the}} two independent parameters of the frequency and amplitude of vibration. The equal sensation curves suggested a non-linear dependency of the subjective perceived intensity on both frequency and amplitude. Females were found to provide higher Borg CR 10 perceived intensity values than males (p < 0. 05), particularly at the higher intensity levels above approximately 1. 0 m/s(2) r. m. s and at the higher frequencies above approximately 20 Hz. Relevance to industry: For the manufacturers of steering systems and of other automobile components this study provides vibration perception curves and identifies the possible importance of gender towards the perception of vibration which arrives at the steering wheel.

40|$|The {{rolling element}} bearing is a key part in many {{mechanical}} facilities and the diagnosis of its faults {{is very important in}} the field of machinery health monitoring for safe and efficient operations. Currently, envelope analysis is widely used to obtain the bearing defect harmonics from the envelope signal spectrum for the detection and diagnosis and has shown good results in identifying incipient faults occurring on the different parts of a bearing. However, a critical step in implementing envelope analysis is to determine a frequency band that contains faulty bearing signal component with highest signal to noise. Conventionally, the choice of the band is made by manual spectrum comparison via identifying the resonance frequency where the largest change occurred. This paper presents a spectral kurtosis (SK) based method to determine optimum envelope analysis parameters including the filtering <b>band</b> and <b>centre</b> <b>frequency</b> through a short time Fourier transform (STFT). The results show that the maximum amplitude of the kurtogram provides the optimal parameters for band pass filter which allows both small outer race fault and large inner race fault to be determined from optimised envelope spectrum...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulically induced microseismicity is used {{to study}} {{high-frequency}} attenuation properties (6 – 72 Hz) in an enhanced geothermal system. Intrinsic and scattering attenuation are separated by jointly inverting seismogram envelopes for structural parameters, source and site effects. Modelling of synthetic envelopes is based on radiative transfer theory. To speed up inversion, an analytical solution of the radiative transfer equation for a 3 -D isotropic scattering medium is implemented. In order {{to compensate for the}} actual anisotropic scattering, a smoothing algorithm is applied to introduce envelope broadening and peak delay. The approach is tested with seismic data from four fluid-induced earthquakes (Mw ≤ 1) recorded by a temporary seismic network at the German Continental Deep Drilling (KTB) site at epicentral distances of less than 20 km. Full S-wave envelopes are inverted in 12 overlapping <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> with <b>centre</b> <b>frequencies</b> between 1. 5 and 72 Hz.

Embryonic chicken heart rate was obtained at the final incubation period (days 19 and 20) from ECG recordings. Tachograms were computed and time- and frequency-domain indices of HRV were determined.

Conventional Microstrip patch antennas has some drawbacks of low efficiency, narrow bandwidth of the central frequency, its bandwidth is limited to a few percent which is not enough for most of the wireless communication systems nowadays.
