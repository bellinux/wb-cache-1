40|$|International audienceBitter rot is {{a common}} disease mainly {{affecting}} apples (Malus domestica) worldwide, and resulting in considerable economic losses, but pears can also be affected (Ivic et al. 2013). Most of the reports refer to <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> Chinese and Asian pears (Pyrus bretschneideri and P. pyrifolia) caused by C. acutatum sensu lato or C. fructicola (Jiang et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2007; Li et al. 2013). To our knowledge, the only report <b>of</b> <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> on European pears (P. communis) was done by Ivic et al. (2013) in Croatia and the causal agent was identified as C. fioriniae. In the last 4 to 5 years, anthracnose symptoms have been repeatedly observed on the pear cultivar Beurré Hardy in September during harvest in an orchard near Brest, France. Lesions were round, 1 to 4 cm in diameter, brown, and dry, with acervuli, producing orange spore masses in concentric rings. Two fungal isolates were obtained (in 2015 and 2016, respectively) from symptomatic pears by culturing necrotic tissue pieces on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25 °C in the dark. Cultures were light gray, with cottony aerial mycelium becoming darker with age and reverse ranging from brownish pink to dark gray with black spots. Cultures have dark melanized structures similar to acervuli that oozed orange-colored conidia. Conidia were cylindrical to fusiform, pointed at one or both ends, and measured 10. 0 to 14. 0 μm × 3. 0 to 3. 5 μm. Both cultural and morphological characteristics {{were similar to those}} described for C. acutatum sensu lato (Damm et al. 2012). Total genomic DNA was extracted and the rDNA ITS region was amplified using universal primers ITS 4 and ITS 5 then sequenced. For both isolates (UBOCC-A- 116033 and UBOCC-A- 116034), resulting sequences were 100 % identical to C. acutatum species complex sequences. Based on Damm et al. (2012), strains were further characterized by sequencing partial ACT, CHS- 1, GAPDH, HIS 3, and TUB 2 genes (GenBank accession nos. KY 344741 – 52). Multilocus phylogenetic analyses carried out with the obtained and reference sequences (Damm et al. 2012) revealed that both isolates clustered within C. fioriniae, as observed using BLAST; this result was consistent with their initial identification as belonging to the C. acutatum species complex. Koch’s postulates were performed on 10 ‘Comice’ pears for each isolate. Surface sterilized fruits were wound-inoculated with 20 μl of a conidial suspension (105 conidia ml– 1). After 10 days incubation at 20 °C, symptoms identical to those initially observed developed around the inoculation point, while controls inoculated with water remained symptomless. Fungal colonies reisolated from the lesions were morphologically similar to the original isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first report <b>of</b> pear <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> caused by C. fioriniae in France. Moreover, to date, <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> was not considered as a major problem for pear growing, but as pears are the eighth largest fruit crop in production yield worldwide, pear <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> caused by Colletotrichum species may become a major problem in the future and require further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Apple (Malus domestica) is an {{important}} fruit crop in the Netherlands, with a total production of 418, 000 tons in 2011. Symptoms <b>of</b> apple <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> were observed on ‘Golden Delicious’ apples in the Netherlands in July 2013 after 9 months of storage in a packing house at controlled atmosphere. Lesions were round, 1 to 5 cm in diameter, gray and dry with acervuli, producing orange spore masses in concentric rings. Fruit were rinsed with sterile water, and lesions were sprayed with 70 % ethanol until droplet runoff. The skin was removed aseptically with a scalpel, and tissue under the lesion was isolated and placed onto Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA). The PDA plates were incubated at 20 °C in the dark, and single-spore isolates were propagated on PDA. The isolates were identified as Colletotrichum sp. based on culture morphology, having light gray to pale orange mycelium and, when viewed from the reverse side, ranged from pink to reddish orange. The cultures carried yellowish spore masses and dark melanized structures similar to acervuli that oozed orange conidia. Conidia were cylindrical to fusiform, pointed at one or both ends, and measured 8. 0 to 17. 0 μm × 3. 5 to 5. 0 μm. Both cultural and morphological characteristics of the pathogen {{were similar to those}} described for C. acutatum, causal agent <b>of</b> <b>bitter</b> <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> apple. A representative isolate (PPO- 44377) was used for multilocus gene sequencing (Damm et al. 2012). Genomic DNA was extracted using the LGC Mag Plant Kit (Berlin, Germany) in combination with the KingFisher method (Waltham, USA) and six loci were amplified and sequenced. Primer pairs ACT- 512 F + ACT- 783 R, CHS- 354 R + CHS- 79 F, GDF 1 + GDR 1, CYLH 3 F + CYLH 3 R, BT 2 Fd + BT 4 R, and ITS 1 and ITS 4 (White et al. 1990) were used for amplification of parts of the actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS- 1) gene, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), histone H 3 (HIS 3), beta-tubulin (TUB 2) and ITS region of the rDNA gene, respectively. One sequence for each locus has been deposited in GenBank under Accession Nos. KR 180290 (ACT), KR 180292 (CHS- 1), KR 180293 (GAPDH), KR 180294 (HIS 3), KR 180295 (TUB 2), and KR 180296 (ITS). MegaBLAST analysis revealed that the ITS sequences matched with 98. 9 to 100 % identity to Colletotrichum spp. belonging to C. acutatum species complex (including C. godetiae). The phylogenetic trees constructed using sequences of ACT, CHS- 1, GAPDH, HIS 3, and TUB 2 of our strain (PPO- 44377), and available sequences from GenBank confirmed the identity of this strain as C. godetiae. Koch’s postulates were performed on 15 ‘Golden Delicious’ apples. Surface-sterilized fruit were inoculated with 20 μl of a spore suspension (105 conidia/ml) prepared from a 15 -day-old PDA culture after wounding with a needle. Inoculated fruits were sealed in a plastic bag and were incubated in darkness at 20 °C. Symptoms appeared after 4 to 6 days on 80 % of the fruits while mock-inoculated controls with water remained symptomless. Fungal colonies isolated from the lesions and cultured on PDA had morphological characteristics that resembled the original isolate from the infected apples.

On table grape bunches treatment with 0. 25 atm applied for 24 h significantly reduced the incidence of gray mould. In experiments performed with artificially wounded single table grape berries exposed to 0. 50 atm for 24 h and then inoculated, the percentage of infected fruits and {{the diameter of the}} lesions were significantly reduced, in comparison with the controls. As a sub-atmospheric pressure of 0. 25 atm did not affect radial growth of B. cinerea and Monilinia laxa, induced resistance was likely to be responsible for the observed reduction in decay.

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the production of}} the biocontrol agents: Penicillium oxalicum to control Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Iycopersici in the rhizosphere; and Epicoccum nigrum and Penicillium frequentans to control Monilinia laxa in the phyllosphere. Ecophysiological studies were carried out to categorise different inoculum types, and to test their biocontrol efficacy. A method was developed for the induction of submerged conidiation of P. oxalicum for the first time. This was achieved by transferring 24 h cultures to a nitrogen free medium, and further stimulated by a high C:N ratio with 20 mM calcium. Optimum submerged conidial concentrations obtained were 35 x 10 6 spores mr 1. The hydrophobicity of submerged and aerial conidia of P. oxalicum was similar. However, different results were obtained depending on the method used. Appearance of both spore types under the SEM was similar in size and shape. However, submerged spores were covered by a filamentous matrix, absent in aerial ones. Viability of aerial and submerged P. oxalicum spores was higher than 80 % after 27 weeks, when stored fresh at either 4 or 25 °C, but aerial spores survived slightly better. Freeze-drying severely affected viability, especially of submerged spores. Aerial spores effectively colonised sterile soil in tomato seedbeds with water potentials in the range 1 - 7 (-MPa), and this was further favoured by the addition of nutrients. Aerial conidia of P. oxalicum applied to seedbeds were able to significantly (P< 0. 05) reduce Fusarium wilt of tomato at concentrations as low as 6 x 10 4 spores mr 1 substratum, indicating that the amount of the antagonist needed is not a limiting factor for the practical application of this antagoniSt. Aerial spores were slightly more effective than submerged ones in the control of the disease. However, mycelium was ineffective. Coating of tomato seeds with formulations of aerial spores of P. oxalicum in alginate or methyl cellulose significantly (P< 0. 05) enhanced the growth promotion effect of the antagonist in vitro, which {{may be related to the}} ability of the fungus to control the disease. E. nigrum spores were produced by solid fermentation on wheat grains at different water activities (aw). Maximum levels of sporulation (7 - 11 x 10 6 spores g- 1 grain) were obtained at high aw (0. 996) or reduced aw (0. 98) adjusted with a mixture glycerol/water. E. nigrum and P. frequentans were both produced in culture medium at reduced aw, to improve their ecological competence in the phyllosphere and therefore their biocontrol ability. E. nigrum produced at reduced aw showed improved germ tube extension and in some cases colony growth rate when placed on medium at reduced aw, showing water stress tolerance of such modified inocula. Furthermore, such inocula showed an enhanced ability to compete with the pathogen, M. laxa, at reduced aw, shown by a higher Niche Overlap Index (the proportion of the carbon compounds utilised by M. laxa that were also utilised by E. nigrum). E. nigrum spores produced at reduced aw had improved survival when stored fresh at 4 or 25 °C. Freeze-drying severely affected the viability of both spore types (produced at high or reduced aw). E. nigrum and P. frequentans produced at reduced aw accumulated low molecular weight polyols as compatible solutes. Improvement of biocontrol of peach twig blight was obtained in the case of E. nigrum, which is more sensitive to conditions of low water availability than the xerotolerant P. frequentans. However, both fungi accumulated glycerol as the main compatible solute, indicating that different accumulation mechanisms may be responsible for the different tolerance to low water availability. Glycerol was also the main compatible solute in E. nigrum spores produced by solid fermentation at reduced aw. E. nigrum produced at high or reduced aw was also able to control brown <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cherries,</b> under optimum conditions for the development of the disease. The results presented in this work show that the conditions during the production of biocontrol agents are critical in determining their efficacy. Therefore, when developing mass-production systems it is necessary to aim not only for high propagule numbers but also for inoculum quality, defined by parameters such as ecological competence or survival during storage...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 29 Fusarium {{isolates}} were isolated from Dendrobium orchid showing symptoms of root and stem rots. Based on morphological characteristics, three species were identified namely, F. oxysporum, F. solani, and F. proliferatum which were recovered from root and stem <b>rots</b> <b>of</b> Dendrobium. Cluster analysis of RAPD bands clearly separated F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, and F. solani into distinct clusters. The present {{studies showed that}} three Fusarium species were isolated from root and stem <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> Dendrobium and cluster analysis of RAPD bands was in agreement with morphological characterization of the Fusarium species from root and stem <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> Dendrobium...|$|R
