The two-step parallelization scheme they develop is based upon LLNL`s two-step scheme. The two-step scheme appears to have greater potential compared to the <b>basic</b> <b>schemes</b> and LLNL`s two-step scheme. Lastly, they explain the code design and describe how the functionality of C++ and the Draco framework assist {{the development of a}} parallel code...|$|R

25|$|The preludes {{are quite}} varied {{in style and}} structure, and are {{therefore}} hard to categorize, as no two praeludia are alike. The texture of Buxtehude’s praeludia {{can be described as}} either free or fugal. They consist of strict diatonic harmony and secondary dominants. Structure-wise, there usually is an introductory section, a fugue and a postlude, but this <b>basic</b> <b>scheme</b> is very frequently expanded: both BuxWV 137 and BuxWV 148 include a full-fledged chaconne along with fugal and toccata-like writing in other sections, BuxWV 141 includes two fugues, sections of imitative counterpoint and parts with chordal writing. Buxtehude’s praeludia are not circular, nor is there a recapitulation. A fugal theme, when it recurs, does so in a new, changed way. A few pieces are smaller in scope; for example, BuxWV 144, which consists only of a brief improvisatory prelude followed by a longer fugue. The sections may be explicitly separated in the score or flow one into another, with one ending and the other beginning in the same bar. The texture is almost always at least three-voice, with many instances of four-voice polyphony and occasional sections in five voices (BuxWV 150 being one of the notable examples, with five-voice structure in which two of the voices are taken by the pedal).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a performance comparison}} between the single-stream and the multi-stream approaches to lip synchronization of live media (voice and video). The former transmits a single transport stream of interleaved voice and video, while the latter treats the two media as separate transport streams. Each approach has an option not to exert the synchronization control at the destination, which leads to four <b>basic</b> <b>schemes.</b> On an interconnected ATM-wireless LAN, we implemented the four <b>basic</b> <b>schemes</b> with RTP/RTCP on top of UDP and two variants which exercise dynamic resolution control of JPEG video. Making the performance measurement of the six schemes, we compare them to identify and evaluate {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each approach. We then show that the performance difference between the two approaches is small and that the dynamic resolution control improves the synchronization quality...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{approaches}} for distributed dynamic carrier allocation algorithms: update and search. This paper investigates the fundamental {{differences between the}} {{two approaches}}. We present two simple, representative <b>schemes,</b> namely the <b>basic</b> update <b>scheme</b> and the <b>basic</b> search <b>scheme.</b> We will argue that for two reasons the update approach is more appropriate for mobile cellular networks that support real-time communications. First, it is hard to support carrier reallocations with the search approach. Second, the search approach usually incurs longer delay during carrier acquisitions than the update approach. We then propose a new update scheme that is more efficient than the <b>basic</b> update <b>scheme</b> in terms of message complexity and carrier acquisition delay. Our simulation results show that, compared to the <b>basic</b> update <b>scheme,</b> the new update scheme not only cuts the average carrier acquisition delay by 60 % to 95 %, but also reduces the average number of messages required per carr [...] ...|$|R
