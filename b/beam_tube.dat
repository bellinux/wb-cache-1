Each time after the particles pass to the other dee electrode the polarity of the RF voltage reverses. Therefore, each time the particles cross the gap from one dee electrode to the other, the electric field is in the correct direction to accelerate them. The particles' increasing speed due to these pushes causes them to move in a larger radius circle with each rotation, so the particles move in a spiral path outward from the center to {{the rim of the}} dees. When they reach the rim a small voltage on a metal plate deflects the beam so it exits the dees through a small gap between them, and hits a target located at the exit point at the rim of the chamber, or leaves the cyclotron through an evacuated <b>beam</b> <b>tube</b> to hit a remote target. Various materials may be used for the target, and the nuclear reactions due to the collisions will create secondary particles which may be guided outside of the cyclotron and into instruments for analysis.|$|E

Low beamline pressures will minimize the background radiation encountered by the BaBar Detector. A combination of copper {{and stainless steel}} vacuum chambers with continuous antechambers are used {{to make up the}} <b>beam</b> <b>tubes.</b> Linear Non-Evaporable Getter (NEG) pumps are used to produce distributed pumping along the length of these <b>beam</b> <b>tubes.</b> High conductance "microwave " type screens provide RF shields between the beam aperture and the NEG pumps. In this paper the design features of the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes,</b> NEG pumps, and RF pump screens are described and the vacuum and impedance analyses conducted in support of the design are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{the density}} and {{pressure}} of the background gas in the beam lines of thick-liquid heavy-ion fusion chambers {{is of paramount importance}} for the beams to focus and propagate properly. Additionally, transport and deposition of debris material onto metal beam-tube surfaces may reduce the breakdown voltage and permit arcing with the beam. The strategy to control the gas pressure and the rate of debris deposition is twofold. First, the cool thick-liquid jet structures will mitigate the venting to the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes.</b> The ablation and venting of debris through thick-liquid structures must be modeled to predict the quantities of debris reaching the beam ports. TSUNAMI calculations have been performed to estimate the mass and energy flux histories at the entrance of the beam ports in a 9 x 9 HYLIFE pocket geometry. Secondly, additional renewable shielding will be interposed in the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes</b> themselves. Thick-liquid vortexes are planned to coat the inside of the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes</b> and provide a quasi-continuous protection of the beam-tube walls up to the final focus magnets. A three-component molten salt, flinabe, with a low melting temperature and vapor pressure, has been identified as a candidate liquid for the vortexes. The use of flinabe may actually eliminate the necessity of mechanical shutters to rapidly close the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes</b> after target ignition...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} of the thermal issues related to the National Ignition Facility. In particular, the influences of the HVAC system and lighting fixtures on the operational performance of the laser guide <b>beam</b> <b>tubes</b> are reviewed and discussed. An analytical model of the oscillating HVAC air temperatures in the NIF switchyard and target bay will cause significant amounts of beam distortion. However, these negative effects can be drastically reduced by adding thermal insulation to the outside of the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes.</b> A computational fluid dynamics model and an analytical investigation found that the light-fixture to beam-tube separation distance must be on the order of 5. 7 m (18. 7 ft) to maintain acceptable beam operating performance in the current NIF design. By reducing the fluorescent light fixture power by 33 % this separation distance can be reduced to 3. 5 m (11. 5 ft). If in addition, thermal insulation with a reflective aluminum foil covering is added to the outside of the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes,</b> the separation distance can be reduced further to 1. 6 m (5. 2 ft). A 1. 27 cm (0. 5 in.) rigid foam insulation sheet with aluminum foil covering will provide adequate insulation for the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes</b> in the NIF switchyards and target bay. The material cost for this amount of insulation would be roughly $ 30, 000...|$|R

This collimator assembly provides further neutron-beam collimation and houses a fast-neutron filter to increase the signal-to-noise ratio at the neutron scattering instruments.|$|E

40|$|The {{installation}} of a 3 rd harmonic Landau accelerator module is planned at BESSY II to improve the beam lifetime. The passive cavity shall provide an accelerating voltage up to 500 kV for beam currents from 10 to 500 mA. A CESR Phase-III cavity [1], scaled to 1. 5 GHz, will be used. The cavity design provides strong damping of higher-order modes by ferrite loads on the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes.</b> A new module, constrained {{to fit into a}} very limited space at BESSY, is described here. It includes a piezo-electric tuner that allows amplitude control within 1 %. Non-standard modes of operation, such as normal-conducting stand-by operation and thermal breakdown are also discussed. 1 SYSTEM OVERVIEW The Landau accelerator module cavity is based on the CESR superconducting mono mode cavities developed at Cornell University [1]. The cavity design allows the propagation of all HOMs through the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes.</b> On the warm ends of the <b>beam</b> <b>tubes</b> outside the cryostat the HOM power is absorbed in water cooled ferrite loads.

50|$|<b>Beam</b> {{deflection}} <b>tubes,</b> sometimes {{known as}} sheet <b>beam</b> <b>tubes,</b> are vacuum tubes with an electron gun, a beam intensity control grid, a screen grid, sometimes a suppressor grid, and two electrostatic deflection electrodes {{on opposite sides}} of the electron beam, that can direct the rectangular beam to either of two anodes in the same plane. They can be used as two-quadrant, single-balanced mixers or (de)modulators with very linear qualities, their mode of operation similar to one-half of a Gilbert Cell, by applying an unbalanced signal f1 to the control grid and a balanced signal f2 to the deflection electrodes, then extracting the balanced mixing products f1 − f2 and f1 + f2 from the two anodes. Similar to a pentagrid converter, the cathode and the first two grids can be made into an oscillator. Two <b>beam</b> deflection <b>tubes</b> can be combined to form a double-balanced mixer.|$|R

40|$|The Napoly {{integral}} is {{the very}} useful method for calculations of wake potentials in structures where parts of the boundary extend below the beam pipe radius or the radii of the two beam pipes at both ends are unequal. It reduces CPU time a lot by deforming the integration path so that the integration contour is confined to the finite length over the gap of the structures. However, the original Napoly method {{cannot be applied to}} the transverse wake potentials in a structure where the two <b>beam</b> <b>tubes</b> on both sides have unequal radii. In this case, the integration path needed to be a straight line and the integration is stretched out to an infinite, in principle. We generalize the Napoly integrals so that integrals are always confined in a finite length even when the two <b>beam</b> <b>tubes</b> have unequal radii, for both longitudinal and transverse wake potential calculations.

50|$|The first fully {{functional}} low-velocity scanning <b>beam</b> <b>tube,</b> the CPS Emitron, {{was invented}} and {{demonstrated by the}} EMI team {{under the supervision of}} Isaac Shoenberg. In 1934, the EMI engineers Blumlein and McGee filed for patents for television transmitting systems where a charge storage plate was shielded by a pair of special grids, a negative (or slightly positive) grid lay very close to the plate, and a positive one was placed further away. The velocity and energy of the electrons in the scanning beam were reduced to zero by the decelerating electric field generated by this pair of grids, and so a low-velocity scanning <b>beam</b> <b>tube</b> was obtained. The EMI team kept working on these devices, and Lubszynski discovered in 1936 that a clear image could be produced if the trajectory of the low-velocity scanning beam was nearly perpendicular (orthogonal) to the charge storage plate in a neighborhood of it. The resulting device was dubbed the cathode potential stabilized Emitron, or CPS Emitron. The industrial production and commercialization of the CPS Emitron had to wait {{until the end of the}} second world war.|$|E
