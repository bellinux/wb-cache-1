5|$|Nichols {{recommended}} that S-50 and the Alpha tracks at Y-12 be closed down. This {{was done in}} September. Although performing <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> the Alpha tracks could not compete with K-25 and the new K-27, which had commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, thereby cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2million a month.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1951 Donen made Love Is <b>Better</b> <b>Than</b> <b>Ever.</b> The film stars Larry Parks, whose Oscar–nominated {{performance}} in The Jolson Story {{had made him}} a star five years earlier. Parks plays a streetwise show business agent who finds himself compelled to marry an innocent young dance teacher played by Elizabeth Taylor. Donen and Kelly appear in cameo roles. The film remained unreleased {{for over a year}} after Parks admitted to the House Un-American Activities Committee that he {{had been a member of}} the Communist Party and named other members. The film was unsuccessful at the box office.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{hoped that}} the Manhattan Project would develop {{improved}} calutrons and construct Alpha III racetracks, but they were judged to be uneconomical. The Alpha tracks were closed down in September 1945. Although performing <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> they could not compete with K-25 and the new K-27, which commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, thereby cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2million a month.

5|$|In 1683, George and his brother, Frederick Augustus, {{served in}} the Great Turkish War at the Battle of Vienna, and Sophia Dorothea bore George a son, George Augustus. The {{following}} year, Frederick Augustus was informed of the adoption of primogeniture, meaning {{he would no longer}} receive part of his father's territory as he had expected. It led to a breach between father and son, and between the brothers, that lasted until Frederick Augustus's death in battle in 1690. With the imminent formation of a single Hanoverian state, and the Hanoverians' continuing contributions to the Empire's wars, Ernest Augustus was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. George's prospects were now <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> as the sole heir to his father's electorate and his uncle's duchy.|$|E

5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger {{on his left}} hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} play in the Lancashire League in England during the Australian winter of 1952, joining Nelson Cricket Club for a sum of 600 pounds and bonuses, which did not include the boat fares for him and his wife. Lindwall took 96 wickets at 8.37 during the season and developed an inswinger on the advice of a local umpire who adamantly refused to give leg before wicket decisions to outswingers. Lindwall returned to Australia with a newborn son who has been born during his stay in Lancashire, and he was greeted by media speculation as to whether his professional sojourn had improved or detracted from his capabilities. Lindwall's form leading into the Tests against South Africa in 1952–53 prompted observers to opine that he was bowling <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> reinforced with the inswinger and his trademark Yorker. Lindwall made 70 from a total of 148 on a sticky wicket against South Australia in Adelaide that led Miller to regard it as the best innings he had seen under such conditions. He made the score after being sent in to open the batting in the absence of Sid Barnes.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{he showed}} some decline as a bowler in 1914, Thompson batted <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> {{and it was}} a great pity for Northamptonshire that serious {{injuries}} prevented him playing at all until 1921, when he had lost his bowling completely but retained some of his batting skill. After a few games in 1922, Thompson's career ended tamely.|$|E

25|$|With {{franchising}} of {{passenger train}} services from 1996 under then controversial privatisation of British Rail, Virgin Trains {{has become the}} main operator on the London and Birmingham to Glasgow route, introducing Pendolino train sets. Locomotive haulage of passenger trains has virtually disappeared on the route (although locomotive hauled freightliner trains are increasing). The main line service frequency is considerably <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before. First TransPennine Express operate a frequent service between Manchester Airport and Glasgow and Edinburgh.|$|E

25|$|Although he just {{failed to}} reach three-figures in the wet summer of 1930, Staples was still a force with the ball as shown when he took 7 for 24 on a sticky wicket against Leicestershire at Trent Bridge. However, in 1931 a car {{accident}} {{kept him out of}} most of Nottinghamshire's later programme and the team's bowling was very weak without him and Larwood. 1932 opened with a sensational 10 for 21 against Hampshire and saw Staples on the whole bowling <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> so that it was a surprise when after 1933 Staples decided to retire to coach the team. He did play one match as captain in 1934 when Arthur Carr was not able to play.|$|E
25|$|Bandy in USA {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} a Minnesota sport. All league matches are {{played on the}} largest artificial ice surface of the Western Hemisphere, Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval in Roseville, venue of the Bandy World Championship 1995 and the Bandy World Championship for women 2006, even by the team from Duluth. Also rink bandy competitions are organized. The United States national bandy team is typically the 6th or the 7th {{best team in the}} world, thus often having finished either last in Group A or winning Group B of the Bandy World Championship. At the 2012 tournament they were praised for being <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before. However, it was not enough to avoid being relegated to Group B. With an increasing number of participating countries, from the 2014 tournament there are 8 countries in Group A, almost securing USA a permanent place for the foreseeable future.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1898 Lockwood, having {{married again}} and slimmed considerably, began an amazing revival, with his pace and break being {{as good as}} ever. When Richardson {{returned}} to form, the two could form an amazing pair, and against Yorkshire at the Oval their wonderful bowling allowed Surrey to inflict an all-time record defeat, something they gave to Kent a week later. With the bat, Lockwood was also back in form and hit three centuries. The following year, Lockwood was plagued by injury, but {{in at least three}} matches he bowled <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> (notably when recalled for the last Test at the Oval). He also reached a thousand runs for the first time, which he repeated in 1900, when despite some inconsistencies, he was still clearly the best bowler on a good pitch when at his best. In 1901 Lockwood had a benefit match washed out by rain and played after the normal cricket season had ended. His cricket, too was disppointing, though this was largely due to injury wiping out {{more than a quarter of}} his season.|$|E

25|$|The Pacers {{started the}} 2002–03 season well, winning 14 {{of their first}} 16 games, and had {{the best record in}} the East by the time the All-Star break arrived. The same team from the year before was playing <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> but the season fell apart in the latter half. For one, Brad Miller got injured and Indiana lost one of their most {{versatile}} players. Defensive lynchpin Artest suffered from too many emotional outbursts and this further hurt the Pacers, who could only finish the season 48–34. On his part, O'Neal kept up his All-Star numbers, averaging 20.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, being only one of three players in the NBA that year to pull off a 20/10. He was voted Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice, in January and April, and would go on to be named to the All-NBA Third Team again by the season's end. With no momentum heading into the playoffs, however, the Pacers were eliminated 4–2 by the underdog Boston Celtics, marking a first-round elimination for the third year in a row. Off the court, the team had also been facing family problems. Brad Miller's father-in-law and Tinsley's mother died during the season, and just before the playoffs, O'Neal's stepfather attempted suicide. When the season ended, O'Neal tried to keep his focus on basketball and considered the possibility of joining another team since he was now a free agent. The San Antonio Spurs, led by two-time NBA Champion Tim Duncan, looked an interesting proposition as perennial All-Star David Robinson had just retired. Much as it was tempting for O'Neal to make the switch, he opted not to uproot his family and signed a seven-year, $126 million contract with the Pacers. Even so, the offseason produced a few surprises for O'Neal when Isiah Thomas was replaced by Rick Carlisle, and Brad Miller left for the Sacramento Kings. Indiana was undergoing rebuilding yet again.|$|E
