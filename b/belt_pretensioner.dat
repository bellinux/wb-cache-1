40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects by crash related car parameters on head and chest injury measures for 3 - and 12 -year-old children in near side impacts. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car which was impacted laterally by a barrier. The car model was validated in two crash conditions: the IIHS and the USNCAP side impact tests. The SID-IIs and the HBM 3 (THUMS 3 -yo) finite element models were used for the parametric investigation (HBM 3 on a booster). The car parameters were: vehicle mass, side impact structure stiffness, a head airbag, a thorax-pelvis airbag, and a seat belt with pretensioner. The studied dependent variables were: resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest viscous criterion, rib deflection, and relative velocity at head impact. The chest measurements were only considered for the SID-IIs. Results: The head airbag had the greatest effect on the head measurements for both of the occupant models. On average, it reduced the peak head linear acceleration by 54 g for the HBM 3 and 78 g for the SID-IIs. The seat belt had the second greatest effect on the head measurements; the peak head linear accelerations were reduced on average by 39 g (HBM 3) and 44 g (SID-IIs). The high stiffness side structure increased the SID-IIs head acceleration, while it had marginal effect on the HBM 3. The vehicle mass had marginal effect on SID-IIs head accelerations, while the lower vehicle mass caused 18 g higher head acceleration for HBM 3 and the greatest rotational acceleration. The thorax-pelvis airbag, the vehicle mass and the seat <b>belt</b> <b>pretensioner</b> affected the chest measurements the most. The presence of a thorax-pelvis airbag, high vehicle mass and a seat <b>belt</b> <b>pretensioner</b> all reduced the chest VC and peak rib deflection in the SID-IIs. Conclusions: The head and thorax-pelvis airbags have the potential to reduce injury measurements for both the SID-IIs and the HBM 3, provided that the airbag properties are designed to consider these occupant sizes also. The seat <b>belt</b> <b>pretensioner</b> is also effective, provided that the lateral translation of the torso is managed by other features. The importance of lateral movement management is greater the smaller the occupant is. Light vehicles require interior restraint systems of higher performance than heavy vehicles do to achieve the same level of injury measures for a given side structure...|$|E
40|$|Thesis in {{the field}} of passive safety problems, traffic {{accidents}} and health outcomes of participants in road traffic accidents is aimed, inter alia, to create an overview of modern passive safety elements especially cars.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the outcome}} of the continuous improved occupant protection {{over the last two decades}} for front seat near side occupants in side impacts based on a real world driven working process. The effectiveness of four generations of improved side impact protection are calculated based on data from Volvo’s statistical accident database of Volvo Cars in Sweden. Generation I includes vehicles with a new structural and interior concept (SIPS). Generation II includes vehicles with structural improvements and a new chest airbag (SIPSbag). Generation III includes vehicles with further improved SIPS and SIPSbag as well as the new concept with a head protecting Inflatable Curtain (IC). Generation IV includes the most recent vehicles with further improvements of all the systems plus advanced sensors and seat <b>belt</b> <b>pretensioner</b> activation. Compared to baseline vehicles, vehicles of generation I reduce MAIS 2 + injuries by 54 %, generation II by 61 % and generation III by 72 %. For generation IV effectiveness figures cannot be calculated because of the lack of MAIS 2 + injuries. A continuous improved performance is also seen when studying the AIS 2 + pelvis, abdomen, chest and head injuries separately. By using the same real world driven working process, future improvements and possibly new passive as well as active safety systems, will be developed with the aim of further improved protection to near side occupants in side impacts...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Investigate the {{combined}} effects of belt geometry, seat substructure, and seat <b>belt</b> <b>pretensioners</b> and load limiters on rear seat occupant injury risk. Methods: An instrumented Hybrid III 5 th percentile adult female dummy {{was subjected to}} simulated frontal impacts (Δv = 45. 8 km/h, peak acceleration = 27. 1 g). Testing was conducted on a rear seat of a typical family sedan with modifications allowing for adjustment in upper anchorage position, mounting of an antisubmarining seat pan, {{and the use of}} seat <b>belt</b> <b>pretensioners</b> with load limiters. Results: Dummy seated posture had the strongest effect on submarining. Seat <b>belt</b> <b>pretensioners</b> with load limiters reduced head and femur excursion and decreased chest injury measurements but did not prevent submarining. The antisubmarining seat pan, on the other hand, prevented submarining in one case but could not prevent submarining with the dummy in a slouched posture. Upper anchorage position resulting in poor belt geometry was shown to increase both chest injury measures and submarining. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate the importance of an upright seated posture and the potential benefits of including adjustable upper anchorages to allow good sash belt fit, antisubmarining seat pans, belt buckles positioned near the seat bight, and seat <b>belts</b> with <b>pretensioners</b> and load limiters for rear seat occupants. These data can be used to inform the design of a system of restraints to reduce injuries to rear seat occupants. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The UK Co-operative Crash Injury Study {{currently}} includes data on 205 seat belted drivers from frontal impacts {{in which an}} air bag deployed; of these, 142 suffered some degree of injury. To detect the influence of frontal air bags, the distribution of injury over the body regions of these drivers was {{compared to that of}} a much larger group from vehicles without air bags. The injured drivers from air bag vehicles showed relatively fewer head injuries, especially fractures, and relatively more arm injuries. No abnormal types of injury or circumstances of injury were identified for the air bag group. Air bags generally appear to deploy at vehicle impact severities that pose a statistical risk of significant head injury, and also in a proportion of lower severity impacts.

40|$|Major {{gains in}} {{occupant}} protection in automotive crashes {{have been made}} {{over the past few}} decades, with the introduction of technologies such as airbags and seat <b>belt</b> <b>pretensioners.</b> However, the focus, both in terms of regulation and consumer testing, has been on front seat occupants. With rear seat occupants being over-represented in vehicle fatalities, {{there is a need to}} examine protection offered to those who sit in the back seat of motor vehicles. This thesis consists of six inter-related studies focused on characterising the rates and biomechanical mechanisms of the injury to rear seat occupants (not using child restraints), and evaluations of both existing and novel technologies for improving injury outcomes for rear seat occupants. The methods used include in-depth crash investigation and crash sled testing, with a focus on children aged 8 - 16 and older occupants. The results of these studies indicate that substantial casualty savings in rear seat occupants might be achieved through the implementation of existing technology to front seat occupants. While the results of the in-depth crash investigation demonstrated that injury mechanisms differ between front and rear seat occupants, it was found from sled testing that tailoring existing technologies to meet the needs of rear seat occupants, such as younger and older occupants, may substantially improve rear seat occupant protection. Vehicle regulation and consumer testing has previously been an effective method for driving improvements in occupant protection, and it is recommended that vehicle regulation bodies incorporate requirements for performance of the rear seat occupant protection system...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{restrained}} occupants over the age of 50 in frontal crashes have a higher risk of injury in the rear seat than in the front, and have hypothesized that the incorporation of technology such as belt pre-tensioning and force limiting preferentially in the front seat is at least partially responsible for this trend. This study investigates the potential benefits and trade-offs of seat <b>belt</b> <b>pretensioners</b> and force-limiters in the rear seat using a series of frontal impact sled tests at two speeds (48 km/h and 29 km/h ΔV) with a buck representing the interior of the reat seat occupant compartment of a contemporary mid-sized sedan. Four different dummies were tested: the Hybrid III six year old (in a booster seat, H 3 6 YO), the Hybrid III 5 th percentile female (H 3 AF 05), the Hybrid III 50 th percentile male (H 3 AM 50), and the THOR-NT. The restraints consisted of either a standard three point belt, or a 3 -point belt with a retractor pretensioner and a progressive force-limiter (FL+PT). Each test condition was repeated in triplicate. The FL+PT restraints (compared to the standard restraints) resulted in a significant (p≤ 0. 05) decrease in peak internal chest deflection for each of the Hybrid III dummies at both test speeds (48 km/h: 29 % decrease for H 3 6 YO, 38 % decrease for H 3 AF 05, 30 % decrease for H 3 AM 50), and for the THOR-NT at a ΔV of 29 km/h. At 48 km/h, the FL+PT restraint qualitatively decreased the average peak internal chest deflection of the THOR-NT, however this decrease was not statistically significant (p= 0. 06). Furthermore, the FL+PT system allowed little or no increase in forward head excursion, and improved whole-body kinematics for all dummies by restricting pelvic excursion and slightly increasing torso pitch. The results suggest that the FL+PT system studied here may provide injury-reducing benefit to rear seat occupants in moderate to high severity frontal crashes, although more study is needed to evaluate these restraints in other crash scenarios...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{presents}} a broad comprehensive research effort that combines expertise from industry and academia and uses various methodologies with applied research directed towards countermeasures. The project includes real world crash data analysis, real world driving studies and crash testing and simulations, aiming at enhancing {{the safety of}} forward facing child occupants (aged 3 y to small adults) in the rear seat during frontal to side impacts. The real world crash data analyses of properly restrained children originate from European as well as US data. Frontal and side impact crash tests are analyzed using different sizes of crash test dummies in different sitting postures. Side impact parameter studies using FE-models are run. The sitting posture and behavior of 12 children are monitored while riding in the rear seat. Also, the body kinematics and belt position during actual braking and turning maneuvers are studied for 16 rear seat child occupants and for various child dummies. Real world crash data indicates {{that several of the}} injured children in frontal impacts, despite being properly restrained, impacted the vehicle interior structure with their head/face resulting in serious injury. This was attributed to oblique crashes, pre-crash vehicle maneuvers or high crash severity. Crash tests confirm the importance of proper initial belt-fit for best protection. The crash tests also highlight the difficulty in obtaining the real world kinematics and head impact locations using existing crashtest dummies and test procedures. The side impact parameter studies indicate that the vehicle’s occupant protection systems, such as airbags and seat <b>belt</b> <b>pretensioners,</b> {{play an important role in}} protecting children as well. The results from the on-road driving studies illustrate the variation of sitting postures during riding in the rear seat giving valuable input to the effects of the restraint systems and to how representative the standardized dummy seating positioning procedures are. The results from the maneuver driving studies illustrate the importance of understanding the kinematics of a child relative to the seat belt in a real world maneuver situation. Real world safety of rear seat occupants, especially children, involves evaluation of protection beyond standard crash testing scenarios in frontal and side impact conditions. This project explores the complete context of rear seat protection in impact situations ranging from front to side and directions in between highlighting the importance of pre-crash posture and behavior. This research project at SAFER (Vehicle and Traffic Safety Centre at Chalmers), where researchers from the industry and universities cooperate with the aim to further improve safety for children (from 3 y) to small adults in the rear seat, speeds up the process to safety implementation due to the interaction between academic and industrial researchers...|$|R
