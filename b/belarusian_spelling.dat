2500|$|... "On 1 September 2010, {{new rules}} of Belarusian orthography came into force. According {{to the old}} rules, the correct {{spelling}} of the word “fifty” in Belarusian was “пяцьдзесят,” (piaćdziesiat) but under the new rules, it should be spelled “пяцьдзясят,” (piaćdziasiat) the difference being that the seventh character was the Cyrillic letter IE but is now the Cyrillic letter YA. As {{a result of these}} new rules, the existing 50- and 50,000-ruble notes dated 2000 now technically contain errors where the denominations are spelled out on the notes. On 29 December 2010, the National Bank of Belarus introduced new 50- and 50,000-ruble banknotes to bring the inscriptions on the notes into compliance with the new rules of <b>Belarusian</b> <b>spelling</b> and punctuation. The images, colors, and sizes of the notes remain consistent with the preceding issues of the same denominations dated 2000. The modified 50-ruble notes also no longer has a security thread, and the modified 50,000-ruble notes have replaced the solid security thread for a 2-mm wide windowed security thread." ...|$|E
5000|$|Note also that, {{unlike in}} Russian, <b>Belarusian</b> <b>spelling</b> closely {{represents}} surface phonology {{rather than the}} underlying morphophonology. For example, akannye, tsyekannye, dzyekannye and the [...] allophone of [...] and [...] are all written. The representation of akannye in particular introduces striking differences between Russian and Belarusian orthography.|$|E
5000|$|The decree {{had been}} named On Changing and Simplifying <b>Belarusian</b> <b>Spelling</b> (...) , {{but the bulk of}} the changes had been {{introduced}} into the grammar. Yan Stankyevich in his critique of the reform talked about 25 changes, with one of them being strictly orthographical and 24 relating to both orthography and grammar. 1936 ...|$|E

5000|$|The website came up {{originally}} in 2003. Initially {{it had its}} own interface, {{totally different}} from Google, and its own search database which listed {{only a few thousand}} Belarusian sites. Later, the actual Google interface and logo were implemented. The fake interface has Russian and Belarusian versions, with <b>Belarusian</b> version having <b>spelling</b> errors ("У інтернэце" [...] instead of [...] "У інтэрнэце"). The search form then posted the search queries to an actual search application on google.com.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{significant}} instance {{of this is}} in the representation of vowel reduction, and in particular akannye, the merger of unstressed /a/ and /o/, which exists in both Russian and <b>Belarusian.</b> <b>Belarusian</b> always <b>spells</b> this merged sound as , whereas Russian uses either [...] or , according to what the [...] "underlying" [...] phoneme is (determined by looking at related words where the vowel is stressed, or if no such words exist, either by etymology or by the pronunciation in dialects that lack the merger). This means that Belarusian noun and verb paradigms, as written, have large numbers of instances of alternations between written [...] and , whereas no such alternations exist in the corresponding written paradigms in Russian. This can significantly complicate the task of foreign speakers in learning these paradigms; but, on the other hand, it makes spelling easier for native speakers.|$|R
5000|$|Artyom [...] (Артём) is a male {{given name}} common in Russia and other Slavic-speaking countries. The name uses the [...] "ё" [...] letter, {{which can be}} {{transcribed}} to English as [...] "e" [...] but still has the [...] "yo" [...] sound. Furthering confusion there is another name Artem (Артем), whose only spelling in English is [...] "Artem", and is pronounced with the [...] "em" [...] ending syllable. The <b>Belarusian</b> <b>spelling</b> is Арцём.|$|E
50|$|Erakovic and Monica Niculescu {{were the}} runners-up to Victoria Azarenka and Olga Govortsova (<b>Belarusian</b> <b>spelling</b> being Volha Havartsova) in the 2004 Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles, before Erakovic teamed with Michaëlla Krajicek {{to win the}} 2004 US Open girls' doubles title, beating Niculescu and her Romanian {{teammate}} Mădălina Gojnea. Erakovic became the first player from New Zealand to win a Grand Slam title (Singles or Doubles) since James Greenhalgh and Steven Downs won the Boys' Doubles at Wimbledon and the French Open in 1993; before that, it was David Lewis, who won the 1981 Australian Open Boys' Doubles title in partnership with Australian Tony Withers. She then partnered Azarenka to an easy win in the 2005 Australian Open girls' doubles over Nikola Fraňková and Ágnes Szávay, and reunited with Niculescu to be runners-up in the 2005 Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles, defeated this time by Azarenka and Szávay.|$|E
