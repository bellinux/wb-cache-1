5|$|In {{order to}} store the high level {{radioactive}} waste in long-term geological depositories, specific waste forms need to be used which will allow the radioactivity to decay away while the materials retain their integrity for thousands of years. The materials being used can <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> a few classes: glass waste forms, ceramic waste forms, and nanostructured materials.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E

50|$|Glucose and {{galactose}} {{are called}} simple sugars, or monosaccharides. Sucrose and lactose are called disaccharides {{because they are}} made from two simple sugars, and <b>are</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> these simple sugars during digestion. Sucrose <b>is</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> glucose and another simple sugar called fructose, and lactose <b>is</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> glucose and galactose. As a result, lactose, sucrose and other compounds made from carbohydrates cannot be digested by individuals with glucose-galactose malabsorption.|$|R

5|$|As on the White Pass trail, {{supplies}} {{needed to}} <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> smaller packages and carried in relay. Packers, prepared to carry supplies for cash, were available {{along the route}} but would charge up to $1 ($27) per lb (0.45kg) on the later stages; many of these packers were natives: Tlingits or, less commonly, Tagish. Avalanches were common in the mountains and, on April 3, 1898, one {{claimed the lives of}} more than 60 people travelling over Chilkoot Pass.|$|E
5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|Maeda {{not only}} taught {{the art of}} judo to Carlos Gracie, but also taught a {{particular}} philosophy {{about the nature of}} combat based on his travels competing and training alongside catch-wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters, and various other martial artists. The book details Maeda's theory that physical combat could <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> distinct phases, such as the striking phase, the grappling phase, the ground phase, and so on. Thus, it was a smart fighter's task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat that best suited his own strengths. The book further states that this theory was a fundamental influence on the Gracie approach to combat. The approach included armed versus armed, armed versus unarmed, unarmed, standing (tachiwaza, 立ち技), kneeling (suwariwaza, 座技), and ground work (newaza, 寝技), close quarters (hakuheijugi, 白兵主義), and other forms of combat. It was employed by other proponents of judo ('Kano jiu-jutsu') who, like Maeda, engaged in challenge match fighting overseas as judo spread internationally (e.g., Yukio Tani in the United Kingdom from 1905, Mikonosuke Kawaishi in France, and others).|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulty}} of deploying artillery in New Guinea {{led to a}} need for a gun which could <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> light parts and transported by aircraft or jeeps. The Army had {{only a small number of}} British 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzers, and Australia's request for United States M116 75mm pack howitzers was not immediately filled. In September 1942, the Army's Director of Artillery, Brigadier John O'Brien, suggested that a variant of the 25-pounder be developed to meet this requirement. This proposal was agreed to, and all development work was conducted in Australia by the Army, the Ordnance Production Directorate and Charles Ruwolt Pty Ltd. The process of designing the gun began in September 1942, and an acceptable weapon was ready by January the next year. The three agencies cooperated well as they were strongly motivated to provide the Army with a useful light artillery piece as quickly as possible. During this period, the Army received thirty-eight 75mm pack howitzers, and deployed some of these guns to New Guinea.|$|E
