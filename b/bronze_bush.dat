5000|$|The Norton 650 and 750 {{vertical}} twin engines had a reliability problem. At about 7000 rpm {{the piston}} exceeds the engineering limit for piston speed, so over-revving soon destroys the engines. The BSA 650 had a <b>bronze</b> <b>bush</b> main {{bearing on the}} right hand side, doubling as the crank oil feed, {{with a lack of}} effective crankshaft end play control, that all had difficulty staying together when ridden hard, even though the rest of the design was possibly more robust than the Triumph. The Triumph vertical twin used a ball on the timing side, and a roller on the other, with the oil feeding through a separate <b>bronze</b> <b>bush</b> in the outer right hand engine side cover.Whereas the Norton 650SS 646.44 cc had a bore and stroke of 68 x 89 mm giving [...] @ 6,800 rpm, the Triumph T120 Bonneville 649.31 cc had a bore and stroke of 71 x 82 mm giving [...] @ 6,500 rpm. However the mean piston speed of the Norton was 3,971 ft/min (almost at the, then accepted, limit of 4,000 ft/min). The Triumph, with its shorter stroke, had a mean piston speed of only 3,497 ft/min, had much less vibration and was much stronger and reliable. Road tests showed that the Norton had a higher top speed due to its [...] advantage. In spite of this, the Triumph was the much preferred engine. The Norton featherbed was the preferred frame, hence the Triton.|$|E

25|$|In 1908 New Castle {{was linked}} to Pittsburgh by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, an {{interurban}} trolley line. Steel and paper mills, foundries, a <b>bronze</b> <b>bushing</b> factory, and car-construction plants contributed to the economy. In addition, the Shenango China produced commercial china and created the fine Castleton china line for the White House, including dinnerware for Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. Other ceramic factories produced bathroom fixtures and industrial refractory materials.|$|R
50|$|Inexpensive {{record players}} {{typically}} used a flanged steel stamping for the turntable structure. A rubber disc would be secured {{to the top}} of the stamping to provide traction for the record, as well as a small amount of vibration isolation. The spindle bearing usually consisted of a <b>bronze</b> <b>bushing.</b> The flange on the stamping provided a convenient place to drive the turntable by means of an idler wheel (see below). While light and cheap to manufacture, these mechanisms had low inertia, making motor speed instabilities more pronounced.|$|R
50|$|The final {{development}} of the Velocette KTT, the Mk VIII KTT was introduced in 1938 at that year's Earls Court Show, {{and was the first}} motorcycle to use the now-conventional swinging-arm rear fork with a shock absorber unit (in this case, an oleo-pneumatic unit built by the Oleo Strut Co. of England). The rear suspension system was designed by Veloce development engineer Harold Willis, and was inspired by the Oleo strut landing gear on the DeHavilland Hornet he borrowed at the Midland Aero Club, while his beloved DeHavilland 'Moth' was undergoing repair. Contact with the Oleo company led to several pairs of air shocks built for Veloce in 1936, for which the factory's racing rigid-frame racers (similar to the Mark VII KTT) were adapted with a swinging-fork rear end and bolt-on subframe for the seat. The experimental first swinging-arms used an adapted steering head lug turned sideways, with the cup-and-cone bearings retained. Production Mark VIII KTTs used a more conventional <b>bronze</b> <b>bush</b> and trunnion shaft pivot for the one-piece rear fork. The first experimental swing-arm machines were raced by the factory in the 1937 season, and introduced as the Mark VIII KTT the next year, for sale to the public.|$|E
50|$|The 24 in bore by 28 in stroke {{cylinders}} were interchangeable {{with those}} of the Class 16E. A 4+1/2 in thick cast-iron liner was fitted between the smokebox and its saddle to obtain this interchangeability. The cylinders had cast-iron liners and the steam and exhaust valve seatings were renewable. The connecting and coupling rods were fitted with floating <b>bronze</b> <b>bushes</b> and all crank pins were hollow bored. Soft grease lubrication was used for the motion, while the coupled wheel axle boxes were hard grease lubricated.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the layout}} of the gearbox, the {{layshaft}} is normally mounted low-down in the gearbox casing below the other shafts. The gear lever enters through the top of the casing and so it is more convenient for the sliding components of the dog clutches to be mounted on the driven shaft, rather than the layshaft. The layshaft gear cluster is thus often a simple one-piece component, typically cast iron gears running in bearings on a fixed steel shaft. The bearings may be plain phosphor <b>bronze</b> <b>bushes,</b> or for high-load applications needle rollers.|$|R
50|$|The {{main bar}} frames were {{machined}} from rolled steel slabs and each frame {{was in one}} piece from the front to the hind buffer beam. The wheels were fitted with hollow crank pins, while the leading bogie was fitted with an oil bath centre pivot. The connecting and coupling rods were fitted with floating <b>bronze</b> <b>bushes</b> and were made of special chrome-nickel alloy steel of fluted section. The centre driving set of coupled wheels were flangeless and had wider treads {{than the other two}} sets to prevent them from slipping off the rails in sharp curves.|$|R
2500|$|The Praga B2 was a dual ignition, {{air-cooled}} horizontal twin producing 40 horsepower (30kW) {{aimed at}} lightweight aircraft. [...] It was a higher compression version (6.7:1 {{from the earlier}} 5.72:1) of the original and otherwise very similar Praga B, which provided 36hp (27kW). [...] Its cylinders were machined from alloy steel forgings and had aluminium alloy heads. The pistons were of aluminium alloy, with three compression rings and one scraper ring. The connecting rods were of nitrided steel, with divided big ends and <b>bronze</b> <b>bushes</b> at the little ends. The one piece crankshaft was also formed from nitrided steel and had two main roller bearings and a single ball thrust bearing. The single piece crankcase was cast from an aluminium alloy.|$|R
5000|$|The Royal Star had a {{relatively}} small 1" [...] single Amal monobloc carburettor, and later Concentric carburettor, but in 1964 new 8.5:1 pistons and a new gearbox improved performance. The machine had {{a top speed of}} about 90 mph and was relatively free of vibration. Sharing common engine and cycle parts with the larger BSA A65 Star 650 twin, it was an over-engineered machine and proved very robust. The only major fault with the engine design was a plain crankshaft bearing on the timing side which, when worn, would cause a drop in oil pressure. In 1965, BSA addressed the bearing issues with a roller bearing on the drive side, as it had been on the pre-unit engines, with an improved <b>bronze</b> <b>bushing</b> on the timing side.|$|R

The analytical dependences for the determination of thickness to be formed during the friction process of film have been ascertained; the interconnection of mechanical-and-physical properties of composition platings with the nature of polymeric particles has been showed. The rebuilding process of parts (by example of <b>bronze</b> <b>bushes)</b> by the electrolytic polymerometallic platings on the copper basis has been developed. The developed process has been introduced at the Alexandriya Motor-Vehicle Repair Works, Kirovograd Region.

40|$|Environmentally adapted {{lubricants}} (EALs) {{are becoming}} of increasing {{interest to the}} industry as legislation demands the replacement of mineral oil lubricants. However, little or nothing {{is known about the}} infl uence of ageing on the performance of these fl uids in mixed and boundary lubricated tribological contacts. In this study, samples of three fully formulated lubricating oils, both in their ‘unaged’ form and ‘aged’ by means of an oxidation process in the laboratory, were utilized in a detailed study whereby variations in relative lubrication performance were examined. Standard laboratory pin-on-disc equipment was utilized in order to allow comparisons to be made and the defi nition of conclusions for a sliding tin bronze on steel contact. This simulated the interaction between an oil-lubricated <b>bronze</b> <b>bushing</b> and steel shaft as found in the vane adjustment mechanism of a Kaplan turbine. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was employed to assess the effect on surface layer structural chemistry. Results showed, for the specifi c application being investigated, that EALs continue to function well in terms of their friction and wear performance even at high acid numbers...|$|R
40|$|Abrasion is {{generally}} defined as wear caused by fine solid particles. In this paper the term abrasion will refer only to wear caused by hard particles introduced into and entrained by a fluid flowing between two solid surfaces, the particles possibly becoming embedded {{in one of}} these surfaces. For the study of this type of wear a plain journal bearing was considered suitable. Arguments for this choice and a description of the apparatus are given. The use of an aerostatic bearing for the application of load to the plain journal bearing has made friction torque measurement feasible. The abrasives used were silicon carbide particles of very narrow size distributions; the carrier fluid was a mixture of a srraight mineral oil and n-hexadecane. The wear of the shaft was determined by measuring its surface profile, the wear of the bush by measuring its deviation from roundness. Various combinations of materials were investigated. In most cases hardened steel shafts and soft <b>bronze</b> <b>bushes</b> were used. In addition, some plastic materials served for the bushes; steel, bronze, and aluminium were applied both as bush and as shaft material. Embedding of particles was observed at various places in the bushes, which were usually softer than the shaft. Additional information on the wear processes was obtained by microscopical inspection of the worn surfaces. Results of the experiments are discussed. APPARATU...|$|R
40|$|PhDClearances at {{connections}} {{of mechanical}} systems may allow contact to be momentarily lost between the interconnected elements resulting in impact loading, {{the generation of}} noise and deterioration of the bearing surfaces. The work presented examines the dynamic behaviour of a planar mechanism having clearances-at two of its bearings and suggests criteria which may be applied {{at the design stage}} to ensure that contact loss does not occur. A test rig has been developed having both rotary and oscillatory inputs and operable as a single input 4 /bar ljnkage or a double input 5 /bar linkage mechanism. The rotary input is varied between 170 and 370 rev/min and the oscillatory input between 10 and 22 Hz at amplitudes of 1. 8 and 2. 6 mm. Acceleration impact levels are measured by means of small accelerometers embedded in the bearing housing. The bearings are nominally 25 mm diameter steel pins with sintered <b>bronze</b> <b>bushes.</b> Clearances in the range of 15 to 105 gm are examined. An-additional dynamic constraint to the system is provided by spring loading one of the links. The series of tests performed establish various conditions at which impact loading occurs. A mathematical model of the test rig is developed, the equations of motion being solved numerically. Following some earlier work a zero-clearance analysis of the system has been used to develop empirical relationships for describing the occurrence and magnitude of the impact loading. These relationships are applicable to the system when only one bearing has a finite clearance and when two bearings have finite clearances. The interactive effects of a two clearance bearing system are examined in detail and it is concluded that the empirical relationships developed may be generally applied...|$|R

40|$|For the {{die casting}} {{conditions}} of aluminium bronzes assumed {{based on the}} literature data, a thick-walled bush was cast, made of complex aluminium bronze (Cu-Al-Fe-Ni-Cr). After the cast {{was removed from the}} mould, cracks were observed inside it. In order to identify the stage in the technological production process at which, potentially, the formation of stresses damaging the continuity of the microstructure created in the cast was possible (hot cracking and/or cold cracking), a computer simulation was performed. The article presents the results of the computer simulation of the process of casting the material into the gravity die as well as solidifying and cooling of the cast {{in the shape of a}} thick-walled bush. The simulation was performed with the use of the MAGMA 5 program and by application of the CuAl 10 Ni 5, 5 Fe 4, 5 alloy from the MAGMA 5 program database. The results were compared with the location of the defects identified in the actual cast. As a result of the simulation of the die-casting process of this bush, potential regions were identified where significant principal stresses accumulate, which can cause local hot and cold cracking. Until now, no research has been made of die-cast aluminium bronzes with a Cr addition. Correlating the results of the computer simulation validated by the analysis of the actual cast made it possible to clearly determine the critical regions in the cast exposed to cracking and point to the causes of its occurrence. Proposals of changes in the bush die casting process were elaborated, in order to avoid hot tearing and cold cracking. The article discusses the results of preliminary tests being a prologue to the optimization of the die-casting process parameters of complex aluminium <b>bronze</b> thick-walled <b>bushs...</b>|$|R
