The coupled Nernst-Planck equations (multi-ion model, MIM) for the concentration {{fields of the}} ions in solution and the Stokes equation for the flow field are solved simultaneously. The predictions of the multi-ion model are compared with the predictions of two simplified models based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBM) and the Smoluchowski 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>slip</b> velocity (SVM).

We retrieve the {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of slip during this mega-earthquake through a joint inversion of teleseismic records, InSAR and High Rate GPS (HRGPS) data. Additionally, our model is shown to agree with broadband surface waves. Rupture initiated at about 32 km depth and propagated bilaterally resulting in two main slip zones located SSW and NNE of the hypocenter. Nucleation {{did not take place}} within or at the edge of one of these main asperities, but in between. During the first 30 <b>s,</b> <b>slip</b> propagated predominantly southwards. Later on, the rupture evolved more slowly and more symmetrically. Eventually, the northern asperity became predominant with maximum slip reaching about 20 m. Most of the seismic moment was released within 110 s, a relatively short time, explained by the bilateral propagation. The overall average rupture velocity is 2. 6 km/s but propagation occurred initially faster towards the south (3. 2 km/s). Large slip did not reach the trench, a result consistent with the moderate size of the tsunami. Down-dip, rupture stopped at about 50 km depth, in agreement with the lower limit of the locked zone inferred by Ruegg et al. (2009) from pre-seismic GPS data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{study of}} {{boundary}} layer flow and heat transfer of an electrically conducting visco-elastic second grade fluid in a porous medium past a stretching sheet is conducting with power law surface temperature or power law surface heat flux. The flow in boundary layer {{is considered to}} be generated solely by the linear stretching of the boundary sheet adjacent to porous medium in a magnetic field with boundary wall slip condition. The governing partial differential equations are converted into non linear ordinary differential equations by similarity transformations. The solutions of dimensionless surface temperature as well as non-similar flow and heat transfer characteristics with the governing dimensionless parameters of the problem which include a non-linear stretching sheet, viscous dissipation, internal heat generation /absorption and temperature gradient dependent heat sink, power-law index of wall temperature parameters are obtained in terms of Confluent Hypergeometric Functions (CHF) and tabulated. The skin friction at the wall is also derived. It is observed that the suction (<b>S),</b> <b>Slip</b> parameter (L), the permeability of the medium (k 2) and the magnetic parameter (M), visco-elastic parameter (k 1) depress the longitudinal velocity magnitudes but influences positively the transverse velocity while the suction, wall temperature parameter, temperature gradient dependent heat sink (Q), lowers temperature and heat transfer distribution aiding in controlling momentum and heat transfer during material processing.

40|$|Is there {{a debate}} about public debt in Canada—and if there is, why should anyone care about it? Ten years ago, the context for {{discussion}} of public debt in Canada was an economy in which federal and provincial governments were still running substantial deficits, {{despite the fact that}} public debt had recently risen rapidly to fractions of GDP that had not been seen in half a century. In addition, with high unemployment and a recent growth experience that contrasted very unfavourably with the USA, Canadians had ample reason for dissatisfaction with their real economic outcomes. Debate on the issue of public deficits and debts was therefore fierce, with frequent expressions of a sense of crisis, many adverse comparisons with other nations and a broad awareness {{of the importance of the}} government debt issue for Canadian society. In contrast, in 2002 - 03, the federal government, like most provinces, was running a financial surplus, and economic growth was strong. The debt/GDP 1 ratio was, as a consequence, dropping like a stone. Canadians were adjusting to the prevalence of newspaper stories about the superior job creation record of the Canadian labour market, as growth in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>slipped</b> below that in Canada.

To address our hypothesis, 79 M. longissimus dorsi (LD) steaks from cattle of unknown background {{were used to}} provide information on slip points, percentage intramuscular lipid, fatty acid composition, and MUFA:SFA ratios. Overlying s. c. adipose tissue was separated from the muscle lean, which contained intramuscular (i. m.) adipose tissue. Lipids were extracted from s. c. adipose tissue and muscle lean by a modified chloroform:methanol procedure and subjected to various analyses. The hypothesis was tested by developing regression equations to determine which fatty acid variables were most useful in predicting carcass composition. There was a high correlation between s. c. MUFA:SFA ratio and <b>s.</b> c. <b>slip</b> points (P < 0. 001) with an R 2 of 0. 557. Also, the MUFA:SFA fatty acid ratios of s. c. and i. m. adipose tissue were significantly correlated and an R 2 of 0. 440 was observed (P < 0. 001) when regressed against each other. The current data set observed s. c. MUFA:SFA ratios (0. 73) lower than previous studies, which suggests a population of young or unfinished cattle.

40|$|Abstract—After {{an initial}} fault lowers bus voltage, {{induction}} motors {{connected to the}} bus can successively stall in a cascading process {{that can lead to}} a voltage collapse or delayed voltage recovery. There are typically many induction motors connected to the bus, and models that aggregate the motors do not capture the cascading stall. We study the cascading stall in a simple power system with many induction motors using a quasistatic assumption and randomization of some motor parameters, and hence efficiently estimate the distribution of the number of motors stalled. This approach is also extended to a simple 4 -bus system and a simple motor dynamics and similar results are obtained. These distributions can often be fit with a high-level and generic probabilistic model of cascading failure, showing a commonality between cascading motor stall and other cascading processes.
