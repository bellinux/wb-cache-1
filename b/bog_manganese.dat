40|$|Several <b>bog</b> <b>manganese</b> {{deposits}} {{were discovered}} in the Riding Mountain area in Manitoba during {{the spring and summer}} of 1940. A study was made of the known deposits to determine the grade of the occurrences, a possible source of the manganese oxides in the bog deposits and the possibilities of locating other manganese occurrences. Samples of the <b>bog</b> <b>manganese,</b> of spring waters from which the manganese oxides have apparently been precipitated, of the Odanah shale in which the deposits occur, and of "ironstone" nodules found in the Odanah and Riding Mountain shales were gathered in the field and later analyzed. In addition to chemical analyses of the above-mentioned samples, several polished sections of the manganese oxides were prepared and studied under the microscope, thin-sections of nodules were examined, and spectrographic analyses of both nodules and <b>bog</b> <b>manganese</b> were made.

40|$|<b>Bog</b> <b>manganese</b> {{was long}} ago {{reported}} from various places in Columbia county (1 : 54) {{and it seemed}} well to reexamine these occurrences. According to W. W. Mather in his report of the First District Survey, 1836 - 42, " in the counties of Columbia and Dutchess 50, 000 tons of manganese could be procured without any great expense, if carefully prepared. " He also stated {{that some of the}} <b>bog</b> <b>manganese</b> showed on analysis as high as 68. 5 per cent manganese oxide and less than 5 per cent silica. At the direction of the State Geologist the writer has devoted most of the summer of 191 7 to this work. The results of this investigation, though not in any way confirming the quantitative results of Mr Mather, are herewith published as a matter of record and as an account of the manner of the occurrence and the genesis of postglacial <b>bog</b> <b>manganese...</b>|$|E
40|$|Initial {{data on the}} hydrogen-isotopic {{compositions}} in hydrous Mn minerals {{from various}} occurrences fall {{in a wide range}} from - 298 to - 84 per mil, relative to SMOW. DeltaD-values of todorokite and cryptomelane from Tertiary deposits show - 89 and - 150 per mil. 10 Angström-manganite and Delta-MnO 2 from deep-sea nodules have relatively restricted DeltaD-values ranging from - 96 to - 84 per mil. The DeltaD-values for <b>manganese</b> <b>bog</b> ores from recent hot springs show almost - 105 per mil. It is recognized that the isotopic values obtained for the deep-sea nodules and recent bog ores are slightly different ranged. Manganite and groutite are unique in their hydrogen-isotopic compositions, having the most depleted DeltaD-values ranging from - 298 to - 236 per mil. MnO(OH) minerals are more deuterium-depleted hydrous minerals than any other hydrothermal minerals from various ore deposits. Hydrogen-isotope fractionation factors between manganite and water were experimentally determined to be 0. 7894, 0. 7958 and 0. 8078 at 150 °, 200 ° and 250 °C, respectively. the present experimental results indicate that if manganites were formed at temperatures below 250 °C, under isotopic equilibrium conditions, most of the manganite mineralization in the Tertiary manganese deposits must have precipitated from meteoric hydrothermal solutions...|$|R
