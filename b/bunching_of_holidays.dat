While Mason flew as a senior pilot for MyTravel Airways, the charter airline division <b>of</b> the <b>holiday</b> company MyTravel Group plc, he flew both holiday makers and private charters. Mason was well-known within the airline for his humorous, matter-of-fact style, telling a [...] "rather miserable" [...] <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> makers who made up the last flight of the 1997 season from Manchester Airport to the Greek island of Kefalonia, [...] "Come on you miserable lot. You are going on your holidays - to the sunshine. You should be smiling, you miserable bunch." [...] Mason's attitude transferred well to the public speaking circuit, while his knowledge of his craft resulted in his starting a fear of flying course.|$|R
5000|$|... “Vladimir Komarov {{comments}} on the new release: [...] "We started the new album with no clear concept — just putting some tracks together to form an album like a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> favorite <b>holiday</b> snapshots. It was really just like that: the demo of “Phantom” was recorded in Mexico, the sequence of “Breathing Out” fell into place on long treks down crazy Vietnam roads, and “Kopenhagen”, I think, kind of speaks for itself. When we stepped into this room at Christian Heiss’ Munich studio (Lali Puna, Notwist, Portmanteau) and saw all these magic hand-made boxes that did not just make sounds but actually sang, we immediately thought — it would be perfect if he could produce “SID”. Christian said yes, that’s how a new track “Seeds” came about. James (Aitken, of EMF) agreed to sign on our record straight away, which {{put us in a}} stupid position — we have the cult singer and no song for him to sing. We trawled our archives, fished out a fragment of a studio jam and sent it to him. I was just amazed by the way his vocal fit in. The rest was simple tweaking — and “Breathing Out” {{turned out to be one}} the album’s highlights" [...] — Lookatme.ru ...|$|R

In this paper, Hefei Light Source II (HLS II) is given as an example for odd buckets. In accordance with 45 buckets, which is multiples of 3, three different length <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> generated simultaneously is proposed in the presently applied user optics. The final result is to, without low-alpha optics, fill HLS II with long <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> 50 ps length, medium <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> 23 ps and short <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> 6 ps. Each third buckets can be filled with short <b>bunches,</b> <b>of</b> which the current limit is up to 6. 6 mA, more than 60 times the value of low-alpha mode.
