In the present study, <b>bovine</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> (BAF) has been investigated as a possible option. Materials and methods 84 male Wistar rats were undergone a laparotomy. After 2 weeks, adhesions were scaled grossly. <b>Bovine</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> (in whole combination, without cells or without cells and proteins) extracted from cows carried either male or female calves was then applied to treated groups 2 weeks later during the second laparotomy. Adhesions were rescored 2 weeks later during a third laparotomy. Results and conclusionA significant reduction (P< 0. 05) in adhesions formation was observed only in rats treated with male <b>bovine</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> without cells and proteins. Therefore, BAF could be used in treatment of adhesion formation because it is inexpensive, readily available, and has minimal side effects...|$|E
40|$|Successful oocyte {{fertilization}} {{and normal}} embryonic development of mice were {{considered the most}} important diagnostic criteria {{for the safety of}} materials and tools used for human in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET). Therefore, we studied the influence of cumulus cells co-culture and protein supplement within culture medium on percentages of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and normal development of early stages of mouse embryo later. Oocytes were collected and treated with hyaluronidase to remove cumulus cells. Oocytes were divided into four groups namely: Group- 1 : Oocytes incubated within modified Earl’s medium (MEM) supplied with 10 % inactivated <b>bovine</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> as a protein source and cumulus cells; Group- 2 : Oocytes incubated with MEM supplied with cumulus cells only; Group- 3 : Oocytes incubated with MEM supplied with 10 % inactivated <b>bovine</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> only; and Group- 4 : Oocytes  incubated with MEM free of both protein source and cumulus cells. For IVF, 5 - 6 oocytes were incubated with active spermatozoa under paraffin oil for 18 - 20 hours at 37 ° oC in 5 % CO 2. Percentages of IVF and embryonic development were then recorded. Best results for IVF and normal embryonic development were achieved from oocytes of Group- 1 when compared to the other groups. As compared to Group- 1, the percentage of IVF for Group- 2 and Group- 3 were decreased insignificantly and significantly (P< 0. 002), respectively. Significant (P< 0. 01) reduction in the percentages of IVF and normal embryonic development were reported in Group- 4 as compared to Group- 1. Therefore, it was concluded that the presence of cumulus cells co-culture and <b>bovine</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> as a protein source within culture medium may have an important role on the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa and oocytes and normal development of pre-implanted mouse embryo later...|$|E

40|$|Ingestion by rats of rat {{placenta}} or {{amniotic fluid}} enhances opioid-mediated, or partly opioid-mediated, antinociception produced by morphine injection, vaginal or cervical stimulation, late pregnancy, and foot shock. This phenomenon {{is believed to}} be produced by a placental opioid-enhancing factor (POEF). Ingestion by rats of human or dolphin placenta has also been shown to enhance opioid antinociception, suggesting that POEF may be common to many mammalian species. We tested <b>bovine</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> (BAF) for its capacity to enhance morphine antinociception in female Long-Evans rats, as determined by percentage change from baseline tail-flick latency in response to radiant heat, and we report that 0. 50 mL BAF effectively enhanced morphine antinociception but did not by itself produce antinociception. The efficacy of POEF across species suggests that POEF may have been functionally (and structurally) conserved during evolution. Furthermore, the availability of POEF at parturition, as well as its ability to enhance pregnancy-mediated antinociception without disrupting maternal behavior, offers a tenable explanation for the long-debated ultimate causality of placentophagia...|$|E

A method was devised wherein 0. 4 ml of each virus dilution was layered onto BSC- 1 cells in 80 -mm Leighton tubes and permitted to adsorb at 25 C for 18 hr prior to incubation at 35 C. The diluent found most reliable was medium 199 containing 50 % <b>bovine</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> adjusted to 2. 0 mm calcium and 1. 0 mm magnesium at pH 7. 0.

Irreversible adsorption of Yaba virus by BSC- 1 cells proceeds comparatively slowly at 25 to 33 C. Although the process is more rapid at 35 or 37 C, the increased thermal lability of the virus at these temperatures results in lower titers than with virus adsorbed at 25 C for longer periods of time.

The 10 -kDa proteins obtained on three drug-coupled resins and on phenyl-Sepharose were analysed by reversed-phase HPLC. It was found that two characteristic 10 -kDa proteins, one polar and one less polar, were bound with all three drugs, although S 100 A 2 (S 100 L), of the S 100 family, was bound with phenyl-Sepharose.

40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric) (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. As most {{researchers}} have foreseen, and many breeders have hoped, the in vivo and in vitro production of livestock embryos {{and the birth}} of subsequent offspring never really replaced artificial insemination during the past 30 years. This was, to a large extent, due to very variable and unreliable numbers of embryos produced using these two methods. The present study was therefore undertaken to investigate certain aspects of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) to try and solve some of these difficulties. Problems addressed were the management of follicular development on the ovary by controlling the dominant follicle, and investigating alternative and more cost-effective culture media and conditions for embryo culture. A method to control the development of the dominant follicle in a cohort of follicles as well as the waves of follicular development in the ovaries of sheep, goats and cows with an estrogenic product was investigated. Estradiol cypionate (ECP) was used for this purpose, injected intramuscularly after the insertion of the progesterone or progestagen implant. ECP has a negative feedback effect on the secretion of pituitary FSH, and therefore follicular development. The animals of the three different species were randomly divided into two groups each, the ECP-group receiving the estradiol cypionate injection, and the control group receiving a saline injection. Five days after the ECP injection a program of follicular multi-stimulation with FSH hormone was initiated. The females of the different species were bred by either natural service (goats) or inseminated by laparoscopy (sheep) or trans-cervically (cows) to fertilize the ovulated ova. Embryos and unfertilized ova were collected surgically at the 8 to 16 - cell stage 3 to 4 d after breeding in the sheep and goats, and trans-cervically in the cows. Significantly more CL formed, and a total number of ova and embryos, as well as transferable embryos, were collected from the ECP-group of sheep ewes and goat does compared to the control group that received no ECP (p 0. 05) were found in the number of Grade 1 pre-compacted bovine embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage, or the hatched blastocyst stage, neither for the culture medium used, or the method of culturing in the two incubators. Neither was there any difference (p> 0. 05) in the number of blastomeres that developed at the blastocyst stage between the two types of incubators used. Embryos tended to develop more blastomeres when cultured in BAF than when cultured in TCM- 199 in both the standard laboratory incubator and when using the vagina of a goat doe as an incubator (p< 0. 05). After the collection of in vivo produced livestock embryos, they are evaluated under high magnification (minimum of 80 X) with the aid of an inverted or stereo microscope. The Grade 1 embryos will give the best conception results when transferred to synchronized recipient female animals, while the Grade 3 embryos will give the worst results. The aim of the next experiment was to culture all three quality grades of in vivo produced pre-compacted morula-stage embryos of sheep, goats and cows in two different culture media and then compare the development of the embryos by evaluating the number of embryos reaching the hatched blastocyst stage. The results have shown that {{there were no significant differences}} between the development of the Grade 1 and the Grade 2 embryos from any of the three species when either cultured in TCM- 199 or heat inactivated early pregnancy-stage (< 60 d) <b>bovine</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> (BAF) were used as culture media. Significantly more in vivo produced Grade 3 pre-compacted morula-stage sheep, goat and cow embryos, however, developed to the hatched blastocyst stage when cultured in BAF with 10 % FBS and antibiotics, compared to culture in TCM- 199 with 10 % FBS and antibiotics (p< 0. 05). The effect of co-culture on the survival of caprine embryos post transfer to a synchronized recipient female goat was also assessed. A total of 120 Kashmir embryos at the blastocyst stage were divided into three groups after thawing and reconstitution in four steps in glycerol and sucrose medium. The first group of embryos (G 1, n= 40) was individually transferred semi laparoscopically in D-PBS with 10 % FBS and antibiotics to the ipsilateral horn of the CL over a period of 3 d. The second group of caprine blastocysts (G 2, n= 40) was similarly transferred in TCM- 199 with FBS and antibiotics. The third group of frozen-thawed caprine blastocyst-stage embryos (G 3, n= 40) were first co-cultured for ~ 24 h in TCM- 199 with serum and antibiotics in groups of up to five embryos inside a ~ 50 mm length of a semen straw in a cylindrical sponge in the anterior part of the vagina of a goat doe in her luteal phase. After the culture period these embryos were transferred in a similar way in TCM- 199 without the co-culture as in G 1 and G 2. Ultrasound scanning showed that significantly more of the blastocyst embryos that were cocultured in the vagina (G 3) before transfer developed to a pregnancy compared with the embryos transferred in D-PBS (G 1). The co-culture Group 3 blastocyst-stage caprine embryos produced significantly more offspring than the non-cultured embryos transferred in both D-PBS (G 1) and TCM- 199 (G 2) (p< 0. 05). The maturation of bovine oocytes to allow the oocyte to resume meiosis, is the first step in in vitro fertilization to produce IVMFC embryos. The composition of the maturation medium plays an important role in the success achieved with maturation. An investigation was therefore launched to evaluate the maturation ability of first trimester <b>bovine</b> <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> (BAF) to mature prophase I oocytes collected from abattoir ovaries to metaphase II oocytes, compared to a standard maturation medium such as TCM- 199. In the first experiment three groups of ~ 100 oocytes each were matured in TCM- 199 with estrus cow serum (ECS). The first group of oocytes was matured in a 50 μL micro-drop in an incubator, while the other two groups were matured in semen straws, one group in an incubator and the other group in the vagina of a goat doe in di-estrus. Six further groups of ~ 100 oocytes each, with BAF as maturation medium, three groups with ECS and three without ECS, were matured in the same receptacles and under the same conditions as with the TCM- 199. No significant differences in number of oocytes reaching the metaphase II stage could be found for any of the nine treatment groups. In the [...] ...|$|E

In <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> samples from fetuses affected with harlequin ichthyosis and lamellar ichthyosis, clumps of keratinized cells that contained disease-specific abnormal granules and lipid droplets were observed. These results indicate that the morphologic analysis of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> cells can provide important supportive information for the prenatal diagnosis of several severe genodermatoses...|$|R
50|$|Ewes will {{generally}} display stronger attraction {{to their own}} <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> than to that of another ewe, though they will display some attraction to the <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> of any animal of their own species. If a dry alien lamb is smeared with <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid,</b> a ewe presented with that lamb {{is more likely to}} display aggressive behavior if the lamb is smeared with the <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> of an alien ewe, compared to if it is smeared with that ewe’s own fluid. It has been speculated that this is due to some olfactory signature of the ewe’s <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid,</b> though whether this is a response innate to the ewe or a result of her exposure to and ingestion of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> from the ground after rupture of the water bag.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{using in}} vitro {{analysis}} {{have shown that}} the interaction between pulmonary surfactant and vemix caseosa could explain the appearance of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> turbidity. That phenomenon is interpreted based on the "roll-up" hypothesis. We tested the roll-up hypothesis by examining the presence of micelles of pulmonary surfactant in human <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> at term. <b>Amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> samples were collected from each of six healthy pregnant women at term and at 16 wk of gestation. These samples were stained negatively and analyzed using an electron microscope. Ultrastructures present in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> were compared with the structure of micelles derived from suspended surfactant TA isolated from bovine lung. Surfactant TA formed spheroidal and rod-shaped micelles 10 - 70 nm in diameter above the critical micelle concentration. Identical micelle particles were described in human <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> at term. In addition, surfactant protein B was identified in the micelle fraction of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid.</b> However, no micelles were found in human <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> taken at 16 wk of gestation. Our results support the view that pulmonary surfactant could induce the detachment of vernix caseosa and increase the turbidity of the <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid...</b>|$|R
40|$|The major {{molecular}} species of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> phosphatidyl-choline were determined as diacyiglycerol trimethylsilyl ether derivativesby gas-liquid chromatographywith use of glass capillary columns. We studied <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> specimens from 48 pregnancies. As expected, the major disaturated species of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphati-dyicholine, and palmitoylmyristoylphosphatidylcholine in-creased with gestational age, whereas phosphatidylcholine species with 34, 36, and 38 carbon {{atoms in the}} acyl radicals decreased. Although the <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> samples were ob-tained shortlybefore parturition(4. 2 ± 3. 7 h, #{ 163 } ± SD), the correlation between dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine concen-tration in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> and gestational age was better than between dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine concentration and the compliance of the respiratory system of the newborns.

40|$|<b>Amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> {{cells have}} been widely used, {{initially}} {{in the assessment of}} gestational age and Rhesus isoimmunization; more recently in the antenatal diagnosis of chromosomal disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, haemoglobinopathies, some congenital malformations and detection of high risk pregnancy. However, the <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> cell origin is not yet clear. This study examined the properties of uncultured and cultured <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> cells, as well as their differentiation through culture. <b>Amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> were divided into normal and abnormal according to their alpha fetoprotein values (Brock, 1981) and the following cell characteristics were examined: numbers, morphology, viability, adherence, phagocytosis, presence of Fc receptors, non-specific acid esterase, behaviour in vitro by cinemicrography and immunocytochemistry. The heterogeneity of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> cells was confirmed and their origin is discussed. The use of the previously neglected uncultured <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> cells is enhanced. The presence of macrophages in normal (Hoyes, 1968) and abnormal (Sutherland et al., 1973, 1975) <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> was confirmed. Macrophages were increased in number in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> from fetuses with anencephaly but not in those with spina bifida. The macrophages were short lived and incapable of survival and proliferation in culture. The presence of neural cells in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> from fetuses with a neural tube defect (Gosden and Brock, 1978 a) was also confirmed. The neural cells consisted of neuroblasts which differentiated through culture into neurons; glial cells which seem to dedifferentiate into glioblasts; and microglia. The studies in normal <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> suggested that the main cell type (AF) of long-term <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> cell cultures originates from trophoblast (Priest et al., 1979) and that their heterogeneity is due to differentiation in culture from cytotrophoblast into syncytiotrophoblast. The implications of these findings in antenatal diagnosis are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Swallowed <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> creates {{urine and}} {{contributes}} {{to the formation of}} meconium. <b>Amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> protects the developing baby by cushioning against blows to the mother's abdomen, allowing for easier fetal movement and promoting muscular/skeletal development. <b>Amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> swallowed by the fetus helps {{in the formation of the}} gastrointestinal tract. Contrary to popular belief, <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> has not been conclusively shown to be inhaled and exhaled by the fetus. In fact, studies from the 1970s show that in a healthy fetus, there is no inward flow of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> into the airway. Instead, lung development occurs as a result of the production of fetal lung fluid which expands the lungs. It also prevents the fetus from mechanical jerks and shocks.|$|R
40|$|Ingestion of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> and {{placenta}} by rats {{has been}} shown to enhance opioid-mediated antinociception but not affect the nonopioid-mediated antinociception produced by aspirin, suggesting spccificity for opioid-mediated processes. However, enhancement by the active substance(s) in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> and placenta 1 (POEF, for placental opioid-enhancing factor) of antinociception produced by other nonopioid mechanisms has yet to be examined. The present experiments tested whether ingestion of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> enhances the antinociception produced by nicotine injection. In Experiment IA, Enhancement of morphine-mediated antinociception by ingestion of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> was demonstrated in a hot-plate assay. In Experiment IB, rats pretreated with naltrexone were given an orogastric infusion of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> or control (0. 25 ml), then injected with nicotine (0, 0. 075, 0. 125, or 0. 225 mg/kg subcutaneously), then tested for antinociception in a hot-plate assay. <b>Amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> ingestion did not enhance the antinociception produced by various doses of nicotine. In Experiment 2, rats pretreated with naltrexone were given an orogastric infusion of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> (0, 0. 125, 0. 25, or 0. 50 ml) and then injectcd with 0. 125 mg/kg nicotine. None of the doses of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> enhanced the nicotine-induced antinociception. The findings of these experiments lend support to our contention that the enhancement by POEF of antinociception is specific to opioid-mediated processes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> at 15 - 20 weeks {{contains}} {{high concentrations}} of microvillar enzymes which serve as markers for the prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. We found that these enzymes were mostly bound to <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> particulate fraction which eluted in the void volume on Sepharose 6 B chromatography and precipitated in ultracentrifugation at 100, 000 g. Electron microscopy showed that the particulate fraction comprised membrane fragments and small vesicles. It represented less than 1 % of the total protein in cell free <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid.</b> Sorbitol gradient centrifugation showed heterogeneity in the particulate fraction. The enzyme patterns of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> and meconium particulate fractions resembled each other. Antiserum against particulate fraction in <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> strongly reacted with early meconium and fetal small intestine in immunodiffusion, enzyme immunoassay, and staining with immunoperoxidase. The results suggest {{that most of the}} enzyme rich particulate fraction in early <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> originates in the fetal intestine...|$|R
40|$|There {{are some}} data {{to suggest that}} <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> protects the fetus from {{invasion}} by pathogenic bacteria. To examine methods by which <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> may offer such protection, quantitative antibody, complement activity, and functional opsonic capacity were measured. Immunoglobulins were measured by laser nephelometry and total hemolytic complement was determined by radial diffusion; results suggested activity adequate for bactericidal capacity. The chemiluminescence assay was used to quantitate the functional interaction between polymorphonuclear leukocytes and E. coli, group B streptococci (GBS), or zymosan particles preopsonized with <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> obtained {{at different stages of}} gestation. Results were compared to those for normal serum. Data were analyzed by evaluation of the initial slope, area under the curve, and peak chemiluminescence response. Opsonic activity of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> for E. coli and GBS was demonstrated, with E. coli showing greater reactivity (maximum = 15, 000 to 25, 000 cpm) than GBS (10, 000 to 20, 000 cpm). Specific, as well as nonspecific, opsonic activity was demonstrated by absorption of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> with killed bacteria. Concentration of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> did not result in an increase in chemiluminescent activity, which demonstrates that optimal opsonic activity already exists. The classical and alternate pathways of complement were assessed for E. coli and GBS. Preterm <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> did not differ in response from that of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> obtained from term pregnancies. This study demonstrates that <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> can provide the fetus with protection from bacterial pathogens and delineates mechanisms for such protection...|$|R
