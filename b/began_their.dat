5|$|At 16:02, {{still waiting}} for a {{definitive}} report on {{the location of the}} Japanese fleet carriers, the U.S. carriers' radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft. Fifty-three F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers. However, communication problems, limitations of the aircraft identification capabilities of the radar, primitive control procedures, and effective screening of the Japanese dive bombers by their escorting Zeros, prevented all {{but a few of the}} U.S. fighters from engaging the Vals before they <b>began</b> <b>their</b> attacks on the U.S. carriers. Just before the Japanese dive bombers <b>began</b> <b>their</b> attacks, Enterprise and Saratoga cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted. These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything they could find, or else to circle outside the battle zone, until it was safe to return.|$|E
