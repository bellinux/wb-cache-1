5000|$|<b>Band</b> <b>printers</b> are a {{variation}} of chain printers, where a thin steel band is used instead of a chain, with the characters embossed or etched onto the band. Again, a selection of different bands were generally available with a different mix of characters so a character set best matched to the characters commonly printed could be chosen. Dataproducts was a well known manufacturer of <b>band</b> <b>printers,</b> with their B300, B600, and B1000 range, the model number representing the lines per minute rate of the printer. (The B300 was effectively a B600 with only half the number of hammers—one per two character positions. The hammer bank moved back and forth one character position, requiring two goes to print all characters on each line.) ...|$|R
50|$|Chain or train printers, {{where the}} {{character}} set is arranged multiple times around a linked chain or {{a set of}} character slugs in a track traveling horizontally past the print line. The IBM 1403 {{is perhaps the most}} popular, and comes in both chain and train varieties. The <b>band</b> <b>printer</b> is a later variant where the characters are embossed on a flexible steel band. The LP27 from Digital Equipment Corporation is a <b>band</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Impact {{printers}} create noise {{when the}} pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures {{may have to}} be used in quiet environments. They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers. While they support fanfold paper with tractor holes well, single-sheet paper {{may have to be}} wound in and aligned by hand, which is relatively time-consuming, or a sheet feeder may be utilized which can have a lower paper feed reliability. When printing labels on release paper, they are prone to paper jams when a print wire snags {{the leading edge of the}} label while printing at its very edge. For text-only labels (e.g. mailing labels), a daisy wheel printer or <b>band</b> <b>printer</b> may offer better print quality and a lower risk of damaging the paper.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, GE {{sold the}} printer and relays {{groups and the}} company was formed as the GENICOM Corporation in 1983.

40|$|Repetitive {{controllers}} {{have been}} shown to be effective for tracking periodic reference commands or for rejecting periodic disturbances. Typical repetitive controllers are synthesized in temporal domain where the periods of the reference or disturbance signals are assumed to be known and stationary. For periodic references and disturbances with varying periods, researchers usually resort to adaptive and robust control approaches. For rotational motion systems where the disturbances or reference signals are spatially periodic (i. e., periodic with respect to angular displacement), the temporal period of the disturbance and reference signals will be inversely proportional to the rotational speed and vary accordingly. Motivating by reducing halftone <b>banding</b> for laser <b>printers,</b> we propose a design framework for synthesizing spatially sampled repetitive controller by reformulating a linear time-invariant system subject to spatially periodic disturbances using angular displacement as the independent variable. The resulting nonlinear system can be represented as a quasi-linear parameter-varying (quasi-LPV) system with the angular velocity as one of the varying state-dependent parameters. An LPV self-gain-scheduling controller that includes a spatially sampled repetitive control can be designed to take into consideration bounded model uncertainty and input nonlinearity, such as actuator saturation. Using the signal from an optical encoder pulse as a triggering interrupt, experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach in rejecting spatially periodic disturbances that cannot be compensated with fixed period temporal repetitive controllers...|$|R
30|$|Often, {{the first}} step in {{document}} forensics focuses on source identification. The aim is to trace the source of the documents including the brand and model of the device. Typically, statistical characteristics of the printed characters are used to identify the source brands and models. For example, Delp et al. used gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) [2, 3] features, variance/entropy, and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) [4] features to identify the <b>printer</b> source. <b>Banding</b> frequency is another characteristic used to identify the source as a laser <b>printer.</b> <b>Banding,</b> which appears as non-uniform light and dark lines perpendicular to the printing direction [5], is caused by fluctuations in the rotating angular velocity of the organic photo conductor (OPC) drum and by errors in the gear transmission mechanism. Delp et al. [6] printed pre-generated gray images and exploited the projection method and Fourier transform to estimate banding frequencies. Some researchers have also focused on hardware defects to trace the source; these include spinning velocity fluctuations of the polygon mirror in the laser printer and the imperfections of the paper feeding mechanism, which result in geometric distortions in the document that can serve to characterize individual laser printers. Kong et al. [7] established a projective transformation model to estimate such geometric distortions. Bulan et al. [8] computed the geometric distortion signature from printed halftone images to trace the source laser printer by estimating the variations in the center positions of halftone dots.|$|R
40|$|Banding is a {{well-known}} printer artifact which generally appears as lines of variations in density running perpendicular to the process direction of the image. Banding is an important image quality issue; {{and it has been}} analyzed and assessed by many researchers. However, little literature has focused on the study of the relationship between physically measured banding and perceived banding. In the thesis we propose an experimental methodology for assessing banding which is based on the observers ability to discriminate between images with different levels of banding. We develop a method of measuring the amount of banding in hardcopy print. Using the method of constant stimuli, we conduct a psychophysical discrimination experiment for a given printer to obtain the difference threshold (DL). Our results show that the Weber fraction for discriminating banding remains constant over the printers despite differences in the spectral characteristics. This suggests that banding discrimination appears to be similar to many other perceptual phenomena (Weber 2 ̆ 7 s law holds). The obtained DL allows us to predict how much the banding power should be reduced in order to achieve a significant decrease in the perceived banding. ^ We also describe new cross-platform experiments using 10 different laser printers having different imaging characteristics. We analyze banding of the ten printers with line screen patterns. The experimental results identify the points of subjective equality of the ten printers relative to the banding of a reference printer, and provide the basis of a method of computing banding power by considering a contrast sensitivity function. Our results show that regardless of different banding spectral characteristics, the contrast banding power of a given printer can be mapped to the contrast banding power of one reference printer with added extrinsic banding. This implies that using our technique, we can reliably estimate the perceived amount of <b>banding</b> in a <b>printer.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Electronic imaging {{systems such}} as image {{rendering}} and printing devices are providing higher quality with improved technologies. Physical hardware limitation has been pushed to a newer level. By utilizing some of these new imaging technologies, three improvements are presented in this document, including banding reduction using pulse width modulation, multitoning using DBS screens, and hybrid screen design. ^ In Ch. 1, we propose a system to reduce electrophotographic laser <b>printer</b> <b>banding</b> artifacts due to optical photoconductor drum velocity fluctuations. The drum velocity fluctuations are sensed with an optical encoder mounted on the drum axis. Based on the line-to-line differential encoder count, we modulate the laser pulse width to compensate fluctuations in development that would otherwise occur. We present {{an analysis of the}} system, including the compensation algorithm that determines the desired pulse-width as a function of differential encoder count. Characterization of the system is based on printing, scanning, and processing a special test page that yields information about line-spacing and absorptance fluctuations. This data is synchronized with the encoder count signal that was recorded during the printing of the test page. The experimental results show the efficacy of the system. ^ In Ch. 2, we propose a methodology for multilevel screen design using Direct Binary Search. We define a multitone schedule, which for each absorptance level specifies the fraction of each native tone used in the multitone cell. Based on the multitone schedule, multitone patterns are designed level-by-level by adding native tones under the stacking constraint. At each level, the spatial arrangement of the native tones is determined by a modified DBS search. We explore several different multitone schedules that illustrate the image quality tradeoffs in multitone screen design. ^ In Ch. 4, we propose a screen design method that generates a new hybrid class of halftones [...] -stochastic dispersed-dot in highlights and periodic clustered-dot in midtones. The traditional solution for generating hybrid halftones is the so-called supercell technique. While maintaining the spatial resolution, supercell increases the number of the output levels of a periodic micro-clustered-dot screen by adding dots asynchronously based on the order described in a dispersed-dot macroscreen. The traditional supercell screen employs a Bayer macroscreen and consequently results in visible false textures in highlight area. Simply replacing the Bayer macroscreen with a stochastic macroscreen yields the maze-like artifact due to the embedded upsampling process. In this work, we propose a screen design method which optimizes the employed multiple macroscreens and microscreens simultaneously using DBS. The resulting final screen is decomposable for a memory-efficient implementation. We also propose an adaptive microcell-based edge enhancement algorithm for further improvement. Several results are demonstrated using the proposed screens. ...|$|R
