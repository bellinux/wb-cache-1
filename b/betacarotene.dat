40|$|Background The use of sunscreens on {{the skin}} can prevent sunburn but whether {{long-term}} use can prevent skin cancer is not known. Also, {{there is evidence that}} oral <b>betacarotene</b> supplementation lowers skin-cancer rates in animals, but there is limited evidence of its effect in human beings. Methods In a community-based randomised trial with a 2 by 2 factorial design, individuals were assigned to four treatment groups: daily application of a sun protection factor 15 -plus sunscreen to the head, neck, arms, and hands, and <b>betacarotene</b> supplementation (30 mg per day); sunscreen plus placebo tablets; <b>betacarotene</b> only; or placebo only. Participants were 1621 residents of Nambour in southeast Queensland, Australia. The endpoints after 4. 5 years of follow-up were the incidence of basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas both in terms of people treated for newly diagnosed disease {{and in terms of the}} numbers of tumours that occurred. Analysis of the effect of sunscreen was based only on skin cancers that developed on sites of daily application. All analyses were by intention to treat. Findings 1383 participants underwent full shin examination by a dermatologist in the follow-up period. 250 of them developed 758 new skin cancers during the follow-up period. There were no significant differences in the incidence of first new shin cancers between groups randomly assigned daily sunscreen and no daily sunscreen (basal-cell carcinoma 2588 vs 2509 per 100 000; rate ratio 1. 03 [95 % CI 0. 73 - 1. 46]; squamous-cell carcinoma 876 vs 996 per 100 000; rate ratio 0. 88 [0. 50 - 1. 56]). Similarly, there was no significant difference between the <b>betacarotene</b> and placebo groups in incidence of either cancer (basal-cell carcinoma 3954 vs 3806 per 100 000; 1. 04 [0. 73 - 1. 27]; squamous-cell carcinoma 1508 vs 1146 per 100 000; 1. 35 [0. 84 - 2. 19]). In terms of the number of tumours, there was no effect on incidence of basal-cell carcinoma by sunscreen use or by <b>betacarotene</b> but the incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma was significantly lower in the sunscreen group than in the no daily sunscreen group (1115 vs 1832 per 100 000; 0. 61 [0. 46 - 0. 81]). Interpretation There was no harmful effect of daily use of sunscreen in this medium-term study. Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, but not basal-cell carcinoma seems to be amenable to prevention through the routine use of sunscreen by adults for 4. 5 years. There was no beneficial or harmful effect on the rates of either type of skin cancer, as a result of <b>betacarotene</b> supplementation...|$|E

In experiment 1, after estrus synchronization and superovulation animals were inseminated 12 and 24 hours after estrus onset and embryos flushed 7 days later. Heifers were allocated randomly to one of three treatments: Control; T 800 (800 mg of <b>betacarotene</b> plus 500 mg of tocopherol) and T 1200 (1, 200 mg of <b>betacarotene</b> plus 750 mg of tocopherol). The treatments were given on the day of ear implant placement and repeated {{on the first day of}} superovulation. Blood samples were collected on D 0, D 5, D 9, D 12 and D 16. In experiment 2, treatments were imposed at intravaginal device insertion (D 0). The same experimental design, as in experiment 1, was used. Blood samples were collected on D 17 (embryos implanted) for progesterone determination by radioimmunoassay. In experiment 1, average plasma progesterone concentrations after corpora lutea formation (D 12 plus D 16 means) were 13. 7 ± 1. 8 ng/ml, 14. 5 ± 2. 3 ng/ml and 10. 8 ± 2. 3 ng/ml for control, T 800 and T 1200, respectively, and did not differ (P= 0. 44).

40|$|Background: It is {{acknowledge}} that antioxidant liposoluble vitamins and carotenoids are reduced in liver cirrhosis, but {{little is known}} about chronic viral hepatitis, where oxidative damage has to be taken into account. Materials and methods: Fifty-five patients with chronic hepatitis, mainly C virus-related, were matched with 16 patients with biliary stones and 20 healthy controls. Plasma and liver analyses were carried out using a well-tried HPLC technique, which affords an accurate quantification of retinol, tocopherol, alpha- and <b>betacarotene,</b> cryptoxanthin and lycopene. Results: Plasma concentration of retinol, tocopherol, beta-carotene and lycopene was significantly decreased in both patient groups, particularly in those with chronic hepatitis. On the other hand, liver concentration of both esterified and free retinol, tocopherol and some carotenoid was better preserved in the hepatitis than in the cholelithiasis group. A strict correspondence between aminotransferases and the amount of liver-stored retinol was documented.

40|$|The word {{broccoli}} {{comes from}} the Italian broccolo, the diminuitive of brocco, meaning shoot, stalk. Broccoli possesses abundant fleshy flower heads, usually green in color, arranged in a tree-like fashion on branches sprouting from a thick, edible stalk (Gray, A. R., 1982) Broccoli is high in vitamin C, calcium and soluble fiber and contains multiple nutrients with potent anti-cancer properties including diindolylmethane and selenium. The 3, 3 '-Diindolylmethane found in broccoli is a potent modulator of the innate immune response system with anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer activity. Broccoli also contains the compound glucoraphanin, which can be processed into an anticancer compound sulforaphane, though the benefits of broccoli are greatly reduced if the vegetable is boiled more than ten minutes.

The National Cancer Institute and other governmental agencies can recommend increases in fruits and vegetables to the population. 3 However, it is unethical to push an unproven intervention in a demonstration project, that is, that an increase in fruits and vegetables will decrease the risk of cancer, especially in potentially vulnerable populations.

40|$|Oral cancer {{holds the}} eighth {{position}} in the cancer incidence ranking worldwide. with squamous cell carcinoma encompassing at least 90 % of all oral malignancies. The World Health Organization expects that prognosis {{for many of these}} patients is grave and even in cases of successful treatment the degree of dysfunction and disfigurement postoperatively is well appreciated by all of us. Hence, understanding of the disease process is of paramount importance for early diagnosis and successful management. Dietary substitutes, such as <b>betacarotene,</b> provitamin A, vitamin A, C, and E, lipoic acid, zinc, selenium and Spirulina use in premalignant lesions, in premalignant conditions is still a debate. The antitumor activity of micronutrients is by their capability of destroying cancer cells through three major mechanisms: (i) Tumor inhibition by immune cytokines; (ii) stimulation of cancer suppressor genes, such as ′wild-type p 54 ′ and diminished expression or dysregulation of oncogenes, such as mutant p 53 and H-ras; (iii) inhibition of angiogenesis-stimulating factors, such as transforming growth factor alpha (TGFa). Studies have shown that antioxidants are not the′ magic bullet′ for the treatment of premalignant oral mucosal lesions or the prevention of second primary malignancies. However, there is a role for antioxidants if used judiciously in selected cases that can be monitored carefully. An important principle is that the treatment should not be more harmful than the damage that the lesion can cause...|$|E
40|$|Originally it was {{proposed}} that dietary access alone might explain variation in expression of carotenoid pigmentation (Endler 1980; Kodric-Brown 1985; Hill 1990). By this idea, carotenoids are scarce in the environment, and only those {{individuals in the}} best condition gain access to sufficient carotenoids for maximum ornament display. To this idea of limited access was added the idea that parasites might negatively impact expression of carotenoid pigmentation (Milinski and Bakker 1990; Houde and Torio 1992; Zuk 1992). Indeed, from studies with poultry it is well established that coccidia (protozoan gut parasites) directly inhibit carotenoid absorption (Ruff et al. 1974; Augustine and Ruff 1983; Allen 1987, 1992; Tyczkowski et al. 1991). In several studies with species that have carotenoid-based ornamental display, {{it has been shown}} that parasites, including particularly coccidia, inhibit expression of carotenoid pigmentation (Milinski and Bakker 1990; Houde and Torio 1992; Brawner 1997; Thompson et al. 1997). It seems likely that parasite load and limited access to dietary carotenoids combine to determine color expression in many species of animals (Hill 1999). Carotenoids are used for more than integumentary colorants in animals. Some carotenoids, particularly <b>betacarotene</b> and related molecules, function as vitamin A precursors (Bauernfeind 1972).

40|$|AIM: The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyze the {{potential}} capacity of a dietary supplement, based on gamma linolenic acid, vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene, coenzyme Q 10 and Vitis Vitifera, to reduce side effects, in particular the dry skin, erythema and desquamation, due to treatment with oral isotretinoin, and evaluate the ability of the product to increase adherence to therapy in patients with acne. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with nodular acne (32 females and 16 males) were randomly divided into 2 groups: 24 receveid isotretinoin therapy (20 - 30 mg/day) for 6 months associated to dietary supplement (twice a day), while the other 24 patients received only isotretinoin (20 - 30 mg/day) for 6 months. For all patients the degree of acne severity, through GAGS (Global Acne Grading System), the sebum production by Sebutape, the hydration by Corneometer and the erythema by Mexameter, were measured. We have also evaluated the adherence to treatment, asking to patients how many days a week they follow the therapy. RERSULTS: Patients treated with dietary supplement had lower side effects, with a less degree of erythema and dryness, and greater degree of hydration; a greater adherence to therapy was also reported. CONCLUSION: Thanks to antioxidant and moisturizing properties, the dietary supplement containing gamma linolenic acid, vitamin E, vitamin C, <b>betacarotene,</b> coenzyme Q 10 and Vitis Vitifera, can be considered a useful supplement in the treatment and prevention of dry skin associated with the use of oral isotretinoin...|$|E
40|$|Summary In the BUPA Study, a {{prospective}} study of 22, 000 men attending a screening centre in London, serum {{samples were collected}} and stored. The concentration of beta-carotene was measured in the stored serum samples from 271 men who were subsequently notified as having cancer and from 533 unaffected controls, matched for age, smoking history and duration of storage of the serum samples. The mean <b>betacarotene</b> level of the cancer subjects was significantly {{lower than that of}} their matched controls (198 and 221 Mg I 1 respectively, P= 0. 007). The difference was apparent in subjects from whom blood was collected several years before the diagnosis of the cancer, indicating that the low beta-carotene levels in the cancer subjects were unlikely to have been simply a consequence of pre-clinical disease. Men in the top two quintiles of serum beta-carotene had only about 60 % of the risk of developing cancer compared with men in the bottom quintile. The study was not large {{enough to be able to}} indicate with confidence the sites of cancer for which the inverse association between serum beta-carotene and risk of cancer applied, though the association was strongest for lung cancer. The association may be due to beta-carotene affecting the risk directly or it may reflect an indirect association of cancer risk with some other component of vegetables or with a nonvegetable component of diet that is itself related to vegetable consumption. It has been suggested that beta-carotene (and other carotenoids...|$|E
40|$|Background: When {{breast milk}} {{is no longer}} enough to meet the {{nutritional}} needs of the infant, complementary foods should be added. Complementary feeding should be start giving from 6 months onwards. The period from 6 -months of age is a very vulnerable period. It {{is the time when}} malnutrition starts in many infants. One form of complementary feeding which are hygienic, and ready to serve is an instant baby food. Utilization of local food such as catfish (Pangasius sp) and pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) as a source of protein and beta-carotene may increase the nutrient content of complementary feeding. Objective: This study was designed to analyze the difference of nutrients content, bulk density, and acceptability among the percentage varieties of catfish and pumpkin flour substitution on instant baby porridge. Methods: An experimental study with a single factor completely randomized design. The experiment carried out by combining the percentage of catfish and pumpkin flour substitution in to 4 formulas. The nutrients content that were analyzed are levels of protein, <b>betacarotene,</b> fat, and carbohydrate. Statistical analysis of the nutrients content, bulk density, and acceptability using One Way ANOVA test CI 95 % followed by Tukey posthoc test. Results: Instant baby food recommended is the substitution of catfish 20 % and 15 % pumpkin. Servings (25 g) instant baby food to meet the 34 % and 102 % of protein adequacy adequacy of vitamin A. Conclusion: Instant baby porridge substituted with catfish and pumpkin flour are high in protein and vitamin A, appropriate to the bulk density, and acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Background: Breast {{cancer is}} the second {{malignancy}} after carcinoma cervix. Pandanus conoideus believed as anti tumor. Pandanus conoideus oil contains high levels of <b>betacarotene</b> and tocopherol, which increase T-cell activity and limfosit B differentiation, so the growth of carcinoma cell can be inhibited. Objectives: Observing the effect of Pandanus conoideus oil to the histology grading of adenocarcinoma mammae C 3 H mice. Methods: This is an experimental study, using the post test only control group design make the samples were 15 C 3 H mice, randomized into 3 groups. Group K: were innoculated with cancer cells, got standard diet, and were given with 0, 2 cc aquadest per day orally for 3 weeks. P 1 : were innoculated with cancer cells and then after tumors appeared, administrated with 0, 2 cc Pandanus conoideus oil per day orally for 3 weeks. P 2 : were innoculated with cancer cells and then after tumors appeared for 3 weeks, administrated with 0, 2 cc Pandanus conoideus oil per day orally for 3 weeks. Result: The highest mean score of histology grading occured in group K, followed by P 1 and P 2. the result of histological grading difference among all group is (p= 0, 008). The result between group K-P 1 and K-P 2 (p= 0, 007), and between group P 1 -P 2 (p= 0, 655). Conclusion: The administering of Pandanus conoideus oil could give effect to reduce histology grading significantly C 3 H mice. Keyword: Mice C 3 H, Pandanus conoideus, grading histologic. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Oxidative {{stress is}} {{detrimental}} to sperm function {{and a significant}} factor in the etiology of male infertility. This report examines the association between dietary and supplementary intake of the antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene and sperm chromatin integrity. Eighty-seven healthy male volunteers donated semen samples, completed food-frequency questionnaires, and provided information about their sociodemographic characteristics, medical and reproductive histories, and lifestyle habits. Sperm chromatin integrity was measured using the DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and related parameters, obtained from the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA�). SCSA measures the susceptibility of sperm DNA to acid-induced denaturation in situ. After adjusting for age and duration of abstinence, there was no dose-response association between any DFI outcome and any antioxidant intake measure. Non-dose–related associations were found between <b>betacarotene</b> intake and both the standard deviation of DFI (SD DFI) and the percent of immature sperm. Participants with moderate, but not high, beta-carotene intake had an increase in SD DFI compared with participants with low intake (adjusted means 206. 7 and 180. 5, respectively; P �. 03), as well as an increase in the percentage of immature sperm (adjusted means 6. 9 % and 5. 0 %, respectively; P �. 04). If antioxidant intake in the range studied is indeed beneficial for fertility in healthy men, it {{does not appear to be}} mediated through the integrity of sperm chromatin. The results of this study do not preclude possible beneficial effects of high antioxidant intake on sperm chromatin integrity for men with fertility problems...|$|E
