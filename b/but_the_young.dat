5|$|Falco peregrinus japonensis, {{described}} by Gmelin in 1788, includes kleinschmidti, pleskei, and harterti, {{and seems to}} refer to intergrades with calidus. It is found from northeast Siberia to Kamchatka (though it is possibly replaced by pealei on the coast there) and Japan. Northern populations are migratory, while those of Japan are resident. It is similar to peregrinus, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> are even darker than those of anatum.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{qualified}} to the 2016 Summer Olympics in singles and doubles. In doubles {{she should have}} partner with Gasparyan, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> tennis player cited her injury; she was replaced by Daria Kasatkina. Kuznetsova reached the 3rd round in singles and the quarterfinal in doubles. She again reached the quarterfinal in a Premier 5 tournament, doing so in Cincinnati. At the US Open, Kuznetsova suffered a disappointing loss against resurgent Caroline Wozniacki despite leading 4-0 in the first set.|$|E

5|$|While {{the allied}} troops {{attacked}} the French right flank, Kutuzov's IV Corp {{stopped at the}} Pratzen Heights and stayed still. Just like Napoleon, Kutuzov realized the importance of Pratzen and decided to protect the position. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Tsar did not, so he expelled the IV Corp from the Heights. This act quickly pushed the Allied army into her grave.|$|E
5|$|After Fulin came {{to rule on}} his own in 1651, {{his mother}} the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang {{arranged}} for him to marry her niece, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> monarch deposed his new Empress in 1653. The following year Xiaozhuang arranged another imperial marriage with her Khorchin Mongol clan, this time matching her son with her own grand-niece. Though Fulin also disliked his second empress (known posthumously as Empress Xiaohuizhang), he {{was not allowed to}} demote her. She never bore him children. Starting in 1656, the Shunzhi Emperor lavished his affection on Consort Donggo, who, according to Jesuit accounts from the time, had first been the wife of another Manchu noble. She gave birth to a son (the Shunzhi Emperor's fourth) in November 1657. The emperor would have made him his heir apparent, but he died early in 1658 before he was given a name.|$|E

5|$|Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, {{the player}} who organizes and directs the game play) {{randomly}} draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd, a book that details Strahd's long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd {{had fallen in love}} with a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that he had become a vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.|$|E
5|$|Diermot {{enters the}} dragon's cave and wakes him up. The dragon agrees to help Diermot, {{revealing}} that Turnvale was {{the domain of}} a demon long before humans came to the area. This demon should have died along with his breed long ago, but did not perish because {{it was able to}} feed on man's greed and ambition in order to survive. The demon was driven out by the great Gethryn, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> sorceress Selena's meddling with evil has reawakened the demon, and it controls her mortal form. The dragon possesses the Eye of Gethryn, an enchanted stone left by Gethryn {{at the time of his}} death. The stone contains the power to defeat the demon, and the dragon then gives the stone to Diermot. A Skorl named Wayne, who turns against Selena, sneaks Diermot into Selena's castle in a barrel. Diermot defeats Selena with the Eye of Gethryn, freeing Turnvale from her tyranny.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet {{made one}} final attempt {{to call off}} the assault. After his {{encounter}} with Pickett, he discussed the artillery situation with Porter and was informed that Porter did not have full confidence that all the enemy's guns were silenced and that the Confederate ammunition was almost exhausted. Longstreet ordered Porter to stop Pickett, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> colonel explained that replenishing his ammunition from the trains in the rear would take over an hour, and this delay would nullify any advantage the previous barrage had given them. The infantry assault went forward without the Confederate artillery close support that had been originally planned.|$|E

While he recovers in hospital, detectives Thomson and Thompson visit him and inform him that the plane subsequently flew to Sussex, England, where it crashed. Tintin and Snowy proceed to Sussex, but along the way, two criminals frame Tintin for robbery, and he is arrested by Thomson and Thompson; he escapes, but is pursued by the detectives. After arriving in England by ferry in Newhaven, Tintin is kidnapped by the criminals, who attempt to kill him over the cliffs of Seaford, but with Snowy's help he escapes. Discovering the plane wreckage, he finds a torn-up note in the pilot's jacket, and following the writing on it arrives at the estate of Dr. J. W. Müller, a German who owns a mental institution. Müller captures Tintin, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> reporter again escapes. In a scuffle, Müller's house catches ablaze and the criminals escape.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} {{the power of}} the Imperial Household Department and the Manchu nobility, in July 1653 the Shunzhi Emperor established the Thirteen Offices (十三衙門), or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus, which were supervised by Manchus, but manned by Chinese eunuchs rather than Manchu bondservants. Eunuchs had been kept under tight control during Dorgon's regency, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> emperor used them to counter the influence of other power centers such as his mother the Empress Dowager and former regent Jirgalang. By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again: they handled key financial and political matters, offered advice on official appointments, and even composed edicts. Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy, Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to the abuses of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming. Despite the emperor's attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities, the Shunzhi Emperor's favorite eunuch Wu Liangfu (吳良輔; d. 1661), who had helped him defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s, was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658. The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite, which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power. The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated (and Wu Liangfu executed) by Oboi and the other regents of the Kangxi Emperor in March 1661 soon after the Shunzhi Emperor's death.|$|E

25|$|Like in {{the rest}} of the Ottoman Empire, Greeks had to carry a receipt {{certifying}} their payment of jizya at all times or be subject to imprisonment.

25|$|Go-go is {{a popular}} music subgenre {{associated}} with funk that originated in the Washington, D.C., area during the mid-60s to late-70s.

25|$|Darras hanged {{himself at}} Neenton, {{probably}} during March 1408. The {{evidence for the}} date is a commission from the king, issued on 30 March, to four Shropshire gentry to investigate possible concealment of the deceased's goods, which as a suicide, escheated to the Crown. A formal order for the escheator to take his estates {{into the hands of}} the king was issued on 24 May.

25|$|For a few years, {{with rising}} stars Richardson, small forward Antawn Jamison and point guard Gilbert Arenas leading the team, the Warriors {{seemed like a}} team on the rise; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Warriors {{did not have enough}} in the {{competitive}} Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the 2002–03 season, St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson, Adonal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars.|$|E
