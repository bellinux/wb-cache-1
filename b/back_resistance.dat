60|$|Section 8. It {{might be}} {{inferred}} from this that pure and impure blood mix in the ventricle, and that a blood of uniform quality flows to lungs, head, and extremities; {{but this is not}} so. The spongy nature of the ventricle sufficiently retards this mixing. It will be noted that the opening of pulmonary arteries lies nearest to the heart, next come the aortic and carotid arches, which have a common opening at A. Furthermore, at c.g.l. [the carotid artery, repeatedly divides to form a close meshwork of arterioles, the carotid gland, forming a sponge-like plug in this vessel.] is a spongy mass of matter, the carotid gland inserted upon the carotid. Hence the pulmonary arteries yawn nearest for the blood, and, being short, wide vessels, present the least resistance to the first rush of blood-- mainly venous blood for the right auricle. As they fill up, the <b>back</b> <b>resistance</b> in them becomes equal, and then greater, than the resistance at A, and the rush of blood, now of a mixed quality passes through that aperture. It selects the dorsal aorta, because the carotid arch, plugged by the carotid gland, offers the greater resistance. Presently, however, the <b>back</b> <b>resistance</b> of the filled dorsal aorta rises above this, and the last flow of blood, from the ventricular systole-- almost purely oxygenated blood for the left auricle-- goes on towards the head.|$|E
60|$|That {{appeared}} to be the cue for pandemonium to break loose. Duane opened his lips to speak, but if he had yelled {{at the top of his}} lungs he could not have made himself heard. In weary disgust he looked at the gaunt man, and then at the others, who were working themselves into a frenzy. He made no move, however, to hold up his hands. The villagers surrounded him, emboldened by finding him now unarmed. Then several men lay hold of his arms and pinioned them behind his <b>back.</b> <b>Resistance</b> was useless even if Duane had had the spirit. Some one of them fetched his halter from his saddle, and with this they bound him helpless.|$|E
40|$|Abstract − The ambient or {{instrument}} temperature {{affects the}} outputs {{of a standard}} radiation thermometer through various parts such as a detector, a feedback resistance and an interference filter. Usually the output was corrected by one coefficient assuming the linear dependence. If the filter wavelength changes, the dependence is different at each target temperature. We measured the temperature coefficients of Topcon radiation thermometers at different target temperatures and found the target temperature dependence {{as well as the}} feed <b>back</b> <b>resistance</b> dependence. Therefore a high stability radiation thermometer requires controlling the detector, filter and amplifier temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the short term effects of an exercise program on abdominal and <b>back</b> muscles <b>resistance</b> and hamstring flexibility among schoolchildren. Fifty eight healthy schoolchildren were divided into two groups: experimental (15 males and 14 females; mean age 12. 2 ± 1. 8 years) and control (14 males and 15 females; mean age 11. 9 ± 2. 1 years). The intervention was performed twice a week, on nonconsecutive days, during six weeks. The duration of each session was fifty minutes and they were composed by warming up aerobic exercises, isotonic and isometric abdominal and back mus-cle exercises and hamstring stretching. The intervention effects were evaluated through Kraus-Weber test (abdominal resis-tance), modified Biering-Sørensen test (<b>back</b> muscle <b>resistance)</b> and sit and reach test (hamstring flexibility). Data were ana-lyzed by mixed-design two-way ANOVA, with one between-subjects and one within-subject (time) factors. The alpha level was set at P 0. 05. The experimental group improved <b>back</b> muscles <b>resistance</b> and hamstring flexibility, but not abdominal muscles resistance. There was a significant interaction between groups and time for <b>back</b> muscles <b>resistance</b> (P= 0. 018) and for hamstring flexibility (P= 0. 017). The 6 -week training period showed positive results in improving <b>back</b> muscles <b>resistance</b> and hamstring flexibility of schoolchildren...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The host {{acceptance}} {{behavior and}} environmental factors as temperature affect the feeding behavior of Lepidoptera pests. Thus, they {{must be considered in}} studies about the risk potential of resistance evolution. The current study sets the differences in the feeding behavior of neonate Alabama argillacea (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae exposed to Bt and non-Bt cotton plants, under different temperatures and time gap after hatching. Two cotton cultivars were used: the Bt (DP 404 BG - bollgard) and the non-transformed isoline, DP 4049. We found that the feeding behavior of neonate A. argillacea is significantly different between Bt and non-Bt cotton. Based on the number of larvae with vegetal tissue in their gut found on the plant and in the organza {{as well as on the}} amount of vegetal tissue ingested by the larvae. A. argillacea shows feeding preference for non-Bt cotton plants, in comparison to that on the Bt. However, factors such as temperature and exposure time may affect detection capacity and plant abandonment by the larvae and it results in lower ingestion of vegetal tissue. Such results are relevant to handle the resistance of Bt cotton cultivars to A. argillacea and they also enable determining how the cotton seeds mix will be a feasible handling option to hold <b>back</b> <b>resistance</b> evolution in A. argillacea populations on Bt cotton, when it is compared to other refuge strategies. The results can also be useful to determine which refuge distribution of plants is more effective for handling Bt cotton resistance to A. argillacea...|$|E
