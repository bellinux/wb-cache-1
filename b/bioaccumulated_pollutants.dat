40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the Mdm 2 and p 53 responses induced by DNA damaging xenobiotics and how these responses can be modified by non-genotoxic xenobiotics. During control conditions cellular levels of p 53 are low. The level is regulated by Mdm 2 and Mdm 2 and p 53 forms an autoregulatory loop. When DNA is damaged, the p 53 -Mdm 2 feedback loop is perturbed, and the cellular levels of p 53 are increased so that p 53 can regulate the transcriptional activity of proteins mediating responses such as apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. DNA damage may induce posttranslational modifications on p 53 and Mdm 2, such as phosphorylation or dephosphorylation induced by different kinases. These posttranslational modifications may modify the functions of Mdm 2 and p 53. This study focuses on Mdm 2 phosphorylation within the epitopes of antibody 2 A 10, and phosphorylation of Mdm 2 on Ser 166. Both TCDD and the cholesterol lowering drugs statins were shown to attenuate the p 53 stabilization in response to DNA damaging agents in HepG 2 cells and in rodents. TCDD is a persistent, <b>bioaccumulating</b> <b>pollutant.</b> It is a carcinogen without being genotoxic. The detailed mechanisms for cancer induction are unknown, however. Statins are drugs used to treat hypercholesterolemia, and have also anticarcinogenic properties. The attenuation of p 53 DNA damage response was associated with Mdm 2 phosphorylation on Ser 166. Thus, statins and TCDD induces Mdm 2 Ser 166. phosphorylation and attenuates p 53 stabilization in response to DNA damage in HepG 2 cells. TCDD also attenuated p 53 stabilization in response to DNA damage in rats. As statin-induced Mdm 2 Ser 166. phosphorylation was attenuated by rapamycin (an inhibitor of MTOR) and Mdm 2 Ser 166. phosphorylation occurred in parallel to MTOR) phosphorylation, it is likely that MTOR) induced Ser 166. phosphorylation. Our findings thus suggests that mTOR is one of the kinases inducing Mdm 2 Ser 166. phosphorylation. TCDDand statin-induced attenuation of p 53 response might interfere with the cells ability to handle genotoxic agents. TCDD has been associated with cancer, especially liver cancer in rodents. Statins, on the other hand, rather seems to have anti care i nogenic properties. However, if statins are used together with genotoxic substances, attenuation of p 53 response could affect its capacity to kill cells. Mdm 2 phosphorylation within the epitopes of antibody 2 A 10 occurred at much lower concentrations of genotoxic substances benzo[a]pyrene, BPDE, mitomycinC and etoposide than those inducing p 53 stabilization. This suggests that Mdm 2 can be used as a marker for certain types of DNA damage. Mdm 2 2 A 10 phosphorylation induced by lower doses than those inducing p 53 stabilization did not occur after exposure to dibenzo[a,l]pyrene and its metabolite DBPDE. We suggest that Mdm 2 phosphorylated within the 2 A 10 epitopes might be involved in DNA repair of BPDE adducts, since BPDE induces 2 A 10 phosphorylation and DNA repair while DBPDE do not. Mdm 2 has been shown to interact with proteins involved in DNA repair such as DNA polymerase epsilon and Nbs I. Mdm 2 also partly localize to double stranded DNA breaks in response to IR irradiation.

40|$|Introduction In 1990, the Italian Ministry of the Environment {{declared}} a 276 -km 2 area - {{which includes the}} municipalities of Gela, Niscemi and Butera - a high-risk area (see Chapter 1). Gela, a coastal city located {{in the south of}} Sicily, had a population of 77 145 people in 2008 (54 774 in 1961). In 2008, the municipalities of Niscemi (332 m above sea level) and Butera (402 m above sea level) had 26 541 and 5063 inhabitants, respectively. In 2000, {{on the basis of the}} documented presence of soil contamination or hazardous waste, 51 km 2 of Gela (corresponding to private, industrial, public and marine areas) were designated a site of national concern (see "Introduction" in Chapter 6). In this area, extremely high levels of toxic, persistent and <b>bioaccumulating</b> chemical <b>pollutants</b> have been detected in soil, surface and groundwater, as well as in marine water and sediments (Musmeci et al., 2009). In the last decade, descriptive epidemiological studies have provided evidence of highly significant adverse health outcomes (see Chapter 5). Prior to the analytical epidemiological study described in the present chapter, the data produced by industry, to characterize chemical substances measured in soil, surface water and groundwater in the national sites of concern, were evaluated by an ad hoc multidisciplinary group (Musmeci et al., 2009). Although data on environmental matrices and health outcomes are available for the area of national concern, these data are scattered and lack organization. Considering the data available on polluting chemicals, and taking into account their toxic properties, the multidisciplinary group produced a list of chemicals defined as index substances. This list represents a priority set for environment and health assessments(Musmeci et al., 2009). The human biomonitoring study described in the present chapter aims to improve the knowledge of exposure of the residents of the municipalities of Gela, Niscemi and Butera to selected pollutants. The study surveyed the development of a communication plan: dissemination of information, contacts with local communities, meetings, training activities and the involvement of stakeholders. The study started in 2008, and its results were presented publicly in July 2009. This chapter will show the results of a human biomonitoring study, called Studio Epidemiologico Biomonitoraggio Area Gela(SEBIOMAG), in the Gela area.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Caspian terns (Hydroprogne caspia) and double-crested {{cormorants}} (Phalacrocorax auritus) nest {{in large}} colonies on East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary, the largest known colonies {{for the two}} species in the world. Both species of piscivorous colonial waterbirds {{have been identified as}} predators with {{a significant impact on the}} survival of juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) listed under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. To better understand and address issues related to seabird-fisheries interactions in the Columbia River estuary, I conducted studies related to the ecology, conservation, and management of these two species of piscivorous waterbirds. I evaluated the demographics and inter-colony movements of Caspian terns belonging to the Pacific Coast metapopulation, with special emphasis on two breeding colonies, one on East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary and the other on Crescent Island in the mid-Columbia River, based on re-sightings of color-banded individuals. Apparent annual adult survival at both colonies was high, and age at first reproduction was greater than previously reported for the species. Colony site philopatry of breeding adults at both colonies was high; however, some individuals prospected for breeding colonies over much of the Pacific Coast region and moved to other colonies over distances of up to 3, 000 km. Some terns from the large colony in the Columbia River estuary responded quickly to the availability of new colony sites as distant as 550 km from the estuary, and established successful breeding colonies within less than a year of the new sites becoming available. The Caspian tern colony on East Sand Island appears to be an important source colony for a number of smaller, less productive colonies distributed over an extensive area from the Salton Sea, California to the Copper River Delta, Alaska, an area with limited and ephemeral nesting opportunities. Environmental contaminants have been a conservation concern for wildlife in the Columbia River estuary, especially species that consume fish and are therefore likely to <b>bioaccumulate</b> persistent organic <b>pollutants.</b> I measured and compared levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in eggs and chicks of Caspian terns and doublecrested cormorants, as well as their primary prey fish types, at colonies on East Sand Island and farther up-river. Based on differences in tern and cormorant diet composition at the various study colonies, higher PCB levels in eggs and chicks were associated with diets dominated by resident freshwater and estuarine fishes. PCB levels in prey fish were positively correlated with lipid content; however, PCB levels in the livers of chicks were negatively correlated with chick fat scores, suggesting that chick fat reserves are a sink for ingested PCBs. Lower PCB levels in terns and cormorants from East Sand Island compared to colonies farther up-river reflected diets with a higher proportion of marine forage fishes at East Sand Island; marine forage fishes had lower average levels of PCBs than their resident freshwater and estuarine counterparts. In order to explore non-destructive techniques for managing nesting colonies of double-crested cormorants, I evaluated habitat enhancement and social attraction, two techniques that have proven effective for relocating Caspian tern colonies to sites where impacts on fish stocks of conservation concern would be minimal. Cormorants were attracted to nest and successfully raised young at test plots on East Sand Island and on islands in the estuary with a previous history of cormorant nesting or unsuccessful nesting attempts. On an island with no history of cormorant nesting or prospecting, however, no cormorants were attracted to nest. My results suggest that attraction of nesting cormorants using these techniques is dependent on the previous history of cormorant nesting or nesting attempts, the frequency and intensity of disturbance by potential predators, and the presence of breeding cormorants nearby. While habitat enhancement and social attraction have potential as methods for redistributing nesting cormorants away from areas where fish stocks of concern are highly susceptible to predation, successful establishment of new colonies using these techniques will likely require a focus on sites with a history of cormorant nesting. Findings from this dissertation raise some concerns over the management of Caspian tern and double-crested cormorant colonies on East Sand Island in order to redistribute parts of these colonies to alternative sites and mitigate the impact of those piscivorous colonial waterbirds on ESA-listed salmonids. East Sand Island has supported source colonies of piscivorous colonial waterbirds for many smaller colonies throughout the region and is close to an abundant and relatively uncontaminated food supply. Also, alternative colony sites that can substitute for East Sand Island are not readily apparent, especially for double-crested cormorants. Therefore, management of Caspian tern and double-crested cormorant colonies on East Sand Island to benefit Columbia Basin salmonids needs to proceed cautiously and reversibly because of the implications for the region-wide populations of these piscivorous colonial waterbirds...|$|R
40|$|Metallic {{contamination}} is widespread, {{particularly in}} areas impacted by human activities. Human activities result in high loads of metals being discarded into the aquatic compartment, reinforcing {{the need to}} evaluate their toxic effects especially on exposed fish. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the toxic response (namely, antioxidant levels and lipoperoxidative damage) in both liver and gills of the freshwater fish species Gambusia holbrooki, exposed to lead and zinc. Fish were exposed for 28 days (chronic exposure) to ecologically relevant concentrations of the selected compounds. The following oxidative stress/damage biomarkers were evaluated: glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), glutathione reductase (GR), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The results indicate that lead caused a significant oxidative response, with significant increase of the enzymatic antioxidant defense (GSTs activity in hepatic tissue, and GR activity in branchial tissue) of exposed organisms. On the other hand, zinc caused a significant inhibition of G. holbrooki hepatic GR, a biological response that may be related to the antioxidant activity exhibited by this metal. The obtained results are of high importance, especially if one considers that the obtained toxic responses occurred at low, albeit ecologically relevant, levels of exposure. Metal-containing waste (from domestic, agricultural and industrial sources) that is continuously released can have significant impacts on the environment, particularly aquatic ecosystems (López-Galindo et al. 2010). In recent years, the effects of metallic pollution in fish were demonstrated, showing that these organisms are able to <b>bioaccumulate</b> these <b>pollutants</b> (Greco et al. 2010). In addition, metals can induce severe alterations, including an oxidative stress response in various cell types, and also significant alterations of the elimination profile of foreign molecules from the body (Wang et al. 2009; Johnston et al. 2010). Thus, oxidative stress biomarkers, and others (especially those implicated in the metabolism of toxic molecules), have become an important assessment tool in aquatic toxicology (Livingstone 2001; Wang et al. 2009; Jin et al. 2010; Johnston et al. 2010) to monitor the occurrence of pollutants, and deleterious effects potentially exerted in aquatic organisms. The use of molecular oxygen in normal respiratory processes in mitochondria results in the physiological production and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS; Chance et al. 1979; Wallace 1999); exposure to xenobiotics (including metals) can increase the production of ROS through several mechanisms, such as interference in the electron transport within the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent accumulation of reactive intermediates (Herrero et al. 2008). This may result in cellular damage, namely by inactivation of antioxidant enzymes, depletion of nonenzymatic antioxidants, and membrane lipid peroxidation (Modesto and Martinez 2010). The review by Franco et al. (2009) referenced that some of the most common environmental contaminants, including several metallic species (e. g., iron, copper, chromium, cobalt, vanadium, cadmium, arsenic, nickel), could trigger apoptosis through the interference with regulating cellular mechanisms. Metals are known to interfere at several subcellular levels, such as the mitochondria (oxidation of mitochondrial RNA, and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway), the endoplasmatic reticulum, and nuclear DNA. Moreover, established oxidative imbalance can cause irreversible oxidative damage in DNA and other macromolecules, or even death of organisms (Jin et al. 2010; Li et al. 2010; Modesto and Martinez 2010). ROS are removed or inactivated by antioxidant defenses, and the balance between these radicals and the antioxidant defense of living organisms is fundamental for their protection against oxidative stress and its deleterious consequences (Li et al. 2010; Modesto and Martinez 2010). Nevertheless, the exposure to chemical pollutants also may contribute to oxidative stress, by altering this equilibrium, and consequently inducing a decrease in the antioxidant defense system efficiency (Solé et al. 1996; Livingstone 2001). Fish cope with the harmful effects of oxidative stress through adaptive responses, namely by increased activity of enzymes involved in the biotransformation and metabolism of a wide range of environmental contaminants and their metabolites (Ognjanovic et al. 2008; Modesto and Martinez 2010). The antioxidant defense system of the majority of organisms is composed by a multitude of enzymes, among which it is possible to identify glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). These are the most frequently studied biomarkers of oxidative stress in fish (Jin et al. 2010; Modesto and Martinez 2010; Pereira et al. 2010). Lipoperoxidation (LPO) estimation also has been found to have a high value as a biomarker of toxic effects, because this parameter reflects the onset of cellular damage, as a result of oxidation of membrane lipids (Ognjanovic et al. 2008; Pereira et al. 2010). Amongst all compounds present in the environment, in growing amounts and with evident human origin, metals are particularly important. Metals are widely dispersed in the aquatic environment, being released by anthropogenic activities (mining, release of domestic products into sewage; plumbing degradation; emissions from nuclear plants, from smelters and from burning fossil fuels) but also by natural sources (e. g., volcanoes) (Hozhina et al. 2001; Thompson et al. 2005; Rose and Shea 2007; Connan and Tack 2010; Aktar et al. 2011). Metallic species are fundamental for life, being part of macromolecules and enzymes (Liu and Thiele 1997). However, metals also are prone to establish redox cycles if in the presence of molecular oxygen, giving rise to the production of ROS (Herrero et al. 2008). Consequently, metals are dual in their effects: albeit vital, they are eminently toxic (Liu and Thiele 1997). Metals (especially transition metals) are toxic and capable of exerting important deleterious effects of oxidative nature in exposed organisms, as reviewed by Valavanidis et al. (2006). Metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, chromium, nickel, manganese, and iron, especially in their waterborne form, can indeed increase the production of reactive oxygen species (Jadhav et al. 2007). However, exposure to metals conducing to oxidative stress is commonly followed by a set of immediate physiological adaptations (e. g., through antioxidant defenses) to prevent their adverse effects. For example, the study conducted by Grinevicius et al. (2009) on textile effluents rich in metallic species evidenced antioxidant responses in the freshwater fish Danio rerio. Despite the activation of antioxidant mechanisms following chemical insults by metals, damage (e. g., lipid peroxidation) is likely to occur, as reported by Siddique et al. (2008) after exposing Drosophila melanogaster to metals present in tannery effluents. Mining effluents also were proven to induce oxidative stress responses in fish (Kelly and Janz 2009), anurans (Marques et al. 2011), and mammals (Reglero et al. 2009). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the chronic effects induced by exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations of two metals (nonessential lead and essential zinc) on oxidative stress parameters of the freshwater fish Gambusia holbrooki. Being distinct in nature and biological effects, these two metals are dispersed widely in Portuguese estuaries (Mucha et al. 2003; Fernandes et al. 2008). However, it is important to know in detail their toxic effects when in ecologically relevant levels to ascertain about the putative common toxic mechanisms and to know the biological responses elicited by fish to cope with these two different compounds. The oxidative stress parameters GSTs, GR, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured in hepatic and gill tissues to serve as putative biomarkers of effect in this study, provided their role in key biological processes determinant for the survival of the individuals: the enzymes are involved in detoxification by phase II metabolism (conjugation with glutathione) and antioxidant activity, and TBARS are indicative of lipoperoxidative damage (Nunes et al. 2008, 2015 a, b). As target organs, we chose liver and gills because the liver is the main organ of xenobiotic metabolism in fish, and the gills are the primary barrier against the entrance of xenobiotics into the body and also are the first line of detoxification and elimination of deleterious compounds (Wood and Soivio 1991; Evans et al. 2005) ...|$|R

Negative health effects are expressed in liver damage and thyroid immunotoxicity, neurobehavioral abnormalities, reduced weight of newborns, reproductive toxicity. The problem of contamination of marine ecosystems with persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and their impact on biodiversity used to be the subject of research. In recent years the number of studies determine the concentrations of pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and other persistent organic pollutants in environmental samples, animal and plant organisms is constantly growing. Scientific studies have focused on determining the levels of contaminants in water species because lipophilic organochlorine compounds bioaccumulate in their tissues, in concentrations higher than those in the aqueous medium which inhabit. So fish and other aquatic organisms are used as bio-indicator of pollution of aquatic ecosystems. Edible products of animal origin, in particular fish and seafood are the main source of their entry into the human body. On the other hand, fish is valuable food for humans, because it contains proteins, vitamins and other essential nutrients, low levels of saturated fats and omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have a protective effect in the prevention of coronary heart disease. Due to health recommendations on fish consumption, it is important to determine the contribution of organochlorine contaminants such as pesticides and PCBs through dietary intake of fish and other marine organisms. The aim of the dissertation work is a study of content of residual organochlorine pesticides (DDT and its metabolites) in the Black Sea fish and assess the safety of the fish as food. Main tasks: 1. Sampling of various fish species from different regions. 2. Modification of the analytical procedure, developed for PCBs in foodstuffs of animal origin, for simultaneous determination of DDT and metabolites and PCBs in fish tissues. 3. Determining of the concentrations of DDT and its metabolites in the Black Sea fish, mussels, rapanas and freshwater fish. 4. Evaluation of the safety of the Black Sea fish as food by calculating the daily intake, risk quotient (RQ) and toxic equivalent concentrations (TEQ). Main conclusions of the thesis: 1. The research on organochlorine contaminants in different species of marine and freshwater fish were summarized and systematized. The data are used for comparison with the results obtained from this study. 2. Analytical procedure, developed for the determination of PCBs in foods is modified for simultaneous determination of PCBs, DDT and metabolites. The goal is the simultaneous determination of PCBs, DDT and metabolites, which saves time and expensive reagents. 3. For qualitative and quantitative determination of DDT and metabolites was used gas chromatography method. 4. The systematic study of 10 fish species was made for five years - from 2007 to 2011. The results are summarized: by areas of the catch - no significant difference between the values of DDT in fish samples from three regions of sampling. in years of sampling - there was observed a slight decrease in the concentrations of total DDT in 2010 and 2011. in seasons - there was no significant difference in the concentrations of DDT and metabolites in fish caught in the spring and autumn period. by fish species - there is a significant difference between the different types of fish such as average concentrations DDT for the entire period ranged from 20. 8 ng / g ww to 208. 5 ng / g ww. 5. The results show that the residual concentrations of DDT and its metabolites in all species tested decreased in the order p, p-DDE- p, p-DDD- p, p-DDT. DDT is found in very low concentrations, suggesting that the technical p,p-DDT is almost completely metabolized. 6. The content of DDT and metabolites in mussels and rapanas from the Black Sea coast is much lower than all studied fish species. 7. The comparison of the data with results from studies of other authors shows that the levels of contamination by DDT and metabolites in fish from the Bulgarian Black Sea coast are similar or lower than levels of the same species from the Black Sea, Marmara Sea and Mediterranean Sea. 8. In comparison, a survey was conducted on several freshwater fish. The DDTs residues in freshwater fish 23. 2 (mean value) were lower than concentrations in fish from Black Sea. 9. PCBs concentrations (other POPs) were determined in same fish species for comparison with the levels of DDT and its metabolites. In all species concentrations of DDTs are higher than those of the PCB. 10. Pollution of the Black Sea fish with PCBs is primarily due to indicator PCBs (from 7. 2 to 27. 3) with the lowest values were found in goby, and highest in shad. Highly toxic dioxin-like PCBs were in low concentrations (1. 4 to 9. 1). 11. The results for sum of indicator PCBs in all fish species did not exceed the recommended maximum level of 75. 12. Pollution indicator PCBs on the Black Sea fish is lower in comparison with data for PCBs in fish from other ecosystems. 13. The results for DDT and metabolites and PCBs were used to assess the safety of the fish as food. Calculated are: Daily intake of DDT and PCBs Risk quotient (RQ) Toxic equivalent concentration (TEQ) 14. Safety assessment shows that there is no risk to human health when consuming fish from Black Sea. Contributions of the dissertation work 1. For very first time in Bulgaria a systematical study on DDT and its metabolites DDE and DDD in various marine and freshwater fish was done. The study covers the period 2007 - 2011, as pollution was assessed by areas of the catch, by years of sampling, by seasons and by fish species. 2. Analytical procedure, developed for the determination of PCBs in foods, was modified for simultaneous determination of PCBs, DDT and metabolites in fish tissues. 3. An evaluation of the safety of fish as food based on the calculated daily intake and risk factor for DDT and PCBs and toxic equivalent concentrations (TEQ) of dioxin-like PCBs. Such an assessment of the Black Sea fish is done for very first time here. 4. The study has character of monitoring for the assessment of pollution in our region of the Black Sea. The results have contributed to the enrichment of the data on pollution of the Black Sea and their comparison with other marine ecosystems. /////////// /////////// [BG] Програмата за околна среда (UNEP) към Организацията на обединените нации е определила 12 хлорсъдържащи органични съединения като опасни замърсители поради тяхното отрицателно въздействие върху човешкото здраве и околната среда. Сред тях са някои хлорорганични пестициди, полихлорирани бифенили, диоксини и фурани. Разпространението на хлорорганични пестициди (като ДДТ и метаболити), полихлорирани бифенили (ПХБ) и диоксиноподобни съединения в околната среда постепенно намалява след края на 70 -те години на 20 век, поради тяхното ограничение и забрана. Но основните проблеми като замърсяването на екосистемите, безопасността на храните и потенциалните вредни ефекти за здравето на хората от експозицията на тази група вещества остават. Поради устойчивостта им в околната среда и способността им да биоакумулират, хлорорганичните замърсители се натрупват по хранителната верига в организмите, по-специално в животинските мазнини, млечните продукти и рибите. Проблемът за замърсяване на морските екосистеми с устойчиви органични замърсители (УОЗ) и влиянието им върху биоразнообразието продължава да бъде предмет на научните изследвания. През последните години броят на изследванията за определяне концентрациите на пестициди, полихлорирани бифенили, полихлорирани дибензо-р-диоксини и дибензофурани и други устойчиви органични замърсители в проби от околната среда, животинските и растителните организми непрекъснато нараства. Научните изследвания са насочени към определяне нивата на замърсители във водни животински видове, защото липофилните хлорорганични съединения биоакумулират в техните тъкани в концентрации по-високи от тези във водната среда, която обитават. Затова рибите и други водни организми се използват като биоиндикатор за замърсяването на водните екосистеми. Хранителни продукти от животински произход и особено риба и морски продукти са основният източник за попадането им в човешкия организъм. От друга страна рибите са ценна храна за хората, защото съдържат протеини, витамини и други есенциални нутриенти, ниски нива на наситени мазнини, както и омега - 3 полиненаситени мастни киселини, които имат защитен ефект в превенцията на коронарната болест на сърцето. Поради здравните препоръки относно консумацията на риба, е важно да се определи приносът на хлорорганични замърсители като пестициди и ПХБ чрез хранителен прием на риба и други морски организми. По този начин може да се направи оценка на безопасността и риска от консумация на риба|$|R
