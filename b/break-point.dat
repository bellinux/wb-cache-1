5|$|During {{the clay}} season, Federer's {{victory in the}} Hamburg Masters final was {{particularly}} impressive, as it snapped Rafael Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-Era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in {{a repeat of the}} previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on <b>break-point</b> chances.|$|E

40|$|Transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertions of Agrobacterium {{gene fusion}} vectors and {{corresponding}} insertional target sites were isolated from transgenic and wild type Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Nucleotide sequence comparison of wild type and T-DNA-tagged genomic loci showed that T-DNA integration resulted in target site deletions of 29 - 73 bp. In those cases where integrated T-DNA segments {{turned out to}} be smaller than canonical ones, the <b>break-points</b> of target deletions and T-DNA insertions overlapped and consisted of 5 - 7 identical nucleotides. Formation of precise junctions at the right T-DNA border, and DNA sequence homology between the left termini of T-DNA segments and <b>break-points</b> of target deletions were observed in those cases where full-length canonical T-DNA inserts were very precisely replacing plant target DNA sequences. Aberrant junctions were observed in those transformants where termini of T-DNA segments showed no homology to <b>break-points</b> of target sequence deletions. Homology between short segments within target sites and T-DNA, as well as conversion and duplication of DNA sequences at junctions, suggests that T-DNA integration results from illegitimate recombination. The data suggest that while the left T-DNA terminus and both target termini participate in partial pairing and DNA repair, the right T-DNA terminus plays an essential role in the recognition of the target and in the formation of a primary synapsis during integration...|$|R
40|$|A {{time series}} {{is a set}} of random values {{collected}} at equal time intervals; this randomness makes these types of series not easy to predict because the structure of the series may change at any time. As discussed in previous research, the structure of time series may change at any time due to the change in mean and/or variance of the series. Consequently, based on this structure, it is wise not to assume that these series are stationary. This paper, discusses, a method of analyzing time series by considering the entire series non-stationary, assuming there is random change in unconditional mean and variance of the series. Specifically, this paper emphasizes financial time series. The main goal in this process is to break the series into small locally stationary time series on which stationary assumption applies. The most interesting part of this procedure is locating the <b>break-points,</b> where the unconditional mean and/or variance of the series change. After having found what the <b>break-points</b> are, we divide the series into smaller series according to the break points; the number of <b>break-points</b> determines how many small stationary time series we have. The analysis by this method considers each interval on which the series is stationary as an independent time series with its specific parameters. Hence, the overall time series that is naturally nonstationary is broken into small stationary time series that are easier to analyze. Afterwards, by using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) we are comparing the local stationary model to the model considering the entire series stationary. In a simulation study with known sample size, unconditional means and variances, for each small stationary series, the result shows that we can locate the exact true <b>break-points</b> when the sample size is greater than 500. After our simulation study, this method is also applied to the real data, S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 series of returns, which is a financial time series. The results obtained by using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) show that BIC is smaller for the locally stationary model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Interconnected {{power systems}} are multi-loop structured. In such networks, the {{determination}} of settings for all overcurrent relays {{can be done in}} different forms and may be quite complicated. The main problem for coordination is {{the determination of}} starting points, i. e. the location of starting relays in the procedure for settings, which is referred to as <b>break-points</b> (BP). In the recent developed algorithm an approach based on expert system is applied to consider the effects of pilot protection, fault levels, etc. This paper introduces a new method which not only contains the characteristics of the previous method, but also it can generate new BP after each coordination process. Finally the minimum <b>break-points</b> set (MBPS) that leads to a minimum miscoordination is obtained. The method is applied to the 6 buses network for case study. From the obtained results, it is reviled that the new method is accurate and contains no miscoordination...|$|R

40|$|Summary: We {{developed}} Breakpointer, a fast algorithm {{to locate}} breakpoints of structural variants (SVs) from single-end reads pro-duced by next-generation sequencing (NGS). By {{taking advantage of}} local non-uniform read distribution and misalignments created by SVs, Breakpointer scans the alignment of single-end reads to identify regions containing potential breakpoints. The detection of such <b>break-points</b> can indicate insertions longer than the read length and SVs located in repetitve regions which might be missd by other methods. Thus, Breakpointer complements existing methods to locate SVs from single-end reads...|$|R

40|$|Microarray-CGH {{experiments}} aim at detecting and mapping chromosomal imbalances, by hybridizing {{targets of}} genomic DNA from a test and a reference sample. Probes are constituted by sequences of genomic DNA (BACs) that are mapped on the genome. For this reason, the signal has a spatial coherence {{that has to}} be handled by specific statistical tools. Process segmentation seems to be a natural framework for this purpose. A CGH profile {{can be viewed as a}} succession of segments that represent homogeneous regions in the genome whose BACs share the same relative copy number in average. We model a CGH profile by a random gaussian process whose distribution parameters are affected by abrupt changes at unknown coordinates. Two major problem arise: the estimation of the <b>break-points</b> coordinates and the estimation of the number of segments. A dynamic programming algorithm is used to partition the data into a finite number of segments. A model selection approach is used to determine the number of segments in the profile, using an adaptative method. We explain why classical penalized criteria can not be used in the context of <b>break-points</b> detection and show the potentialities of our methodology, using publicly available data sets. We detect previously mapped chromosomal aberrations and disuss the performance of our methodology on noisier data concerning breast cancer cell lines...|$|R
