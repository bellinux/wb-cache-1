50|$|From {{at least}} {{as early as the}} 1890s, cane lifts at tram or railway sidings were used to {{transfer}} <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> cane onto <b>rail</b> or tram wagons. Cane was initially harvested as whole stalks by hand and, later, by whole stalk mechanical harvesters. The cane was cut close to the ground and then the top foliage was cut off. It was transported to the mill as whole stalks. A frequent practise was to lay temporary tramlines into the field so that tram wagons could be loaded with cut cane close to where the harvesting took place. Where this practise was not followed, the cane was loaded onto a horse-drawn wagon or motorised vehicle. This was done by hand until the introduction of mechanised loaders in the mid-20th century. The wagon or vehicle transported the cane to the nearest siding where the <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> cane were transferred onto a tram or rail wagon using the cane lifts.|$|R

A less than full train fails to fully realise the economies of scale achievable through the use <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> freight, and the P&G case study identified that attention {{should be given to}} the <b>bundling</b> <b>of</b> goods. This refers to the aggregation of goods from a variety of shippers on the same rail freight vehicle, to ensure the train is fully loaded. Horizontal collaboration is viewed as a possible solution to the problem <b>of</b> <b>bundling</b> <b>of</b> goods. It aims to facilitate collaboration between shippers, by combining smaller shipments into a larger volume, more suitable for transportation by train. <b>Bundling</b> <b>of</b> goods can lead to economic, environmental and social benefits. Horizontal collaboration as described by Cruijssen et al. [35] requires that multiple independent shippers pro-actively work together in clusters or communities to “bundle” their overlapping freight flows. “Bundling” in this context means that the compatible freight flows of the shippers are consolidated in space, as well as synchronised in time. 12 [...]...|$|R

The goods need to be delivered not too early since the flower shops are still closed; but also not too late since the shops are already opened.
