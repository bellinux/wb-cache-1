25|$|Ogawa and his wingman {{had just}} swept down on Bunker Hill {{so quickly that}} her gunners <b>barely</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to respond. Ogawa's wingman {{released}} a 550-lb bomb which smashed through the flight deck and out the side, exploding just above the water. The aircraft crashed into the flight deck and skidded over the side, destroying {{nearly all of the}} 34 fully armed and fueled planes parked on the flight deck. At the same time, Ogawa was completing his dive with his Zero through the AA fire, aiming for the flight deck near the bridge of the ship to cause the most damage, as kamikaze pilots were trained to do. At nearly a vertical dive, Ogawa dropped his 550-lb bomb just before impact with the flight deck, crashing near the island at about 10:05 hours.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman {{squadron}} had set anchor at the Gulf of Girolata {{to distribute}} the booty from the recent raid. Dragut had chosen the place because it was deserted and far from the common sailing routes. As such, he left no ship to guard {{the entrance of the}} gulf. On arriving in the waters nearby, Gianettino Doria sent his relative Giorgio Doria into the gulf with 6 galleys and a small rowing frigate in order to identify the anchored galleys. Accounts of the battle's course differ. According to Cesáreo Fernández Duro and Julien de la Gravière, the Ottoman seamen and soldiers were ashore, sleeping under the trees or having a meal, when the arrival of the Spanish galleys took them by surprise. According to De La Gravière, 600 Ottomans fled to the surrounding mountains before the battle actually started and Dragut <b>barely</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to embark and fire a single volley before the Genoese and Spanish boarded his flagship and his other galleys. At the first shots, many of his men, whether Turks, Moors or European renegades, jumped overboard to escape inland.|$|E

[...] For Killer Croc's, Carter said the mission was [...] "a predictable storyline" [...] since Killer Croc is generally portrayed as a [...] "one-dimensional" [...] foe, though [...] "t works better than Mad Hatter's portion... because most of it isn't [...] re-used environments, {{and there is a}} nice brief reunion with Nightwing." [...] Speaking of the Mister Freeze mission, Carter called the exploration of Freeze's relationship with his wife Nora [...] "compelling" [...] and enjoyed the fact it was the only [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] mission to feature a predator challenge. Additionally, he added that the Batmobile sequence had [...] "more of a reason to exist than most of the ones in the campaign." [...] Finally, Carter called the Ra's al Ghul mission [...] "the other highlight of the pack" [...] and felt the choice the mission gave players at the end was [...] "pretty interesting". He also added the setting of Elliot General Hospital was a good way to highlight Hush's family legacy since his [...] "part in [...] was extremely disappointing".|$|E
500|$|Rear Admiral Eiji Gotō, {{commander}} of the 24th Air Flotilla, launched all 17 of his long-range Mitsubishi G4M1 [...] "Betty" [...] torpedo bombers, although no torpedoes were available at Rabaul and they made do {{with a pair of}} [...] bombs apiece. To better search for the Americans, the Japanese split their aircraft into two groups and Lexingtons radar acquired one of these at 16:25. At this time, the ship was rotating its CAP aircraft and the newly launched aircraft <b>barely</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to reach the altitude of the Japanese before they arrived. Lexington had 15 fully fueled Wildcats and Dauntlesses on her forward flight deck that had been moved forward to allow the CAP fighters to land. They represented a serious fire hazard, but they could not be launched until all aircraft on the flight deck were moved aft. Cognizant of the danger, the deck crews succeeded in respotting the aircraft and the fueled aircraft were able to take off before the Japanese attacked. Per Commander Herbert Duckworth, [...] "It was as if some great hand moved all the planes aft simultaneously." [...] Only four of the nine G4Ms in the first wave survived to reach Lexington, but all of their bombs missed and they were all shot down afterward, including one by a Dauntless. The honors were not all one-sided as they shot down two of the defending Wildcats. The second wave of eight bombers was spotted at 16:56, while all but two of the Wildcats were dealing with the first wave. Lieutenant Edward O'Hare and his wingman, Lieutenant (junior grade) Marion Dufilho, were able to intercept the bombers a few miles short of Lexington, but Dufilho's guns jammed before he could fire a shot. O'Hare was able to shoot down three G4Ms and damage two others before the bombers were able to drop their bombs, none of which struck the wildly maneuvering carrier. Only three of the G4Ms reached base as those Wildcats and Dauntlesses with enough fuel pursued and shot down several others.|$|E

Then, leading his central column, Sérurier launched a charge with Masséna's division in support. Brushing aside spotty resistance, the French broke the Sardinian lines and forced them to abandon Mondovì. Dichat was killed. Stengel received a mortal wound while leading a force of dragoons in pursuit.|$|E

For the other two he gave me a bill upon some agent in Delagoa Bay, together with a letter of recommendation to him and the Portuguese governor, who, it appeared, was in debt to their establishment. By an afterthought, however, although I kept the letters, I returned him the bill and spent the £200 in purchasing a great variety of goods which I will not enumerate, that I knew would be useful for trading purposes among the east coast Kaffirs.

60|$|The king {{consented to}} this proposal. He {{equipped}} a fleet and raised an army, and Margaret set sail for England, taking {{the king and}} the prince with her. Her plan was to land {{in the northern part}} of the island, near the frontiers of Scotland, where she expected to find the country more friendly to the Lancastrian line than the people were toward the south. As soon as she landed she was joined by many of the people, and she succeeded in capturing some castles and small towns. But the Earl of Warwick, who was, as has been already said, the prime minister under Edward, immediately raised an army of twenty thousand men, and marched to the northward to meet her. Margaret's French army was wholly unprepared to encounter such a force as this, so they fled to their ships. All but about five hundred of the men succeeded in reaching the ships. The five hundred were cut to pieces. Margaret herself was detained in making arrangements for the king and the prince. She concluded not to take them to sea again, but to send them secretly into Wales, while she herself went back to France to see if she could not procure re-enforcements. She <b>barely</b> <b>had</b> <b>time,</b> at last, to reach the ships herself, so close at hand were her enemies. As soon as the queen had embarked, the fleet set sail. The queen had saved nearly all the money and all the stores which she had brought with her from France, and she hoped still to preserve them for another attempt. But the fleet had scarcely got off from the shore when a terrible storm arose, and the ships were all driven upon the rocks and dashed to pieces. The money and the stores were all lost; a large portion of the men were drowned; Margaret herself and the captain of the fleet saved themselves, and, as soon as the storm was over, they succeeded in making their escape back to Berwick in an old fishing-boat which they obtained on the shore.|$|E
