5|$|Facing {{increasing}} {{scrutiny and}} pressure to align {{with one of}} the three allied city-states, the Scions decide to relocate their headquarters to Revenant's Toll, a hub for adventurers in the neutral territory of Mor Dhona. Minfilia reunites with her adoptive mother F'lhaminn, which resolves her remaining doubts about moving away from the Waking Sands in Thanalan. No sooner are they settled when word arrives that a renegade moogle faction has summoned their primal Good King Moggle Mog XII, enabled by the Ascians. After besting the giant moogle, the Warrior of Light encounters a white-robed Ascian named Elidibus who tests the player's might before disappearing. Shortly thereafter, refugees arrive from Doma, a city subjugated by the Garlean Empire, and seek asylum in Ul'dah, which refuses their request. Alphinaud recommends they work as tradesmen and manual labor in the construction of Revenant's Toll. In gratitude, the Doman leader, an Au Ra named Yugiri, accompanies the party to reconnoiter the Sahagin spawning grounds where their primal Leviathan is summoned. The adventurer slays the revived Leviathan using a <b>boatload</b> of corrupted crystals, courtesy of Lominsan warship The Whorleater.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{passengers}} decreased from 12.3 million passengers in 1947 to 4.4 million in 1949, due to passengers switching from SIRT to city-operated buses due to a bus fare cut. On September 5, 1948, 237 of the previous 492 weekday trains were cut; the express service would be reduced during rush hours, and all night trains after 1:29 A. M. would be cancelled. Thirty percent of the company's personnel were laid off. On September 7, 1948, Staten Island Borough President Cornelius Hall continued to rally against the cuts made by the SIRT at a Public Service Commission hearing in Manhattan. Commuters testified that trains were missing connections to ferry boats and that some trains were being held at the Saint George Terminal in the rush hour to wait for two boatloads of passengers. Previously, they said, the trains pulled out with only one <b>boatload</b> of passengers. On September 13, 1948, the SIRT agreed to add four trains, and to extend the schedule of four others. On September 22, 1948, the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the SIRT to abandon the ferry it had operated for 88 years between Tottenville and Perth Amboy, New Jersey; the ferry operation was transferred to Sunrise Ferries, Inc of Elizabeth, New Jersey on October 16.|$|E
25|$|In March the Great Comet of 1811 appeared. During {{the next}} year, {{tensions}} between American colonists and Native Americans rose quickly. Four settlers were murdered on the Missouri River and, in another incident, natives seized a <b>boatload</b> of supplies {{from a group}} of traders. Harrison summoned Tecumseh to Vincennes to explain the actions of his allies. In August 1811, the two leaders met, with Tecumseh assuring Harrison that the Shawnee intended to remain at peace with the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{collective}} {{was established}} and {{became known as}} the Port Royal Experiment: a possible model for black economic activity after slavery. The Experiment attracted support from Northerners like economist Edward Atkinson, who hoped to prove his theory that free labor would be more productive than slave labor. More traditional abolitionists like Maria Weston Chapman also praised Pierce's plan. Civic groups like the American Missionary Association provided enthusiastic assistance. These sympathetic Northerners quickly recruited a <b>boatload</b> (53 chosen from a pool of applicants several times larger) of Ivy League and divinity school graduates who set off for Port Royal on March 3, 1862.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} that during {{the last half of}} the 19th century more of San Francisco's workers enjoyed an eight-hour workday than any other American city. The molders' and boilermakers' strike of 1864 was called in {{opposition}} to a newly formed iron-works employers association which threatened a one thousand dollar a day fine on any employer who granted the strikers' demands and had wired for strikebreakers across the country. The San Francisco Trades Union, the city's first central labor body, sent a delegation to meet a <b>boatload</b> of strikebreakers at Panama and educated them. They arrived in San Francisco as enrolled union members.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the French at Fort Caroline had {{remained}} without {{news of the}} outcome of the attack. But on the reappearance of two of his vessels {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns, Ribault went down the river to learn what had happened. He met on his way out a <b>boatload</b> of men returning from one of the ships, who told him of their encounter with the Spaniards, and informed him that they had seen three of the enemy's ships in the River of Dolphins and two more in the roads, where the Spaniards had disembarked and were fortifying their position.|$|E

25|$|The second ship, Amelia Thompson, arrived off the Taranaki coast on 3 September and sat {{off shore}} {{for five weeks}} because its captain feared Ngamotu's {{reputation}} as a dangerous shipping area. Its 187 passengers were helped ashore by Barrett and his men {{over the course of}} two weeks, each small <b>boatload</b> taking five hours to row from the vessel to the shore. The ship's precious food cargo, including flour and salted meat, was finally brought ashore for New Plymouth's starving residents on 30 September. The loss of its baggage ship, the Regina, which was blown ashore on to a reef, contributed to New Plymouth's reputation as a dangerous area for shipping, discouraging other vessels from berthing.|$|E
25|$|Cooper {{called in}} James Ashmore Creelman (who {{was working on}} the script of The Most Dangerous Game at the time) and the two men worked {{together}} on several drafts under the title The Eighth Wonder. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, notably his <b>boatload</b> of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The 'beauty and the beast' angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from Madison Square Garden to Yankee Stadium and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.|$|E
500|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder and Scully are called in when a <b>boatload</b> of {{survivors}} from a U.S. Navy destroyer escort are found. What particularly catches Agent Mulder's attention {{is that all of}} these sailors appear to have aged many decades {{in the course of a}} few days. Mulder and Scully travel to Norway where they find a civilian fisherman who is willing to take them to the ship's last known position. The title is Norwegian for [...] "dead calm".|$|E
25|$|Iron ore {{from the}} Ogden mile {{was brought to}} Nolan's Point (Lake Hoptcong). In 1880 the canal transported 1,700 <b>boatloads</b> (about 108,000 tons) of iron ore. Thereafter, {{competition}} from taconite ore in the Lake Superior region brought a decline in New Jersey bog iron.|$|R

500|$|After five or {{six hours}} of what Elliot called [...] "delay and irritating evasion", he sent a <b>boatload</b> of people on shore to a distant part of the bay with money to {{purchase}} provisions, which they accomplished, but were then obliged by mandarin authorities to return them. In his report, Elliot wrote that he felt [...] "greatly provoked" [...] upon hearing this and opened fire on the junks in what became the first armed conflict of the First Opium War. According to Adam Elmslie, a young Superintendency clerk who was present, Elliot sent a message at 2 pm, warning the Chinese {{that if they did}} not receive provisions in half an hour, they would sink the junks. When the ultimatum expired with no results, Smith ordered his pinnace to fire, after which Elmslie observed: ...|$|E
500|$|He set {{off again}} and on 1October searching the cliffs of the Carcarañá River found [...] "an {{enormous}} gnawing tooth" [...] {{then in a}} cliff of the Paraná River saw [...] "two great groups of immense bones" [...] which were too soft to collect but a tooth fragment identified them as mastodons. Illness delayed him at [...] Santa Fe, and after seeing the fossilised casing of a huge armadillo embedded in rock, he was puzzled to find a horse tooth in the same rock layer, since horses had been introduced to the continent with European migration. They took a riverboat down the Paraná River to Buenos Aires but became entangled in a revolution as rebels allied to Rosas blockaded the city. The passport helped and with Covington he managed to escape in a <b>boatload</b> of refugees. They rejoined the Beagle at Montevideo.|$|E
500|$|... "Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody's Celebratin')" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single on May 20, 1993 and like the previous single, it was a hit on multiple charts. It reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and number six on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. It sold over 500,000units and the RIAA certified it Gold on October 8, 1993. Allmusic writer Steve Huey stated that the song was [...] "a classic hip-hop single", citing Dr. Dre's production as [...] "impeccable as ever, uniting his signature whiny synth melodies with a halting, descending bass line, a booming snare, and soulful female vocals in the background" [...] and alluded to Snoop Dogg, stating [...] "Attitude was something Snoop had by the <b>boatload,</b> his drawling, laid-back delivery projecting unassailable control – it sounded lazy even though it wasn't, and that helped establish Snoop's don't-give-a-damn persona." [...] The track contains direct insults to rappers East coast rapper Tim Dog, 2 Live Crew member Luke, and Dre's former accomplices Eazy-E & Ice Cube.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November 1934, {{large groups}} of Kisch {{supporters}} gathered in Melbourne and the Strathaird was surrounded by <b>boatloads</b> of Kisch well-wishers.

50|$|In 2003 the Kirishima was {{deployed}} to the Indian Ocean as logistical support for US forces {{engaged in the}} War on Terror.

500|$|After Sony {{canceled}} {{their shared}} universe plans and started sharing the Spider-Man character with Marvel Studios, multiple critics discussed their failure at replicating the MCU. Scott Meslow of The Week noted the perceived flaws {{of the first}} Amazing Spider-Man film, outside of its lead performances, and how the sequel [...] "doubles down on all the missteps of the original while adding a few of its own. …We now have a textbook example of how not to reboot a superhero franchise, and if Sony and Marvel are wise, they'll take virtually all those lessons to heart as they chart Spider-Man's next course." [...] Scott Mendelson noted that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 [...] "was sold as less a sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man than a backdoor pilot for Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six. …Had Sony stuck with the original plan of a scaled-down superhero franchise, one that really was rooted in romantic drama, they would have at least stuck out in a crowded field of superhero franchises. When every superhero film is now going bigger, Amazing Spider-Man could have distinguished itself by going small and intimate." [...] This would have saved Sony [...] "a <b>boatload</b> of money", and potentially reversed the film's relative financial failure.|$|E
2500|$|In 1796, {{the first}} {{hotel in the}} Highlands of Navesink was built and many other hotels were built until the War of 1812.

[...] In addition, {{a number of new}} homes were being built and {{visitors}} were coming to Highlands by the <b>boatload.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A major {{challenge}} for Downer was handling relations with Australia's most important neighbour, Indonesia. [...] Downer negotiated the 2006 Lombok Treaty to put security {{relations between the}} two countries on a stable footing, built bilateral co-operation to fight terrorism, people smuggling and illegal fishing. [...] One of the recent difficulties which erupted between Australia and Indonesia was when Australia accepted a <b>boatload</b> of asylum seekers from Indonesia's Papua province in March 2006.|$|E

50|$|In January 1794 {{the canal}} opened from Marlbrook to Woofferton and seven <b>boatloads</b> of coal were transported from the Mamble collieries {{on the first}} day. Engineering {{difficulties}} delayed the opening of Putnall Tunnel (south of Woofferton) until 1796. By {{the end of that}} year an 18.5 mi stretch of the canal was open between Marlbrook and Leominster and on the first day 14 <b>boatloads</b> of coal arrived in Leominster. Coal from the Mamble collieries was brought down the hill on tramways to Southnet wharf, where it was loaded onto barges and transported to Leominster. For the next 60 years the canal carried coal to Leominster, enabling the Mamble collieries to prosper. However the traffic from Mamble Colliery was not sufficient to run the canal at a profit, so the owners were constantly seeking to extend it eastwards to meet the River Severn, although this never materialised.|$|R
50|$|The first burial in 1812 was in {{the churchyard}} cemetery. Coffins {{were brought to the}} church by the river, with <b>boatloads</b> of mourners joining the funeral {{procession}} as it was rowed along the Hawkesbury.

2500|$|By one account, {{settlers}} were by now [...] "moaning vociferously {{about having}} ever left England. Living was a continual battle to shield {{themselves against the}} elements and their food supplies against termites, insects and hungry animals. Drunkenness was rife among the labourers in a dreary existence with too little to do. Flour supplies had run out again {{and there was no}} likelihood of more until the next <b>boatload</b> of settlers arrived. Te Ati Awa, too were hungry. The co-operative ones had planted more crops than usual, to feed the coming Pakeha, but so many more Europeans had turned up than they expected, that they also were short of food." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1882 free {{transportation}} {{was announced}} for settlers {{to the area}} from Ukraine and free land was offered to settlers. <b>Boatloads</b> of settlers departed from the Ukrainian port of Odessa.
