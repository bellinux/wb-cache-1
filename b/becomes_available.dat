5|$|Three {{types of}} secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its {{corresponding}} extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, <b>becomes</b> <b>available</b> for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten {{pieces of a}} Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting {{a certain number of}} gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it <b>becomes</b> <b>available</b> for play in a bonus level.|$|E

5|$|All {{candidate}} theories {{still have}} major formal and conceptual problems to overcome. They also face the common problem that, as yet, {{there is no}} way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments <b>becomes</b> <b>available.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dataflow {{programming}} languages describe {{systems of}} operations on data streams, and {{the connections between}} the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs <b>becomes</b> <b>available</b> to it.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its status}} an {{international}} language, English is expeditious {{when it comes}} adopting foreign words, and borrows vocabulary from {{a large number of}} other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora, collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published {{before the end of the}} 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data <b>becomes</b> <b>available.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food <b>becomes</b> <b>available.</b> Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in the Ellendale and Georgetown {{areas have}} been {{environmentally}} cleared, which means design and engineering can proceed as funding <b>becomes</b> <b>available.</b> The Federal Highway Administration approved the Ellendale Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2010. DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 on its present alignment through the study area, which runs from south of Redden Road to north of DE 16. Along much of the route, service roads would be constructed parallel to the present highway {{to provide access to}} properties along US 113 and to connect with the local road system and reduce the number of contact points with US 113. Interchanges are planned at Redden Road and DE 16.|$|E

No.76 Squadron has a similar Operations Flight. Most of No. 79 Squadron's exercises with the Navy take place {{off the coast of}} Western Australia, but aircraft are occasionally deployed to Darwin for this task.|$|E

Additionally, the encore song for a particular tier is only made available once its requirements are completed. On the Easy difficulty setting, there are no encores available, but the next tier will be unlocked immediately after completing the required {{songs in the}} previous tier.|$|E
