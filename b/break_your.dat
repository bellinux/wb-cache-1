The footage was edited down to 92 minutes, and the film was released to theaters in 2002. The documentary has received generally positive reviews.|$|E

500|$|Kotche re-wrote {{the drum}} parts for the album almost {{immediately}} upon his acceptance into the band. In one instance, he reworked [...] "I Am Trying to <b>Break</b> <b>Your</b> Heart" [...] by adding parts played on hubcaps, crotales, and floor tiles.

500|$|Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "Its about {{breaking}} a girl's heart, {{but in a}} way that's kinda not on purpose. It's more that I'm just a single guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And sometimes, when you are in that place, you get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about – but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, those girls can end up being heartbroken. So what I'm basically saying is 'I might just <b>break</b> <b>your</b> heart. But I'm only gonna <b>break</b> <b>your</b> heart if you come through this way right now'." [...] Cruz also has called his song [...] "catchy" [...] with a [...] "good melody" [...] and [...] "fun topic", stating that [...] "both girls and guys can get into this character". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cruz elaborated and said the song was partially based on a personal situation, and rather an [...] "exaggeration of an experience".|$|E
500|$|Presley began {{speaking}} to the audience between songs about various different things. During one live performance, he spoke about a movie magazine which said he was [...] "strung out" [...] because of his alleged drug problem, he got angry and said: [...] "Well by God, I'll tell you something, I have never been strung out in my life, except on music [...] [...] [...] If I find the individual who said that about me, I’m going to <b>break</b> <b>your</b> neck, you son-of-a-bitch.

Rolling Stone magazine later described the album as [...] "...one of Coltrane's least innovative records, but impeccably dignified and elegant", and music critic Richard S. Ginell commented {{by saying that}} [...] "Coltrane's eloquence and the warm, masculine baritone of Hartman can still <b>break</b> <b>your</b> heart." [...] Renowned writer and poet Al Young wrote of the album's most well-known recording, [...] "My One and Only Love", and interpretation of the song by Coltrane and Hartman: ...|$|E

This {{comprised}} mainly standards, but also included three original tracks by Herbert and Rutter. Herbert's version of Neil Young's [...] "Only Love Can <b>Break</b> <b>Your</b> Heart", taken from this album, was {{featured on the}} soundtrack of romantic comedy Leap Year, directed by Anand Tucker and starring Amy Adams and Matthew Goode.

500|$|Coomer wasn't {{the only}} band member that struck a nerve with Tweedy during the {{recording}} sessions. Tweedy {{was unhappy with}} the way that Bennett mixed parts of the album, particularly the sequences between songs. Tweedy felt that Bennett was [...] "burning out" [...] while mixing the album, and invited Jim O'Rourke to remix [...] "I Am Trying to <b>Break</b> <b>Your</b> Heart". Although Bennett conceded that O'Rourke did {{a better job of}} mixing the song, animosity arose between the two engineers. O'Rourke continued to remix more songs, and attempted to increase the drama of the album by reducing the contributions by the backing members of Wilco. He removed so many parts on some songs that only music by Tweedy, Kotche, and himself—the three members of Loose Fur—appeared on those pieces.|$|E

500|$|During {{the opening}} {{date of the}} band's March 1976 US tour at the Boston Garden, Moon passed out over his drum kit after two numbers and the show was rescheduled. The next evening Moon {{systematically}} destroyed everything in his hotel room, cut himself doing so and passed out. He was discovered by manager Bill Curbishley, who {{took him to a}} hospital, telling him [...] "I'm gonna get the doctor to get you nice and fit, so you're back within two days. Because I want to <b>break</b> <b>your</b> fucking jaw... You have fucked this band around so many times and I'm not having it any more." [...] Doctors told Curbishley that if he had not intervened, Moon would have bled to death. Marsh suggested that at this point Daltrey and Entwistle seriously considered firing Moon, but decided that doing so would make his life worse.|$|E

The clues combined to reveal a new photograph of the Joker and an audio clip of him from the film saying [...] "And tonight, you're gonna <b>break</b> <b>your</b> one rule."

In his return promotional interview, Big Show threatened to give Rey Mysterio a chokeslam. Professional boxer and WBC Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who was in attendance and a close friend of Mysterio's, came to his aid and confronted Big Show. After Big Show dropped to his knees, Mayweather attacked him with a combination of punches, which caused Big Show to bleed from the nose and mouth. The following night on Raw, Big Show challenged Mayweather to a wrestling match, which Mayweather accepted. As part of the storyline, Big Show arranged an exhibition match with fighter Brandon Hill, who was similar in size and stature to Mayweather. Unimpressed with Show's display of dominance over Hill, Mayweather told Show that [...] "at WrestleMania, I'm going to <b>break</b> <b>your</b> jaw". At their weigh-in for their WrestleMania match, Show threw Mayweather into a crowd of wrestlers to emphasise the disparity in size.|$|E
500|$|Bill Fay {{released}} {{his first two}} albums, Bill Fay (1970) and Time of the Last Persecution (1971), on the Deram Records label. The recordings did not perform well and Fay was dropped from Deram soon {{after the release of}} his second album. After failing to secure another recording contract, Fay took various jobs including fruit picking, working in a factory and in a supermarket. Fay continued to write songs and entered the studio with a group of musicians in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Tapes of the resulting album, Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow, were sent to twelve record companies but the album did not receive a release. In 1998, British record label See for Miles Records re-issued Bill Fay and Time of the Last Persecution on compact disc, reviving interest in Fay's work.

500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the post-apocalyptic world and the survival horror genre gave {{them the opportunity to}} better develop the characters. Taking inspiration from their work on the Uncharted games, the team used their knowledge of paralleling characters with the conflict in both gameplay and stories when developing The Last of Us. They also took inspiration from the books The Road (2006) and City of Thieves (2008), and the film No Country for Old Men (2007), noting that they all include memorable characters and using this as a point of inspiration. [...] "e can make you as a player feel more of what it's truly like to exist inside of a world where every bullet counts and each step you take is a conscious choice that's going to make or <b>break</b> <b>your</b> existence," [...] said Straley.

500|$|Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett {{recorded}} the entire album with Chris Brickley, and agreed with Tweedy that O'Rourke {{would be a}} good choice to mix the album, after a failed attempt by Bennett and Brickley to mix a few of the songs at CRC and after hearing O'Rourke's [...] "audition mix". One of the conflicts, exhibited in the film , was over the ten-second transition between [...] "Ashes of American Flags" [...] and [...] "Heavy Metal Drummer". Bennett attempted to explain to Tweedy that there were several slightly different ways to approach the transition, each of which would yield slightly different results, but Tweedy explained that he just wanted the problem fixed, and was not concerned with understanding the different approaches. Bennett focused on the individual songs, while Tweedy focused on larger conceptual and thematic issues—a tried and true division of labor that had worked well on the four releases on which they co-wrote the material. In order to achieve the band's musical goals, Tweedy invited Jim O'Rourke into the studio to mix [...] "I Am Trying to <b>Break</b> <b>Your</b> Heart" [...] (...) , and the results impressed the band members. O'Rourke was then asked to mix the rest of the album.|$|E
