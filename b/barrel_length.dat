5|$|Despite {{the added}} <b>barrel</b> <b>length,</b> the PS90 is {{relatively}} compact and lightweight, {{with an overall}} length of 667mm (26.3in), and a weight of 3.4kg (7.5lb) with a fully loaded 50-round magazine. Due to the added <b>barrel</b> <b>length,</b> the PS90 can achieve a muzzle velocity of up to 777m/s (2,550ft/s) with SS195LF ammunition, or up to 930m/s (3,050ft/s) with third-party ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the <b>barrel</b> <b>length.</b> On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E
25|$|The Tavor uses a bullpup configuration, {{in which}} the receiver, bolt carrier group and {{magazine}} are placed behind the pistol grip. This shortens the firearm's overall length without sacrificing <b>barrel</b> <b>length.</b> As a result, the Tavor provides carbine overall length, yet can achieve rifle muzzle velocities if equipped with a rifle-length barrel.|$|E

50|$|Whitworth rifles {{were made}} with <b>barrel</b> <b>lengths</b> of 33, 36, and 39 inches, giving the weapon an overall length of 49, 52, and 55 inches respectively. The barrel was {{attached}} to the stock using two or three barrel bands, depending on the <b>barrel's</b> <b>length.</b>|$|R
25|$|While most hunting {{shotguns}} hold between 2 and 5 shells (often 3 shells, {{to comply}} with U.S. regulations for migratory bird hunting), riot shotguns can have a magazine tube {{as long as the}} barrel, allowing for 6 to 10 shells to be loaded depending on the model, <b>barrel</b> <b>length,</b> and type of shells loaded.|$|E
25|$|As with {{previous}} Winchester rifles, a new serial number range was launched with the M1895, beginning with serial number 1. Including military contract rifles, {{a total of}} 425,881 rifles were produced, with production ceasing at serial number 425,132. The standard <b>barrel</b> <b>length</b> varied from 24 to 28 inches, depending on chambering and configuration, and the Standard finish on all rifles was blue.|$|E
25|$|The barrel {{was adapted}} from the 3 inch Gun T9; it had rifling with a uniform right hand twist, with 28 grooves and one turn in 25 inches. <b>Barrel</b> <b>length</b> was 13.16 feet. It was {{combined}} with breech, recoil system and carriage from the 105 mm Howitzer M2. The breech was of horizontal sliding type, manual; the recoil system hydropneumatic. The carriage was of split trail type, equipped with a single equilibrator spring beneath the breech and wheels with pneumatic tires.|$|E
50|$|The X-Series was {{launched}} in 2013. It is a redesign and expansion of SIG Sauer competitive models, consisting of the brand new X-Short (<b>Barrel</b> <b>lengths</b> comparable to the standard P226) and updated versions of both the X-Five and the X-Six. All three <b>barrel</b> <b>lengths</b> are available in Classic, Match and Supermatch configurations. In addition, {{there are a number}} of specialized models available that feature only one or two of the <b>barrel</b> <b>lengths.</b> The line features great interchangeability of parts, along with a wide array of accessories. For instance, sights can be replaced quickly by undoing a screw and some clips.|$|R

25|$|The Type 1 47mm {{anti-tank}} gun was accepted into service in 1942. The design originated as an improvement to the prototype “Experimental Type 97 (1937) 47 mm {{anti-tank gun}}” (試製九七式四十七粍速射砲), which was tested between 1938 and 1939. The prototype weighed 567 kilograms with a <b>barrel</b> <b>length</b> of 2,515mm, a traverse range of ±50 degrees and an elevation range of between minus 10 and plus 20 degrees, and a muzzle velocity of 730m/s. The prototype was not accepted into service {{because it was}} considered to not have sufficient performance.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, 180 Sherman tanks {{received}} {{the even more}} powerful French 105 mm Modèle F1 gun. The <b>barrel</b> <b>length</b> of the gun was reduced from 56 caliber to 44 and equipped with a muzzle brake; ammunition was altered to use a smaller cartridge. In Israel the gun was designated M-51 and the tank the Sherman M-51. M4A1 hulls and the larger T23 turrets (from 76 mm armed Shermans) {{were used for the}} conversion. All tanks were fitted with Cummins diesel engines and HVSS suspension. The tank was displayed to the public for the first time during the Independence Day ceremony in 1965.|$|E
25|$|After {{obtaining the}} tsar's {{signature}} Dubasov and Pavel Tyrtov discussed the configuration with chief executives of state-owned shipyards. The conference agreed to arm the new ships with proven but already obsolescent 12-inch/40-calibre main guns and 8-inch/50-calibre secondary guns that {{had yet to}} be designed and built. Upgrade of the main guns to 50-calibre <b>barrel</b> <b>length</b> was not even considered: Tyrtov {{made it clear that the}} matters of armament are clearly subordinate to keeping displacement within the limit. In March 1903 Tyrtov agreed to remove the forecastle and lower the freeboard, sacrificing seagoing to the displacement constraint. Gun placement was simplified, and became inferior to the Borodino class.|$|E

25|$|The D-10 is a {{high-velocity}} gun of 100mm bore diameter, with a <b>barrel</b> <b>length</b> of 53.5 calibres. Muzzle {{velocity of}} 895m/s gave it good anti-tank performance by late-war standards. Initially it could penetrate about 164mm of steel armor plate at 1,000m range, {{superior to the}} German 75mm KwK 42 mounted on the Panther tank and the Tiger I's 88mm KwK 36 gun. Testing against Panther tanks at Kubinka showed the D-10T could penetrate the Panther's glacis up to 1500 m. This performance grew when APDS and more modern ammunition types were developed after the war. After the war a more effective high-explosive shell was also developed, {{taking advantage of the}} larger 100mm bore.|$|E
25|$|The Type 1 Chi-He's 47mm {{high-velocity}} gun had a <b>barrel</b> <b>length</b> of 2.250 m, a muzzle {{velocity of}} , and a penetration capability of 55mm/100 m, 40mm/500, 30mm/1,000 meters; over {{double that of}} the Type 97s low-velocity main gun. It was more reliable and more accurate, but did require the installation of elevation gear (on the earlier Type 97 the gunner had to physically move the gun up or down on his shoulder). In light of these improvements, the gun was adequate against Allied armor. The ammunition {{was the same as}} used with the anti-tank version of the gun. The tanks carried 120 rounds of ammunition with both armor-piercing and armor-piecing high explosive shells. The gun was placed in a three-man turret, which had space for the commander, gun-layer and loader. The gun could be elevated and depressed between +20 and -15 degrees. This gun was used in the Type 97-Kai Shinhoto Chi-Ha tank, and on the Type 3 Ka-Chi Amphibious Tank.|$|E
25|$|T-55AGM - Ukrainian T-54/T-55 modernization. It {{brings up}} the T-54/T-55 tanks to T-80 standard. It can also be applied to Chinese made Type 59 and Soviet T-62. It is fitted with 5TDFM, {{two-stroke}} liquid-cooled multi-fuel supercharged diesel engine with boxing pistons which develops 850hp (634kW), improved running gear, automated movement control system with a steering handlebar control, additional passive protection, built-in explosive reactive armour, countermeasures system, new fire suppression system with over-ride facilities at the commander's station, automatic loader which holds 18 rounds and anti-aircraft machine gun that can be aimed and fired from within the turret under a complete armour protection. The anti-aircraft machine gun is installed on the commander's cupola and {{is intended to be}} fired at air and ground targets. The buyer can choose between two main armament options: 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun or 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun. Both of them with use of enhanced performance conventional ammunition and barrel-launched ATGM can defeat modern tanks form distance of 2000–3000 m and up to 5,000 m using the ATGM. The tank can carry at least 30 rounds. The 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun weighs 2,5 tonnes, has a <b>barrel</b> <b>length</b> of 6 m (48 calibers) and can fire APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FRAG rounds while 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun weighs 2,63 tonnes, has a <b>barrel</b> <b>length</b> of 6 m (50 calibers) and can fire all types of ammunition that meet the requirements of NATO standards and Ukrainian-made ATGM. Both guns have normal recoil length of 26–30cm and maximum recoil length of 31cm. The tank can be armed with either the KT-7.62 or the PKT-7.62 coaxial machine gun and can carry 3,000 rounds for it. The tank can also be armed with either KT-12.7 or NSVT-12.7 heavy machine gun for AA protection and can carry 450 rounds for it. The approximate successful range is 2km during day and 800 m during night. The AA HMG can be elevated between -5 to +70 degrees. The remote control for anti-aircraft machine gun is stabilized in the vertical axis during automatic mode (by using the TKN-5 sight) and is using the PZU-7 sight for semi-automatic mode.|$|E

25|$|SIG Sauer P210 Legend series: In 2010 SIG Sauer {{introduced}} a new version called the P210 Legend, now manufactured in SIG Sauer's Mastershop facility in Eckernförde, Germany instead of the traditional SIG plant in Neuhausen am Rheinfall, Switzerland. While the general profile of original P210 design was followed for the new gun, SIG Sauer this time around chose to use a button-style, frame magazine catch, an elongated 'beavertail' shaped {{similar to those found}} on 1911 and SIG Sauer Elite pistols, more extensive use of stainless steel, as well update of other features and specifications. Two versions were originally offered at launch: a fixed sight base model and the Target version that comes with an adjustable rear sight. A limited run collector's variant of the basic model was also offered at launch; referred to as the First Edition, this version consisted of a sequentially numbered run to a total number of 210 examples featuring ornate engraving and metal inlay. In 2012, SIG Sauer {{introduced a}} new variant of P210 Legend, called the Super Target, which featured additional modifications such as an extended <b>barrel</b> <b>length</b> to 6 inches, control reconfiguration to a 1911-style thumb safety and wood grips with integral magwell funneling. In 2013 SIG Sauer introduced the Silver series of the P210 Legend, which consists of the existing Legend models finished in silver colored PVD instead of the standard proprietary Nitron finish that is commonly used on SIG Sauer handguns.|$|E
