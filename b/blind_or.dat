5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{informs the}} detectives that Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) {{has been shot}} in the head, and he orders an {{immediate}} investigation. Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) arrive at the hospital to find the doctors working frantically on Thormann; Crosetti, a close friend of Thormann, becomes very emotional. Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> mentally disabled, even if he survives. Crosetti begs Gee to give him the case and, even though Gee believes he is too emotionally involved, he gives in when Crosetti tries to make him feel guilty by showing him his previous gunshot wounds. When an investigation at the crime scene turns up nothing, Lewis catches Crosetti praying with a rosary in the locker room. Crosetti convinces a skeptical Lewis to pray with him for help in the investigation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{minimum and}} maximum buy-in {{at a table}} is usually set in {{relation}} to the big blind. At live games, the minimum buy-in is usually between 20 and 50 big blinds, while the maximum buy-in is usually between 100 and 250 big blinds. Some online cardrooms offer [...] "short stack" [...] tables where the maximum buy-in is 50 big <b>blinds</b> <b>or</b> less and/or [...] "deep stack" [...] tables where the minimum buy-in is 100 big <b>blinds</b> <b>or</b> more.|$|R

25|$|The 1p, 2p, 20p and 50p coins have smooth edges. The 5p, 10p, £1 and £2 coins have milled edges. The milling, in {{combination}} with the non-circular shape of the 20p and 50p, serve as the primary means of identification and differentiation between coinage for <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired people. Historically, milling also served to discourage coin clipping.|$|E

In a trial conducted in the British Medical Journal, 527 consecutive manuscripts were randomized into one of three groups, and each was sent to two reviewers, who were randomized to receive a <b>blinded</b> <b>or</b> an unblinded copy of the manuscript. Review quality was assessed by two editors and the corresponding author. There was no significant difference in assessment between groups or between editors and authors.

25|$|Children who {{are blind}} not only have the {{education}} disadvantage {{of not being able}} to see — they also miss out on fundamental parts of early and advanced education if not provided with the necessary tools. Children who are <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired can begin learning pre-braille skills from a very young age to become fluent braille readers as they get older.|$|E
25|$|Early Braille {{education}} {{is crucial to}} literacy for a <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> low-vision child. A study conducted {{in the state of}} Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well, if not better than their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension. In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44% of the participants who had learned to read in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77% unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print. Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are braille-literate are employed. Among adults who do not know braille, only 33% are employed. Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> low-vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce.|$|E

25|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> blinded-{{experiment}} is {{an experiment}} in which information about the test is masked (kept) from the participant, to reduce or eliminate bias, until after a trial outcome is known. It is understood that bias may be intentional or unconscious, thus no dishonesty is implied by blinding. If both tester and subject are blinded, the trial is called a double-blind experiment.|$|E
25|$|The {{workers of}} army ants are usually <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> can have {{compound}} eyes that {{are reduced to}} a single lens. There are species of army ants where the worker caste may show polymorphism based on physical differences and job allocations; however, there are also species that show no polymorphism at all. The worker caste is usually composed of sterile female worker ants.|$|E
25|$|Although braille {{notation}} {{was designed}} {{for people who are}} <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> visually impaired to read, prior to the introduction of the Perkins Brailler, writing braille was a cumbersome process. Braille writers created braille characters with a stylus and slate (as developed by Louis Braille) or by using one of the complex, expensive, and fragile braille writing machines available at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{many films}} that {{touch on the}} underbelly of Chinese society (see for example, Li Yang's <b>Blind</b> Shaft <b>or</b> <b>Blind</b> Mountain, <b>or</b> Wang Xiaoshuai's Beijing Bicycle), Li Yu's tale of prostitution, blackmail, and rape in modern-day Beijing has been plagued with {{censorship}} problems. The film also found controversy for what some critics described as [...] "thumb-nosing gratuitous sex scenes." [...] After nearly a year of delays, the film was finally banned by Chinese authorities in January 2008.|$|R
50|$|It is too simplistic {{to try to}} {{increase}} energy savings by increasing the size of windows.
