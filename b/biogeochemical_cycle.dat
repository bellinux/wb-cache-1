5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of oxygen gas on Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E

25|$|Death is the {{permanent}} termination of all vital functions or life processes in an organism or cell.

After death, the remains of an organism re-enter the <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>cycle.</b> Organisms may be consumed by a predator or a scavenger and leftover organic material may then be further decomposed by detritivores, organisms that recycle detritus, returning it to the environment for reuse in the food chain.|$|E

Over the years, different dating models and technologies for measuring date sediments and peat profiles accumulated over the last 100–150 years, have been used, including the widely used vertical distribution of 210Pb, the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-SMS), and more recently the initial penetration (IP).|$|E
25|$|However, {{the deep}} sea is {{increasingly}} threatened by humans: most of this deep-ocean frontier lies within Europe's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and has significant potential for the exploitation of biological, energy, and mineral resources. Research and exploration {{over the last two}} decades has shown clear signs of direct and indirect anthropogenic impacts in {{the deep sea}}, resulting from such activities as overfishing, littering and pollution. This raises concerns because deep-sea processes and ecosystems are not only important for the marine web of life, but also fundamentally contribute to the global <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{carbon cycle}} is the <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> by which carbon is {{exchanged}} among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and {{atmosphere of the}} Earth. Carbon is {{the main component of}} biological compounds as well as a major component of many minerals such as limestone. Along with the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle, the carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to make Earth capable of sustaining life. It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere, as well as long-term processes of carbon sequestration to and release from carbon sinks.|$|E

25|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle is the <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> by which nitrogen is converted into various chemical forms as it circulates among the atmosphere, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. The conversion of nitrogen {{can be carried}} out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the {{nitrogen cycle}} include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is nitrogen, making it the largest source of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle.|$|E
2500|$|The oxygen {{cycle is}} the <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> [...] of oxygen within its four main reservoirs: the {{atmosphere}} (air), the total content of biological matter within the biosphere (the global {{sum of all}} ecosystems), the hydrosphere (the combined mass of water found on, under, and {{over the surface of}} planet Earth), and the lithosphere/Earth's crust. [...] The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmosphere and life on earth (see the Great Oxygenation Event).|$|E
50|$|Some may use {{the terms}} <b>biogeo{{chemical}}</b> <b>cycle</b> and geochemical cycle interchangeably because both cycles deal with Earth´s reservoirs. However, a <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> refers to the chemical interactions in surface reservoirs such as the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere whereas a geochemical cycle refers to the chemical interactions that exist in crustal and sub crustal reservoirs such as the deep earth and lithosphere.|$|E

Furthermore, natural <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>cycles</b> in the urban environment can be impeded due to impermeable surfaces that prevent nutrients from returning to the soil, water, and atmosphere.|$|R

Changes in marine <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>cycles</b> and ecosystems due to global change will also have consequences for the broader Earth System. An even greater challenge will be drawing together the natural and social science communities to study some of the key impacts and feedbacks between the marine and human systems.|$|R
