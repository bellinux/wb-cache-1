5000|$|Niebla versiforma [...] is {{distinguished}} by the thallus divided into numerous branches and branchlets entangled {{together into a}} hemispherical or <b>ball</b> like <b>mat,</b> similar to the reindeer lichen, Cladonia rangiferina; the primary branches somewhat ribbon-like with variously widened and narrow twisted parts, bearing crooked spinuliferous branchlets, to 4 cm high and 6 cm across, and further distinguished by containing divaricatic acid, with triterepenes. [...] The species {{appears to be a}} hybrid between Niebla effusa, which differs in having salazinic aicd, and Niebla juncosa var. spinulifera, which differs in having uniformly narrow branches.|$|R

50|$|In 1698 he was {{appointed}} Major-General by the Elector of Brandenburg, {{and at the same}} time received command of about 5000 Brandenburg Hülfstruppen who had acted in the service of the Dutch Republic. In this position he was present at the siege of Bonn and was wounded by a <b>mat</b> <b>ball</b> in the chest. After the taking of Bonn he went to Brabant and took Huy. Nonetheless, his health was severely weakened by so many wounds and shortly after resigned his command.|$|R
50|$|In this Leg's Detour, {{teams had}} to choose between Rask Ball (Fast <b>Ball)</b> or Rask <b>Mat</b> (Fast Food). In Rask Ball, teams {{had to go to the}} Sports Centre of the park and score 10 points in a game of table tennis against a kid. In Rask Mat, teams had to go to the Olympic square of the park where both team member had to finish their plates of dim sum faster against a competitor. For being Handicapped, Kari and Bjørn had to do both Detour choices. In this Leg's Roadblock, one team member had to chop wooden planks using Kung fu.|$|R
5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing <b>ball,</b> Blobs and <b>mat</b> are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Marine tar {{residues}} {{originate from}} natural and anthropogenic oil releases {{into the ocean}} environment and are formed after liquid petroleum is transformed by weathering, sedimentation, and other processes. Tar <b>balls,</b> tar <b>mats,</b> and tar patties are common examples of marine tar residues and can {{range in size from}} millimeters in diameter (tar balls) to several meters in length and width (tar mats). These residues can remain in the ocean envi-ronment indefinitely, decomposing or becoming buried in the sea floor. However, in many cases, they are transported ashore via currents and waves where they pose a concern to coastal recreation activities, the seafood industry and may have negative effects on wildlife. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on marine tar residue formation, transport, degradation, and distribution. Methods of detection and removal of marine tar residues and their possible ecological effects are discussed, in addition to topics of marine tar research that warrant further investigation. Emphasis is placed on ben-thic tar residues, with a focus on the remnants of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in particular, which are still affecting the northern Gulf of Mexico shores years after the leaking submarine well was capped...|$|R
5000|$|Fulham {{hit their}} first win after beating Brentford 1-0 at Griffin Park in the League Cup {{in the first}} {{competitive}} meeting between the sides since 1998. The win gave Fulham momentum for the game against Cardiff City. However, {{on the eve of}} the game, former chairman Mohamed Al Fayed had labelled Magath an [...] "odd man", while also taking a swipe at [...] "absent landlord" [...] Shahid Khan. However, Fulham started brightly: Ross McCormack curled wide a first-time effort, and in the 22nd minute, Parker played the ball wide to McCormack on the left, with the forward's cross glanced across the goalkeeper by Hoogland. McCormack hit a post direct from a corner five minutes later and Emerson Hyndman powered wide as the hosts upped the ante, with the impressive Chris David twice wasting free-kicks from decent positions. The hosts were made to rue a series of missed chances in the 55th minute when Kenwyne Jones shrugged off his man to win a header and collected the return <b>ball</b> from <b>Mats</b> Daelhi to slot home. It finished 1-1, and at the final whistle, there were boos from pockets of Fulham fans.|$|R
50|$|Immunity Challenge: The contestants {{go through}} an {{obstacle}} course that uses elements from past challenges: They first roll a large <b>ball</b> to their <b>mat,</b> then unwind a long piece of cloth wrapped around a pole using their bodies, then rolling it out while heading towards a table. At each table are four bugs to be consumed (a gecko, a scorpion, a chameleon, and a millipede). Once the four bugs are eaten, they then climb up a wall and trudge across a cargo net. They then head for a sand pit and dig for seven blocks indicating {{the days of the}} week in Thai, putting them in order as one goes along. There is also a cheat table in case one forgets the order. Once the order of blocks is correctly arranged, they then race to the flagpoles to raise a flag. First person to raise his/her flag wins a choice between Immunity and a car (a Honda Civic) with the unclaimed prize given to a chosen fellow contestant.|$|R
50|$|Short mat bowls is {{very similar}} to lawn bowls in that the object is for each player, or team, to take turns rolling bowls (<b>balls)</b> down a <b>mat</b> in an attempt to get as many of the bowls as {{possible}} closer to the target (the 'jack') than the opponent. The main difference is {{in the size of the}} playing area and the presence of the block midway down the rink mat. The presence of the block prevents players from knocking their opponents' bowls away from the jack by sheer force; players are required to use the natural bias of the bowls to maneuver around the block. Any bowls that touch the block, or land in the ditch or dead area, are dead and are removed before the next bowl. The skill in playing short mat bowls comes from the bias of the ball and the inconsistent playing surface; both the performance of the rink mat and the floor surface can vary between matches in different venues. A general description of different bowls games, including short mat bowls, is maintained at bowls.org.uk.|$|R
5000|$|The Pit is a {{historic}} part of Morse High School. Built {{in the style of}} a stadium, the room focuses around a relatively small basketball court often used for the Boy's PE class. The Pit is not used for spectator games anymore, as games open to the public have since been moved to the larger Bath Middle School gymnasium. Each year, the school hosts a pep rally in The Pit, where classes compete to win the collective spirit week competition. This includes events such as a pie eating contest, and tug of war. In the four corners of the pit, there are four small hallways leading to stairwells or locker rooms. All but one of these entrances have been converted into storage spaces for <b>mats,</b> <b>balls,</b> etc. The pit is located underneath the Montgomery Theater at the school and students often use the pit as a common room before and after school. The entrance to the school's fall out shelter is also located in one of the entrances to The Pit ...|$|R
50|$|The next Saturday, Oregon State {{traveled}} to the Rose Bowl to play #23 UCLA. The Bruins started off the 2000 season beating #3 Alabama and #3 Michigan. UCLA led at halftime 10-7. In the first half, Oregon State's starting running back, Ken Simonton, reaggravated a nagging groin injury and could {{not return to the}} game. The second half would prove to be an epic battle. Just 52 seconds into the third quarter, Jonathan Smith threw his first interception since the Eastern Washington game. <b>Mat</b> <b>Ball</b> returned the interception for a touchdown and a 17-7 lead. The Beavers responded less than two minutes later with their version of the Immaculate Reception. Smith threw to tight end Martin Maurer over the middle, but UCLA's Marques Anderson knocked the ball out of Maurer's hands. The ball fluttered through the air and wound up in the arms of Oregon State receiver Robert Prescott, who ran in for a 57-yard touchdown pass. The Bruins took a 31-21 fourth quarter lead, but the Beavers swiftly tied the game at 31 with 9:25 left on a four-yard touchdown pass from Smith to Maurer. Oregon State built a 37-31 lead but faced 3rd-and-long inside its own ten-yard line. Disaster struck; Smith fumbled in the end zone and UCLA recovered. However, a penalty flag was on the field. Maurer was called for a touchdown-saving false start, nullifying the play. On 3rd-and-21, Antonio Battle ran for 22 yards on a draw play. Later in the drive, Patrick McCall ran for a 66-yard touchdown with 1:52 left. The Bruins scored to pull within six, 44-38, and recovered the onside kick, but turned the ball over on downs to effectively end the game.|$|R
40|$|In the master’s thesis we {{researched}} {{what kind}} of an opinion pupils of the 3 rd grade have about the Sport as a subject. In the theoretical part we identified the meaning of movement and sport and explained the difference between them. We focused on the importance of the quality of delivery of the Sport as a subject in elementary school and on ensuring safety and a positive class climate in this subject. We touched upon the reason why it is important to implement differentiation and individualization and we provided a few ways by which the teachers are able to adjust the class to different pupils. In addition to the teacher, the parents hold a very important {{role in the development of}} the child’s opinion on sport; therefore we briefly touched upon this as well. We described the type of fears pupils are faced with in sports and proposed ways these fears could be overcome. Finally, in the last chapter we explained the issue of excusing pupils from sports activity and provided some suggestions on how pupils, who have medical conditions and are thus enable to be as active as their peers, can be more included in class. In the empirical part, we obtained results from 245 pupils, which in the school year 2014 / 2015 attend 3 rd grades in various elementary schools in the Gorenjska and Ljubljanska region. We wanted to know whether the Sport as a subject is popular amongst the pupils; whether the pupils are aware of its importance and classify it amongst three most important subjects for life; and which sports and forms of activity they prefer and which they dislike. We were also interested to find out, which factors the pupils are bothered by and what they would prefer to do most, if they were able to choose themselves. The results show the Sport as a subject is one of the most popular school subjects amongst students, who are also aware of its importance as they classified it as one of the top three most important school subjects for life. In addition to sports, the pupils favourite subjects are Arts, Math and Music, whereas the subjects rated as most life-important are Math, Natural and Social Science and Slovene. In regards to the type of sports, the pupils are most excited about the team game dodgeball. In addition to this, basketball and football are also popular with the boys, whereas gymnastics is popular with the girls. On the other hand, the least preferred type of activity was testing for sport educational personal file and Krpan badge. When asked about what they like in Sport as a subject, the majority answered they prefer to choose what type of activity they wish to do. They also enjoy sports day, field trip and obstacle field as a learning technique. The least important factors according to the pupils were having a lot of <b>mats,</b> <b>balls</b> and a lot of different props. In regards to types of sports, the least favourite amongst boys are dancing and gymnastics, whereas girls prefer football and handball the least. Most boys and girls, however also said they dislike measuring a skin fold. The factors which the pupils were most bothered by are the teacher getting angry with them, classmates screaming, being mocked and laughed at, being punished by the teacher and having their sports class canceled when they are not behaving well. If the pupils were able to pick for themselves what they would prefer to do, they would mostly prefer to play various games. For other popular activities they also chose gymnastics, football, basketball, dance, volleyball and running. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{hope you}} {{excuse me for}} {{starting}} my exposition telling you a little story. My purpose is not being witty, because maybe most of you do not see anything funny at all in it; at best, quite the reverse: I {{want to give the}} best example, which is not always easy, of the reality of our profession. A reality we keep facing despite the passage of time. A few months ago, I was visiting a relative with my wife and my son in a rest home belonging {{to one of the most}} famous names of geriatric services today. In the lobby, decorated like a hotel, we were received by the girl at the desk, who was very kind and wore the unavoidable white coat. That was the moment my son took up to shake off my hand and our vigilance. He had found a room which had strongly caught his attention; of course, he ran to it. Once on the inside, he started to manipulate the familiar objects filling that big room. On the table, there was a dominoes of animals (of a famous toys brand) which was by chance like the one he had been given as a present; a puzzle with images from the latest Disney film; plastic cubes and little balls of very vivid colours, blue, red, yellow, green, and a very strange sphere whith a metallic net and containing small spheres with numbers inscribed. The big sphere rotated and ejected the small ones when pressing a button. Excited, he pointed on the wall the sheets to be coloured. Some of them were about butterflies, little ducks, fish, flowers, Bamby, Donald, the duck and the chubby face of an Indian baby with a feather. He also put his attention into a corner full of <b>mats,</b> <b>balls,</b> rings, ropes and coloured rolling-pins. I guess Diego was amazed, maybe surprised by the fact of having been driven by us to such an amusing place without previous notice (as usual). So that, he needed to express his discovery: “Look mummy, it's a school!”. Then, his comment made me laugh ironically, with a bitter face, hardly raising my lip. I remembered the picture of the new costume of the Emperor. Diego, who is not easily cheated by words—in this case, because he could not read the explanatory labels: T. O. R (on the puzzles and the dominoes), gerontogymnastics (near the rings and the balls), and especially a label over the entry door reading: Occupational Therapy. As I said, the child could not read nor perceive more than the bare reality: a kind of school. At that moment I better understood why the relative we were visiting repeatedly refused to go to Occupational Therapy; why he did not listen to my reccomendations, and why he liked better chatting with his friends at the garden, drinking a coffee or, when the pain and the sick feeling permitting, playing dominoes or going to the nearest park to play pétanque. I am afraid the story I am telling you is not an isolated fact in the practise of our profession. Furthermore, I would dare to say, without concrete data and relying on my experience (limited as everyone's), that it is more a standard than an exception. If what I suppose is true—and I hope it isn't so!—I think It is necessary to wonder: would you like to go to a similar place when being elder?; how would you feel colouring sheets with little ducks or throwing a red ball while repeating your name?; what can mean seeing yourself doing these things? and what about being watched by the rest of the people meanwhile?; Does a label give more sense to it?; what's its use?We can also wonder some other questions, these ones for experienced therapists. For instance: what kind of occupation is done there?; which is their personal, cultural or social meaning?; does stringing counting balls or mounting plastic cubes have any purpose?; Wouldn't be better playing dominoes or chess, even simplifying the game instead of playing with a children game to recover we don't know which capacities that the passage of time or the age tends to damage irremediably?. And what is more: Does the fact of improving coordination, attention or memory necessarily implies looking after the person?; Does occupying in any way mean making Occupational Therapy?; Could the prescription of children's activities be a counter-indication for health?; Does making something therapeutic necessarily imply making Occupational Therapy?Definitely, I think at this point we must keep wondering about what we do as Occupational Therapists, which is our scope of study, what do we pursue with our intervention [...] . in short, what do we call Occupational Therapy...|$|R
