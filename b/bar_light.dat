25|$|A small {{laboratory}} {{was built}} near the power house in mid-1896. Trials were begun with {{several types of}} filter, but none were particularly effective, although they were better than land filtration. The old river bed soon became full of sludge, and the Corporation purchased a boat, so that the sludge could be dumped at sea. The Joseph Thompson was built in Barrow in Furness {{at a cost of}} £24,837, and made its first voyage in December 1897. Loading of the sludge took around 45 minutes, the journey down the Ship Canal took six and a half hours, and the sludge was discharged near the Mersey <b>Bar</b> <b>Light</b> in five minutes.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1974, the Rivers Department and the Rivers Committee {{ceased to}} exist, when {{responsibility}} for the works passed from Manchester City Council to the newly formed North West Water Authority. The Authority built a new control room in 1981, which housed a computer control system for the site. Three years later, eight new sludge digesters were built, to enable all sludge dumped at sea to be digested first. Construction of the Mersey Valley Regional Sludge Pipeline began, linking Oldham to Davyhulme, and continuing to Sandon Dock in Liverpool. Davyhulme was able to treat sludge {{from a number of}} other sewage works to the east, and pump the digested product to Liverpool. Sludge boats ceased to use the ship canal, taking 15 minutes to transport sludge from Liverpool to a point {{to the north of the}} <b>Bar</b> <b>Light</b> in the Mersey, instead of over six hours required when using the canal.|$|E
500|$|Previously, {{leadership}} of the 261st Battalion alternated between Hoang, a South Vietnamese revolutionary who had returned from North Vietnam after 1954, and Tu Khue, who {{was a native of}} North Vietnam. Khue was unpopular among the battalion's soldiers because he was known to be very strict and demanding. However, he was very careful about details. In contrast, Hoang was far more relaxed and commanded a high degree of confidence from the soldiers of the 261st Battalion. Thus, due to his strong leadership skills and popularity, Hoang was selected to take command of Viet Cong forces for operations in Ap Bac. Most of the soldiers under Hoang's command were equipped with captured US weaponry, such as the M1 carbine, <b>BAR</b> <b>light</b> machine guns, [...]30 caliber machine guns, and a single 60mm mortar.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes a {{lighthouse}} {{needs to be}} constructed in the water itself. [...] Wave-washed lighthouses are masonry structures constructed to withstand water impact, such as Eddystone Lighthouse in Britain and the St. George Reef Light off California. [...] In shallower bays, Screw-pile lighthouse ironwork structures are screwed into the seabed and a low wooden structure is placed above the open framework, such as Thomas Point Shoal Lighthouse. As screw piles can be disrupted by ice, steel caisson lighthouses such as Orient Point Light are used in cold climates. [...] Orient Long Beach <b>Bar</b> <b>Light</b> (Bug Light) {{is a blend of}} a screw pile light that was converted to a caisson light because of the threat of ice damage.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of lights has allowed competitors {{to switch from}} HIDs to a viable LED technology. Rigid Industries was the first LED company to win the Baja 1000 in 2012 with BJ Baldwin. LED <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> are <b>lighter</b> & smaller, creating less drag and better aerodynamics. The tougher housing and lack of filament make them much more robust.|$|R
50|$|During Gay Pride 2008 one {{phase of}} the power failed in the club leaving limited disco {{lighting}} in operation and no music playing for about 20 minutes. Staff at the club managed to bring most of the power back on-line, however several sets of disco <b>lights</b> and <b>bar</b> <b>lights</b> were non-functional {{on one of the}} clubs busiest nights of the year. The power failure was caused by a failure of the main supply to the building.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the initial}} {{controller}} version the <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> was a permanently illuminated bright colored light. The potential for light pollution in darkened playing rooms, {{as well as}} an interest in extending battery life led to inquiries as whether the <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> could be switched off by users when not required in game; Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida initially responded in the negative (July 2013), though videogame developers had the option to disable the light in game.
