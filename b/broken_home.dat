25|$|The series {{centers on}} Ryan Atwood, a troubled but tough {{young man from}} a <b>broken</b> <b>home</b> who is adopted by the wealthy and philanthropic Sandy and Kirsten Cohen. Ryan and his foster brother Seth, a {{socially}} awkward yet quick-witted teenager, deal with life as outsiders in the high-class world of Newport Beach. Ryan and Seth spend much time navigating their relationships with girl-next-door Marissa Cooper, Seth's childhood crush Summer Roberts, and the fast-talking loner Taylor Townsend. Storylines deal with the culture clash between the idealistic Cohen family and the shallow, materialistic, and closed-minded community in which they reside. The series includes elements of postmodernism, and functions as a mixture of melodrama and comedy.|$|E
25|$|John David Duty {{was born}} on April 25, 1952, to Charles Houston Duty and Mildred Duty Hall. Duty stated {{that he had been}} raised in a <b>broken</b> <b>home,</b> his mother having {{remarried}} twice. His family included two brothers, a sister, a half-brother, and a half-sister. For some time, Duty went by the name of John David Hall; there had been some confusion over the identity of his biological father as his mother had married O.H. Hall at Atoka, Oklahoma in 1950, but his birth certificate listed Duty as his surname. According to Duty, he lost an eye due to an accident in the third grade and suffered a head injury from a collapsed brick wall; the latter incident led him to be hospitalized for scarlet fever. Duty's mother died from an illness in Altus, Oklahoma at the age of 46 on August 24, 1973.|$|E
40|$|Criminologists have {{frequently}} identified <b>broken</b> <b>homes</b> as {{a risk factor}} for involvement in crime and delinquency. The association between <b>broken</b> <b>homes</b> and antisocial behavior has been replicated in numerous studies, and despite being entrenched within the study of delinquency, {{there is a lack of}} research examining its impact on the development of self-control. This is somewhat surprising given that low self-control has been shown to be a robust and consistent predictor of antisocial behavior. We address this void in the literature by examining the role of <b>broken</b> <b>homes</b> in the development of self-control in early childhood using propensity score matching. Analysis of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study revealed a statistically significant association between <b>broken</b> <b>homes</b> and the development of self-control prior to matching. After matching on six key maternal and paternal covariates, the association between <b>broken</b> <b>homes</b> and levels of self-control was no longer statistically significant. We discuss what these findings mean for criminological theories. ...|$|R

Kylie is characterised through her [...] "full on personality" [...] and has a feisty attitude. She has often been described as a [...] "gobby female" [...] who wants a better life and ultimately she is driven by money. Kylie has a son, Max (Harry McDermott), who was placed into foster care. She had the child at a young age and she was not ready for the responsibility. Becky helps Kylie retrieve custody of Max. In one of her first big storyline arcs, Kylie sells her son to Becky for Â£20,000. The storyline was branded controversial by media outlets and Lane found it hard to compress her emotions whilst filming the plot. Lane said Kylie's sheer audacity was highlighted when she dared to blackmail her barren sister for more cash.|$|E
500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a <b>broken</b> <b>home</b> or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{was born}} (with his twin sister Cassandra) in San Diego, California, to 19-year-old Sandy Williams and her husband, 18-year-old Errick Williams. He was born inside of Jack Murphy Stadium, also {{referred}} to as [...] "the Murph" [...] by San Diegans. Growing up middle class, his parents divorced in 1983 and Williams, at the age of five, was taking care of his sisters by putting them to bed and even cooking for them. Perhaps due to his <b>broken</b> <b>home</b> and the fact that his father was gone at such an early age, Williams suffered from anger issues that eventually led his mother to send him to counseling. He also struggled academically, despite a test he took as a six-year-old which revealed that he had the intelligence of someone twice his age. Williams himself once said, [...] "I was always very bright, but not necessarily a hard worker. I think I was in eighth grade when I became really focused as a student and started getting good grades." [...] By high school Williams was an honor roll student and was named to the San Diego Union-Tribune All-Academic team.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the often}} {{political}} and cultural contours of blackness in the United States, the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States, because, as she put it, he displayed [...] "almost every trope of blackness". Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president, noting, [...] "Mr Clinton, according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is our first black President, the first {{to come from the}} <b>broken</b> <b>home,</b> the alcoholic mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems. Thus, we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism, but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms: broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits and (presumable from the rest of [...] Miller's senescent musings) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same." [...] Some black activists were also offended, claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before, while not serving black interests. They cite the lack of action during the Rwandan Genocide and his welfare reform, which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s. Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration.|$|E

60|$|All earthly and {{material}} {{things should be}} worn out with use, and not preserved against decay by any unnatural artifice. Even when broken and disabled from overuse they {{have a kind of}} respectability which must commend itself to the observer, and which partakes of the pensive grace of ruin. An old table with one leg gone, and slowly lapsing to decay in the woodshed, is the emblem of a fitter order than the same table, with all its legs intact, stored {{with the rest of the}} furniture from a <b>broken</b> <b>home.</b> Spinning-wheels gathering dust in the garret of a house that is itself falling to pieces have a dignity that deserts them when they are dragged from their refuge, and furbished up with ribbons and a tuft of fresh tow, and made to serve the hollow occasions of bric-a-brac, as they were a few years ago. A pitcher broken at the fountain, or a battered kettle on a rubbish heap, is a venerable object, but not crockery and copper-ware stored in the possibility of future need. However carefully handed down from one generation to another, the old objects have a forlorn incongruity in their successive surroundings which appeals to the compassion rather than the veneration of the witness.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 75 - 77) A {{sample of}} 308 {{high school students}} were utilized to measure role attitudes towards marriage for their future husband or wife and to observe if there were differences in the attitudes of adolescents from intact homes versus adolescents from <b>broken</b> <b>homes.</b> A questionnaire was compiled from related literature and the measurement instruments, which were given to these students. The sample was drawn from high school students at El Camino High School and Simi Valley High School. The hypotheses were derived from the theory of family sociologist Bernard Farber (1964) who suggested {{that the nature of}} parent-child interaction in the American family was changing in relation to their attitudes towards various aspects of the familial institution. Further, he theorized that the nature of such interaction between parents and children is crucial in the stability or change within the family. The hypotheses of this study were: I. Are there significant differences in the effects of sex, and intact versus <b>broken</b> <b>homes</b> upon adolescent attitudes towards the institution of marriage and the family. Specifically, the attitudes of: a. wanting to marry b. age anticipate marrying c. length adolescent knows prospective mate d. wanting children e. how many children II. Are there significant differences in the effects of sex, and intact versus <b>broken</b> <b>homes</b> upon adolescent views of the qualities they desire in a prospective mate. Specifically, views towards: a. congruence of religion b. congruence of race c. educational expectations d. financial expectations III. What effects do sex differences, and intact versus <b>broken</b> <b>homes</b> have upon how adolescents view their own prospective families with respect to traditional versus egalitarian marital roles.
