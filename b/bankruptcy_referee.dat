50|$|However, {{those actions}} were not taken. The Arbitration court of Rostov Oblast {{appointed}} Alexander Stepanov the external manager (<b>bankruptcy</b> <b>referee)</b> of Atommash OJSC. At the time, Stepanov was First Vice President (and, since 1996, CEO) of Energomashcorporatsiya (EMK) JSC, a direct competitor of Atommash. Stepanov's appointment was actively lobbied by Tatiana Gramotenko, the Chief agent for bankruptcy proceedings in Rostov Oblast. Several Founders of EMK JSC were direct competitors of Atommash OJSC, {{which was a}} violation of the Russian antitrust law. The audit conducted by the Audit Chamber of Russian Federation showed that in a matter of one year EMK, controlled by its CEO Stepanov (at the same time the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>referee</b> of Atommash OJSC), managed to buy 10.8% share in Atommash OJSC and more than 40% of its debt, which, according to the competition law, clearly poses a conflict of interest.|$|E

He was re-appointed in 1900 by Judge Christian Cecil Kohlsaat, and held this position until his death.|$|E
5000|$|A Referee in Bankruptcy or <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>Referee</b> was {{a federal}} {{official}} with quasi-judicial powers, appointed by a United States district court to administer bankruptcy proceedings, prior to 1979.

50|$|In the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 Congress {{enacted the}} current U.S. Bankruptcy Code, {{abolished}} {{the office of}} <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>referee</b> and established bankruptcy judgeships to serve separate bankruptcy courts in each judicial district.

50|$|After {{his service}} as state senator ended in 1922, Cazort {{returned}} to his law practice in Little Rock.

After he left the lieutenant governorship for the final time, he was from 1937 to 1962 a <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>referee</b> for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Cazort died in a Little Rock hospital in 1969 and is interred there at Oakland Cemetery.|$|E
5000|$|The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 {{established}} {{the position of}} <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>referee</b> [...] "to assist in expeditiously transacting the bankruptcy business". The act specified that referees were to be appointed by the district court for a term of two years, although they could {{be removed from office}} or have their jurisdiction over a particular case revoked at any time. The courts could appoint the referees in such numbers [...] "as may be necessary". The fees paid by petitioners in bankruptcy proceedings were used to compensate the referees.|$|E

50|$|According to the Plan of the <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>referee</b> of Atommash OJSC Alexander Stepanov, a {{new company}} called EMK-Atommash JSC was created (Protocol №3 of the Meeting of {{creditors}} of Atommash OJSC of 22.11.1996). The new company had two founders: Atommash OJSC (85,7% of charter capital) and Stepanov's EMK (14,3%). In January 1997, 70% of the assets of Atommash were transferred to EMK-Atommash JSC. Atommash OJSC contributed its liquid assets (fixed assets, current assets, intangible assets) and production assets to the charter capital of EMK-Atommash JSC. Illiquid assets (construction in progress, industrial sites, railways, etc.) remained on the balance sheet of Atommash OJSC. After that, EMK-Atommash JSC stock was transferred to EMK JSC.|$|E
50|$|As spring {{training}} {{drew to a}} close, Pilot players and management were unsure whether to report to Seattle or Milwaukee to begin the 1970 season. At the bankruptcy hearing, Milkes testified {{there was not enough}} money to pay the coaches, players and office staff. Had Milkes been more than 10 days late in paying the players, they would have all become free agents and left Seattle without a team for the 1970 season. With this in mind, Federal <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>Referee</b> Sidney Volinn declared the Pilots bankrupt on April 1—six days before Opening Day—clearing the way for them to move to Milwaukee. The team's equipment had been sitting in Provo, Utah with the drivers awaiting word on whether to drive toward Seattle or Milwaukee.|$|E

50|$|The {{creditors}} of Experimenter Publishing and the Consrad Company reviewed bids at a March 28 {{hearing before}} the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>referee.</b> Two publishers, B. A. MacKinnon and Macfadden Publications, entered similar bids that would almost pay the creditors in full. After these two complete bids were read, Chester Cuthell then offered $60,000 for the radio stations. The MacKinnon offer was revised to allow the separate sale of the stations, Macfadden {{wanted to keep the}} stations. Motion Picture Publications offered $50,000 cash for Amazing Stories. Fawcett Publishing offered $30,000 cash for Science and Invention. The Robert McBride Company offered $300,000 for Science and Invention and Amazing Stories. The hearing was adjourned for a week to allow the creditor's committee to evaluate the bids.|$|E
50|$|The Investigative Committee of Russian Ministry of the Interior instituted {{criminal}} proceedings against Alexander Stepanov, {{the owner of}} Energomash Corporation and former <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>Referee</b> of Atommash OJSC. Stepanov is charged with fraud with a commercial loan issued by Sberbank {{in the amount of}} 12.7 billion rubles (nearly USD $413 million). Criminal prosecution against Alexander Stepanov was triggered by a personal Statement from German Gref, the CEO & President of Sberbank. After the investigation, the case was transferred to a Presnensky court of Moscow (Case №1-149 / 2012, art.30 p. 3, art.159 p. 4 of the Criminal Code of Russia - large-scale fraud and attempted crime). Charges in fraudulent bankruptcy of Atommash OJSC, however, were not brought in this criminal case.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Stepanov, now the CEO of [...] "Energomashinostroitelnaya corporatsiya" [...] JSC and at {{the same}} time the <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>referee</b> of Atommash OJSC, wrote a letter on 05.05.1997 to the First Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy Lev Ryabev, assuring that he had {{understood}} the concern of MinAtom about the financial state of Atommash, and therefore suggested to work together to support EMK-Atommash JSC, his new company. In this letter Stepanov tried to convince MinAtom that there was no reason for worries, since the production facilities of Atommash were preserved, technological routines for manufacturing of core production were uninterrupted, and the establishment of EMK-Atommash JSC would not lead to restraint of competition. According to Stepanov's letter, the fact of trading liquid assets of Atommash OJSC for EMK-Atommash JSC stock would give the nearly bankrupt company a chance for a settlement with creditors. At the same time Stepanov, head of both companies, positions liquid assets which Atommash OJSC contributed to the charter capital of EMK-Atommash JSC as long-term investments.|$|E
50|$|After {{a winter}} and spring full of court action, the Pilots {{reported}} for spring training under new manager Dave Bristol unsure of where they would play.

50|$|On July 2, 1923, the Federal Grand Jury {{released}} {{four more}} indictments in the Fuller case, with {{the charges and}} names kept secret. It was revealed the indictments were linked with the seizure of documents from the baggage of William Frank McGee's ex-wife Nellie Shechan McGee several days earlier. On July 26, 1923, the bankruptcy hearing in the Fuller case was being held at 217 Broadway {{at the office of}} <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>referee</b> Harold P. Coffin. That day there was a conflict between Coffin and Foley's counsel Edward E. McCall, when a reference to William R. Hearst was ordered stricken from the record. McCall mentioned in proceedings that Hearst had offered money to McGee's ex-wife in Europe, asking her to return to New York. When she had asked Foley what it was about, he had theorized to her that Hearst had wanted to obtain press materials for his newspapers from her. McCall objected strongly to Coffin's choice to strike the statement from the record, with Coffin in turn threatening to force McCall to leave the proceedings.|$|E
5000|$|Walter Howey — who, {{before heading}} Trade Publications, {{had been the}} {{founding}} {{managing editor of the}} New York Daily Mirror — left Trade Publications to again become the managing editor of the Mirror on August 1, 1928.

Instead, the Brewers were stuck using old Pilots' uniforms, with the team name replaced. One legacy of the Brewers' roots in Seattle is that their colors are still blue and gold, although the shades have been darker since 2000.|$|E
