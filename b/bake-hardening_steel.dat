40|$|A biaxial {{tensile test}} has been {{designed}} for the experimental determination of yield locus points of thin steel sheets. Using texture-based anisotropic finite-element simulations, the geometry of the test sample has been optimized. A detailed accuracy analysis is presented {{and the range of}} accuracy of the new specimen is derived. Experimental tests have been carried out on a ultra-low carbon and a <b>bake-hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> Both the yield stresses and the ratios of plastic strains have been compared to the theoretical predictions obtained with the Taylor-Bishop-Hill model using the experimentally-determined crystallographic textures. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the effect}} of soaking {{temperature}} during continuous annealing on mechanical property of high-tensile cold rolled <b>bake-hardening</b> <b>steel</b> was studied by using hot-dip process simulator. The results show that it can finish re-crystallization process when the soaking temperature increased from 740 ˚C to 850 ˚C. As the temperature increased, the yield strength, tension strength and microhardness monotone decreased and the n value monotone increased by contrast. At the same time, the total elongation and r value of BH steel increased {{at the beginning and}} decreased later, they would all reached a peak value at about 820 ˚C...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a FEA-based tool design optimisation for a clinching process with an open multiple-part die. The studied materials are the <b>bake-hardening</b> <b>steel</b> CR 240 BH (1. 5 [*]mm) on the punch side and the die-cast aluminium alloy AlSi 10 MnMg (2. 95 [*]mm) on the die side. The objective of the optimisation was to minimise probability of cracks that appear at the outer circumference of {{the bottom of the}} clinch joint in AlSi 10 MnMg. In the framework of the optimisation, it was possible to minimise crack probability by varying geometrical parameters of the tools though at the cost of slightly worse but still tolerable geometrical parameters of the clinch joint...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{physically}} based {{model for}} <b>bake-hardening</b> (BH) <b>steels</b> is developed suitable {{to predict the}} BH {{as well as the}} macroscopic behavior of strain-aged steels in tensile tests, such as the lower yield stress and the yield point elongation or Lüders strain. A description of the strain aging kinetics is given by considering two aging steps: Cottrell atmospheres formation and precipitation of coherent carbides. The modeling includes the effect of solute carbon content, aging time, temperature, and prestrain. Then, a numerical approach of Lüders phenomenon using finite element (FE) method codes is conducted. The strain aging model is eventually coupled with the previous numerical study thanks to a local mechanical behavior that schematically describes the local dislocation behavior. Simulations of tensile tests are performed and agree well with experiments carried out on aluminum-killed (AlK) and ULC BH steels, in terms of lower yield stress and yield point elongation. Effects of aging treatment, grain size, and strain rate on the macroscopic behavior are particularly enlightened...|$|R
