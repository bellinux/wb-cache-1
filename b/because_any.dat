5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} not wish the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, <b>because</b> <b>any</b> sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. Sarah was kept in all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711. This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.|$|E
5|$|Astatine is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol At and atomic number 85. It is the rarest naturally occurring {{element in the}} Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, <b>because</b> <b>any</b> macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that swaraj {{not only can}} be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military is unnecessary, <b>because</b> <b>any</b> aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.|$|E

5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} {{considered}} to be renewable <b>because</b> <b>any</b> projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content. The Earth has an internal heat content of 1031joules (3·1015TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption. About 20% of this is residual heat from planetary accretion, and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past. Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic timescales. Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{was sold}} to Gordon Strachan's Coventry City for a club record {{transfer}} fee of £5,000,001 (the unusual figure was <b>because</b> <b>any</b> offer exceeding £5 million would trigger an escape clause in his West Brom contract) in August 2001. His wages at Highfield Road were reported to be £15,000 a week. Hughes scored 14 goals in 40 games, including a hat-trick in a 6–1 win at Crewe Alexandra, and finished the 2001–02 season as the club's top-scorer. Coventry rejected a loan offer from West Bromwich Albion in March 2002, and ended the season outside the play-offs.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February, two {{divisions}} of the Japanese Twenty Fifth Army, led by Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita, landed on the northwestern coast of Singapore, in the Sarimbun area. Yamashita's headquarters (HQ) was in the Sultan of Johor's palace on Istana Bukit Serene, which offered him and his officers a bird's eye view of virtually every key target in the northern sector of Singapore Island, only 1.6 kilometres (one mile) across the Straits of Johor. Sultan Ibrahim's palace was not fired upon by the British <b>because</b> <b>any</b> damage caused would have extensive repercussions for British-Johor ties.|$|E

5|$|The {{efficacy}} of chemical pesticides tends to diminish over time. This is <b>because</b> <b>any</b> organism that manages {{to survive the}} initial application will pass on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed. In this way, {{some of the most}} serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} rows of this table are straightforward. The {{homotopy}} groups πi(S0) of the 0-dimensional sphere are trivial for i > 0, <b>because</b> <b>any</b> base point preserving map from an i-sphere to a 0-sphere is a one-point mapping. Similarly, the homotopy groups πi(S1) of the 1-sphere are trivial for i > 1, because the universal covering space, R, which has the same higher homotopy groups, is contractible.|$|E
5|$|Wang tiles are squares {{coloured}} on each edge, {{and placed}} so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles {{have the same}} colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known <b>because</b> <b>any</b> Turing machine can be represented {{as a set of}} Wang dominoes that tile the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.|$|E

5|$|Around 25–33% {{of white}} dwarfs have metal lines in their spectra, which is notable <b>because</b> <b>any</b> heavy {{elements}} in a white dwarf should sink into the star's interior in just {{a small fraction of}} the star's lifetime. The prevailing explanation for metal-rich white dwarfs is that they have recently accreted rocky planetesimals. The bulk composition of the accreted object can be measured from the strengths of the metal lines. For example, a 2015 study of the white dwarf Ton 345 concluded that its metal abundances were consistent with those of a differentiated, rocky planet whose mantle had been eroded by the host star's wind during its asymptotic giant branch phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{degenerate}} matter {{that makes up}} the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low opacity, <b>because</b> <b>any</b> absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state, which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence radiative heat transfer within a white dwarf is low; it does, however, have a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 107K. An outer shell of non-{{degenerate matter}} cools from approximately 107K to 104K. This matter radiates roughly as a black body. A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to radiate at about 107K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell.|$|E
5|$|With Ujung Kulon as {{the last}} resort of this species, all the Javan rhinos are in one location, an {{advantage}} over the Sumatran rhino which is dispersed in different, unconnected areas. However, this may also be disadvantageous to the Javan rhino population, <b>because</b> <b>any</b> catastrophic diseases or tsunamis could wipe them all out at once. Poaching for their horns is no longer as serious a threat as in the past, due to stricter international regulations on rhino horn, active protection efforts by local authorities, the rhinos' elusiveness and Ujung Kulon's remoteness. However, there are still obstacles to the species recovery. In 2012, the Asian Rhino Project was working out the best eradication programme for the arenga palm, which was blanketing the park and crowding out the rhinos' food sources. The banteng cattle also compete with the rhinos for food, so the authorities were considering plans to fence off {{the western part of}} the park to keep the livestock out.|$|E

In addition, 75% of homes were damaged in Puerto San Carlos, and power was lost in many areas including Comondú and Loreto. In the town of Puerto Lopez Mateos, half of the cannery buildings were destroyed and every wood home was destroyed, thus leaving {{a quarter of the}} population homeless. Nearby, the storm nearly destroyed two isolated villages, Punta Abreojos village and Laguna San Ignacio. Both areas got hit by Jimena at its first landfall. Although in Bahia Asuncion damages was minor, the villages of Abreojos and San Ignacio Lagoon were badly damaged. Seventy percent of the electric network form Santa Rosalía to Ciuadad Constitución was damaged due to power outages. In both of the towns, the Mexican Red Cross branches received some damage. The roads from San José del Cabo to Tijuana was affected <b>because</b> <b>any</b> nearby creeks overflowed their banks. The airports in Los Cabos, La Paz and Loreto and ports were briefly closed, but were later re-opened after the storm passed since the airports received only minimal damage.|$|E

This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.|$|R
