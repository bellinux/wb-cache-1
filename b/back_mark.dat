25|$|Two {{field goals}} by Rafael Septién, a {{touchdown}} run by Robert Newhouse, and Thurman's 39-yard touchdown return gave the Cowboys a 20–7 lead by halftime.

The Bears took the ensuing kickoff and drove to the Giants 27, but on fourth and 12, coach Mike Ditka decided against attempting a field goal in the 13mph winds. On Chicago's conversion attempt, Anderson caught a pass from Tomczak, but was stuffed after a short gain.

25|$|Besieged Maryland {{head coach}} Joe Krivak, with a 17–25 record, led his Terps (5–5) to a sold-out Scott Stadium in Charlottesville for their final regular season game.

Then {{freshman}} reserve running <b>back</b> <b>Mark</b> Mason put the Terps {{back in the}} game with a 59-yard touchdown breakaway, and a team best run for the year. Maryland quarterback Scott Zolak threw for two more touchdowns and Mason scored the go-ahead with an 8-yard rush to put the Terps ahead 35–30. With the win, Maryland secured a bowl berth {{for the first time since}} Bobby Ross left four seasons prior.

500|$|Despite earlier predictions, Warren was not {{selected}} in the draft. [...] He signed as an undrafted free agent with the New York Jets immediately after the draft. [...] Warren's godfather, former Pro Bowl defensive <b>back</b> <b>Mark</b> Carrier, is an assistant coach with the Jets. The 2010 New York Jets have several cornerbacks on their roster, including Darrelle Revis, Antonio Cromartie, Dwight Lowery, Drew Coleman, Marquice Cole and first-round pick Kyle Wilson. Some sources speculate that Warren would be converted to safety. Jets head coach Rex Ryan said that although Warren would be practicing at both cornerback and safety, he felt that Warren's best shot was at safety. Warren, who was sidelined {{during most of the}} Jets training camp sessions with a concussion, was waived by New York on September 3, 2010. Warren would be signed to the team's practice squad on September 6, 2010. Warren would later be released from the team's practice squad on September 7, 2010.|$|E
500|$|After winning five {{of their}} first six games, the Gamecocks {{proceeded}} to lose four of their next five. [...] Against No.2 Alabama, eventual Heisman Trophy-winning running <b>back</b> <b>Mark</b> Ingram ran for a then-career record 246 yards and a touchdown; South Carolina lost 20–6. The defeat dropped the Gamecocks to No.23 in the AP and Coaches' polls, {{and out of the}} Harris poll altogether; in the first BCS standings released that week, the Gamecocks were ranked 24th. [...] South Carolina came back to beat Vanderbilt 14–10; the Gamecocks rose to No.21 in all three polls, and No.22 in the following week's BCS standings. The next game, against Tennessee, was never close; South Carolina fell behind 21–0 early in the second quarter and lost 31–13. [...] The loss caused the Gamecocks to fall out of all three polls as well as the BCS standings. [...] South Carolina then faced Arkansas, who scored 23 unanswered points on their way to delivering the Gamecocks a 33–16 loss. [...] The following game was against No.1 Florida, who was undefeated. [...] South Carolina was within three points of Florida as the fourth quarter began, but Garcia was subsequently sacked four times and intercepted twice; Florida won 24–14. [...] The Gamecocks' record fell to 6–5 overall, 3–5 within the SEC.|$|E
500|$|There {{were few}} {{clear-cut}} chances {{at the start}} of the second half, but Plymouth Argyle were winning the midfield battle with Mauge and Chris Leadbitter leading by example with a number of forceful tackles. [...] The pivotal moment arrived on 65 minutes after Martin Barlow had earnt a corner-kick on the right-hand side. Leadbitter played the ball short to full <b>back</b> <b>Mark</b> Patterson, whose well-measured cross was met firmly by the unmarked Mauge to head into the back of the net. Darlington tried to force their way back into the match, but were being thwarted by Plymouth Argyle captain Michael Heathcote and his defensive colleagues which left strikers Robbie Blake and Robbie Painter, who both scored in the semi-finals, with little to work on. As Darlington committed more players forward in search of an equaliser they left themselves exposed in defence which gave the leading side more space to launch counter-attacks. Evans and Littlejohn threatened to score the decisive second goal, but in the end Mauge's headed finish midway through the second half proved to be enough to claim the final promotion place for the team from Devon. The match was by no means a classic, with serious goalscoring chances at a premium, but to the winners it didn't matter.|$|E
