5|$|Starting {{the late}} 19th century, {{uncontrolled}} crossbreeding created {{a decline in}} the population of purebred Mérens. By the early 20th century, some breeders in L'Hospitalet and Mérens-les-Vals began to work against these crossings with outside breeds and bred only horses with conformation similar to the original Mérens. These breeders wanted to keep alive the traditional Mérens, which they valued for its hardiness and versatility. In 1908, control of breeding was given to the President of the Société d’Agriculture de l’Ariège (Agricultural Society of Ariege), Gabriel Lamarque, who was dedicated to the preservation of the breed. In 1933, the Syndicat d'élevage du Mérens (<b>Breeding</b> <b>Society</b> of Mérens) was created, and in 1948 the first stud book was created {{under the control of the}} French National Stud.|$|E

This is when the importance of the performance test is clearest. The stallions and elite mares are scored on their interior qualities: temperament, character, constitution, and willingness to work, as well as rideability. Therefore, within the Oldenburg Verband, breeders have the tools to choose the route of high-performance horse, or one more suitable for the amateur rider.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the interface between}} scientific knowledge of commercial sheep farming and local communities of practice. Through combining socio-cultural and cognitive theories of learning, we applied a concept of community of practice to analysing {{the importance of the}} local Goat and Sheep Society for family-based sheep farming in Lyngen after the Second World War. A point of departure for this investigation was the extraordinary results in national rankings and competitions by some of these Lyngen sheep farmers. This paper empirically documents the dynamic, multi-faceted interaction between "barn floor" breeding practices and national-level breeding science. We thoroughly analysed this domain of knowledge as a practice-driven process that involves a particular configuration of practitioners, including newcomers and old-timers, households, local sheep breeding societies and national scientific knowledge institutions. Based on this notion of a community of practice, the relations between masters and apprentices are given particular attention. One particular characteristic of this community of practice is the institutional enmeshment between the local Goat and Sheep <b>Breeding</b> <b>Society</b> and the local Læstadian congregations. We argue that certain focal normative notions of the family and of the order of creation (Norwegian skaperordning) to care for the creation and to survive (Norwegian å berges) provide the motivational force to these knowledge innovations...|$|E
50|$|Free jumping or loose jumping is the {{practice}} of jumping a horse without a rider. It is often conducted in a chute and is used most often to evaluate the jumping ability of horses too young to jump under saddle. The correlations between free jumping and eventual success in show jumping competition {{have been the subject}} of several studies. Free jumping is used as a diagnostic tool by most warmblood <b>breeding</b> <b>societies</b> to evaluate jumping prowess in breeding stock. This practice is used to build a horse's confidence over jumps without a rider's interference, to evaluate a horses jumping ability, or to showcase a horse that is for sale. This training method is used in a variety of ways, both professionally and recreationally. Free jumping is also done competitively, primarily with younger horses that are not old enough for a rider or just beginning their jumping career.|$|R
40|$|In primitively eusocial and cooperatively <b>breeding</b> <b>societies,</b> {{there is}} {{substantial}} individual variation in helping effort that is not accounted for by variation in genetic relatedness. In primitively eusocial wasps, helpers have a significant chance of inheriting breeding positions. Recent models suggest that because helpers with greater expected future fitness have more to lose, they should invest less in rearing the dominant's offspring. Observations and experiments on the paper wasp Polistes dominulus and the hover wasp Liostenogaster flavolineata support this prediction: helpers nearer {{to the front of}} the queue to inherit dominance, and helpers that stand to inherit larger, more productive groups, work less hard. These findings support the view that variation in social traits is best understood from a life-history perspective. Group augmentation effects, where greater helping effort leads to direct benefits through increased group size, seem less important in wasps. Further studies are required to understand how conflicts over helping effort are resolved in social wasps...|$|R
40|$|In many cooperatively <b>breeding</b> <b>societies,</b> helping effort varies greatly among group members, {{raising the}} {{question}} of why dominant individuals tolerate lazy subordinates. In groups of carrion crows Corvus corone corone, helpers at the nest increase breeders' reproductive success, but chick provisioning is unevenly distributed among non-breeders, with a gradient that ranges from individuals that work as much as the breeders to others that completely refrain from visiting the nest. Here we show that lazy non-breeders represent an insurance workforce that fully compensates for a reduction in the provisioning effort of another group member, avoiding a decrease in reproductive success. When we temporarily impaired a carer, decreasing its nest attendance, the laziest non-breeders increased their provisioning rate and individuals that initially refrained from visiting the nest started helping. Breeders, in contrast, did not increase chick provisioning. This shows that lazy non-breeders can buffer a sudden unfavourable circumstance and suggests that group stability relies on the potential contribution of group members in addition to their current effort...|$|R
40|$|In the 19 th century Boka Kotorska, {{sericulture}} - silk-worm {{breeding and}} processing -was highly developed. Based on unpublished arhivalia from the Montenegro National Archives, - Records Department of Herceg Novi - and on published {{materials from the}} Historic Archives of Kotor and the Historic Archives of Zadar, along with the related literature, the paper deals with the silk-worm breeding, scope of silk production, operation of spinner mills, planting and cultivation of mulberry trees, whose leaves were used for silk-worm feeding. The Austrian authorities, ranging from the Zadar Regency and the Kotor County Hall, with local councils, through the Silk-Worm <b>Breeding</b> <b>Society</b> and the Bay of Kotor Economy Association, were actively engaged in developing the silk production and enhancing the quality of this economic activity. According {{to what has been}} said, it appears that silk-worm breeding was practiced in both rural and urban settlements of the entire Boka Kotorska Bay. The silk-worm breeding entailed the planting of mulberry trees which survived even after the silk-worm breeding had ceased to exist, as mulberry fruit was used to feed pigs and poultry, to make brandy, and because the wood - mulberry lumber - was highly valued in ship building. Mulberry trees were grown in urban settlements as they provided a reliable shade. The silk-worm breeding was discontinued towards and during World War One, whereas the mulberry tree planting persisted until World War Two...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{interactions}} between individuals in socially living animals select for {{the evolution of}} signals that convey information identifying individuals or categories of individuals, which may enable the discrimination of familiar versus unfamiliar individuals. Such information may help animals maximize their inclusive fitness by adjusting their own behaviour, allowing them to avoid conflict, preferentially direct help and/or ignore unreliable individuals. Acoustic signals in birds provide the potential to encode individual-specific information. We examined the degree to which individual identity, sex, breeding status, group membership and genetic relatedness were related to variability in six different call types, which occurred across a variety of different behavioural contexts in the apostlebird, Struthidea cinerea, a socially living and cooperatively breeding Australian passerine. We demonstrated that not all calls reflected the same extent of information. Of the six call types, call variation was related to individual identity in three call types, breeding status in two call types and sex and group relatedness in one call type. Finally, variation in two call types was not related to any of the measured variables. Our results suggest that some, but not all, acoustic signals in apostlebirds may be selected for individual distinctiveness between individuals and categories of individuals (male versus female, breeder versus nonbreeder), and these signals may be important in determining levels of cooperation and interaction between individuals in this cooperatively <b>breeding</b> <b>society.</b> © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|E
50|$|Following his {{political}} career, Stevenson began another {{career as an}} agriculturalist and stock breeder. In 1843, Stevenson established Appleyard, a farm near Greencastle. While Stevenson first bred merino sheep, he began breeding shorthorn cattle in 1845, and his work with this breed brought him significant success. In 1853, Stevenson visited England to inspect and buy shorthorn cattle for his farm; {{he was the first}} breeder to import cattle from England to Indiana. He was appointed to an unofficial State Board of Agriculture in 1847, and when the board became an official state body in 1851, he was one of its founding members. Stevenson served on the Indiana State Board of Agriculture until 1859, excepting 1855 and 1856, and was the board's president for three years. While on the board, Stevenson helped found the Indiana State Fair to promote agricultural development and collaboration. Stevenson also served as a leader for private <b>breeding</b> <b>societies,</b> as he was named president the Indiana Shorthorn Breeders Association after organizing the Indiana Shorthorn Breeders Convention in 1872.

5000|$|After World War II, {{the mare}} {{population}} in 1950 was near 10,000; 11 years later, this number fell by over a third. In that decade, farmers {{had abandoned the}} breeding of horses, and the State Stud of Traventhal was dissolved. Instead of allowing the agricultural horses to die out as a breed, the Board of Directors of the breeders' federation purchased 30 Holsteiner stallions and three Thoroughbreds and completely reshaped the breeding direction. [...] Former state stallions were now owned by the breeders' association, a completely unique arrangement among German warmblood <b>breeding</b> <b>societies.</b> To accomplish the updating of the Holsteiner, several Thoroughbred and French stallions were imported. By 1976, most of the top Holsteiner stallions were Thoroughbred or half-Thoroughbred. The new style Holsteiners were more agile, quicker, taller, and had better jumping technique. These changes have been especially important over the 15 to 20 years, as riding sport has left the realm of male professionals and soldiers, and become dominated by women and girls who ride as a leisure activity. To {{meet the needs of}} this new market, today's Holsteiners have been made more rideable, more beautiful, and more refined.|$|R

40|$|Conflict over {{reproduction}} is an inherent part of group living. In many social vertebrates, conflict may be reflected as allostatic load, or {{the costs of}} social status and dominance rank, which may be quantified by measuring glucocorticoid stress hormones. Here, we develop the first quantitative model of allostatic load based on the tug‐of‐war model of reproductive skew to generate insights into the mechanisms underlying reproductive conflict in cooperative breeders and to determine whether glucocorticoids {{can be used to}} assess conflict levels in group‐living vertebrates. It predicts that subordinates have higher allostatic loads than dominants under most conditions, but when body condition is lower in dominants than in subordinates, dominants experience higher allostatic load. Group structure is also important, as dominants generally have higher allostatic loads than subordinates when there is a large number of subordinates in the group, but this cost can be reduced by increasing the number of dominants, as in plural <b>breeding</b> <b>societies.</b> Using glucocorticoid data from cooperatively breeding superb starlings Lamprotornis superbus, we found empirical support for both predictions. Our model is useful for understanding how the costs of social status influence reproductive sharing, and it suggests that glucocorticoids can be used to examine reproductive conflict and cooperation in social species...|$|R

40|$|Cooperative <b>breeding</b> <b>societies</b> are {{characterized}} by alloparental care and unequal distribution of reproduction (skewed reproduction). Competition for resources among group members may determine the reproductive outcome of each individual. In a spider colony, females feed together on prey and therefore may compete over the extraction of specific nutrients required for reproduction. Here we examined the occurrence of skewed reproduction in colonies of the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola (Eresidae) in nature and asked whether competition over specific limiting nutrients is a mechanism leading to unequal distribution of reproduction. We determined the nutritional composition of breeding and nonbreeding females in natural colonies. By supplementing field colonies with prey rich in either proteins or lipids, we examined {{the effect of these}} nutrients on female breeding potential. We then determined which nutrients were extracted from prey by breeding and nonbreeding females in a noncompetitive setting. About 40 % of the females in natural colonies are potential breeders. Field colonies supplemented with lipid-rich prey had a higher percentage of breeding females than colonies supplemented with protein-rich prey. Furthermore, when feeding alone, nonbreeding females extracted more lipids relative to protein than breeding females. We suggest that lipids are critical for maturation and ovarian development and that competition for lipids determines the skewed reproduction observed in colonies of S. dumicola.

40|$|Journal ArticleLife-history theory {{assumes that}} {{reproduction}} entails a cost, {{and research on}} cooperatively <b>breeding</b> <b>societies</b> suggests that the cooperative sharing of workloads can reduce this cost. However, the physiological mechanisms that underpin both the costs of reproduction {{and the benefits of}} cooperation remain poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that reproductive costs may arise in part from oxidative stress, as reproductive investment may elevate exposure to reactive oxygen species, compromising survival and future reproduction and accelerating senescence. However, experimental evidence of oxidative costs of reproduction in the wild remains scarce. Here, we use a clutch-removal experiment to investigate the oxidative costs of reproduction in a wild cooperatively breeding bird, the white-browed sparrow weaver, Plocepasser mahali. Our results reveal costs of reproduction that are dependent on group size: relative to individuals in groups whose eggs were experimentally removed, individuals in groups that raised offspring experienced an associated cost (elevated oxidative damage and reduced body mass), but only if they were in small groups containing fewer or no helpers. Furthermore, during nestling provisioning, individuals that provisioned at higher rates showed greater within-individual declines in body mass and antioxidant protection. Our results provide rare experimental evidence that reproduction can negatively impact both oxidative status and body mass in the wild, and suggest that these costs can be mitigated in cooperative societies by the presence of additional helpers. These findings have implications for our understanding of the energetic and oxidative costs of reproduction, and the benefits of cooperation in animal societies...|$|R
50|$|Known {{in written}} sources since the 6-7th centuries, the Žemaitukas became famous as an {{excellent}} war horse during the Northern Crusades. During the centuries, the breed {{was influenced by}} Tatar, Russian, light Polish, and other horses. Once widespread, the breed went almost extinct three times. In the 19th century, new agricultural machinery required taller and stronger horses. Therefore the horses were crossed with the Trakehners, Arabians, and draft horses threatening survival of pure breed Žemaitukas. The breed was saved by the Ogiński family, who established Žemaitukas <b>breeding</b> <b>societies</b> in Raseiniai, Plungė, and Rietavas between 1881 and 1890. The Ogińskis popularized the breed and exhibited it at the Paris International Agricultural Show in 1900 where the horses won two gold and one silver medals. At the end of World War II, the Germans took all Žemaitukas horses from the Gruzdžiai stud farm. A single stud was found in 1958 in Užventis.

A new challenge was presented by the dissolution of the Soviet Union and rapid de-collectivization in 1990. Horses, that belonged to the kolkhozes (collective farms), were distributed to private owners who often showed little interest in the survival of the breed. In 1994, only 30 adult individuals remained. However, the Vilnius State Stud Farm preserved its horses and remains the major breading center. As of 2010, it had 98 Žemaitukas horses.|$|R
