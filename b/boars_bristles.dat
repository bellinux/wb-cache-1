50|$|<b>Boar</b> <b>bristles</b> are {{available}} cheaply from many sources. Brushes made in China or India with <b>boar</b> <b>bristle</b> are supplied wholesale, while even the cheapest wholesale Badger brush costs at least $10; even the cost difference between badger brushes with resin handles vs. expensive horn handles shows that, except with exotic {{materials such as}} sterling silver, special woods, ivory, bone or custom materials, badger hair is the costliest element of a brush. It is common for boar-hair brushes to have part of the bristles dyed to resemble badger hair.|$|R

40|$|Synopsis An {{automated}} {{robotic system}} for protein streak seeding is described, which uses novel silicon microtools {{in place of}} the commonly used <b>boar</b> <b>bristles.</b> Abstract This report presents a new approach to streak seeding based on custom-designed silicon microtools. Experimental data shows that the microtools produce similar results to the commonly-used <b>boar</b> <b>bristles.</b> One advantage to using silicon is that it is rigid and can easily serve as an accurately calibrated end-effector on a microrobotic system. Additionally, the fabrication technology allows for the production of microtools of various shapes and sizes. A working prototype of an automatic streak seeding system based on these microtools was built and successfully applied for protein crystallization...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} a traditional shoe involves up to 72 individual processes, {{the most important of}} which is the stitching. This is performed using a needle made from a <b>boar</b> <b>bristle,</b> rather than a manufactured steel needle, due to the need for flexibility.|$|R
50|$|The {{historical}} dictum {{to brush}} hair with one hundred strokes {{every day is}} somewhat archaic, dating from a time when hair was washed less frequently; the brushstrokes would spread the scalp's natural oils down through the hair, creating a protective effect. Now, however, this does not apply when the natural oils have been washed off by frequent shampoos. Also, hairbrushes are now usually made with rigid plastic bristles instead of the natural <b>boar's</b> <b>bristles</b> that were once standard; the plastic bristles {{increase the likelihood of}} actually injuring the scalp and hair with excessively vigorous brushing. However, traditional brushes with <b>boar's</b> <b>bristles</b> are still commonly used among African Americans and those with coarse or kinky textures to soften and lay down curls and waves.|$|R
50|$|Wild boar hunting (vanatoarea la mistret) (Sus scrofa) is {{the most}} common big game sport in Romania; wild boar is often used for meat as well as for trophies (conventionally the male tusks only, but also {{shoulder}} mounts, female tusks, silver hat pins with <b>boar</b> <b>bristles</b> or hair or even skins and rugs).|$|R

50|$|Boar's {{hair brushes}} are {{relatively}} inexpensive, {{but can be}} of very high quality. A well-made boar brush will break in with use; the bristles begin to split at their tips, resulting in a brush that is very soft but has considerable backbone. Unlike badger hair and synthetic fibers, <b>boar</b> <b>bristles</b> absorb water, so the brush should be soaked before use.|$|R

50|$|Body {{brush or}} Soft brush: A soft-bristled brush removes finer {{particles}} and dust, adds a shine to the coat and is soothing to the horse. A body brush, particularly a smaller design called a Face brush, {{can be used}} on the head, being careful to avoid the horses eyes. Some natural body brushes are made of horsehair, goat hair or <b>boar</b> <b>bristles,</b> like human hairbrushes, others are made of soft synthetic fibers.

5000|$|In {{spite of}} {{occasional}} claims to that effect, Skowroneck's instruments were re-interpretations according to historical building principles rather than scrupulously faithful reproductions of historical originals. Skowroneck described his philosophy like this: [...] "More successful making a literal copy, and authentic {{in a higher}} meaning, would be a new instrument in which the maker expresses himself, fulfilling his task with all his knowledge, and supported by his judgment instead of given measurements."Skowroneck built harpsichords, clavichords, spinets and virginals after English, Italian, early (Ruckers) and late Flemish (Dulcken), 17th- and 18th-century French, and German models. Some of the materials used are considered by some as archaic, such as <b>boar's</b> <b>bristles</b> and bird feathers. Starting in 1991 he built altogether three fortepianos, and he continued to build recorders as well as transverse flutes until late in life. Skowroneck also restored old instruments to playing condition.|$|R

50|$|The first bristle {{toothbrush}} {{resembling the}} modern one {{was found in}} China. Used during the Tang Dynasty (619-907), it consisted of hog bristles. The bristles were sourced from hogs living in Siberia and northern China because the colder temperatures provided firmer bristles. They were attached to a handle manufactured from bamboo or bone, forming a toothbrush. In 1223, Japanese Zen master Dōgen Kigen recorded on Shōbōgenzō that he saw monks in China clean their teeth with brushes made of horsetail hairs attached to an oxbone handle. The bristle toothbrush spread to Europe, brought from China to Europe by travellers. It was adopted in Europe during the 17th century. The earliest identified {{use of the word}} toothbrush in English was in the autobiography of Anthony Wood who wrote in 1690 that he had bought a toothbrush from J. Barret. Europeans found the hog bristle toothbrushes imported from China too firm and preferred softer bristle toothbrushes made from horsehair.

The improved design had a bone handle with holes bored into it for the Siberian <b>boar</b> hair <b>bristles.</b> Unfortunately, animal bristle was not an ideal material as it retained bacteria, did not desiccate efficiently and the bristles were often extricated from their intended fixed insertions. In addition to bone, handles were made of wood or ivory. In the United States, brushing teeth did not become routine until after World War II, when American soldiers had to clean their teeth daily.|$|R

50|$|Hunter-gods were venerated {{among the}} Continental Celts, {{and they often}} {{seem to have had}} an {{ambivalent}} role as protector both of the hunter and the prey, not unlike the functions of Diana and Artemis in classical mythology. From Gaul, the armed deer-hunter depicted on an image from the temple of Le Donon in the Vosges lays his hands in benediction on the antlers of his stag companion. The hunter-god from Le Touget in Gers carries a hare tenderly in his arms. Arduinna, the eponymous boar-goddess of the Ardennes, rides her ferocious quarry, knife in hand, whilst the boar-god of Euffigneix in the Haute-Marne is portrayed with the motif of a <b>boar</b> with <b>bristles</b> erect, striding along his torso, which implies conflation between the human animal perception of divinity. Arawn of Welsh mythology may represent the remnants of a similar hunter-god of the forests of Dyfed. Additionally, in Welsh mythology the hunting of a sacred stag often leads the hunters into the Otherworld.|$|R
50|$|Shaving soap {{in a cup}} is {{traditionally}} lathered and applied using a rotating in-and-out motion of a shaving brush, usually made of <b>boar</b> or badger <b>bristles.</b> The shave is completed using as few strokes as possible, stropping sparingly if at all. A second shave with another razor in an alternate direction against the beard yields an extremely close shave. Rinsing with cold water constricts minor abrasions or cuts, followed by patting dry (not rubbing) and an astringent or aftershave lotion. More serious nicks can be attended with direct pressure for perhaps a minute with a styptic pencil, or with an application of a household astringent such as witch hazel. A light steady touch is most effective at providing a close shave, preserving the edge and avoiding cuts.|$|R
60|$|Biddy {{spoke of}} his {{disappointment}} almost with commiseration, for she was evidently inclined this morning to a fresh and kindly view of things. Nick could share her feeling but so far as was permitted by a recognition merely general of what his brother must have looked for. It might have been snipe and {{it might have been}} <b>bristling</b> <b>boars.</b> Biddy was indeed brief at first about everything, {{in spite of all the}} weeks that had gone since their last meeting; for he quickly enough saw she had something behind--something that made her gay and that she wanted to come to quickly. He was vaguely vexed at her being, fresh from Broadwood, so gay as that; for--it was impossible to shut one's eyes to the fact--what had practically come to pass in regard to that rural retreat was exactly what he had desired to avert. All winter, while it had been taken for granted his mother and sisters were doing what he wished, they had been doing precisely what he hated. He held Biddy perhaps least responsible, and there was no one he could exclusively blame. He washed his hands of the matter and succeeded fairly well, for the most part, in forgetting he was not pleased. Julia herself in truth appeared to have been the most active member of the little group united to make light of his decencies. There had been a formal restitution of Broadwood, but the three ladies were there more than ever, with the slight difference that they were mainly there with its mistress. Mahomet had declined to go any more to the mountain, so the mountain had virtually come to Mahomet.|$|R
60|$|My {{deer and}} hound are {{properly}} {{related to the}} deer and hound that flicker {{in and out of}} the various tellings of the Arthurian legends, leading different knights upon adventures, and to the hounds and to the hornless deer at the beginning of, I think, all tellings of Oisin's journey to the country of the young. The hound is certainly related to the Hounds of Annwvyn or of Hades, who are white, and have red ears, and were heard, and are, perhaps, still heard by Welsh peasants following some flying thing in the night winds; and is probably related to the hounds that Irish country people believe will awake and seize the souls of the dead if you lament them too loudly or too soon, and to the hound the son of Setanta killed, on what was certainly, in the first form of the tale, a visit to the Celtic Hades. An old woman told a friend and myself that she saw what she thought were white birds, flying over an enchanted place, but found, when she got near, that they had dog's heads; and I do not doubt that my hound and these dog-headed birds are of the same family. I got my hound and deer out of a last century Gaelic poem about Oisin's journey to the country of the young. After the hunting of the hornless deer, that leads him to the seashore, and while he is riding over the sea with Niam, he sees amid the waters--I have not the Gaelic poem by me, and describe it from memory--a young man following a girl who has a golden apple, and afterwards a hound with one red ear following a deer with no horns. This hound and this deer seem plain images of the desire of man 'which is for the woman,' and 'the desire of the woman which is for the desire of the man,' and of all desires that are as these. I have read them in this way in 'The Wanderings of Usheen' or Oisin, and have made my lover sigh because he has seen in their faces 'the immortal desire of immortals.' A solar mythologist would perhaps say that the girl with the golden apple was once the winter, or night, carrying the sun away, and the deer without horns, like the <b>boar</b> without <b>bristles,</b> darkness flying the light. He would certainly, I think, say that when Cuchullain, whom Professor Rhys calls a solar hero, hunted the enchanted deer of Slieve Fuadh, because the battle fury was still on him, he was the sun pursuing clouds, or cold, or darkness. I have understood them in this sense in 'Hanrahan laments because of his wandering,' and made Hanrahan long for the day when they, fragments of ancestral darkness, will overthrow the world. The desire of the woman, the flying darkness, it is all one! The image--a cross, a man preaching in the wilderness, a dancing Salome, a lily in a girl's hand, a flame leaping, a globe with wings, a pale sunset over still waters--is an eternal act; but our understandings are temporal and understand but a little at a time.|$|R
