40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the cooling conditions undergone by an ingot during <b>direct-chill</b> (DC) <b>casting,</b> thermocouples were immersed in the liquid pool and consequently entrapped in the solid, thus monitoring {{the temperature of the}} metal during its descent. Assuming steady-state thermal conditions, the time-dependent temperatures measured by these thermocouples were then converted into spacedependent temperature profiles. These values were the input of a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inverse method described by Rappaz et al., [1] which has been adapted in this case to steady-state thermal conditions. This MAP method permits the deduction of the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of the alloy, initially, and then of the highly nonuniform heat-flux distribution along the ingot rolling faces, in a second step. The obtained values are in good agreement with literature and clearly reflect the widely different boundary conditions associated with primary cooling (contact with the mold) and secondary cooling (water jet).

40|$|The {{increased}} demand for aluminum as a primary structural metal stems from a quest in automotive, aerospace, and marine industries to be more energy efficient and sustainable. This unprecedented demand drives aluminum casting methods towards increased productivity looking to, cast larger ingots faster.

Rolling slab ingots of AlCu 4. 5 using a typical <b>Direct-Chill</b> <b>casting</b> technique have been cast and sectioned for analysis. This alloy allowed us to compare our results with the available literature and to elucidate the marked differences in spatial variation of microstructure and composition found in radial and lateral symmetry castings. In an attempt to couple conventional theory with our results, sump and temperature profiles were measured in-situ and modeled using a commercial finite element analysis software package.

40|$|This {{review paper}} {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} recent studies on different mechanisms of macrosegregation upon <b>direct-chill</b> (DC) <b>casting</b> of aluminium alloys.

With the advances in computer simulations and in experimental techniques it becomes possible to look at the impact of individual mechanisms in relation to the macroscopic parameters of the transition region of a DC cast billet and to the microscopic parameters of billet structure.

40|$|There is {{interest}} in modelling the industrially important intermetallic phase transformation of Al 6 (Fe,Mn) to a-Al-(Fe,Mn) -Si that occurs during homogenisation of <b>direct-chill</b> <b>cast</b> ingots of 3 XXX aluminium alloy. The kinetics of this " 6 -to-a" transformation are studied {{to aid the}} modelling. The initial investigation uses an Al- 0. 5 Fe- 1. 0 Mn- 0. 2 Si (wt. %) alloy. The morphology of the transformation and the associated local composition changes are studied using a range of electron optical techniques, including energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (TEM), convergent-beam electron diffraction and field-emission-gun scanning electron microscopy. The transformation proceeds by eutectoid decomposition of the Al 6 (Fe,Mn) phase into a-phase and aluminium solid solution. The transformation requires intake of silicon from the surrounding matrix, which we believe is supplied along the migrating transformation front. This gives a eutectoid growth rate that is comparatively fast; hence nucleation {{is found to be}} the key rate-controlling factor. Intake of manganese is not required for transformation, but does occur on continued annealing. The morphology of transformed particles is not static: eutectoid aluminium coalesces and ripens into "Al-spots", and wetting of Al 6 (Fe,Mn) /a-phase interfaces by the matrix may ultimately lead to fragmentation of two-phase particles. Roll-bonded diffusion couples permit the study of 6 -to-a nucleation by steadily increasing the silicon content in an Al-Fe-Mn alloy (initially containing only Al 6 (Fe,Mn) particles). Nucleation is found to be sporadic. Results also indicate that the transformation preferentially nucleates at boundaries in the matrix - this is confirmed by TEM studies. If there is insufficient eutectoid nucleation, transformation is by the dissolution of Al 6 (Fe,Mn) supplying solute for the growth of a-phase. However, preliminary diffusion studies using silicon-coated alloy blocks indicate that a typical ingot microstructure gives sufficient 6 -to-a nucleation for the alloy to achieve equilibrium levels of a-phase eutectoidally.

40|$|Homogenization heat {{treatment}} of as-cast billets {{is an important}} step in the processing of aluminum extrusions. Microstructural evolution during homogenization involves elimination of the eutectic morphology by spheroidisation of the interdendritic phases, minimization of the microsegregation across the grains through diffusion, dissolution of the low-melting phases, which enhances the surface finish of the extrusions, and precipitation of nano-sized dispersoids (for Cr-, Zr-, Mn-, Sc-containing alloys), which inhibit grain boundary motion to prevent recrystallization. Post-homogenization cooling reprecipitates some of the phases, changing the flow stress required for subsequent extrusion. These precipitates, however, are deleterious for the mechanical properties of the alloy and also hamper the age-hardenability and are hence dissolved during solution {{heat treatment}}. ^ Microstructural development during homogenization and subsequent cooling occurs both at the length scale of the Secondary Dendrite Arm Spacing (SDAS) in micrometers and dispersoids in nanometers. Numerical tools to simulate microstructural development at both the length scales have been developed and validated against experiments. These tools provide easy and convenient means to study the process. ^ A Cellular Automaton-Finite Volume-based model for evolution of interdendritic phases is coupled with a Particle Size Distribution-based model for precipitation of dispersoids across the grain. This comprehensive model has been used to study the effect of temperature, composition, as-cast microstructure, and cooling rates during post-homogenization quenching on microstructural evolution. The numerical study has been complimented with experiments involving Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction and Differential Scanning Calorimetry and a good agreement has with numerical results has been found. ^ The current work aims to study the microstructural evolution during homogenization heat treatment at both length scales which include the (i) dissolution and transformation of the as-cast secondary phases; (ii) precipitation of dispersoids; and (iii) reprecipitation of some of the secondary phases during post-homogenization cooling. The kinetics of the phase transformations are mostly diffusion controlled except for the η to S phase transformation in 7 XXX alloys which is interface reaction rate controlled which has been implemented using a novel approach. Recommendations for homogenization temperature, time, cooling rates and compositions are made for Al-Si-Mg-Fe-Mn and Al-Zn-Cu-Mg-Zr alloys.

40|$|Macrosegregation of solute {{elements}} during casting operations {{has been}} a subject of observation, discussion, and research for several hundred years. The unique casting conditions found in the <b>Direct-Chill</b> aluminum <b>casting</b> process can lead to significant accumulation and depletion of solute elements throughout the cast product. In particular, the center of ingots are generally characterized by a depletion of up to 20 % of solute elements. In this investigation we confirm the dominant role mobile, solute-depleted grains play on magrosegregation along ingot centerlines. We propose that avalanche events drive the grains from the solidification front to the ingot center. In order to demonstrate and control this preferential settling, we propose {{the use of a}} turbulent jet to re-suspend the avalanching grains. An analytical expression is derived in order to optimize the dimension of the jet with the goal of minimizing centerline segregation. We then performed a series of experiments in order to validate the analytical expression across ingot dimensions and alloy families.

40|$|International audienceAluminum alloy 7050 {{is known}} for its {{superior}} mechanical properties, and thus finds its application in aerospace industry. Vertical <b>direct-chill</b> (DC) <b>casting</b> process is typically employed for producing such an alloy. Despite its advantages, AA 7050 is considered as a "hard-to-cast" alloy because of its propensity to cold cracking. This type of cracks occurs catastrophically and is difficult to predict. Previous research suggested that such a crack could be initiated by undeveloped hot tears (microscopic hot tear) formed during the DC casting process if they reach a certain critical size. However, validation of such a hypothesis has not been done yet. Therefore, a method to produce a hot tear with a controlled size is needed as part of the verification studies. In the current study, we demonstrate a method that has a potential to control the size of the created hot tear in a small-scale solidification process. We found that by changing two variables, cooling rate and displacement compensation rate, the size of the hot tear during solidification can be modified in a controlled way. An X-ray microtomography characterization technique is utilized to quantify the created hot tear. We suggest that feeding and strain rate during DC casting are more important compared with the exerted force on the sample for the formation of a hot tear. In addition, we show that there are four different domains of hot-tear development in the explored experimental window-compression, microscopic hot tear, macroscopic hot tear, and failure. The samples produced in the current study will be used for subsequent experiments that simulate cold-cracking conditions to confirm the earlier proposed model...|$|R
40|$|During <b>direct-chill</b> (DC) <b>casting</b> of {{aluminium}} alloys high temperature gradients are developed across the ingot such that stresses are generated. These stresses may induce cracks or even lead to ingot fracture. There {{are two types of}} cracks to consider: hot tears which are formed at temperatures above the solidus and cold cracks which appear at temperatures below the solidus and can damage the entire ingot. High-strength aluminium alloys are more vulnerable to cold cracking mainly because of the poor thermal and mechanical properties in the genuine as-cast condition. Low thermal conductivities and large solidification temperature range are the main thermal properties which make the alloy more prone to cracking. The temperature range between rigidity temperature, the temperature below which the material starts holding thermal strains, and non-equilibrium solidus determines the solidification contraction range, and is the crucial factor for hot cracking susceptibility. In this Master’s thesis this temperature was defined for a group of AA 7050 alloys with different chemical compositions and prepared under different casting process, to study the effect of grain refinement, impurities and cooling conditions. The temperatures when the tested alloys started to contract, Tth, were between 510 - 548 ºC. The solidification range over which the material changes from liquid state to the solid was in the range from 176 ºC to 161 ºC. Grain refinement decreased Tth and the solidification range. Numerical simulations have been run using the thermal properties of an AA 7050 grain refined aluminium alloy to determine the stress and strain state of a DC-cast billet. Simulation results showed that material is prone to yielding at temperatures ranging from 400 ºC to rigidity point (510 ºC) and hot cracks can probably form, especially in the centre of the billet, where the residual thermal stresses are all tensile. Rapid propagation and catastrophic failure may occur later, if the formed micro-cracks get the chance to propagate in the residual stress fields...|$|R

Numerical models can simulate the thermomechanical behavior of an ingot during casting and after solidification and reveal the critical cooling conditions that result in catastrophic failure, provided that the constitutive parameters of the material represent genuine as-cast properties. Application of fracture mechanics, on the other hand, can help to derive the critical crack length leading to failure. In the present research work, the state of residual thermal stresses was determined in an AA 7050 billet during DC casting by means of ALSIM 5. Simulation results showed that in the steady-state conditions, large compressive stresses form near {{the surface of the}} billet in the circumferential direction, whereas in the center, the stresses are tensile in all directions.

40|$|Semi-continuous <b>direct-chill</b> (DC) <b>casting</b> of {{aluminium}} ingots {{suffers from a}} very frequent defect {{which can lead to}} a strong decrease in productivity: hot tearing. This phenomenon takes place in the mushy state (i. e., at solid fractions, gs, lower than unity). In order to solve this problem, research moved towards the development of models for the prediction of the hot cracking sensitivity of any kind of alloy under given casting conditions. The defect being of complex nature and revealing some random aspects, the models must describe in the most precise way the interconnected mechanisms intervening in the formation and propagation of the crack. However, an approach supporting the separate study of each mechanism in order to integrate them, thereafter, in a single model, emerged as the way to follow from now on. The objective of this research task is to study the mechanisms leading to hot cracking {{of aluminium}} alloys during continuous casting processes, in order to deduce from them the fundamental parameters and mechanisms that will be integrated in the models to predict hot cracking sensitivity. For this purpose, two relevant aspects were targeted: the mechanical behaviour of the material in the semi-solid state {{as a function of the}} microstructure, and also the coalescence phenomenon. In order to study these phenomena, specific apparatus were developed in the laboratory. The first one, previously used by Farup et al. [Far 01] for in-situ observation of organic alloys (succinonitrile- 0. 5 wt pct acetone), was improved in order to allow more precise observations under better controlled conditions of the hot cracking phenomenon in columnar grains. Then, in order to study the mechanical behaviour of an Al- 4. 5 wt pct Cu alloy as a function of three various types of microstructures (equiaxed, E, columnar radial parallel to the shear plane, C//, and columnar longitudinal perpendicular to this plane, Cperp), a torsion test performed on hollow cylindrical specimens in the semi-solid state was built, based on the original idea of Mahjoub et al. [Mah 00]. Finally, an apparatus intended to tear a grain-refined Al- 1 wt pct Cu alloy in the semi-solid state, avoiding any contact with air during the test, was designed. In order to optimize the tests on the Al-Cu alloys, numerical simulations of the thermal field in the specimens were made. Moreover, as a complement to the experimental results, numerical simulations of the mechanics for the torsion test were carried out so as to study the arrangement influence of the wet grain boundaries within a medium made up of hexagonal grains. From the tests on the organics, two distinct cases depending on the value of gs at which the grain boundary is stressed could be observed: either ''healing'' of the crack due to liquid feeding in the zone under constraints, or the formation of a hot crack. Finally, temperature ranges within which intra- and intergranular coalescence start to take place were established and used in a simple model (Rappaz-Drezet-Gremaud [Rap 99]) for the prediction of hot cracking. Temperatures for coherency loss of an Al- 4. 5 wt pct Cu alloy, as a function of the microstructure, were obtained using the torsion test. Moreover, creep tests made it possible to describe the deformation mode depending on the type of microstructure tested. An evolution of the E and C// samples behaviour towards that of a fully solid material could be highlighted by fitting the curves with a Norton's power law, in the case of an increase of gs from 90 to 92 %. The Cperp samples always showed a higher resistance to deformation compared to that of the other microstructures. The tearing test results highlighted a strong increase in the maximal force needed to break a grain-refined Al- 1 wt pct Cu specimen as gs reached approximately 95 %. The latter is attributed to a start of coalescence between the grains. Observations under the microscope of the broken surfaces confirmed this assumption by revealing a transition from a smooth surface with a dendritic aspect to a surface containing important sharp-edged areas. An evolution in the shape of the spikes left by the broken bridges could also be highlighted. The temperature versus solid fraction curves were determined using the thermal analysis method developed at the laboratory by Campanella et al. [Cam 01]: the single pan thermal analysis (SPTA). Indeed, this method allows a closer description of the actual solidification path for systems out of equilibrium. Finally, the study by successive transverse sectioning of a DC cast billet containing a hot crack was undertaken. The results point out the crack evolution in the case of a constant increase of the casting speed. The crack starts as a concentration of microporosity in the centre of the billet that quickly changes to an annular shape made of microcracks. Then, it moves off centre taking the shape of a linear crack. Eventually, the crack moves again to the billet centre with a typical "star" crack shape...|$|R
40|$|<b>Direct-chill</b> (DC) <b>casting</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods to produce ingots of {{high-strength}} aluminum alloys such as an AA 7050. Despite of its superior mechanical properties, this alloy is prone to both hot tearing (HT) and cold cracking (CC) during DC casting. HT form above the solidus while CC occurs below the solidus temperature. CC occurrence appears to be random and thus it is difficult to foresee. Moreover, the propagation of CC is usually catastrophic. Thus, not only it decreases the yield of the production and may damage the casting equipments, but it also poses safety hazard to the casting personnel. A previous study on CC indicated this type of crack could start from a solidification defect, for example an inclusion. The same study also suggested that undeveloped or micro hot tear (HT) may also act as CC initiation point but this assumption has not yet being proven. In addition to trials and errors methods, numerical models are more and more considered as relevant tools to find process conditions minimizing the risk of both HT and CC. At the moment, we have a numerical process simulator to simulate aluminium DC-casting process, called ALSIM. Although at its current version (ALSIM 6), ALSIM has criteria to estimate the susceptibility for both HT and CC, it was reported that ALSIM’s crack prediction capability has not yet reached its full potential. Therefore, the main goal of this study is four-fold: (1) Verify the connection between HT and CC experimentally. (2) Complete ALSIM materials database for AA 7050 for a better crack prediction accuracy. (3) Analyze ALSIM model sensitivity with respect to different DC casting parameters and materials database. (4) Propose a concept of a new crack prediction criterion so that ALSIM could capture the connection between HT and CC quantitatively. Before developing the connection between HT and CC within ALSIM, we need to make sure that the current version of ALSIM is able to properly estimate the susceptibility of different types of cracks during DC casting. For this validation, we performed benchmark tests between trial casts that produce different cast output (healthy, HT and CC) and ALSIM simulations that mimic those trial casts. For obtaining different cast outputs, we vary two casting parameters; casting speed (in combination with cooling rate) and melt inlet geometry. The analysis shows the output of the ALSIM simulation is in qualitative agreement with the experimental results of the trial DC casting. This verifies that ALSIM is sensitive with respect to different casting parameters. Moreover, the results also indicate that ALSIM has the potential to capture the connection between HT and CC. ALSIM uses a set of material properties database to simulate the DC casting process. One of the ALSIM drawbacks in the beginning of the project was the incompleteness of the AA 7050 mechanical properties database in the vicinity of the solidus point (T = 465 °C). To complete this database, we performed isothermal tensile tests in both the sub-solidus temperature regime (between 400 and 465 °C) and in the super-solidus temperature regime (when the material is in its semi-solid state but already possesses mechanical strength), i. e. between solid fraction of 0. 85 and 1. 0 (fully solid). We fitted the result of the tensile tests in respective temperature regimes with the constitutive models implemented in ALSIM to obtain the material property parameters. The focus was on the tensile behavior of the alloy as this loading mode is the main one for the HT formation in the billet. The tensile test results also reveal the mechanical behavior and the failure mechanisms of AA 7050 around the solidus point and shed some light on the possible mechanisms of the connection between HT and CC. In the sub-solidus temperature range, we performed tensile tests at different temperature points (400, 420, 440, 450, 455, 460, 465 °C) and three strain rates (0. 05, 0. 005, 0. 0005 s- 1). For each combination of temperature and strain rate, we repeated the tests three times to capture the statistical behavior of the alloy at the test condition. From the test result, we found that the ductility of the alloy decreases as temperature and strain-rate increases. Meanwhile, the strength of the alloy increases with strain rate but it decreases as temperature increases. From the fracture surface assessment, we observed that the main mode of failure gradually changes from ductile transgranular (at 400 °C) to ductile intergranular (at 465 °C). In the sub-solidus temperature range, we fitted the tensile constitutive behavior data with both extended-Ludwik equation and creep-law. For the former fit, we found that the obtained constitutive parameters are continuous with the data from the lower temperature regime (room temperature up to 400 °C) while for the latter fit, we found that the AA 7050 parameters are relatively comparable to the value of other 7 XXX series alloys. In the super-solidus temperature range, we performed tensile test at different solid-fractions (fs); 0. 85, 0. 88, 0. 9, 0. 94, 0. 97, 0. 99 and 1. 0 (fully solid) or in terms of temperature at 550, 520, 485, 475, 473, 470 and 465 respectively. To observe the displacement-rate sensitivity, we did tests at two different displacement rates (0. 2 and 2. 0 mm/min) for some solid fractions. To assess the statistical behavior of the alloy, for each test conditions, we repeated the test three times. The results show that grain coalescence starts between solid fraction of 0. 94 and 0. 97. This occurrence is signified by the steep increase in the peak stress as solid fraction increases. The alloy undergoes a typical brittle temperature range behavior – transition from ductile-brittle-ductile as the solid fraction decreases from the fully solid state, with the lowest ductility observed at fs = 0. 94. The fracture mode observed from fracture surface analysis is generally mixed between transgranular and interdendritic. We extracted the constitutive parameters by comparing the tensile force-displacement curves obtained from the experimental tensile tests and the result from numerical thermo-mechanical tensile tests that were built using ALSIM. Using this method, we selected the constitutive parameters that provide a good fit of the force value between numerical and experimental tensile tests in this temperature range. From the fitting, we found that the semi-solid behavior of AA 7050 is different compared to the other alloys that were already available in ALSIM semi-solid mechanical database; Al- 2 % Cu and AA 5182. We observe that AA 7050 is stronger than Al- 2 % Cu but weaker than AA 5182 in the semi-solid temperature regime. Using the newly obtained AA 7050 materials database, we carried out the sensitivity analysis of ALSIM with respect to different materials database at both temperature regimes (semi-solid and fully-solid). We ran ALSIM simulations using the same set-up as the benchmarking cases but we varied the materials database at different temperature ranges. We assessed the results of both cracking criteria. We conclude that ALSIM model is sensitive with respect to the materials database in both temperature ranges. However, we also found that ALSIM HT criterion has a weak dependency with respect to different materials databases, which is unexpected and shows this criterion needs to be improved. To experimentally validate the connection between HT and CC, we need to produce samples containing undeveloped HT and then quantify the dimension of these HT. To produce these samples, we used a solidification experiment with controlled conditions. During the solidification, we varied two process parameters namely cooling-rate and constrain conditions. We made sure only HT were formed in the sample by relieving the constraining force as soon as the material is fully solidified and let the sample cool down unconstrained to room temperature. Subsequently, we performed three dimensional imaging on the re-solidified and most deformed part of the sample by using X-Ray microtomography technique and analyzed the image data by image analysis method. From the result of the image analysis, we found that by changing these two process parameters, four regimes of HT can be distinguished based on its severity; compressive, micro-HT, macro-HT and complete fracture. Only the samples with micro-HT conditions were selected for the subsequent tests. The produced samples with micro-HT were then tensile tested at room temperature, which is the temperature where CC commonly occurs. The result of tensile tests shows significant drop in strength and ductility of the alloy if micro-HT are present in the sample. This verifies the connection between HT and CC. The result from the quantitative image analysis shows that usually HT do not form individually. Moreover, the geometry of the formed HT is not simple (i. e. branching crack) and the approximate ratio between the longest and shortest crack axis is finite (unlike the penny-shaped geometry). These HT features are not taken into account in the crack initiator geometry of the current ALSIM CC criterion. Therefore, the criterion needs to be improved in order to increase the accuracy of the crack prediction. One of the most important drawbacks in the current ALSIM HT criterion in the framework of connection between HT and CC is that it cannot provide the dimension of the formed HT. This information is crucial for the CC criterion to decide whether crack will occur. Since HT is a non-linear and complex phenomenon, we propose to capture its formation by using a stochastic (probabilistic) model. The new HT model considers the relationship between different physical phenomena during solidification and utilizes ALSIM simulation result (physical fields) as the model input. From the simple example presented in this study, we illustrate the potential of this new approach to provide probable dimension and location of the formed HT. Although further development is necessary to make this model fully operational in ALSIM, the implementation of this new HT model in ALSIM may offer the possibility of quantitative crack prediction of the connection between HT and CC.
