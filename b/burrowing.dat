40|$|Numerical {{hydrodynamic}} modelling {{has been}} used extensively {{over the last few}} decades to simulate flow in the ocean, bays and estuaries; however, modelling of much smaller scale phenomena is less common. In this work a commercially available Computational Fluid Dynamics package (FIDAP), normally used for industrial applications, was used to simulate tidally-induced flow in multi-opening animal <b>burrows.</b> U-shaped <b>burrows</b> of varying complexities were modelled to determine the effect of different surface characteristics and <b>burrow</b> geometries on surface water velocities, <b>burrow</b> velocities and <b>burrow</b> flushing times. The turbulent 2 D model showed the slope of the surface water was proportional to the square of both the surface and <b>burrow</b> velocities. The effect of placing a root in the surface flow was to reduce the surface water velocity; however, the <b>burrow</b> flow depended upon the root position. For the root location either upstream or downstream of the <b>burrow,</b> the <b>burrow</b> velocity was reduced by 50 %. With the root located between the <b>burrow</b> openings the <b>burrow</b> velocity increased by 200 %, due to the increase in pressure difference across the <b>burrow</b> openings. A buttress root placed in the flow immediately downstream of the upstream <b>burrow,</b> caused the <b>burrow</b> flushing rate to increase significantly with increasing buttress height. Flushing times for <b>burrows</b> of varying depth were determined computationally by use of a tracer for the <b>burrow</b> water. For a <b>burrow</b> of depth 1 · 2 m, the flushing times were 5 and 28 min for root location between the <b>burrow</b> openings and downstream of the <b>burrow,</b> respectively. Animal <b>burrows</b> often consist of multiply-connected loops. A second <b>burrow</b> was added to the primary <b>burrow</b> and flushing times were found to be 15 and 38 min, respectively. A <b>burrow</b> system of four connected <b>burrows</b> was modelled which had corresponding flushing times up to 24 and 47 min, respectively. The calculated times are consistent with the hypothesis that a significant flushing of animal <b>burrows</b> occurs within a single tidal event. This preliminary investigation indicates that CFD models may be very useful in studying small scale hydrodynamic phenomena such as flow in animal <b>burrows...</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Burrowing</b> behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely (or partially) into the substrate, is frequent among strombid gastropods. The <b>burrowing</b> behaviour of L.canarium consists {{of a series of}} movements characteristic of the species. There are three consecutive movements: first is probing, where the animal pushes the anterior portion of the foot into the substrate to gain a hold; next is shovelling, where it pushes the substrate with its long, extensible proboscis. Retraction is the final movement, where it moves the shell along an anterior-posterior axis to settle the substrate around it. Once burrowed, part of the dorsal shell is usually still visible (although the ventral surface and the animal's soft parts are buried).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Courting male fiddler crabs Uca terpsichores (1 cm {{carapace}} width) sometimes build {{mounds of}} sand called hoods at the entrances to their <b>burrows.</b> Males wave their single enlarged claws to attract females to their <b>burrows</b> for mating. It was shown previously that <b>burrows</b> with hoods are {{more attractive to}} females and that females visually orient to these structures. In this study, we test whether males also use their hoods to find their <b>burrows.</b> We first determined the maximum distance that males can see and find a <b>burrow</b> opening without a hood. Males were removed from their <b>burrows</b> and placed on the sand at a range of distances from a <b>burrow</b> opening. If they were more than about 8 cm (seven units of eye-height) away, they were unable find the <b>burrow.</b> In contrast, males that were <b>burrow</b> residents used a non-visual path map {{to return to their}} <b>burrows</b> from much greater distances. To determine if hoods help males find their <b>burrows</b> when there are errors in their path maps, we moved residents 1 – 49 cm on sliding platforms producing errors equal to the distances they were moved. Males with self-made hoods or hood models at their <b>burrows</b> relocated their <b>burrows</b> at significantly greater distances than did males with unadorned <b>burrows.</b> Hood builders also relocated their <b>burrows</b> faster. Hence, hoods have two functions: they attract females and they provide a visual cue that males use to find their <b>burrows</b> quickly and reliably when their path maps fail...|$|R

5|$|The sloth bear, {{though not}} as {{specialised}} as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the ants, termites, and other <b>burrowing</b> insects they favour.
