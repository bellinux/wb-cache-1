Believing that de Grasse would return {{a portion of}} his fleet to Europe, Rodney detached Rear Admiral Sir Samuel Hood with 14 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America. Rodney, who was ill, sailed for Europe {{with the rest of his}} fleet in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have <b>been</b> <b>tracking</b> the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Kathy was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that devastated the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands in March 1984. Originating from a tropical low off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea. Tracking westward, the system attained gale-force winds by 18March before striking the Cape York Peninsula. After crossing the area, Kathy entered the Gulf of Carpentaria where environmental conditions favoured significant development. On 22March, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category5 severe tropical cyclone (Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale) with ten-minute sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph). By this time, the storm had <b>been</b> <b>tracking</b> towards the southwest and struck the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands later on 22March before moving over the Australian mainland as a slightly weaker system. Once over land, Kathy rapidly degraded, losing gale-force winds within 24hours; the storm dissipated over the Northern Territory on 24March.|$|E
5|$|Three organisations {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} location of Tito's headquarters and the disposition of Partisan forces in Drvar. The first of these was the Benesch Special Unit of Section II of the Abwehr (the Wehrmacht intelligence service), some members {{of which had been}} involved in identifying Tito's presence in the town of Jajce prior to the German offensive to retake the town. The Benesch Special Unit was part of the Brandenburg Division, and was staffed by ethnic Germans who spoke local languages. The unit had many contacts with both the Chetniks and Ustaše Militia, and had <b>been</b> <b>tracking</b> Tito since October 1943. Leutnant Kirchner of that unit had been responsible for locating Tito prior to the re-capture of Jajce, and he established a patrol base near Bosansko Grahovo. He got very close to the Drvar cave, and located the Allied military missions, but despite German radio intercepts confirming that Drvar was the site of Tito's headquarters, Kirchner was unable to pinpoint the cave as the location of the headquarters. Kirchner was attached to the 500th SS Parachute Battalion for the operation.|$|E

Factors behind the deaths include bullying, hazing, and the systemic corruption within the Azeri military.|$|E

25|$|The United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN), a {{division}} of the United States Strategic Command, has <b>been</b> <b>tracking</b> objects in Earth's orbit since 1957 when the Soviet Union opened the Space Age with the launch of Sputnik I. Since then, the SSN has tracked more than 26,000 objects. The SSN currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects. The rest have re-entered Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The SSN tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger; those now orbiting Earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds. About seven percent are operational satellites (i.e. ~560 satellites), the rest are space debris. The United States Strategic Command is primarily interested in the active satellites, but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, the Advanced Party of 3/3's sister battalion, the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment (2/3) {{arrived in}} RC(E). Since before {{deploying}} to Afghanistan, 2/3's intelligence officer, Captain Scott Westerfield and his assistants, had <b>been</b> <b>tracking</b> a small cell {{led by a}} man named Ahmad Shah, based on intelligence sent back by 3/3's intelligence officer. Shah was from a remote region in Nangarhar Province, which borders the south side of Kunar Province. Shah, they determined, was responsible for approximately 11 incidents against coalition forces and Government of Afghanistan entities, including small arms ambushes and improvised explosive device attacks. By June 2005, 2/3 had relieved-in-place 3/3, and had taken the Stars concept and developed a comprehensive operation which they called Operation Red Wings, with the goal of disrupting anti-coalition militia activity, with an emphasis on disrupting Ahmad Shah's activities, which were based near the summit of Sawtalo Sar.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midst}} of the Time War between the Time Lords and the Daleks, the War Doctor — a hitherto-unknown {{incarnation}} of the Doctor — decides to trigger an ancient weapon called The Moment in order to destroy both sides completely. The Moment is sentient and manifests itself as Rose Tyler. It questions whether mass killing is the best option for ending the Time War and prescribes the Doctor's punishment if he does so — he will survive while the rest of his race dies. The Moment offers to show the Doctor what this will turn him into and opens a fissure linking him to the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. The three Doctors converge in the year 1562, where the Tenth Doctor has <b>been</b> <b>tracking</b> down a Zygon. They discover that the Zygon is disguised as Queen Elizabeth, who captures and imprisons them in the Tower of London.|$|E
