5|$|In 1989, {{scientist}} Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. {{after discovering}} {{their attempt to}} replicate his Ant-Man shrinking technology. <b>Believing</b> <b>the</b> technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide {{it as long as}} he lives.|$|E
5|$|Lucas reluctantly {{agreed to}} the proposal, and began to disband his militia, <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> debate to be settled. Three days later, {{elections}} in the region were held under Ohio law. Mason refused the deal and he continued to prepare for possible armed conflict.|$|E
5|$|After its founding, {{the party}} {{promoted}} {{itself as the}} legitimate heir of the Socialist Party of America. Former Mayor of Milwaukee, Frank Zeidler, was elected the first national chairperson of the party. Zeidler also helped re-organizing the party structure during its early years. He was later nominated as the party's candidacy for the presidential office, with Zeidler <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> party {{would be able to}} collaborate with other socialist parties nationwide to spread the message of socialism.|$|E
60|$|There {{is but one}} way, my friends. There {{never was}} but one way. <b>Believe</b> <b>the</b> text, and {{therefore}} <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> warrant of your Baptism. <b>Believe</b> <b>the</b> message of your Confirmation.|$|R

25|$|In a 2002 poll of 100 researchers, 61 <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> {{answer to}} be no, 9 <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> answer is yes, and 22 were unsure; 8 <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} may {{be independent of}} the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove.|$|R
5|$|Arnost Rosin (prisoner no. 29858) and Czesław Mordowicz (prisoner no. 84216) {{escaped from}} Auschwitz on 27 May 1944 and arrived in Slovakia on 6 June, {{the day of}} the Normandy landings. Hearing about the {{invasion}} of Normandy and <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> war was over, they got drunk to celebrate, using dollars they had smuggled out of Auschwitz. They were promptly arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council paid their fines.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{relocated}} to Montana in 2010, and founded the Liberty Fellowship, <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> {{people of the}} state responded well to his constitutionalist message. In 2012, he briefly ran for Lieutenant Governor of Montana as the running mate of Republican gubernatorial primary candidate Bob Fanning, but dropped out {{due to the lack of}} campaign funds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Believing</b> <b>the</b> {{attack was}} over, Giffen ordered his ships to cease zigzagging and {{continue}} towards Guadalcanal {{on the same}} course {{and at the same}} speed. Meanwhile, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft began dropping flares and floatlights to mark the course and speed of TF18 for the impending attack by Hagai's bombers.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> revisionists <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> !Kung were {{associated}} with Bantu-speaking overlords throughout history, and involved with merchant capital. They <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> San in the Kalahari are a classless society because they are actually the lower class of a greater Kalahari society. <b>The</b> revisionists <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> !Kung San were heavily involved in trade. They <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> San were transformed by centuries of contact with Iron Age, Bantu-speaking agro-pastoralists. This argues against {{the idea that they}} were a well-adapted hunter-gatherer culture, but instead advanced only through trade and help from nearby economies.|$|R
50|$|Few Chinese {{politicians}} <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> US {{version of}} events, <b>believing</b> instead <b>the</b> strike had been deliberate.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of dispensationalists {{are known as}} Acts 2 dispensationalists. They <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> present church began {{on the day of}} Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 and practice water baptism. <b>The</b> majority also <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> New Testament epistles of Hebrews through Revelation were written directly to the present church. Likewise, most dispensationalists also <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> doctrine contained in the Four Gospels also pertains to the present church.|$|R
5|$|By 1965, US-40 was realigned along Foothill Drive (then US-40A), the Utah Highway Department <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> Foothill route {{was more}} direct in {{connecting}} with North Temple toward the airport. US-40A was now aligned along {{the entirety of}} 2100 South from US-40/future I-215 {{at the mouth of}} Parley's Canyon west to State Street and beyond with US-50A to US-40 west of Magna. Both mainline and Alternate US-40, along with US-50A, were truncated to east of the city by 1979.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1835, Texians had {{expelled}} all Mexican {{troops from}} Texas. <b>Believing</b> <b>the</b> war ended, many Texians resigned from the army and returned home. In January, the provisional government essentially collapsed; {{despite a lack of}} authority for any branch of government to interfere with other branches, the legislature impeached Governor Henry Smith, who in turn disbanded the legislature. No one in Texas was entirely sure who was in charge.|$|E
5|$|German {{reaction}} to the second airborne landings involved mortar barrages and small arms fire, but casualties were negligible. Generalmajor Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division watched the gliders descending and, <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> arriving force would threaten his lines of communication, ordered those elements of the division that had reached the beaches to withdraw {{to the north of}} Caen. The gliders' arrival had inadvertently stopped the only German armoured attack on D-Day.|$|E
25|$|Twelver Shia Muslims <b>believe</b> that <b>the</b> Mahdi (the twelfth imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi) {{is already}} on Earth, is in {{occultation}} and will return {{at the end of}} time. Fatimid/ Bohra/ Dawoodi Bohra <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> same but for their 21st Tayyib, whereas Sunnis <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> future Mahdi has not yet arrived on Earth.|$|R
5000|$|... 1813: First private {{organisation}} {{dedicated to}} <b>‘relieving</b> <b>the</b> distressed’, meeting {{needs of the}} population far beyond the capacity of government, leading to the formalisation of ‘The Benevolent Society of NSW’ in 1818, with a broader purpose to <b>‘relieve</b> <b>the</b> poor, the distressed, the aged, and the infirm’ ...|$|R
2500|$|Farooq quotes another scholar (Iqbal Ahmad Khan Suhail) who <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> two ahadith “demolish the self-invented castle of riba al-fadl”. Khan also <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> hadith {{indicate}} that riba {{in a spot}} exchange is [...] "ruled out".|$|R
5|$|Giselle was revived in 1863 {{with new}} costumes by Lormier's assistant, Alfred Albert. Albert's costumes {{are closer to}} those of modern {{productions}} than those of Lormier, and were in use at the opera until 1868. The ballet was revived again in 1924 with scenery and costumes by Alexandre Benois. He wanted to revive the costumes of the original production but dropped the idea, <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> critics would charge him {{with a lack of}} imaginative creativity.|$|E
5|$|Hitler named Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as his successor. Himmler met Dönitz in Flensburg {{and offered}} himself as second-in-command. He {{maintained}} {{that he was}} entitled to a position in Dönitz's interim government as Reichsführer-SS, <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> SS {{would be in a}} good position to restore and maintain order after the war. Dönitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. He wrote a letter on 6 May—two days before the German Instrument of Surrender—formally dismissing Himmler from all his posts.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E
5000|$|The {{provisional}} {{title for}} Tripwire was The Hook, but that name was scrapped as Putnam <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> title was not [...] "punchy" [...] enough. Putnam also <b>believed</b> <b>The</b> Hook would remind people {{too much of}} Peter Pan.|$|R
50|$|Some historians <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> shrine {{belongs to}} two Muslim clerics. Others <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} originally was a Zoroasterian temple and the shrine's Islamic name {{was just a}} cover to protect the structure from destruction during the Muslim invasion.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{different}} {{views about the}} extent of the Darug nation. While some historians <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> coastal Eora people were a separate group to the Darug people, others <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> two groups were part of the same grouping.|$|R
5|$|In Chapter XVI, Poe recounts Captain James Cook's circumnavigation of {{the globe}} aboard the Resolution that reached 70°10' latitude. He also drew from A Narrative of Four Voyages (1832), an account by Benjamin Morrell that became a bestseller. A Narrative of Four Voyages may have given Poe {{the idea of the}} {{summarized}} title of his novel. Poe may have used these real-life accounts in an attempt to hoax his readers into <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> novel was an autobiographical narrative by Pym.|$|E
5|$|In a side plot, Walternate (John Noble) has {{recovered}} {{the portion of}} the doomsday machine that Fauxlivia has secured from the prime universe, and has discovered the formulation for Cortexiphan from his tests on Olivia, but refuses to allow it to be tested on children. When he hears of Fauxlivia's pregnancy with his grandchild, Walternate comforts her and offers his complete support for her, <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> child to be another way to bring Peter voluntarily back to the parallel universe.|$|E
5|$|Siwiec' {{funeral in}} Przemyśl was well attended, {{but did not}} turn into a {{political}} manifestation; it was guarded by police, and secret agents spread rumors aimed at damaging Siwiec's reputation. His family reported that while some acquaintances were supportive and aware of Siwiec's true purpose, many turned away from them, either intimidated by the authorities or <b>believing</b> <b>the</b> stories that Siwiec had been drunk or mentally ill.|$|E
5000|$|WJMC Doctors <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> likely {{cause of}} the {{symptoms}} is exposure to some type of chemical irritant coupled with heat-related illnesses. The workers told doctors they <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> dispersants being sprayed {{to break up the}} oil made them sick.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, 10 years later, {{the same}} poll was repeated. The number of {{researchers}} who answered was 151: 126 (83%) <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> answer to be no, 12 (9%) <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> answer is yes, 5 (3%) <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> question may be independent of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove, 8 (5%) said either don't know or don't care or don't want the answer to be yes nor the problem to be resolved.|$|R
50|$|The next player may {{do one of}} two things. If he <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> roller, {{he simply}} takes the dice (without looking at the result), rolls, and claims a higher scoring roll. If he does not <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> roller, the cup is lifted, {{revealing}} the roller's hand. Either the bluffer or incorrect challenger must drink.|$|R
5|$|Skelton {{was bitter}} about CBS's {{cancellation}} {{for many years}} afterwards. <b>Believing</b> <b>the</b> demographic and salary issues to be irrelevant, he accused CBS of bowing to the anti-establishment, anti-war faction {{at the height of}} the Vietnam War, saying his conservative political and social views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President Spiro Agnew and Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen, to appear on his program.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Seguin {{confirmed}} {{the fate of}} the mission upon their return. Houston dispatched orders to Fannin to abandon Goliad, blow up the Presidio La Bahía fortress, and retreat to Victoria, but Fannin delayed acting on those orders. <b>Believing</b> <b>the</b> approach of Urrea's troops brought a greater urgency to local civilians, he sent 29 men under Captain Amon B. King to help evacuate nearby Refugio.|$|E
5|$|Some Japanese holdouts, {{especially}} on small Pacific Islands, refused to surrender at all (<b>believing</b> <b>the</b> declaration to be propaganda or considering surrender against their code). Some {{may never have}} heard of it. Teruo Nakamura, the last known holdout, emerged from his hidden retreat in Indonesia in December 1974, while two other Japanese soldiers, who had joined Communist guerrillas {{at the end of}} the war, fought in southern Thailand until 1991.|$|E
50|$|Both Martin Luther and John Calvin {{believed}} that Jacob had wrestled with God, although Calvin <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> event {{was only a}} vision. Joseph Barker (1854) <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> Bible clearly showed that Jacob wrestled with God. Peter L. Berger also believed Jacob wrestled God.|$|R
50|$|The group {{talked about}} Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment ideas as well. Shelley <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> Enlightenment idea that society could {{progress}} and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly; however, she also <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society (Bennett 36-42).|$|R
50|$|The {{watermark}} of {{the papers}} on which the maps were printed were examined. While some Princeton University professors <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> papers are Russian-made, John Delaney, the historical maps curator for the Princeton University Library, <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> paper is possibly from Venice, Italy.|$|R
