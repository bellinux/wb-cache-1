5000|$|Everybody’s Weekly was weekly tabloid founded 1913 in London as The Competitor’s Journal. [...] The {{publication}} {{was widely}} syndicated in the United States.

25|$|On July 24, 1911, Melchor Arteaga led Bingham to Machu Picchu, {{which had}} been largely {{forgotten}} <b>by</b> <b>everybody</b> except {{the small number of}} people living in the immediate valley (possibly including two local missionaries named Thomas Payne and Stuart McNairn whose descendants claim that they had already climbed to the ruins in 1906).

25|$|Saṅkaṭa (Hindi: सङ्कट, meaning Adversity): The poet {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} adversity, which is a test for friendship, skill, intellect, and virtues. Aṣṭāvakra's body becomes {{like that of the}} egg of a turtle. Kahola starts repenting for his action of cursing the child. The sin of the Ṛṣi manifests as a drought in the forest, and all the disciples of Kahola leave the Āśrama. The birds and animals in the forest start dying out of hunger and thirst. Sujātā asks Kahola to go to the Yajña of Janaka and get some wealth by defeating the assembly of the wise in a scriptural debate. Kahola goes to Mithilā against his wishes, and is beaten in the debate by Bandī, the son of Varuṇa, who then immerses Kahola under water in the Varuṇapāśa. In the forest, Sujātā gives birth to a boy. Uddālaka comes to the aid of Sujātā and tells her about the fate of Kahola, asking her to keep this secret from her child, as the knowledge of his father's defeat will be a hurdle in the growth of the child. Uddālaka performs the Jātakarman Saṃskāra of the infant. The child is called Aṣṭavakra (having eight limbs deformed) <b>by</b> <b>everybody,</b> but Uddālaka names him Aṣṭāvakra, with the meanings as explained here. The canto ends with Aṣṭāvakra starting to grow in the Āśrama of his maternal grandfather.|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} in Singapore may be {{contrasted with the}} application of a proportionality analysis in other jurisdictions vis-à-vis the constitutional protection of freedom of religion. Section 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that the freedom of conscience and religion is a fundamental freedom enjoyed <b>by</b> <b>everybody.</b> It is subject to section 1: [...] "The rights and freedoms set out in the Canadian Charter are subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society." ...|$|E

"Well," [...] says Buck, [...] "a feud is this way: A man has {{a quarrel}} with another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills HIM; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the COUSINS chip in--and <b>by</b> and <b>by</b> <b>everybody's</b> killed off, and there ain't no more feud.

500|$|Beckinsale {{then made}} a return to smaller-scale projects: [...] "My {{experience}} is that I sort of {{stepped away from the}} independent movies and did a couple of big movies. But that's not necessarily how it's perceived <b>by</b> <b>everybody</b> else, which I do understand." [...] "I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [...] it’s not something that I would like to do solely." [...] She explained that she had originally decided to appear in Underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles— it was [...] "assumed that I use a chamber pot and wear bloomers"—but that her action career [...] "kind of took off a little too much." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} of The Wall, Waters, Gilmour and Mason became increasingly dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution to the album. Gilmour said that Wright [...] "hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little" [...] and this was why he [...] "got the boot". According to Mason, [...] "Rick's contribution was to turn up and sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'." [...] Waters commented: [...] " [...] {{was not prepared to}} cooperate in making the record... it was agreed <b>by</b> <b>everybody...</b> either [...] can have a long battle or [...] can agree to... finish making the album, keep [...] full share... {{but at the end of}} it [...] leave quietly. Rick agreed." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides his style, Cicero also admired {{other aspects}} of Demosthenes's works, such as the good prose rhythm, {{and the way he}} {{structured}} and arranged the material in his orations. According to the Roman statesman, Demosthenes regarded [...] "delivery" [...] (gestures, voice etc.) as more important than style. Although he lacked Aeschines's charming voice and Demades's skill at improvisation, he made efficient use of his body to accentuate his words. Thus he managed to project his ideas and arguments much more forcefully. However, the use of physical gestures wasn't an integral or developed part of rhetorical training in his day. Moreover, his delivery was not accepted <b>by</b> <b>everybody</b> in antiquity: Demetrius Phalereus and the comedians ridiculed Demosthenes's [...] "theatricality", whilst Aeschines regarded Leodamas of Acharnae as superior to him.|$|E

500|$|The bravery Lody {{exhibited}} {{during his}} trial and execution was praised by many post-war British writers. Sir George Aston, writing in his 1930 book Secret Service, called on his readers to [...] "pay {{a tribute to}} a real German spy of the highest type... Karl Lody", while John Bulloch commented in his 1963 history of MI5 that Lody's bearing made him [...] "something of a hero even in the country against which he was working." [...] E.T. Woodhall, a former detective, collected accounts from officers who {{had been involved in}} the investigation and wrote in 1932: [...] "They are unanimous in their admiration for his manly and brazen qualities, but they all criticise his amazing lack of caution... He was admired <b>by</b> <b>everybody</b> for his bravery and straightforward, patriotic devotion to his country." ...|$|E
500|$|On 31 July 2009, Robson died of {{lung cancer}} at his home in County Durham, aged 76, after a long battle with the disease. After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of {{football}} and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a [...] "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." [...] Gary Lineker said, [...] "It is a sad day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed <b>by</b> <b>everybody</b> in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." [...] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a [...] "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison. I can think of no more fitting epitaph." ...|$|E

50|$|Come the Spring of 1914, all his {{creative}} juices flowed into his magnum opus, The Messiah of the Cylinder, an answering cry against H. G. Wells' When the Sleeper Wakes. Despite acceptance <b>by</b> <b>Everybody's</b> Magazine, the story lingered {{for three years}} (1917 June, July, August, September). While this serial gathered dust, another science fiction serial made its debut, leading many SF enthusiasts to believe this to be Emanuel's first true SF venture. Written {{during the summer of}} 1915, The Sea Demons was printed by All-Story Weekly and serialised in three instalments (1916 January 1, 15, 22).|$|R

It was really ... people's love for Heath that propelled this thing forward." [...] "All the actors already in the film had to change their schedules, and there wasn't a moment's hesitation.

You could not tire him out and his belief that politics and democracy would work for peace. Former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader John Bruton said FitzGerald would; stand out {{as a man who}} changed Ireland and that he had changed attitudes to in the Republic to Northern Ireland and to Europe and that he saw that Ireland could do best in Europe if it contributed creatively to goals and ambitions of other members.|$|E
2500|$|French, {{the only}} {{official}} {{language of the}} French Republic, is spoken today <b>by</b> <b>everybody</b> in Brittany, {{and it is the}} mother tongue of most people. Nonetheless, French was not widely known before the 19th century, and two regional languages exist in Brittany: Breton and Gallo. They are separated by a language border that has constantly moved back since the Middle Ages. The current border runs from Plouha on the English Channel to the Rhuys Peninsula on the Bay of Biscay. Because of their origins and practice, Breton and Gallo can be compared to Scottish Gaelic and Scots language in Scotland. Both have been recognised as [...] "Langues de Bretagne" [...] ("languages of Brittany") by the Regional Council of Brittany since 2004.|$|E
