40|$|AbstractBackgroundReconsidering when to {{initiate}} renal replacement therapy (RRT) {{in patients with}} chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been emphasized recently. With evolving modern aged and diabetes-prone populations, conventional markers of uremia are not sufficient for determining the optimal timing for dialysis initiation. This retrospective cohort study examined the association between hyperphosphatemia and uremic patients who need RRT registration. MethodsAll patients {{from the department of}} nephrology in one tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan who had advanced CKD and estimated glomerular filtration rates < 8  mL/min/ 1. 73  m 2 from July 2009 to May 2013 were enrolled. We reviewed the medical records and collected data on demographics, comorbidities, underlying diseases, duration of nephrology care, use of phosphate binders, and laboratory results. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>initiation</b> decision making. ResultsDuring the study period, 209 of 292 patients with advanced CKD were enrolled in hemodialysis program and 83 patients (controls) were not. Univariable analysis indicated that male sex, current smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, high serum creatinine level, and high serum phosphate level were associated <b>with</b> <b>initiation</b> of <b>hemodialysis.</b> Multivariable analysis indicated that those with higher serum phosphate level (odds ratio [OR] =  2. 4, 95 % confidence interval [CI] =  1. 6 – 3. 5, p =  1. 4  ×  10 − 5) and being in nephrology care for < 12 months (OR =  0. 4, 95 % CI =  0. 2 – 0. 8, p =  0. 016) tended to be significant markers for <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>initiation.</b> ConclusionHyperphosphatemia, in addition to conventional laboratory markers and uremic symptoms, may be a useful marker to determine timing of <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>initiation</b> in patients <b>with</b> advanced CKD...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackgroundLittle {{is known}} about {{vascular}} access conversion and outcomes for patients starting <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>with</b> nonfunctional arteriovenous (AV) access. We assessed mortality risk associated with nonfunctional AV access at <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>initiation,</b> taking subsequent changes in vascular access into account. MethodsWe studied the 53, 092 incident adult hemodialysis patients included in the French REIN registry from 2005 through 2012. AV access placed predialysis was considered nonfunctional when dialysis <b>began</b> <b>with</b> a central venous catheter. Information about vascular access changes was obtained from treatment modality updates. ResultsAt <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>initiation,</b> AV access was functional for 47 % of patients and nonfunctional for 9 %; 44 % had a catheter alone. After a 3 -year follow-up, 63 % of patients <b>beginning</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>with</b> a nonfunctional AV access had changed to a functional one, 4 % had had a transplant, 19 % had died before any vascular access change, and 13 % still used a catheter. Cox proportional hazard models with vascular access treated as a time-dependent variable showed an adjusted mortality hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) for patients with nonfunctional AV access who subsequently converted to functional access of 0. 95 (95 % CI 0. 89 – 1. 03) compared with the reference group with functional AV access since first hemodialysis, versus 1. 43 (95 % CI 1. 31 – 1. 55) {{for those who did}} not convert. ConclusionsAmong patients starting <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>with</b> a nonfunctional AV access, a substantial percentage may never experience successful vascular access conversion.

We estimated crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of nonfunctional versus functional AV access associated with case-mix, facility characteristics, and timing of AV access creation. Analyses were stratified by dialysis start condition (planned or as an emergency) and comorbidity profile. Overall, 18 % patients had nonfunctional AV access at <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>initiation.</b> In the group with planned dialysis start, female gender (OR 1. 43, 95 % CI 1. 32 - 1. 56), diabetes (OR 1. 28, 95 % CI 1. 15 - 1. 44), and a higher number of cardiovascular comorbidities (OR 1. 27, 95 % CI 1. 09 - 1. 49, and 1. 31, 1. 05 - 1. 64, for 3 and > 3 cardiovascular comorbidities versus none, respectively) were independent predictors of nonfunctional AV access. A higher percentage of AV access creation at the region level was associated with a lower rate of nonfunctional AV access (OR 0. 98, 95 % CI 0. 98 - 0. 99 per 1 % increase). The odds of nonfunctional AV access decreased as time from creation to <b>hemodialysis</b> <b>initiation</b> increased up to 3 months in nondiabetic patients with fewer than 2 cardiovascular comorbidities and 6 months in patients with diabetes or 2 or more such comorbidities.

Patients who started long-term hemodialysis between 1 January 1997 and 31 January 2000, and who were referred to the Group Health Cooperative CRI management program, were included in the study. Methods: Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, details of interventions received by patients prior to dialysis, and hemoglobin (Hb) levels during the 6 months prior to the onset of ESRD were recorded. The numbers of days that each patient spent in hospital during the baseline (1 year to 6 months pre-dialysis), pre-dialysis (180 days pre-dialysis), and post-dialysis initiation (180 days following dialysis initiation) periods were recorded. Hospital days during the post-dialysis initiation period were associated with patient characteristics and pre-dialysis interventions received, and were compared with national data from the US Renal Data System (USRDS). Results: When calculated similarly to data from the USRDS, the mean number of hospital days for patients in this study was lower than that for the national hemodialysis population (9. 4 vs 13. 9 days). Temporary vascular access and inadequate nephrology visits prior to dialysis were the key factors increasing the risk of a greater number of hospital days.

In the group <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> time of at least 2 years, there was weak but statistically significant correlation of The Bureau Internacional d'Audiophonologie classification average <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> time (r = 0. 363). There were moderate correlations of average The Bureau Internacional d'Audiophonologie classification (r = 0. 510) and tritone 2 (r = 0. 470) with the total scores of Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults and with its social domain. Conclusion: The Bureau Internacional d'Audiophonologie classification seems to be more appropriate than Lloyd's and Kaplan's for use in this population; its average showed correlations with hearing loss in patients <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> time ≥ 2 years and it exhibited moderate levels of correlation with the total score of Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults and its social domain (r = 0. 557 and r = 0. 512) ...|$|R

40|$|Patient on {{hemodialysis}} (HD) {{should be}} given health education about fluid intake limitation so that renal function is stable and there will no complications. The purpose {{of this research was}} to determine the influence of health education with individual approach about fluid intake limitation towards knowledge about fluid limitation and IDWG (interdialytic weight gain) in patients <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis.</b> The design of this research was “quasi experiement”. 30 respondents were taken by using purposive sampling method. The instrument used knowledge questionnaire about liquid intake that had been tested for validity and reliability. This research was analyse by univariate and bivariate analysis, dependent and independet t test was used to analysed the data. The most respondents are aged 45 - 60 years, with the highest percentage on gender was male, last education was high school, most of respondents did not work, moreover the length of HD was 12 - 60 months. The result showed that health education influences the patient 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge about fluid limitation and IDWG in patients <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> p value (0, 001) < α (0, 05). The result of this research recommends to nurses to give health education with individual approach method to increase of knowledge towards patients <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> about fluid limitation to reduce other complication...|$|R

40|$|There {{is always}} the {{possibility}} of complications of vascular access in patients <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis.</b> The pseudoaneurysm related with accidental arterial puncture {{is one of the}} most important complications in patients <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> and it can cause severe clinic manifestations that may go all the way to limb loss. We describe a 78 -year-old woman undergoing regular dialysis treatment with renal failure. The patient had severe left arm pain starting suddenly after <b>hemodialysis,</b> <b>with</b> rapidly progressing cyanosis, and compartment syndrome caused by brachial artery pseudoaneurysm. Urgent surgical procedure was performed. The pseudoaneurysm was successfully repaired, left arm arterial circulation reestablished, and fasciotomy performed on the left arm for compartment syndrome. In the second session, debridement was performed and dermal graft applied to the necrotic lesions. The patient was discharged with full recovery within 2 months following the treatment. In this case, we emphasize that vascular access during hemodialysis has some complications that can even cause extremity loss. ...|$|R
40|$|The purpose ofthis {{study was}} to explore the {{experiences}} of Hmong hemodialysis patients and the nurses working with them. Two Midwestern Wisconsin hospitals <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> units were used as data collection sites. All Registered Nurses working in the dialysis unit <b>with</b> Hmong <b>hemodialysis</b> patients were invited to participate. All Hmong hemodialysis patients were invited to participate. Cooperation and assistance was obtained by the Hmong community. Questionnaires were distributed to the nurses and interviews were conducted <b>with</b> the Hmong <b>hemodialysis</b> patients. There were 17 nurses and four Hmong hemodialysis patients that participated in this study. The results indicated nurses use a variety of methods to learn about Hmong culture on their own, but overall they felt {{there was a lack of}} training for them on Hmong culture. They felt the Hmong hemodialysis patients were less compliant with theirIII medication regimen and dietarylfluid restriction but equally compliant <b>with</b> their <b>hemodialysis</b> treatment schedule compared to their non-Hrnong hemodialysis patients...|$|R
40|$|Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor which provokes various {{symptoms}} such as episodic headache, {{sweating and}} tachycardia. Meanwhile patients <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> have similar symptoms. Additionally patients with chronic renal failure often can not take the 24 -hour urine collection test. Therefore {{it is said to}} be difficult to diagnose pheochromocytoma in patients with end stage renal disease. We present herein a case of a woman <b>with</b> <b>hemodialysis</b> discovered to have a pheochromocytoma. A 48 -year-old female was admitted to our hospital due to paroxysmal hypertension during hemodialysis. Plasma dopamine and noradrenaline were slightly elevated. Computerized tomography revealed a 2 cm round mass atleftadrenal gland. 131 I-MIBG scintiscan detected that tumor at the same lesion. Under the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, she had taken alpha-adrenergic blocking agent for 4 weeks and left adrenalectomy was successfully performed...|$|R
