60|$|From the {{earliest}} times the Cross {{has been the}} special sign of Christians. St. Paul tells us his great hope, his great business, what God had sent him into the world to do, was this--to make people know the love of Christ; to look at Christ's Cross, and take in its <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> length <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> height.|$|R
60|$|These {{words are}} very deep, and {{difficult}} to understand; for St. Paul does not tell us exactly of what he is speaking. He does not say what it is, the <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> length, <b>and</b> <b>depth,</b> <b>and</b> height {{of which we are}} to comprehend and take in. Only he tells us afterwards what will come of our taking it in; we shall know the love of Christ.|$|R
60|$|This calls {{therefore}} upon Christians, wisely {{to consider}} of the doings of their God. How many opposite <b>breadths,</b> <b>and</b> lengths, <b>and</b> <b>depths,</b> <b>and</b> heights did Israel meet with in their journey from Egypt to Canaan, and all {{to convince them}} of their own weakness, and also {{of the power of}} their God. And they that did wisely consider of his doings there, did reap the advantage thereof. Come, behold the works of the Lord towards me, may every Christian say. He hath set a Saviour against sin; a heaven against a hell; light against darkness; good against evil, <b>and</b> the <b>breadth,</b> <b>and</b> length, <b>and</b> <b>depth,</b> <b>and</b> height of the grace that is in himself, for my good, against all the power, and strength, and force, and subtilty, of every enemy.|$|R
25|$|The {{attribute}} of extension is how substance {{can be understood}} to be physically extended in space.

25|$|For a retailer, {{finding the}} right balance between <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> can be a key to success. An average {{supermarket}} might carry 30,000–60,000 different product lines (product length or assortment), but might carry up to 100 different types of toothpaste (product depth). Specialty retailers typically carry fewer product lines, perhaps as few as 20 lines, but will normally stock greater depth. Costco, for example, carries 5,000 different lines while Aldi carries just 1,400 lines per store.|$|E

40|$|Background & objectives: Data on the {{physical}} dimension of the hand of Indian women are scanty. This information is necessary to ascertain human-machine compatibility {{in the design of}} manual systems for the bare and gloved hand, such as design and sizing of hand tools, controls, knobs and other applications in different kinds of precision and power grips. The present study was undertaken to generate hand anthropometric data of 95 women, working in informal industries (beedi, agarbatti and garment making). Methods: Fifty one hand measurements of the right hand (lengths, <b>breadths,</b> circumferences, <b>depths,</b> spreads <b>and</b> clearances of hand and fingers) were taken, using anthropometric sliding and spreading calipers, measuring tape and handgrip strength dynamometer. The data were statistically analyzed to determine the normality of data and the percentile values of different hand dimensions, and simple and multiple regression analysis were done to determine better predictors of hand length and grip strength. Results: The hand <b>breadths,</b> circumferences <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> were approximately normally distributed, with some deviation in case of the finger lengths. Hand length was significantly correlated with the fist, wrist and finger circumferences. The fist and wrist circumferences, in combination, were better predictors of hand length.

[...] Each volume, starting with the strepsirrhines, covered its subjects exhaustively, including native and scientific nomenclature, anatomical structure, genetics, behaviour and palaeontology.
