40|$|We {{introduce}} the namespaces in XML, focusing first on {{a definition of}} elementary terms {{and the reason for}} their introduction, the disambiguation of names in XML documents. Afterwards we explain the relationship of QNames and expanded names to namespaces URIs, introducing informal standards like RDDL that were created to be standards for namespace documents. We then approach the versioning problem for XML languages. The versioning problem for XML languages can naturally be solved using namespace documents, but it is a model for language versioning, and then provide a concrete colloquial XML language for managing namespace documents we call XMLVS, the XML Versioning System. This language can be transformed to both human-readable XHTML RDDL documents and machine-readable RDF. We show, using Atom as an example, how XMLVS can be used to handle both <b>backward</b> and forward <b>compatible</b> names, as well as elements and attributes sharing a name an...|$|R
5000|$|AGP {{cards are}} <b>backward</b> and forward <b>compatible</b> within limits. 1.5 V-only keyed cards {{will not go}} into 3.3 V slots and vice versa, though [...] "Universal" [...] cards exist which will fit into either type of slot. There are also unkeyed [...] "Universal" [...] slots that will accept either type of card. When an AGP Universal card is plugged-into an AGP Universal slot, only the 1.5 V portion of the card is used. Some cards, like Nvidia's GeForce 6 series (except the 6200) or ATI's Radeon X800 series, only have keys for 1.5 V {{to prevent them from}} being {{installed}} in older mainboards without 1.5 V support. Some of the last modern cards with 3.3 V support were the Nvidia GeForce FX series (FX 5200, FX 5500, FX 5700, some FX 5800, FX 5900 and some FX 5950), Geforce 6 Series (6200, 6600/6600 LE/6600 GT only) and the ATI Radeon 9500/9700/9800(R350) (but not 9600/9800(R360)). Some Geforce 6200 and Geforce 6600 cards will function with AGP 1.0 (3.3v) slots.|$|R
40|$|A {{widespread}} consensus exists {{about the}} poor performance of early modern Spain and numerous explanatory hypotheses have been put forward. However, lack of quantification makes the macroeconomic performance of Spain during the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries largely an unknown. Was there decline or stagnation? Was it absolute or relative to other European nations? Was it possible {{for one of the}} poorest countries in Europe, as Spain is often depicted in the literature, to enjoy one of the highest wages in Europe and to be a leading world power over three centuries? Is the widespread view of a <b>backward</b> agrarian economy <b>compatible</b> with the high wages documented for early modern Spain? These are some of pressing questions that demand a response. In this essay estimates and conjectures about Spain's economic performance over three hundred years are tested for consistency with available evidence on real wages, population trends and rates of urbanization both at regional and national level. Our survey shows a more favourable picture than from recent accounts by Albert Carreras, Angus Maddison, and Jan Luiten van Zanden. Economic progress took place during the 16 th and 18 th centuries while decline occurred during the 17 th century. On the whole we posit that Spanish standards of living were higher by 1800 than in the early 1500 s. Publicad...|$|R

USB 3.0 includes a new, higher speed bus called SuperSpeed in parallel with the USB 2.0 bus. For this reason, the new version is also called SuperSpeed. The first USB 3.0 equipped devices were presented in January 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{theory that}} can be tested using cued recall is {{symmetry}} of forward and backward recall. Forward recall is generally assumed to be easier than backward recall, i.e. forward recall is stronger than backward recall. This is generally true for long sequences of word or letters such as the alphabet. In one view, the independent associations hypothesis, the strength of forward and backward recall are hypothesized to be independent of each other. To confirm this hypothesis, Dr. George Wolford tested participants' forward and backward recall and found that forward and backward recall are independent of each other. The probability of correct forward recall was [...]47 for word pair associations and the probability of correct backward recall of word pair associations was [...]25. However, in another view, the associative symmetry hypothesis, the strengths of forward and backward recall are about equal and highly correlated. In S.E Asch from Swathmore College and S. M Ebenholtz's experiment, participants learned pairs of nonsense syllables by anticipation recall. After reaching a certain threshold of learning, the participants were tested by free recall to determine all pairs and single items they could remember. These researchers found that backward association was greatly weaker than forward association. However, when the availability of forward and backward recall were basically the same, there was little difference between forward and backward recall. Some scientists including Asch and Ebenholtz believe in the independent association hypothesis think that the equal strengths of forward and <b>backward</b> recall are <b>compatible</b> with their hypothesis because forward and backward recall could be independent but with equal strengths. However associative symmetry theorists interpreted the data to mean that the results fit their hypothesis.|$|R

5|$|A Microsoft Windows {{version of}} the game, ported by Demiurge Studios, was {{released}} on May 28, 2008. This version features optimized controls designed specifically for personal computers, high resolution graphics, a new user interface, and other minor changes. BioWare initially intended to use SecuROM, a digital rights management software which would require online activation after installation and additional authentication checks every ten days. However, the company ultimately decided not to use it after listening to criticism from fans. In 2012, {{five years after the}} release of the original Xbox 360 version, Mass Effect was ported to Sony's PlayStation 3 console by Edge of Reality, featuring some lighting and visual effects improvements. It was released digitally on the PlayStation Network and as part of the Mass Effect Trilogy compilation. In 2015, Mass Effect was added to the list of <b>backward</b> <b>compatible</b> Xbox 360 games on Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|At Gamescom 2010, BioWare {{announced}} that a PlayStation 3 version of the game was in development. Microsoft responded to the announcement that, despite losing the game's exclusivity, the Xbox 360 was still the most appropriate console {{to play the game}} due to the game's compatibility with the original Mass Effect, which was only available on the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 systems at the time. The PlayStation 3 version was released on January 18, 2011 in North America and January 21, 2011 in Europe. Unlike the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions of the game, which span two DVDs, the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 fits on one Blu-ray Disc. The downloadable PlayStation Network version accounted for more than 10% of the game's overall sales on PlayStation 3. As of April 2011, it was reported that both the original Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 combined have sold more than seven million units worldwide. In 2012, a compilation featuring the three main games of the series, titled Mass Effect Trilogy, was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. In 2016, Mass Effect 2 was added to the list of <b>backward</b> <b>compatible</b> Xbox 360 games on Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|The {{title is}} {{considered}} a reboot of the series; instead of using a five-button guitar-shaped game controller, the game shipped with a six-button controller, arranged in two rows of three aimed to provide more realistic fingering positions than the five-button controller. The game includes 42 songs on the game's disc, presented in sets using full motion video taken from the first-person perspective of the lead guitarist as the background visuals to create an immersive experience. Guitar Hero Live does not use traditional downloadable content to expand the game and is not <b>backward</b> <b>compatible</b> with previous songs from Guitar Hero games. Instead, the game includes the online Guitar Hero TV (GHTV) mode modeled after music video channels that players can jump {{in or out of}} at any time, playing through ongoing songs in a curated fashion. GHTV, through in-game rewards and microtransactions, supports the ability to play any song in the library, perform Premium shows where the newest tracks to GHTV will be found, or even unlock all features for a 24-hour period as part of a Party Pass. Two hundred songs were available at the release of the game, with more added over time, averaging about six new songs each week.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was {{released to the public}} on October2, 2006, delivering a 20-30X speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based GROMACS counterparts. It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations. GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of GPGPU software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with DirectX, on April10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client. Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June6. Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on ATI and CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation. Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May25, 2010. While <b>backward</b> <b>compatible</b> with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities, and used OpenMM on top of an OpenCL framework. Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems Linux and macOS, Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the Wine software application. GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in FLOPS. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.|$|E
