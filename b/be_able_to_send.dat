25|$|Napoleon's {{strategy}} for early 1809 {{called for an}} invasion of Portugal by three columns. He ordered Marshal Nicolas Soult's 20,000 troops to advance from the north, General of Division Pierre Belon Lapisse's 9,000 men to {{come in from the}} northeast, and Marshal Claude Victor's soldiers to march from the east. Napoleon's plan called for Soult to capture Porto (Oporto) by 5 February 1809. From there, Soult was supposed to march to Lisbon and occupy it by the 16th of the same month. Meanwhile, Lapisse was directed to move from Salamanca to seize Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, Portugal as soon as Soult's II Corps got to Porto. Victor was ordered to be at Mérida by this time. He was instructed to detach a column from there to advance on Lisbon. The emperor expected that Soult, Lapisse, and Victor would readily <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> messengers to each other, and easily coordinate their operations. This assumption ignored the likelihood that Portuguese and Spanish guerillas would prevent Soult's dispatches from reaching his colleagues.|$|E

[...] Here, Benjamin abandoned Davis's plan to fight on, telling him and the Cabinet that the cause was hopeless.

The party reached Abbeville, South Carolina on May 2, and Benjamin told Davis that he wanted to separate from the presidential party temporarily, and go to the Bahamas to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> instructions to foreign agents before rejoining Davis in Texas. According to historian William C. Davis, [...] "the pragmatic Secretary of State almost certainly never had any intention of returning to the South once gone".

[...] Qualification to participate in the Youth Olympics is determined by the IOC in conjunction with the International Sport Federations (ISF) for the various sports on the program. [...] To ensure that all nations are represented at the YOG the IOC instituted the concept of Universality Places. [...] A certain number of spots in each event are to be left open for athletes from under-represented nations regardless of qualifying marks. [...] This is to ensure that every nation will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> at least four athletes to each Youth Olympic Games. [...] For team tournaments one team per continent will be allowed to compete along with a sixth team either representing the host nation or as proposed by the IF with IOC approval.

Pokémon uploads are restricted to six every twenty-four hours per Game Boy Advance cartridge, and the player must capture the uploaded Pokémon before performing another transfer. Pokémon transferred to Diamond and Pearl this way cannot be sent back to a Game Boy Advance cartridge.

500|$|In July, Clark held {{another set}} of congressional {{hearings}} on the issue, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators John Stennis and James Eastland (both staunch segregationists), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described [...] "an unwritten policy {{on the part of}} those who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death." [...] When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, [...] "We seem to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi."

2500|$|It {{may seem}} from the Latency vs. Channels per bundle table that more {{information}} can be sent at a lower latency. [...] However, {{that is not the}} case.

[...] The Channels per bundle vs. test case latencies table illustrates the bundle capacity for a Biamp AudiaFLEX-CM DSP device. [...] The Rx and Tx columns indicate the absolute maximum number of channels that can be received or transmitted.

2500|$|In {{a country}} with a {{comprehensive}} fire service, fire departments must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> firefighters to emergencies at any hour of day or night, to arrive on the scene within minutes. In urban areas, this means that full-time firefighters usually have shift work, with some providing cover each night. On the other hand, it may not be practical to employ full-time firefighters in villages and isolated small towns, where their services may not be required for days at a time. For this reason, many fire departments have firefighters who spend long periods on call to respond to infrequent emergencies; they may have regular jobs outside of firefighting. Whether they are paid or not varies by country. In the United States and Germany, volunteer fire departments provide most of the cover in rural areas. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, by contrast, actual volunteers are rare. Instead, [...] "retained firefighters" [...] are paid for responding to incidents, along with a small salary for spending long periods of time on call.|$|E
2500|$|Though most of {{this work}} dealt with the {{theoretical}} and experimental relations between propellant, rocket mass, thrust, and velocity, a final section, entitled [...] "Calculation of minimum mass required to raise one pound to an 'infinite' altitude", discussed the possible uses of rockets, not only to reach the upper atmosphere, but to escape from Earth's gravitation altogether. He determined that a rocket with an effective exhaust velocity (see specific impulse) of 7000 feet per second and an initial weight of 602 pounds would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a one-pound payload to an infinite height.

[...] Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with Franz von Gruithuisen, Gauss stated words to the effect that [...] "the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common."
