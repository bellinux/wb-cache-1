5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, {{two years before}} US13 had been {{completed}} as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred {{due to lack of}} funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead of adding divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to resolve the problem of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old concrete roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the concrete surface as needed, adding concrete shoulders, and applying a layer of bituminous concrete, more commonly known as asphalt concrete or <b>blacktop,</b> over the entire width of concrete to provide a wearing surface.|$|E
5|$|In August and October1955, NY344 and the Taconic State Park {{south of}} the road was {{inundated}} with floods damaging the <b>blacktop</b> surface highway. The reconstruction of NY344 was the center point of debate came in late February1956, where Paul Winslow, the executive secretary of the Taconic State Park Commission, who felt it was unimportant if the road was rebuilt. Local officials {{in the town of}} Copake opposed Winslow's view, noting that it only cost $35,000 (1956USD) to reconstruct the road. In April1956, the county contacted State Senator Ernest Hatfield that the road was barricaded in Copake Falls for {{the fact that there was}} no residences and the fact that the Massachusetts side was wiped out by the flooding. In November1956, a bid was let for $49,329 to reconstruct NY344 including the construction of drainage facilities and shoulders along the road. The slated completion date was for July 31, 1957. However, progress on reconstruction of NY344 was nearly complete by March1957.|$|E
25|$|Two-Lane <b>Blacktop</b> {{is notable}} {{as a time}} capsule film of U.S. Route 66 during the pre-Interstate Highway era, and for its stark footage and minimal dialogue.

25|$|Two-Lane <b>Blacktop</b> was {{unavailable}} on video for years because Universal Studios only released a few films from their catalog {{each year and}} it was not a priority. In 1994, Seattle's Scarecrow Video invited Hellman to show the film at their store. They proceeded to collect 2,000 signatures, including Werner Herzog's, for a petition to get the film released on video.

25|$|On August 19, Lloyd {{made his}} first {{televised}} appearance in six months, this time on Thunder {{in the first of}} several promos as Coach Buzz Stern, featuring longtime independent wrestler Luther Biggs. The clips were filmed at the WCW Power Plant and served to introduce the storyline of Stern choosing the clumsy Biggs as his protege, and aired until the end of September, when Biggs was pinned by Bobby Eaton in his in-ring debut on Thunder; Stern put Biggs in a postmatch full nelson as punishment. Over the following month, Stern served as Biggs' manager for only three additional matches: a squash loss to Meng on Thunder, a pinfall victory over Dave Burkhead on Saturday Night, and a match against Barry Darsow (wrestling as <b>Blacktop</b> Bully) on Worldwide, which Biggs won only after Stern's outside interference. Though the Stern character was inspired by Lloyd's days as a high school football coach prior to his WCW career, and had received buildup in Mark Madden's weekly WCW.com column, he received an indifferent reception from fans, and after Lloyd himself wrestled his only match as Stern in a November 4 Thunder loss to Eddie Guerrero, the angle was shelved and both Stern and Biggs were removed from television. Lloyd was one of many wrestlers released by the company on November 21, 1999 as part of a cost-cutting measure.|$|E

5000|$|While {{he spoke}} in rural Marthaville in Natchitoches Parish, where his {{great-grandfather}} had once taught school, Lafargue accused Senator Long of having broken campaign promises from just two years earlier. Specifically, Lafargue claimed that Long failed to work to lower federal income tax rates and to obtain funds to widen U.S. Highway 71 between Shreveport and New Orleans and U.S. Highway 80 from Shreveport to Monroe. Lafargue said that some <b>blacktopping</b> had been undertaken on Highway 71 but no improvements then to Highway 80: [...] "So we have high taxes out of Russell's pledges to work for lower taxes.... We have <b>blacktopping</b> of concrete roads out of his pledges to make them into four-lane highways." [...] Lafargue claimed that the movement of state welfare funds proposed by the Earl Long administration was for [...] "political highway bribes in behalf of Russell Long now and for Long candidates in state elections later....

25|$|It was in {{this state}} of mind that Peckinpah agreed to make Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Based on the {{screenplay}} by Rudolph Wurlitzer, who had previously penned Two-Lane <b>Blacktop,</b> a film admired by Peckinpah, the director was convinced {{that he was about}} to make his definitive statement on the Western genre. The script offered Peckinpah the opportunity to explore themes that appealed to him: two former partners forced by changing times onto opposite sides of the law, manipulated by corrupt economic interests. Peckinpah rewrote the screenplay, establishing Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid as friends, and attempted to weave an epic tragedy from the historical legend. Filmed on location in the Mexican state of Durango, the film starred James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson in the title roles, with a huge supporting cast including Bob Dylan, who composed the film's music, Jason Robards, R. G. Armstrong, Richard Jaeckel, Jack Elam, Chill Wills, Katy Jurado, Matt Clark, L. Q. Jones, Rutanya Alda, Slim Pickens, and Harry Dean Stanton. From the beginning, Peckinpah began to have clashes with MGM and its president James Aubrey, known for his stifling of creative interests and eventual dismantling of the historic movie company. Numerous production difficulties, including an outbreak of influenza and malfunctioning cameras, combined with Peckinpah's growing problems with alcohol, resulted in one of the most troubled productions of his career. Principal photography finished 21 days behind schedule and $1.6 million over budget. Enraged, Aubrey severely cut Peckinpah's film from 124 to 106 minutes, resulting in Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid being released in a truncated version largely disowned by cast and crew members. Critics complained that the film was incoherent, and the experience soured Peckinpah forever on Hollywood. In 1988, however, Peckinpah's director's cut was released on video and led to a reevaluation, with many critics hailing it as a mistreated classic and one of the era's best films. Filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese, have praised the film as one of the greatest modern Westerns.|$|E

The $19.7million <b>blacktop</b> project spanned from Tingri County of Xigazê Prefecture to the Everest Base Camp. In March 2008, China banned mountaineers from climbing its side of Mount Everest, and later persuaded the Nepalese government to close their side as well, officially citing environmental concerns. It also reflected concerns by the Chinese government that Tibet activists may try to disrupt its plans to carry the Olympic torch up the world's tallest peak.|$|E

500|$|Refn's {{inspiration}} for Drive came partly from reading Grimms' Fairy Tales, and {{his goal was}} to make [...] "a fairy tale that takes Los Angeles as the background," [...] with The Driver as the hero. To play with the common theme of fairy tales, The Driver protects what is good {{while at the same time}} killing degenerate people in violent ways. Refn was also inspired by films such as Point Blank (1967), Two-Lane <b>Blacktop</b> (1971), The Driver (1978) and Thief (1981). Jean-Pierre Melville's crime productions influenced the cinematography. Amini's script propensity imposes [...] "a kind of sideways moral code," [...] where even those who comply with it are almost never rewarded for their efforts, as seen when The Driver helps Standard with Irene and her son's best interests in mind. In their vehicles, the characters not only make escapes or commit murder, but try to find peace and search for romance.|$|E
