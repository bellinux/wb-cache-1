5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows in the <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> nine sash windows {{on each of the}} ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E

50|$|By the 1790s only {{a single}} low wall {{remained}} to be seen above ground, and that was at risk of falling. Some workmen employed to underpin this wall discovered the buried castle <b>basements</b> <b>and</b> foundations, which ran off from the wall. Realising the likely extent of these <b>basements,</b> <b>and</b> the possibility of treasures within, they brought their discovery {{to the attention of}} Sir William Jerningham. Jerningham immediately ordered all the foundations <b>and</b> <b>basements</b> to be uncovered, and the whole mound to be cleared of overgrowth.|$|R
5|$|By 1916, the Princess {{had stopped}} booking live acts and was {{focusing}} {{exclusively on the}} more profitable cinema side of the business.

His granddaughter Susan Morrow would manage the Princess from 1981 to 1994.|$|E

In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera {{from the viewpoint of}} a distant observer to that of the fighter.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor.

5|$|Camak House, at 279 Meigs Street, Athens, Georgia, {{was built}} in about 1834 by James Camak and {{featured}} in Georgia's early railroad history.

Both main floors have four rooms; the stairwell has a mahogany railing, and moldings and trim were made using a Greek key pattern. After long service as a family home, it was used as a Masonic Lodge before being bought by Coca-Cola Enterprises. In 1975 Camak House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but the building had by then fallen into disrepair. It was restored and used as the offices of a law firm. As of December 2011, it is for sale.|$|E
5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church <b>basement,</b> <b>and,</b> in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E

The owner of the house, Jerry Jempson (Jim Grollman), literally calls her at the house while she is investigating and agrees to a police interview, during which he acts extremely nervous and is eventually charged with the murder.|$|E
