5|$|<b>Bumblebees</b> are {{important}} pollinators of both crops and wildflowers. Because <b>bumblebees</b> do not overwinter the entire colony, {{they do not}} stockpile honey, and therefore are not useful as honey producers. <b>Bumblebees</b> are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators, among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot. Commercial production began in 1987, when Roland De Jonghe founded the Biobest company; in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares of tomatoes. The industry grew quickly, starting with other companies in the Netherlands. Bumblebee nests, mainly of buff-tailed <b>bumblebees,</b> are produced in at least 30 factories around the world; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe; Turkey is a major producer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bumblebees,</b> {{despite their}} ability to sting, are eaten by certain predators. Nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole, {{including}} any adults present. Adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in North America. In Europe, birds including bee-eaters and shrikes capture adult <b>bumblebees</b> on the wing; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take <b>bumblebees,</b> while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers.|$|E
50|$|Bombus cingulatus, {{the small}} tree <b>bumblebee,</b> is {{a species of}} <b>bumblebee</b> found in Eurasia. Its {{appearance}} {{is similar to the}} tree <b>bumblebee</b> Bombus hypnorum, but it is somewhat smaller, and generally establishes smaller nests. The small tree <b>bumblebee</b> can also be separated from the tree <b>bumblebee</b> by having darker hair forming a small band between the wing knots, which the tree <b>bumblebee</b> lacks.|$|R
50|$|The {{bilberry}} <b>bumblebee</b> or mountain <b>bumblebee,</b> Bombus monticola, is {{a species}} of <b>bumblebee</b> found in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Bombus mixtus is {{a species}} of <b>bumblebee.</b> It is native to western North America, where it occurs in western Canada and the United States. It is also disjunct in the Great Lakes region. It is known {{commonly}} as the fuzzy-horned <b>bumblebee,</b> tricoloured <b>bumblebee,</b> orange-belted <b>bumblebee,</b> and mixed <b>bumblebee.</b>|$|R
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, <b>bumblebees</b> feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. <b>Bumblebees</b> gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some <b>bumblebees</b> rob nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. <b>Bumblebees</b> are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>bumblebees</b> {{are social}} insects that form colonies {{with a single}} queen. The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 {{individuals}} in a nest. Female <b>bumblebees</b> can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals. Cuckoo <b>bumblebees</b> do not make nests; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers.|$|E
5|$|Pollen {{is removed}} from flowers {{deliberately}} or incidentally by <b>bumblebees.</b> Incidental removal occurs when <b>bumblebees</b> {{come in contact with}} the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male <b>bumblebees</b> do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen. <b>Bumblebees</b> are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.|$|E
5000|$|The broken-belted <b>bumblebee</b> or Ilfracombe <b>bumblebee,</b> Bombus soroeensis, is {{a species}} of <b>bumblebee</b> [...] present in most of Europe and parts of Asia.|$|R
50|$|As {{in other}} cuckoo bees, {{the queen of}} this species enters the nest of a host species, kills the {{resident}} queen, and lives and breeds in the nest tended by the host workers. Host species of this bee include the white-shouldered <b>bumblebee</b> (B. appositus), yellow <b>bumblebee</b> (B. fervidus), yellow-fronted <b>bumblebee</b> (B. flavifrons), Nevada <b>bumblebee</b> (B. nevadensis), and orange-belted <b>bumblebee</b> (B. ternarius).|$|R
5000|$|Buff-tailed <b>bumblebee</b> {{or large}} earth <b>bumblebee,</b> Bombus terrestris ...|$|R
5|$|To develop, {{the larvae}} must be fed both nectar for {{carbohydrates}} and pollen for protein. <b>Bumblebees</b> feed nectar to the larvae by chewing {{a small hole}} in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen {{in one of two}} ways, depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making <b>bumblebees</b> create pockets of pollen {{at the base of the}} brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Pollen-storing <b>bumblebees</b> keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae.|$|E
5|$|Worker {{policing}} also {{occurs in}} the primitively eusocial <b>bumblebees</b> such as Bombus terrestris.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bumblebees</b> are Northern Hemisphere animals. When {{red clover}} was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. <b>Bumblebees</b> are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed <b>bumblebees</b> naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 miles away, in 1992.|$|E

After {{learning}} Sam Witwicky is going to buy a used car, <b>Bumblebee</b> goes to Bobby Bolivia's Used Carlot and is bought by Sam. Later, Sam and his girlfriend, Mikaela Banes, are attacked by a Decepticon, Barricade, but <b>Bumblebee</b> saves them. <b>Bumblebee</b> fights Barricade, while Sam and Mikaela escape. After defeating the Decepticon, <b>Bumblebee</b> finds Sam and Mikaela, who thank him for saving them. Optimus contacts <b>Bumblebee,</b> telling him that Sam has the artifact that contains the location of the AllSpark, and <b>Bumblebee</b> must protect Sam at all costs.|$|R

5|$|<b>Bumblebees</b> are {{parasitised}} by tracheal mites, Locustacarus buchneri; protozoans including Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi; and microsporidians including Nosema bombi and Nosema ceranae. The tree bumblebee B. hypnorum {{has spread}} into the United Kingdom despite hosting {{high levels of}} a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees' attempts to establish colonies. Deformed wing virus {{has been found to}} affect 11% of <b>bumblebees</b> in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bumblebees</b> of the {{subgenus}} Psithyrus (known as 'cuckoo bumblebees', and formerly {{considered a}} separate genus) are brood parasites, sometimes called kleptoparasites, {{in the colonies}} of other <b>bumblebees,</b> and have {{lost the ability to}} collect pollen. Before finding and invading a host colony, a Psithyrus female, such as that of the Psithyrus species of B. sylvestris, feeds directly from flowers. Once she has infiltrated a host colony, the Psithyrus female kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young. Usually, cuckoo <b>bumblebees</b> can be described as queen-intolerant inquilines, since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring, though some species, such as B. bohemicus, actually enjoy increased success when they leave the host queen alive.|$|E

50|$|Bombus pensylvanicus, the American <b>bumblebee</b> or Sonoran <b>bumblebee,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>bumblebee</b> native to North America. It occurs in eastern Canada, {{throughout}} much of the United States, and much of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|In Cyber Missions 1, <b>Bumblebee</b> and Ironhide are {{protecting}} NEST Command {{when two}} Decepticons, Soundwave and Bludgeon invade the area. Ironhide goes outside {{to deal with}} Bludgeon, while Soundwave ambushes <b>Bumblebee</b> from inside. <b>Bumblebee</b> is easily thrown down by Soundwave. <b>Bumblebee</b> tries to fire a shot from his shoulder gun, but Soundwave redirects the acoustic energy back at him. <b>Bumblebee</b> deduces that he cannot deflect several rounds at once, and begins rapidly firing at Soundwave. The Decepticon {{is not able to}} take in so much, and finally falls. Later, <b>Bumblebee</b> traps Soundwave in a magnetically sealed bubble in Cyber Missions 2.|$|R

5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters <b>bumblebees</b> from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that <b>bumblebees</b> leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has visited a flower. <b>Bumblebees</b> rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E
5|$|Of 19 {{species of}} native nestmaking <b>bumblebees</b> and six species of cuckoo <b>bumblebees</b> {{formerly}} widespread in Britain, three have been extirpated, eight are in serious decline, and only six remain widespread. Similar declines {{have been reported}} in Ireland, with four species designated endangered, and another two considered vulnerable to extinction. A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large-scale changes to the countryside, resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they have}} {{collected}} nectar and pollen, female workers {{return to the}} nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honeybees, <b>bumblebees</b> only store a few days' worth of food, so are much more vulnerable to food shortages. Male <b>bumblebees</b> collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs.|$|E

5|$|Queen {{and worker}} <b>bumblebees</b> can sting. Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's sting lacks barbs, so the bee can sting {{repeatedly}} without injuring itself; {{by the same}} token, the sting is not left in the wound. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may sting in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo <b>bumblebees</b> aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.|$|E
5|$|A {{bumblebee}} (also written bumble bee) is {{a member}} of the genus Bombus, part of Apidae, one of the bee families. This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini, though a few extinct related genera (e.g., Calyptapis) are known from fossils. Over 250 species of bumblebee are known. They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America where a few lowland tropical species have been identified. European <b>bumblebees</b> have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania. The brood parasitic or cuckoo <b>bumblebees</b> have sometimes been classified as a subgenus or genus, Psithyrus, but are now usually treated as members of Bombus.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. <b>Bumblebees</b> must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. <b>Bumblebees</b> have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
