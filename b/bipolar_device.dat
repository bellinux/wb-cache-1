40|$|One of the {{requirements}} for choosing a proper power electronic device for a converter is that it must possess a low specific on-resistance. The specific on-resistance of a <b>bipolar</b> <b>device</b> {{is related to the}} base width and doping concentration of the lightly doped drift region. This means that the doping concentration and the width of the lowdoped base region in a <b>bipolar</b> <b>device</b> must be carefully considered to achieve a desired avalanche breakdown voltage and on-resistance. In order to determine the technological parameters of a semiconductor device, a one dimensional analysis is used to calculate the minimum depletion layer width, Wmin, for a given breakdown voltage, VBD, in Si, SiC and GaN p + n- n + structures. Further investigation is done to determine the optimum width of associated depletion layers for different blocking voltages to achieve a minimal forward conduction voltage drop...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Bipolar</b> {{semiconductor}} <b>devices</b> {{are often}} used as switches in very high power electronic circuits and systems. They have replaced the old conventional gas filled tubes and vacuum devices in many applications. This is mainly {{due to the fact}} that solid-state devices are more efficient, smaller in size, cheaper and more reliable. In addition, solid-state devices are considered environmental friendly, since they do not contain nasty gases and toxic materials used in old devices. The power level requirements and switching frequency are continually increasing in the power electronic industry, and this demands larger and faster switching devices. As a result, both bipolar and unipolar semiconductor devices have undergone continued improvement in current and voltage ratings, and switching speed. The main advantage of <b>bipolar</b> <b>devices</b> is their low conduction losses due to conductivity modulation, but their main disadvantage is the high switching losses which is due to minority carrier injection. The Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) combines the advantages of both unipolar and <b>bipolar</b> <b>devices.</b> It has a simple gate drive circuit like that of the MOSFET, with high current and low saturation voltage capability of bipolar transistor. The main problem remains with the relatively long tail turn-off current. To reduce the turn-off time of the IGBT and other <b>bipolar</b> <b>devices,</b> different lifetime control techniques and structural changes have been developed and used. Details of these and new techniques developed by using auxiliary electronic circuits for reducing the turn-off time and increasing the switching speed of <b>bipolar</b> semiconductor <b>devices</b> are presented in this paper.

40|$|In this paper, a {{structure}} named Schottky extension of anode (SEA) is proposed for BJT/diode power <b>bipolar</b> integrated <b>devices.</b> With BE reverse biased, it {{can serve as}} isolation between the main transistor and the internal diode of the integrated device and depress the hole injection from p-anode to-ward the region near or under the p-base, thus improve the reverse recovery of the internal diode. On the other hand, the forming method of this structure is completely compatible with the conventional processing of power <b>bipolar</b> <b>devices,</b> and no additional processing steps, difficulties and chip areas are needed. Therefore, this structure, while performing its good function, completely retains the low-cost and simple-processing advantages of power <b>bipolar</b> <b>devices.</b> Experimental results show that with the structure parameters given in this paper, an internal diode with the SEA structure can achieve an improvement of about 20 %, compared with a conventional structure, in terms of resistive and inductive reverse recovery. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R
