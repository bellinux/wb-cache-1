5|$|Charismatics {{trace their}} {{historical}} origins to the charismatic {{movement of the}} 1960s and 1970s. They are distinguished from Pentecostals <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> allow for differing viewpoints on whether Spirit baptism is subsequent to conversion and whether tongues is always a sign of receiving the baptism.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive to}} capture wildlife, and {{particularly}} slow lorises, is increasingly dominated by demands from wealthy urban areas, replacing the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. In {{the case of}} long-lived primates, such as the slow lorises, populations replenish themselves slowly. Slow lorises are particularly vulnerable <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> freeze when spotted. Lastly, increased access to new technologies, such as improved transport, guns, wire snares, and spotlights, have facilitated hunting and pushed extraction levels beyond the point of sustainability. These new factors threaten slow loris survival.|$|E
50|$|For the Hamburg Harbour railway {{with its}} tight curves, the ten-coupled steam {{locomotives}} of Class 87 were built with Luttermöller axles, front and rear. The 16 locomotives of this class were however retired again {{as early as}} 1954, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> overheat at higher speeds and could therefore only be used for shunting duties.|$|R
50|$|The ten-coupled Class 87 engines {{with their}} two Luttermöller {{cogwheel}} axles were built for operations on the very tight curves of Hamburg Harbour's railways. The 16 locomotives of this class were however retired as early as 1954 again <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> overheat at higher speeds and could only be used for shunting. As a replacement the Class 82, a new locomotive with Beugniot bogies was used.|$|R
2500|$|Ainsworth {{herself was}} the first to find {{difficulties}} in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed 'tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> occur chiefly in the separation episodes and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be prodromal to crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> vanish if and when crying breaks through'. Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behaviour was [...] "without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behaviour, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress".|$|R
5|$|Most {{observed}} events (70%) have a {{duration of}} greater than two seconds and {{are classified as}} long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute {{the majority of the}} population and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have the brightest afterglows, they have been observed in much greater detail than their short counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a core-collapse supernova as well, unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars. Long GRB afterglow observations, at high redshift, are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E
5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars debate {{how much}} contact the two subcultures had during the 1960s. Hebdige argues that mods and rockers had {{little contact with}} each other <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> come from {{different}} regions of England (mods from London and rockers from rural areas), and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had [...] "totally disparate goals and lifestyles". [...] Mark Gilman, however, claims that both mods and rockers could be seen at football matches.|$|R
50|$|However, {{for many}} people, supertitles {{interfered}} with their enjoyment of a performance, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> find themselves following the titles and not giving their full {{attention to the}} stage. This problem was solved {{by the development of}} an electronic libretto system, which utilizes individual screens placed on the back of each seat, thus allowing patrons either to view a translation or to switch them off during the performance.|$|R
25|$|Khosrow {{promoted}} honest {{government officials}} based on trust and honesty, rather than corrupt nobles and magi. The small landowning deghans were favored over the high nobles <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be more trustworthy and owned {{their loyalty to}} the Shah for {{their position in the}} bureaucracy. The rise of deghans became the backbone of the empire <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were now held the majority of land and positions in local and provincial administration.|$|R
25|$|Small {{molecules}} can {{be stable}} in radical form, oxygen O2 {{is a good}} example. Such systems are quite rare <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be rather reactive.|$|E
25|$|Temperature {{anomalies}} {{are useful}} for deriving average surface temperatures <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be highly correlated over large distances (of the order of 1000km). In other words, anomalies are representative of temperature changes over large areas and distances. By comparison, absolute temperatures vary markedly over even short distances.|$|E
25|$|Plastic chopsticks are {{relatively}} inexpensive, low in temperature conduction, and resistant to wear. Plastic chopsticks {{are not as}} effective as wood and bamboo for picking up food, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be slippery. Also, plastic chopsticks cannot be used for cooking, since high temperatures may damage the chopsticks and produce toxic compounds.|$|E

25|$|Teaching machines, {{though perhaps}} rudimentary, were not rigid {{instruments}} of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved {{based upon the}} students' performance. For example, if a student made many incorrect responses, the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions—the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently if they make few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not well-suited for teaching machines <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> increase student mistakes, and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.|$|R
50|$|Thor, Odin and {{the other}} deities were also {{mentioned}} in Icelandic sagas and Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda which preserved much information of their cults and myths. However, it cannot be ascertained that the religious practices and legends of the pagan Icelanders and Danes were identical. Reports by Adam of Bremen, Saxo Grammaticus and other medieval Christian authors of the pagan Danes' religion are {{to be treated with}} caution, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> attribute obscene and cruel rituals to non-Christians.|$|R
25|$|A rare-earth element (REE) or rare-earth metal (REM), {{as defined}} by IUPAC, {{is one of a}} set of {{seventeen}} chemical elements in the periodic table, specifically the fifteen lanthanides, as well as scandium and yttrium. Scandium and yttrium are considered rare-earth elements <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> occur in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides and exhibit similar chemical properties.|$|E
25|$|Particularly {{problematic}} local trees {{include the}} sycamore, lime, sweet and horse chestnut, ash, and poplar, which regrow or coppice after cutting back, and have large, flat leaves, which {{stick to the}} line and cause severe slippery rail. Other types of tree that cause problems are quick-growing, pioneering trees, or those producing {{a substantial amount of}} leaves. Poplars are particularly troubling <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> shed limbs.|$|E
25|$|Pupation occurs {{relatively}} {{close to}} the food source of the S. nudiseta larvae <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> not typically migrate very far. S. nudiseta larvae {{are one of the}} few species that can successfully pupate in a confined location. Besides the encasing cocoon, the outside environment is also helpful to the protection of this puparium since dust and soil particles have been found coating the outside surface.|$|E
50|$|The Kadizadeli {{movement}} {{erupted in}} response to the challenge that the Sufis and their ulema supports had {{come to be known as}} the standard for mosque preachers. The Kadızadeli vaizan were not men from the ulema ranking hierarchy. They were mosque preachers that corresponded to an assortment of less significant religious career pursuits. The Kadızadeli vaizan were extremely popular amongst the populace and persuasive preachers <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> remark on the modern-day scene, often involving distinct individuals into account.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{biggest hit}} {{single in the}} United Kingdom, 1980's [...] "The Greatest Cockney Rip-Off", was a parody of Sham 69's song [...] "Hersham Boys". Other Cockney Rejects songs were less commercial, partly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be about hard-edged topics such as street {{fighting}} or football hooliganism. Other singles {{to appear in the}} UK were [...] "Bad Man," [...] "We Can Do Anything," [...] "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles [...] " [...] and [...] "We Are the Firm" [...] — all from 1980.|$|R
5000|$|His {{position}} was {{also influenced by}} his beliefs about race. In a May 1891 article on Italian immigration, Lodge expressed his concern that immigration by [...] "the races who have peopled the United States" [...] was declining, while [...] "the immigration of people removed from us in race and blood" [...] was on the rise. He considered northern Italians superior to southern Italians, not only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be better educated, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were more [...] "Teutonic" [...] than their southern counterparts, whose immigration he sought to restrict.|$|R
25|$|A {{parabolic}} microphone uses a {{parabolic reflector}} {{to collect and}} focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, {{in much the same}} way that a parabolic antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, eavesdropping, law enforcement, and even espionage. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.|$|E
25|$|Consolidation is {{the process}} in which the fabric of the ceramic is {{strengthened}} by introducing a material into the fabric that will bind together. The most common ceramics that need consolidation are excavated pieces <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have lost their bonding fabrics due to leeching or have absorbed soluble salts. A consolidant works in two ways: it either links to the particles in the ceramic chemically or it may form a support system mechanically without reacting with the fabric itself. Chemical consolidants that are used in modern conservation include isocyanates, silanes, siloxnes, and methyl methacrylates, however the consolidants that create a mechanical support system are used more frequently.|$|E
25|$|Anti-hunting campaigners long urged hunts {{to retain}} their {{tradition}} and equestrian sport by drag hunting, following an artificial scent. Drag hunting involves hunting a scent that has been laid (dragged) over a course with a defined beginning and end, before the day's hunting. The scent, usually a combination of aniseed oils and possibly animal meats or fox urine, is dragged along the terrain for distances usually of 10 or more miles. However, drag hunting is disliked by some advocates of quarry hunting because the trail is pre-determined, thereby eliminating the uncertainty present in the live quarry hunt and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be faster. Supporters contend that while drag hunts can be fast, this need {{not be the case}} if the scent line is broken up so that the hounds have to search an area to pick up the line.|$|E
50|$|Actual {{analysis}} of shipping losses in World War I disproved all these arguments, {{at least so}} far as they applied to transatlantic and other long-distance traffic. Ships sailing in convoys were far less likely to be sunk, even when not provided with any escort at all. The loss of productivity due to convoy delays was small compared with the loss of productivity due to ships being sunk. Ports could deal more easily with convoys <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> arrive on schedule and so loading and unloading could be planned.|$|R
5000|$|Very {{detailed}} records {{exist for}} the Venetian mint. In the late Middle Ages, the dies used to create tornesellos lasted as follows: [...] "hammer" [...] die, ~17,000 strikes; [...] "anvil" [...] die, 36,000 strikes. The mint made an average of 20,000 coins per day, so they were making one hammer die a day and one anvil die every other day. The [...] "hammer" [...] dies wore out quicker <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be smaller and were hit directly with a hammer, leading to severe mushrooming on the tops.|$|R
5000|$|ECNs and exchanges {{are usually}} known to traders by a three- or four-letter designators, which {{identify}} the ECN or exchange on Level II stock screens. The {{first of these}} was Instinet (or [...] "inet"), {{which was founded in}} 1969 as a way for major institutions to bypass the increasingly cumbersome and expensive NYSE, also allowing them to trade during hours when the exchanges were closed. Early ECNs such as Instinet were very unfriendly <b>to</b> small investors, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> give large institutions better prices than were available to the public. This resulted in a fragmented and sometimes illiquid market.|$|R
25|$|One {{problem with}} wave heating is {{delivery}} of the heat to the appropriate place. Magneto-acoustic waves cannot carry sufficient energy upward through the chromosphere to the corona, both because of the low pressure present in the chromosphere and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be reflected back to the photosphere. Alfvén waves can carry enough energy, but do not dissipate that energy rapidly enough once they enter the corona. Waves in plasmas are notoriously difficult to understand and describe analytically, but computer simulations, carried out by Thomas Bogdan and colleagues in 2003, seem to show that Alfvén waves can transmute into other wave modes {{at the base of}} the corona, providing a pathway that can carry large amounts of energy from the photosphere through the chromosphere and transition region and finally into the corona where it dissipates it as heat.|$|E
25|$|The border city of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, offers big-city {{amenities}} like museums, a zoo, {{a sports}} convention center, {{and an international}} airport. Visitors cross by foot or car from Calexico, California in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs {{are part of the}} draw for the city's tourists. Many shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are also located in walking distance from the border. Also many residents from California, Arizona and Nevada look for medical and dental services in Mexicali, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be less expensive than those in the United States. Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college-aged Southern Californians. The town was near the epicenter of the 2010 Baja California earthquake (on Easter Sunday, April 4, 2010).|$|E
500|$|Abyssal plains {{were not}} {{recognized}} as distinct physiographic {{features of the}} sea floor until the late 1940s and, until very recently, none had been studied on a systematic basis. They are poorly preserved in the sedimentary record, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be consumed by the subduction process.|$|E
50|$|Baley then {{states that}} only one Auroran could have told Amadiro about the relationship: Jander himself. Then, he gives the {{solution}} to the mystery: that in Gladia's absence, Amadiro questioned and tested Jander via trimensional viewing (telepresence). Daneel was part of Fastolfe's establishment, and thus well guarded, but Jander was at the house of the much less skilled Gladia, thus questioning him for reverse engineering purposes was much easier. Gremionis was encouraged <b>to</b> court Gladia <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> take long walks together, allowing Amadiro more time for his testing. The sabotage to the car was intended to capture Daneel and complete the analysis.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the critics}} found {{so much in}} common between Novi Split and other acts that <b>they</b> loved <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> love Keep Moving. Grant Capes at Indieworkshop said exactly that when he declared: [...] "David Jerkovitch {{instantly}} grabs you and continuously fingers you {{for the remainder of}} the record with its effortless pop and rock magic. You could draw all sorts of analogies to other more famous (?) indie bands, but would that really tell the whole story of this incredible album?" [...] Indeed, according to Capes, [...] "I guarantee that later you will be using David J. references to compare how amazing the new Dntel Service record is…" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1880, James Pendergast, {{the oldest}} son of Irish immigrants, moved to Kansas City's West Bottoms. He {{worked at a}} local iron foundry until he bought a bar with money he won from betting on a longshot horse ("Climax") at a local race track. From his new bar, Pendergast began {{networking}} with local leaders and soon built a powerful faction in the Jackson County Democratic Party. Pendergast's faction was called the [...] "goats," [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were backed by those living in the hills above the river. His chief rival were the [...] "rabbits" [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> come from {{the area around the}} rivers. The lead of this faction was Joe Shannon.|$|R
