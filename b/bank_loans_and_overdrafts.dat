40|$|The study {{sought to}} find out {{financial}} challenges encountered by retail SMEs operating in a multi-currency environment with particular reference to Gweru Urban in Zimbabwe. The replacement of the Zimbabwean dollar by foreign currencies {{gave birth to a}} multi-currency environment. The adoption of multi-currencies was necessitated by the need to curb inflationary pressures which characterized the economy up to April 2009. Convenience sampling was used to select 150 retail SMEs. The data were collected using questionnaires. The questionnaires were filled either by the owners of the SMEs or their managers. The study established that retail SMEs were facing several financial challenges in a multi- currency environment. The challenges included shortage of liquidity in the economy which resulted in low sales due to depressed consumer demand. In turn low sales negatively affected the profitability of the SMEs. High interest rates constrained the ability of SMEs to raise finance through <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>overdrafts.</b> The use of personal savings and retained profits as sources of finance implies that SMEs could only raise limited amounts of capital. The financial position of the SMEs was also worsened by high operating expenses and lack of trade credit. In light of these financial challenges the study recommends that the Zimbabwean government should adopt a long-term policy {{on the use of the}} foreign currency. It is also imperative that the government of Zimbabwe swallows its pride and officially makes arrangements with South Africa or the United States of America in order to have an increased supply of the rand or US dollar. The SMEs should also devise survival strategies such as formation of strategic alliances and voluntary chains...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{corporate}} debt type, maturity and priority structures and their determinants are not homogeneous across firms of different size. Small firms use leasing <b>and</b> <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>overdraft</b> while large companies rely on <b>loan</b> capital, convertible <b>and</b> subordinated <b>loans.</b> Small companies depend more on secured debt while large companies' debt is unsecured and subordinated. The {{results show that}} 70 per cent of small companies' debt is short-term, while 64 per cent of the larger companies' debt is long-term. The regression results suggest that debt structure of large companies is significantly affected by agency cost measures while that of small companies is driven by profitability.

40|$|The {{present study}} explores {{the concept of}} {{liquidity}} and how liquidity ratios can be employed depending on each company´s needs and characteristics. Numerous authors were analyzed, which described years back the first concepts of liquidity, its usefulness and importance. The paper also mentions {{the best ways to}} measure it, and the liquidity ratios preferred by most authors, such as working capital which measures a company´s efficiency and current financial health. A section of the paper describes the different determinants of liquidity such as size and age, and how these affect companies, especially in developing countries. Furthermore, there is a thorough analysis regarding profitability, and how these important aspects of a company are interrelated. Many authors describe a trade-off, given that a key factor that determines a company’s profitability is its level of liquidity, but there must be an appropriate balance. The study points out the negative effects that poor liquidity management can cause –by having {{too much or too little}} liquid assets- such as excessive <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>overdraft</b> fees, or, on the other hand high maintenance costs and low investments, which directly affect a company’s profitability, and how this is more common in developing countries. Moreover, alternative ways of financing are described, which can be convenient substitutes for companies that don’t have a large amounts of assets and strong structures they can rely on, plus limited access to <b>bank</b> <b>loans.</b> These include factoring and collateral, which tend to be least used in developing countries including Ecuador...|$|R
40|$|Using the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption (HFCS) data, {{this paper}} {{identifies}} the key differences in borrowing behaviour between core and peripheral nations. As such, {{we focus on}} non-collateralized debt such as credit card <b>loans,</b> <b>bank</b> <b>overdrafts</b> <b>and</b> other forms of non-collateralized debt, which reflect daily borrowing behaviour more closely than does mortgage debt. We examine the differences in levels and prevalence of these debts, and break down these differences into two major components: financial perceptions and the economic environment. We aim to explain to what extent these influences contribute to the differences in debt ownership and levels of holding between core and peripheral countries in Europe. We found that differences in financial perceptions do contribute to the differences in debt in a significant way, while the economic environment contributes little to this outcome. Households in the European periphery are much more conducive to debt {{if they have the}} same financial perceptions as those in the core countries in Europe...|$|R
