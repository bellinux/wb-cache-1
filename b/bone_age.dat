25|$|Growth {{retardation}} may occur, as {{height gain}} may slow and can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. In such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed. Height potential is normally preserved if the duration {{and severity of}} illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed <b>bone</b> <b>age</b> (especially prior to a <b>bone</b> <b>age</b> of approximately 15 years), as hypogonadism may partially counteract the effects of undernutrition on height by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls. Appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential, and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects, due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing adipose tissue levels compared to premorbid levels. In some cases, especially where onset is before puberty, complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible.|$|E

40|$|Humans have {{a unique}} {{evolutionary}} trajectory that allows life past reproductive viability. Antagonistic pleiotropy and resource economics lead to the deterioration of physiological processes once beyond years in which natural selection is effective. As individuals <b>age,</b> <b>bone</b> becomes increasingly fragile and prone to fracture. Due to heterogeneity in human <b>aging</b> patterns, <b>bone</b> <b>aging</b> is a highly variable process. The ability to predict, diagnose, and treat age-related bone fragility has become an area of major focus in medical research, however, there is little consensus in the field as to the mechanisms behind <b>bone</b> <b>aging.</b> The lack of clarity in the causes of <b>bone</b> <b>aging</b> makes individualized medical approaches difficult. Studies of these mechanisms are complicated by the inherent variability in human biology and environment. The use of murine models provides greater experimental control but has previously not recognized the presence of variability in aging. This work provides evidence for the utility of multiple inbred mouse strains in aging research. This approach provides high level of control but also allows investigation into the causes behind variable aging outcomes. The first aim of this project establishes differences in <b>bone</b> <b>aging</b> in the femora of four inbred mouse strains to demonstrate the range of intraspecies variability in <b>bone</b> <b>aging.</b> The BALB/c and C 57 Bl/ 6 strains lose mechanical functionality with age but in different ways. The CBA/J and DBA/ 2 strains maintain mechanical integrity with aging using different strategies. Different rates of remodeling, as well as mineralization, lead to the variation in mechanical function changes with age in the four strains. The second aim investigates the applicability of comparative mouse models of aging to humans. This aim applies modern theories of aging to the variable bone outcomes. The third aim demonstrates the potential influence age-related changes in mechanoresponse have on <b>bone</b> <b>aging</b> using a tibial axial loading model. The data in this thesis demonstrate the variability in <b>bone</b> <b>aging</b> in a mouse model, providing potential insight into human inter-individual aging variations. The work presented also provides a platform for future aging experimentation investigating factors that influence how well <b>bone</b> <b>ages...</b>|$|R

It is not known, however, whether these potential associations are caused by the IVF procedure in itself, by adverse obstetric outcomes associated with IVF, by the genetic origin of the children or by yet unknown IVF-associated causes.

25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the <b>bone</b> <b>age</b> is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a boy (or girl) with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these children will have already had central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing bone maturation.|$|E

40|$|A {{major medical}} {{challenge}} in the elderly is osteoporosis and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including bone. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteoporosis, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to <b>bone</b> <b>aging.</b> We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as models for human <b>bone</b> <b>aging,</b> including mutants in Werner helicase (Wrn−/−), telomerase (Terc−/−) and Wrn−/−Terc−/− double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young Terc−/− and Wrn−/−Terc−/− mice have decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical bone, young Terc−/− and Wrn−/−Terc−/− mice have increased cortical thinning, and increased porosity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in Terc−/− and Wrn−/−Terc−/− mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of osteoblasts in aged mice showed a similar number of osteoblasts in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, mineralization surface, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate in older Terc−/− and Wrn−/−Terc−/− bone suggest that osteoblast dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the Wrn−/− single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure model index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the Terc−/− and Wrn−/−Terc−/− femurs compared with WT mice were also observed. Young Wrn−/−Terc−/− mice had a statistically significant increase in bone-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that Terc−/− and Wrn−/−Terc−/− mutants recapitulate the human <b>bone</b> <b>aging</b> phenotype and are useful models for studying age-related osteoporosis...|$|R

40|$|Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a rare, {{autosomal}} recessive nucleotide excision repair (NER) disorder caused by mutations in {{components of the}} dual functional NER/basal transcription factor TFIIH. TTD mice, carrying a patient-based point mutation in the Xpd gene, strikingly resemble many features of the human syndrome and exhibit signs of premature aging. To examine to which extent TTD mice resemble the normal process of aging, we thoroughly investigated the bone phenotype. Here, we show that female TTD mice exhibit accelerated <b>bone</b> <b>aging</b> from 39 weeks onwards as well as lack of periosteal apposition leading to reduced bone strength. Before 39 weeks have passed, bones of wild-type and TTD mice are identical excluding a developmental defect. Albeit that bone formation is decreased, osteoblasts in TTD mice retain bone-forming capacity as in vivo PTH treatment leads to increased cortical thickness. In vitro bone marrow cell cultures showed that TTD osteoprogenitors retain the capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts. However, after 13 weeks of age TTD females show decreased bone nodule formation. No increase in bone resorption {{or the number of}} osteoclasts was detected. In conclusion, TTD mice show premature <b>bone</b> <b>aging,</b> which is preceded by a decrease in mesenchymal stem cells/osteoprogenitors and a change in systemic factors, identifying DNA damage and repair as key determinants for bone fragility by influencing osteogenesis and bone metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Background Familial male-limited {{precocious}} puberty (FMPP) or testotoxicosis {{is a rare}} gonadotrophin-independent form of sexual precocity caused by constitutively activating mutations of the LH receptor. Several clinical therapeutic approaches have been reported for this disorder, but with a paucity of long-term outcome data. Objective To evaluate the long-term treatment of testotoxicosis with cyproterone acetate or ketoconazole. Design A multicentric retrospective clinical study. Patients Ten boys from eight unrelated Brazilian families who carried known LH-receptor activating mutations were treated with 70 mg/m(2) cyproterone acetate (n = 5) or 10 mg/kg ketoconazole (n = 5) for a mean period of 5 and 8 years, respectively. Measurements Chronological and <b>bone</b> <b>ages,</b> <b>bone</b> age/chronological <b>age</b> ratio, target height (TH) range, adult height, basal and GnRH-stimulated gonadotrophin levels and basal testosterone levels were assessed. Results Growth velocity decreased significantly during treatment with cyproterone acetate or ketoconazole when compared to pretreatment value in each group (P < 0. 05). <b>Bone</b> age/chronological <b>age</b> ratio decreased significantly after cyproterone acetate or ketoconazole therapy. Basal testosterone levels were significantly lower in patients undergoing ketoconazole compared to cyproterone acetate treatment [0. 6 +/- 0. 3 nmol/l (42 +/- 21 ng/dl) vs. 5. 6 +/- 4. 0 nmol/l (392 +/- 280 ng/dl); P < 0. 05], as expected. Secondary gonadotrophin-dependent {{precocious puberty}} occurred at a similar frequency (40 %) in both groups. Five patients have attained adult height and two patients have already reached 90 % of their adult height. Two of them achieved their TH range and one patient, for whom TH was not available, had an adult height of 0. 3 SDS. Four boys (two in each group) did not attain their TH range. Conclusion Long-term treatment with cyproterone acetate or ketoconazole resulted in similar outcomes without important side-effects in boys with testotoxicosis.
