5|$|Canterbury used to <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> {{two other}} stations. North Lane Station was the {{southern}} terminus of the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway between 1830 and 1846. Canterbury South {{was on the}} Elham Valley Railway, which opened in 1890 and closed in 1947. A high-speed train service to London St Pancras via Ashford International started on 13 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|In October 1911, the Piccadilly tube {{platforms}} at Earl's Court station {{became the}} first on the Underground network to <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> escalators when {{a link between the}} District and Piccadilly platforms was created.|$|E

5|$|Kenya Airways {{had nine}} Boeing 787 Dreamliners on order as of April 2011, {{although}} the company considered cancelling the order after systematic delays with the delivery dates. The handover of the first Boeing 787 took place on 4 April 2014. Two days later, Nairobi–Paris became the first route to <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> the Boeing 787.|$|E
5|$|Navenby used to <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> several public houses, but The Butcher's Arms and The Green Man Inn {{have long}} been {{converted}} into private houses. Now, just the King's Head and The Lion and Royal remain.|$|E

5|$|Between 1994 and 1998, {{there was}} local {{political}} debate about how Rikshospitalet, that {{was moving to}} Gaustad, should <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> public transport. The state wanted to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway to the new hospital, while many local politicians {{wanted to use the}} rapid transit. Since the Ring Line would increase traffic on the Songsvann Line, moving the line was considered to better serve the hospital. In 1998, an agreement was reached whereby the light rail line would be built, and a new station for transfer from the metro would open at Forskningsparken.|$|E
5|$|Discussed in ArticleVIII, the {{judiciary}} {{was separated from}} the two other branches of the government, and was to <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship and were in constant session, with judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province to hear the cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, works to complete the electrification of the LNER lines were slowed or halted. The line from Finchley Central to Edgware closed for reconstruction on 11 September 1939. Northern line services were extended from East Finchley to High Barnet on 14 April 1940, and started serving the deep level platforms at Highgate on 19 January 1941, though not all of the new station buildings had been completed. The surface platforms at Highgate continued to <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> LNER steam trains.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, the Department for Transport (DfT) {{announced}} that trains serving the Sutton Loop Line (also {{known as the}} Wimbledon Loop) will continue to travel across London after 2018. The number of trains calling at Herne Hill on the route will remain unchanged, with four trains per hour. The DfT has also decided the Sutton/Wimbledon Loop will remain part of the Thameslink franchise until at least late 2020; as such, the route will eventually <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> the Class 700 trains.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal opinion on the border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections, {{and it would have been}} devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|Northern line trains first {{served the}} station on 3 July 1939. After {{completion}} of the electrification of the line to High Barnet, Underground services were extended northwards on 14 April 1940. The station continued to <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> LNER steam trains from Highgate until 2 March 1941 when that service was discontinued. The inner platforms are now used only by northbound trains entering service or southbound trains terminating at East Finchley {{on their way to}} or from Highgate Wood depot south of the station.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} upgrade to the Great Western Main Line, {{the main line}} from London to Bristol is due to be {{electrified}} by 2016. However, the electrification will not extend beyond the main lines, so Avonmouth will continue to <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> diesel trains. Stephen Williams, MP for Bristol West; and the group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways support the electrification being extended to the Severn Beach Line.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} {{proposal was}} presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It {{became clear that}} Berg would not <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> the Ring Line. Many neighbours to {{the route of the}} Sognsvann Line complained about this proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line. Also, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration protested to the plans, and stated that funding should be allocated to upgrading Ring 3 to six lanes before public transport investments were made in the area.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{township}} <b>is</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> zip code 49345, northern portions <b>are</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> 49330 (Kent City), {{and a very}} small portion on the western part <b>is</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> 49403 (Conklin).|$|R

5|$|In 1961 a {{residents}} progress {{association was}} formed. A prime goal was {{the building of}} a reservoir—supplied from the river—on Armidale hill overlooking the town. To defray costs and gain council acceptance, {{a large part of the}} work was performed by volunteers. This scheme began supplying the town on 17 February 1961. Up to the 1970s, Carrick's growth was limited by the lack of town sewerage—which restricted the minimum allotment size—and reluctance of landowner's to subdivide property. A 1977 planning study found that the land structure allowed most of the town to <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> a gravity fed system and recommended construction. As of 2008 the majority of the town was connected to reticulated water and sewerage.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} {{plans to}} connect the Sognsvann Line to the Grorud Line with a new Ring Line. The company also considered building the ring {{as part of the}} tramway, and have combined operation with both tram and metro on the Sognsvann Line. This was later discarded, despite the higher investment costs with a metro, since the tramway would give higher operating costs and longer travel time. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It became clear that Berg would not <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> the Ring Line. Many neighbors to the Sognsvann Line complained about the proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen.

5|$|The Follo Line {{will allow}} the {{capacity}} in the South Corridor from Oslo to increase from about twelve to forty trains per hour. Local and freight trains will use the Østfold Line, while regional and express trains will use the Follo Line. Travel time will be reduced from 22 to 11 minutes. With a new line, there will be 11,000 more public transport trips through the corridor; this includes a 67% increase during rush-hour and 43% {{the rest of the}} day. This allows a reduction of 5,800 car trips per day and reduces carbon dioxide emissions of 5,474 tonnes. Rush hour capacity would be eight trains per hour to Kolbotn, with four continuing to Ski along the old line. The new line would <b>be</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> four trains to Moss, two to Mysen and two to Halden. There would be half the frequency during off-peak hours.|$|E
