5|$|Blackbuck bear a close {{resemblance}} to gazelles, and are distinguished mainly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> while gazelles are brown in the dorsal parts, blackbuck develop a dark brown or black colour in these parts.|$|E
5|$|Coleridge {{began work}} on The Eolian Harp in August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. It details their future union and was inspired by {{his visit to the}} house in Clevedon that would serve as their home after their wedding. The poem is infused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Coleridge took an idealised view of his life with Fricker.|$|E
30|$|S_n(0)=-θ(0)+ 2 nπ/ω(0)< 0 obviously. When τ→τ^ 1, we have ω(τ)→ 0 and θ(τ)→π <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> sinθ(τ)→ 0 and cosθ(τ)→- 1. Therefore, by (3.20) we get _τ→τ^ 1 S_n(τ)=-∞.|$|R
30|$|The {{role and}} {{identity}} of NGOs have changed largely during this legal review, as shown <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> environmental institutions took civil society into consideration {{and that the}} Supreme Court sought public support {{in the formulation of}} judicial interpretation.|$|R

5|$|Finally, {{yet another}} brother, {{possibly}} younger than Nyuserre {{has also been}} proposed: Iryenre, a prince Iry-pat whose relationship is suggested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having {{taken place in the}} temple of Khentkaus II.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{developed}} the James Bond character more in Goldfinger {{than in the}} previous six novels, presenting him as a more complex individual, whilst also bringing out a theme of Bond as Saint George.

5|$|Henry Kissinger {{observed}} in his Vietnam War memoir that the Ford Administration was astonished and shamed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> top Cambodian officials {{refused to leave}} the country.

50|$|This {{mechanism}} is substantiated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> α-synuclein lacks toxicity when unable to form aggregates; that heat-shock proteins, which assist in refolding proteins susceptible to aggregation, beneficially affect PD when overexpressed; and that reagents which neutralize aggregated species protect neurons in cellular models of α-synuclein overexpression.|$|R
50|$|Crime writers, Robert & Carol Bridgestock, {{have speculated}} that Loewenstein faked his own death and {{disappeared}} because the financial irregularities in his businesses.

5|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{environmental}} parameters like changes in temperature and prior residence may affect the cichlid's territorial aggression. The convict cichlids are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which may be explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Little else {{is known}} about his childhood, {{although}} there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. Rémy — a tradition which is somewhat undermined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the latter disappears from the historical record after 1504, when the child was only one year old.|$|E
5|$|Some sources, such as Claxton, {{state that}} there was only a single boiler, but others, such as Fletcher and Maginnis, state that there were three side by side.

50|$|Hughes told Radio New Zealand on 16 March that {{investigations}} {{indicated that}} finance for the coup had been provided from abroad, though details were still sketchy.

5|$|Subarachnoid hemorrage due to {{arterial}} rupture typically occurs if the dissection extends {{into the}} V4 {{section of the}} artery. This may be explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the arterial wall is thinner and lacks a number of structural supports in this section.|$|E
5|$|Their {{longevity}} may {{be explained}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets.

30|$|The E {{value in}} the process is {{investigated}} as 50 and hence the Dubinin–dushkevich sorption isotherm is not followed for the sorption phenomena of Fe ions on the Fe(III)-ion imprinted polymer.

40|$|A simple indeterministic {{system is}} {{displayed}} {{and it is}} urged that we cannot responsibly infer inductively over it if we presume that the probability calculus is the appropriate logic of induction.

50|$|Despite his {{unremarkable}} form, Harvester {{was considered}} a leading Derby contender.

5|$|Train {{frequencies}} {{are primarily}} limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> most lines funnel into the Transbay Tube and San Francisco.

5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split {{does not seem to}} have been driven by competition for resources but instead <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E
5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are complicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} proved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> special {{features}} of Uzbek architecture harmonize traditional originality of structure formation and consideration of microclimate.

25|$|It is {{also known}} that this Mass was said in Greek.

50|$|However, Clarke {{consistently}} {{stated that}} each of the Odyssey novels takes place in its own separate parallel universe — this is demonstrated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monoliths are still in existence at the end of 2010: Odyssey Two and that Floyd is no longer part of the trinity formed at the end of 2061: Odyssey Three.

5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy {{before and after the}} first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were complicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the stern had become deeply embedded in the sand in the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{he was the last}} king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, {{but it was too late}} for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
