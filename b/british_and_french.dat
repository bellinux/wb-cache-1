5|$|On 29 October 1956, Israeli forces {{crossed the}} Sinai Peninsula, {{overwhelmed}} Egyptian army posts, and quickly advanced to their objectives. Two days later, <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> planes bombarded Egyptian airfields in the canal zone. Nasser ordered the military's high command {{to withdraw the}} Egyptian Army from Sinai to bolster the canal's defenses. Moreover, he feared that if the armored corps was dispatched to confront the Israeli invading force and the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> subsequently landed in the canal city of Port Said, Egyptian armor in the Sinai would be {{cut off from the}} canal and destroyed by the combined tripartite forces. Amer strongly disagreed, insisting that Egyptian tanks meet the Israelis in battle. The two had a heated exchange on 3 November, and Amer conceded. Nasser also ordered blockage of the canal by sinking or otherwise disabling forty-nine ships at its entrance.|$|E

5|$|The Hoare–Laval Pact of December 1935 was {{an attempt}} by the British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and the French Prime Minister Pierre Laval to end the {{conflict}} in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign, and the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> governments dissociated themselves from the two men. In June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.|$|E
5|$|The {{territorial}} dispute {{would not be}} fully resolved until the British conquest of New France in 1760, and the informal boundary between the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> in the dispute (the Missaguash River) now forms {{the border between the}} Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.|$|E

5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, {{which became a}} cause of ongoing friction between the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French,</b> especially on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. Jean, and Cape Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E
5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very little to the alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} writing, Notosusanto {{was active in}} student and {{political}} organisations, the student press, and academic conferences.

He also travelled extensively, visiting Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, and the US on academic sorties. He completed his bachelour's degree in history from UI in 1958, becoming a lecturer at UI after graduation. On 12 December 1960 he married Irma Sawitri Ramelan (better known as Lilik). Together they had three children: Indrya Smita, Inggita Sukma, and Narottama.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century many parts of the Minnesota area were already well traveled by <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> explorers. Though the region's population was mostly Native American, there were important British trading posts in the area with many European and mixed-race settlers, particularly in the north. Grand Portage, in particular, had long been established as the major trading center for the North West Company of Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{military}} importance of Jersey, the British government had ordered that the island be heavily fortified. On 6 January 1781, a French invasion force of 2,000 men set out {{to take over the}} island, but only half of the force arrived and landed. The Battle of Jersey lasted about half an hour, with Britain successfully defending the island. There were about thirty casualties on each side, and the British took 600 French prisoners whom were subsequently sent to England. Both <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> commanders were slain.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1945, {{approximately}} three million Ukrainian and other gentiles were killed {{as part of}} Nazi extermination policies in present-day Ukraine. More Ukrainians were killed fighting the Wehrmacht in the Red Army than American, <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> soldiers combined. Original Nazi plans called for the extermination of 65 percent of the nation's 23.2million Ukrainians, with the survivors treated as slaves. Over two million Ukrainians were deported to Germany as slave labor. The ten-year plan would have exterminated, expelled, Germanized or enslaved most (or all) Ukrainians.|$|E

She participated in major attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in March 1915, but the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> fleets proved incapable of forcing the straits. After the Gallipoli Campaign ended with the withdrawal of Allied forces in January 1916, Canopus patrolled the eastern Mediterranean, but saw no further action. She was removed from service in April 1916 and was converted into a barracks ship in early 1918. After the war, the ship was broken up in 1920.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union. In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.|$|E

Marianne rejoined him in Paris on 6 September 1939, three days after the <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> declaration of war on Germany in response to the German invasion of Poland that started the Second World War in Europe.

5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries, Great Britain and France had a {{territorial}} dispute over Saint Lucia.

5|$|On 10 May 1940, German forces invaded neutral Belgium {{without a}} formal {{declaration}} of war. Leopold headed immediately to Fort Breendonk, {{the headquarters of}} the Belgian army near Mechelen, {{to take control of the}} army. He refused to address the Belgian parliament beforehand, as Albert I had famously done at the outbreak of World War I. The speed of the German advance, using the new Blitzkrieg approach, soon pushed the Belgian army westwards despite <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> support. On 16 May, the Belgian government left Brussels.|$|E
