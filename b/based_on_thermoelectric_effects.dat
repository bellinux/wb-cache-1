Thermoelectric effects provide {{the technology for}} converting these heat resources directly into electricity. We present designs of electricity generators <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> and using heat {{resources of}} small temperature difference, e. g., ocean water at different depths and geothermal sources, and conclude that large-scale power plants <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> are feasible and economically competitive.

40|$|Direct energy {{conversion}} between thermal and electrical energy <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> is attractive for potential applications in {{waste heat recovery}} and environmentally-friendly refrigeration. The {{energy conversion}} efficiency {{is related to the}} thermoelectric figure of merit ZT, which is proportional to the electrical conductivity, the square of the Seebeck coefficient, and the inverse of the thermal conductivity. Currently, the low ZT values of available materials restrict the large scale applications of this technology. Recently, however, significant enhancements in ZT were reported in nanostructured materials such as superlattices mainly due to their low thermal conductivities. According to the studies on heat transfer mechanisms in nanostructures, the reduced thermal conductivity of nanostructures is mainly attributed to the increased scattering of phonons at interfaces. Based on this idea, nanocomposites are also expected to have a lower thermal conductivity than their bulk counterparts of the same chemical configuration. Nanocomposites are materials with constituents of less than 100 nm in size. They can be fabricated with a low cost just by mixing nano sized particles followed by consolidation of nano sized powders. In this thesis, SiGe nanocomposites are investigated for power generation at high temperature. The material properties are characterized at different temperatures, and the optimized process conditions are explored experimentally. In addition, theoretical studies are carried out for better understanding of transport phenomena and our experimental results. (cont.) Grain boundaries in nanocomposites can scatter phonons, when their mean free paths are longer than the grain size. Mean free paths of electrons are usually shorter than the grain size of nanocomposites, so that the electrical conductivities of nanocomposites are not expected to change significantly. However, the experimental results show that nanostructures indeed affect electron transport. The grain boundary effects on electron transport are investigated to explain the experiments. Furthermore, the effects of nanosized pores are explored. Our experimental results show that pores in nanocomposites degrade the electrical conductivity more than predicted by effective medium theories. A scattering model is developed to understand the transport phenomena in porous materials. These modeling studies {{can also be used to}} guide sample preparation conditions. by Hohyun Lee.

This study investigates the power generation performance of the devices over the first 80 days of the field trial. It was determined that the users were able to charge mobile phones, lights and radios from the generator stoves. The power generating performance of the stoves deteriorated slightly over the 80 day period.

40|$|Direct energy {{conversion}} between thermal and electrical energy, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>thermoelectric</b> (TE) <b>effect,</b> {{has the potential}} to recover waste heat and convert it to provide clean electric power. The {{energy conversion}} efficiency is related to the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT expressed as ZT=S(exp 2) (sigma) T/Kappa, T is temperature, S is the Seebeck coefficient, sigma is conductance and Kappa is thermal conductivity. For a lower thermal conductivity Kappa and high power factor (S(exp 2) (sigma)), our current strategy is the development of rhombohedrally strained single crystalline SiGe materials that are highly [111]-oriented twinned. The development of a SiGe "twin lattice structure (TLS) " {{plays a key role in}} phonon scattering. The TLS increases the electrical conductivity and decreases thermal conductivity due to phonon scattering at stacking faults generated from the 60 X rotated primary twin structure. To develop high performance materials, the substrate temperature, chamber working pressure, and DC sputtering power are controlled for the aligned growth production of SiGe layer and TLS on a c-plane sapphire. Additionally, a new elevated temperature thermoelectric characterization system, that measures the thermal diffusivity and Seebeck effect nondestructively, was developed.

40|$|The {{effective}} {{assessment of}} the integrity of welds is a complicated NDE problem that {{continues to be a}} challenge. To be able to completely characterize a weld, detailed knowledge of its tensile strength, ductility, hardness, microstructure, macrostructure, and chemical composition is needed. NDE techniques which can provide information on any of these features are extremely important. In this paper, we examine a seldom used approach <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>thermoelectric</b> (TE) <b>effect</b> for characterizing welds and their associated heat affected zone (HAZ). The thermoelectric method monitors the thermoelectric power which is sensitive to small changes in the kinetics of the conduction electrons near the Fermi surface that can be caused by changes in the local microstructure. The technique has been applied to metal sorting, quality testing, flaw detection, thickness gauging of layers, and microscopic structural analysis. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique for characterizing welds, a series of tungsten-inert-gas welded Inconel- 718 samples were scanned with a computer controlled TE probe. The samples were then analyzed using a scanning electron microscope and Rockwell hardness tests to characterize the weld and the associated HAZ. We then correlated the results with the TE measurements to provide quantitative information {{on the size of the}} HAZ and the degree of hardness of the material in the weld region. This provides potentially valuable information on the strength and fatigue life of the weld. We begin the paper by providing a brief review of the TE technique and then highlight some of the factors that can effect the measurements.

40|$|This {{research}} {{entails the}} first comprehensive and systematic study on a heat-driven, self-cooling application <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>thermoelectric</b> generation <b>effect.</b> The system was studied using {{the first and second}} laws of thermodynamics to provide a solid and basic understanding of the physical principles governing the system. Multiphysics equations that relate heat transfer, fluid dynamics and thermoelectric generation are derived. The equations are developed with increasing complexity, from the basic Carnot heat engine to externally and internally irreversible engines. A computational algorithm to systematically use the fundamental equations has been presented and computer code is implemented <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the algorithm. Experiments were conducted to analyze the geometric and system parameters affecting the application of thermoelectric based self-cooling in devices. Experimental results show that for the highest heat input studied, the temperature of the device has been reduced by 20 - 40 % as compared to the natural convection case. In addition, it has been found that in the self-cooling cases studied, convection thermal resistance could account for up to 60 % of the total thermal resistance. A general numerical methodology was developed to predict steady as well as transient thermal and electrical behavior of a thermoelectric generation-based self-cooling system. The methodology is implemented by using equation modeling capabilities to capture the thermo-electric coupled interaction in TEG elements, enabling the simulation of major heating effects as well as temperature and spatial dependent properties. An alternative methodology was also presented, which integrates specialized ANSI-C code to integrate <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>effects,</b> temperature-dependent properties and transient boundary conditions. It has been shown that the computational model is able to predict the experimental data with good accuracy (within 5 % error). A parametric study has been done using the model to study the effect of heat sink geometry on device temperature and power produced by TEG arrays. In addition, a dynamic model suited for integration in control systems is developed. Therefore, the study has shown the potential for a heat driven self-cooling system and provides a comprehensive set of tools for analysis and design of thermoelectric generation...|$|R

We {{analyze the}} noise {{properties}} of both electric charge and heat currents {{as well as}} their correlations in a quantum-dot based thermoelectric engine. The engine is a three-terminal conductor with crossed heat and charge flows where heat fluctuations can be monitored by a charge detector. We investigate the mutual influence of charge and heat dynamics and how it is manifested in the current and noise properties. In the presence of energy-dependent tunneling, operating conditions are discussed where a charge current can be generated by heat conversion. In addition, heat can be pumped into the hot source by driving a charge current in the coupled conductor. An optimal configuration is found for structures in which the energy dependence of tunneling maximizes asymmetric transmission with maximal charge-heat cross-correlations. Remarkably, at a voltage that stalls the heat engine we find that in the optimal case the non-equilibrium state is maintained by fluctuations in the heat and charge currents only. © IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.
