5|$|The {{opinion of}} historians {{is that the}} temple was built as a {{dedication}} to the Shaivite <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> Hinduism (from {{the large number of}} Shaivaite images seen on the lintels of the main temple and in other adjoining temples). But at some stage during the Middle Ages, there was a shift in the religious <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the rulers and people adopted Vaishnavite <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> Hinduism as witnessed by the images of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita deified in the main sanctum sanctorum of the temple complex.|$|E

50|$|Let us {{say that}} a person has a degree <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> 1 in a {{particular}} proposition if he is completely convinced of its truth. For example, most people have a degree <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> 1 in the proposition that 2+2=4. On the other hand, a person has a degree <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> 0 in a proposition if he is utterly convinced of its falsity; most people have a degree <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> zero in the proposition that 2+2=5. Intermediate values are possible. A man who thinks that his dog has stolen the sausages, but is not completely sure, might have a degree <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> 0.8 in the proposition that his dog stole the sausages.|$|R

5|$|During the Zheng and Qing eras, Han {{immigrants}} brought Confucianized <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> Taoism and Buddhism to Taiwan's indigenous people. Many Plains Aborigines adopted Han religious practices, {{though there}} is evidence that many aboriginal customs were transformed into local Taiwanese Han beliefs. In some parts of Taiwan the Siraya spirit of fertility, Ali-zu (A-li-tsu) has become assimilated into the Han pantheon. The use of female spirit mediums (tongji) can also be traced to the earlier matrilineal Inibs.|$|E
5|$|Folkloric vampirism {{has been}} {{associated}} with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.|$|E
5|$|His {{conception}} of 'marvellous reality' {{revolves around the}} natural fantastic qualities of Latin America and the Caribbean, {{as opposed to the}} overly forced and cliché efforts by European surrealists to portray magical occurrences. The result was the presentation of impossible or fantastic events described as if they were completely usual and natural, such as the metamorphoses of Mackandal and Ti Noel. These events, however, often represent the <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> other characters in the novel. For a more detailed account of the differences between magic realism and Carpentier's real maravilloso, see the page on magic realism.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Colbert left The Daily Show {{to host a}} {{spin-off}} series entitled The Colbert Report, {{a parody}} of personality-driven political pundit programs such as Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor that center largely on the personal views of their hosts. Because of this enlarged role, the personality and <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the Stephen Colbert character have become more clearly defined {{over the course of}} the show, complete with a fictitious backstory that has been revealed piecemeal in short monologues accompanying a part of the program.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the teachings}} of Galen {{continued}} to dominate the academic community and his doctrines were adopted as the official canon of the Church. Andreas Vesalius questioned some of Galen's <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the heart in De humani corporis fabrica (1543), but his magnum opus was interpreted {{as a challenge to}} the authorities and he was subjected to a number of attacks. Michael Servetus wrote in Christianismi Restitutio (1553) that blood flows {{from one side of the}} heart to the other via the lungs.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official statements of the <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E
40|$|Harsanyi (1967 - 68) {{proposed}} {{a method for}} transforming uncertainty over the strategy sets of players into uncertainty over their payoffs. The transformation appears to rely on an assumption that the players are rational, or, indeed, that they are rational {{and that there is}} common <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> rationality. Such an assumption would be awkward {{from the perspective of the}} epistemic program, which is often interested in the implications of irrationality or a lack <b>of</b> common <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> rationality. This paper shows that without common <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> rationality, such implications are not necessarily maintained under a Harsanyi transformation. The paper then shows how, with the belief-system model of Aumann and Brandenburger (1995), such implications can be maintained in the absence <b>of</b> common <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> rationality. ...|$|R

5|$|In non-Christian states, {{coronation}} rites {{evolved from}} a variety of sources, often related to the religious <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> that particular nation. Buddhism, for instance, influenced the coronation rituals of Thailand, Cambodia and Bhutan, while Hindu elements {{played a significant role in}} Nepalese rites. The ceremonies used in modern Egypt, Malaysia, Brunei and Iran were shaped by Islam, while Tonga's ritual combines ancient Polynesian influences with more modern Anglican ones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tales}} and <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the Siberian Yupik people, killer whales {{are said to}} appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|E
5|$|The Chola dynasty in Tamil Nadu was {{particularly}} favourable to the <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> Shaiva sect. It {{is said that}} the sectarian aspect got highlighted during their reign.

The other images are at Darasuram and Kampahareshvarar temple, Thirubuvanam built by a Chola ruler, Kulottunga Chola III where Sharabha's image is housed in a separate shrine.|$|E
40|$|I {{characterize}} backward induction in an epistemic {{model of}} perfect information games where players have common certain <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> {{the consistency of}} preferences rather than the rationality of choice. In this approach, backward induction corresponds to common certain <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> 2 ̆ 018 belief in each subgame of opponent rationality 2 ̆ 019.

5|$|Various {{sources of}} sharia {{are used by}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} to elucidate the body of Islamic law. The primary source accepted universally by all Muslims is the Qur'an, the majority adhering also to the traditionally reported Sunnah, but rejected by others; Quranism. The Qur'an is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of God. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and quotations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, narrated through his Companions and the Imams (per the <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E

5|$|Brahmashiva, {{the court}} poet of King Vikramaditya VI, earned the title Kavichakravarti ("Emperor among poets") from his patron for his writing Samayaparikshe ("Analysis of the doctrine", c.1125). In this {{philosophical}} writing, containing touches of propagandist satire and humor, the author seeks {{to prove the}} virtues of Jainism superior to all other contemporary religions. Brahmashiva portrays contemporary life and <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> {{the people of the}} Kannada-speaking region. He criticises Hinduism and the conversion of a Jain temple originally dedicated to the Tirthankar Chandrapraba in Kholapur into a Hindu temple deifying the goddess Mahalakshmi. He expresses reservation regarding the existence of religious cosmopolitanism within a household where family members followed multiple faiths. The author is concerned about the eroding popularity of Jainism in southern India due to the rising popularity of the Veerashaiva movement. Prince Kirtivarma, a younger brother of King Vikramaditya VI, wrote Govaidya ("Cattle Medicine"), the earliest available writing in Kannada on veterinary science, which mixes medicine and magic.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with the <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
