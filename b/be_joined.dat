5|$|As Ezri Tigan was {{the only}} unjoined Trill {{available}} on board, she agreed to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> to the symbiont {{even though she was}} unprepared and did not previously seek to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> to one. Following the procedure, Ezri — now known as Ezri Dax — spent time at the Symbiosis Institute on Trill to learn to adapt to her new state. Because of her new state, Ezri's romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended, as she later explained to her family that he reminded her of a past host's son.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to <b>be</b> <b>joined.</b> The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|As for Edward II himself, his {{dependence}} on the Despensers grew only deeper, and their transgressions more severe. Lancaster's supporters (including Roger Mortimer, William Trussell and Robert de Holland) found themselves systematically accused of false charges, being imprisoned and having their lands {{taken over by the}} Despensers. Mortimer and Trussell eventually fled to Paris where they were to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by Edward's estranged wife Isabella who was to become Mortimer's lover.|$|E

50|$|The 8 {{truncated}} cuboctahedra <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> to {{each other}} via their octagonal faces, in an arrangement corresponding to the 8 cubical cells of the tesseract. They <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> to the 16 truncated tetrahedra via their hexagonal faces, and their square faces <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> to the square faces of the 32 triangular prisms. The triangular faces of the triangular prisms <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> to the truncated tetrahedra.|$|R
50|$|On 4 March 2013, the 1,000 episode aired. Each captain <b>was</b> <b>joined</b> by {{two former}} captains. Winning captain Phil Tufnell <b>was</b> <b>joined</b> by Bill Beaumont and Ally McCoist, while Matt Dawson <b>was</b> <b>joined</b> by Willie Carson and John Parrott. This was Series 42, episode 17.|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{structures}} that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (often called fats). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking them down and using them {{as a source of}} energy, by their digestion. These biochemicals can <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> together to make polymers such as DNA and proteins, essential macromolecules of life.|$|E
5|$|On Russell's Top the Auckland Mounted Rifles {{were in a}} {{precarious}} position; their trenches were still far from being fully constructed, and three saps heading towards The Nek had yet to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> up. The 19th Division, using hand grenades, attacked the New Zealanders' position in three waves. The Wellington Mounted Rifles to the north were able to bring their machine-guns {{to bear on the}} attackers. The flanking fire caused devastation amongst the Turkish ranks. At the same time the Aucklands charged them in a counter-attack, forcing the survivors to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} fix is {{to consider}} collections of objects {{that can be easily}} divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather than just combining collections of segments, rods can <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.|$|E
50|$|Justice Kennedy {{delivered}} {{the decision and}} <b>was</b> <b>joined</b> by Justices Alito and Roberts. Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion that <b>was</b> <b>joined</b> by Justice Scalia.

5|$|Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof {{redevelopment}} (Stuttgart 21), in Stuttgart, Germany; {{a project}} to realign the Deutsche Bahn's rail lines so they can <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> to the intra-European network. The sub-terranean station will be roofed with a public park, with organically shaped, reinforced concrete shells with petal-shaped sections terminating as skylights. The project is due for completion in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The C60 {{made its}} debut at the 2000 Silverstone 500 USA Challenge, when SMG Compétition's Gary Formato and Philippe Gache used the car to take tenth place, and eighth in the LMP category. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Gache and Formato were to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by Didier Cottaz, but {{suspension}} failure after 219 laps forced the team to retire. SMG ran Cottaz and Gache at the 1000 km of Nürburgring, but an accident after 44 laps lead to the team's retirement.|$|E
5|$|As at Northampton, Chapman's tactics {{were based}} upon the {{principles}} of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers, who would pass low inside the defence instead of crossing from the byline. He had been granted control of all footballing affairs at the club and made this responsibility work to his advantage, encouraging the club's reserve and third teams to play the same style of football so that their players would function effectively in the first team if selected. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network {{to find the right}} players for his tactical system. Bolstered by the money from the cup run, Chapman was able to make further signings such as goalkeeper Ted Taylor and forward Charlie Wilson (later to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by George Cook).|$|E

Thereafter {{it passes through}} Whaley Bridge, New Mills (where it <b>is</b> <b>joined</b> by the River Sett) and Marple Bridge. Having <b>been</b> <b>joined</b> by the River Etherow, the Goyt joins the River Tame at Stockport, forming the River Mersey.|$|R
50|$|The 24 small rhombicuboctahedra <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> to {{each other}} via their {{triangular}} faces, to the cuboctahedra via their axial square faces, and to the triangular prisms via their off-axial square faces. The cuboctahedra <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> to the triangular prisms via their triangular faces. Each triangular prism <b>is</b> <b>joined</b> to two cuboctahedra at its two ends.|$|R
5|$|Dax confides in Sisko {{that she}} knows she {{is in love with}} her former wife. He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> with a new host, but that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to the realization that the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|Directly after commissioning, König {{conducted}} sea trials, {{which were}} completed by 23 November 1914. Her crew consisted of 41 officers and 1,095 enlisted men. Afterward, {{the ship was}} attached to the V Division of the IIIBattle Squadron of the German High Seas Fleet, where she would later <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by her sister ships. On 9 December, König ran aground in the Wilhelmshaven roadstead. Her sister ship Grosser Kurfürst, following right behind, rammed her stern and caused some minor damage. König was then freed from the bottom and taken back to Wilhelmshaven; repair work lasted until 2 January 1915.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain {{increased}} support from Polish nationalists and patriots, Napoleon termed the war the Second Polish War—the First Polish War had been the Bar Confederation uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768. Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.|$|E

Parapagus is also similar to ischiopagus; however, parapagus twins <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> side-by-side whereas ischiopagus twins typically have spines connected at a 180° angle, facing away from one another.|$|R
25|$|For the Queensland 500 and Bathurst 1000, Lowndes <b>was</b> <b>joined</b> by McConville {{finishing}} {{third and}} second respectively. Skaife <b>was</b> <b>joined</b> by Paul Morris finishing third at Bathurst.|$|R
5|$|More {{numerous}} than new-build forts {{were old}} forts upgraded to higher defensive specifications. Thus the two parallel ditches common around earlier forts could <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by excavating the ground between them. Projecting towers were added. Gates were either rebuilt with projecting towers or sealed off by constructing a large rectangular bastion. The walls were strengthened by doubling the old thickness. Upgraded forts were generally {{much larger than}} new-build. New forts were rarely over one hectare in size and were normally placed to fill gaps between old forts and towns. However, {{not all of the}} old forts that continued {{to be used in the}} 4th century were upgraded e.g. the forts on Hadrian's Wall and some other forts in Britannia were not significantly modified.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September the {{regiment}} left their camp for Lyttelton and embarked on the transport ships HMNZT Tahiti and HMNZT Athenic. Leaving the same day, {{they arrived at}} Wellington the next afternoon, and disembarked the troops. On 14 October they boarded the transports again and set sail. With a short stop at Hobart, on 28 October they arrived at Albany, and anchored waiting to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by the Australian contingent. The combined convoy sailed on 1 November and reached Colombo on 15 November. Two days later it sailed into the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal. Docking at Port Said on 2 December and Alexandria the next day, {{the regiment}} disembarked on 4 December and boarded a train for their camp in the Cairo suburb of Zeitoun where they started a training programme, using the desert for manoeuvres, during both day and night.|$|E
5|$|Other notable honours {{bestowed}} upon West Brom players include the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which {{was presented to}} Cyrille Regis in 1979. In 1998, Billy Bassett and Bryan Robson were named among the list of Football League 100 Legends, along with Arthur Rowley, Geoff Hurst and Johnny Giles. Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> two years later by Geoff Hurst. Bobby Robson, a player with Albion, has also been inducted, although this was for his achievements as a manager. In 1919–20, Fred Morris became the first Albion player to finish as top goalscorer in Division One, a feat which has since been repeated by Ronnie Allen, Derek Kevan, Jeff Astle and Tony Brown. Brown, who holds the club records for goals and appearances, was voted into the PFA Centenary Hall of Fame in July 2007.|$|E

5|$|The French Indian Ocean {{islands of}} Île Bonaparte and Isle de France had {{provided}} a secure base for French privateers and French Navy frigates to operate against British shipping {{in the region}} for the entire French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. In 1808, determined to capitalise on this poorly defended region of British trade, the French government ordered Commodore Jacques Hamelin in Vénus to sail to Isle de France where he would <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by three other large and powerful frigates with specific orders to target British trade. Dispersing his frigates into the Bay of Bengal, Hamelin had some success during 1809: Caroline capturing two East Indiamen at the Action of 31 May 1809 and Hamelin himself seizing three at the Action of 18 November 1809. The French squadron also captured a number of smaller British warships and the large Portuguese frigate Minerve.|$|E
5|$|The house {{system was}} first {{established}} in 1909, {{when there were}} three houses: Alpha, Beta and Gamma, each of which had a house master and captain. Boys remained {{in the same house}} for their entire school career, and would <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by any siblings. Every year, the houses competed for the House Shield; points were awarded for all forms of competitions, from sword dancing to vaulting. In 1914, house colours were introduced; purple for Alpha, green for Beta, and scarlet for Gamma. As the student body increased, a fourth houseDeltawas formed in 1917, for which the colour was yellow. The house system was abolished in the 1980s, but re-introduced in September 2008, with houses named after notable alumni. The four houses are: Duke (after Neville Duke), Hodge (after Donald Hodge), Lewin (after Terence Lewin) and Powell (after Cecil Frank Powell).|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} conducted training until 24 September, {{when they}} received embarkation orders. Due to {{the fear of}} German warships being in the area, the wait for suitable escort ships delayed their departure until 15 October. With a short stop at Hobart, on 28 October they arrived at Albany, and anchored waiting to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by the Australian contingent. The combined convoy sailed on 1 November and reached Colombo on 15 November. Two days later it sailed into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.
