40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{is a new}} {{and revolutionary}} logistics tool in many ways, but identifying an object does not solve all challenges that are present in a fast-paced supply-chain. One {{must be aware of}} how to best utilize the data and know the applications in order to automate processes and integrate the data in the best possible way. In this thesis a general purpose server platform for supply chain management event handling and integration is presented. Total of four different real-life production systems utilizing UHF Gen 2 RFID technology are analyzed, and based on the findings, a general-purpose server platform is described. Case studies vary from simple high-volume processes to complex supply-chain loops in order to cover the various real-life environments and challenges. Emphasis on the case studies and the whole thesis is on the real-life applications and demands, and how to simplify and streamline server platform development. The target is to present a platform that is simple and easy to implement and easy to integrate to a multitude of different enterprise <b>back</b> <b>end</b> <b>systems.</b> A solution would enable for an easy and streamlined project development and RFID implementation. A proposed prototype solution is presented as a Java class model and database structure. Feasibility of the prototype is then analyzed and suggestions for future actions are presented. Radiotaajuusteknologian (RFID, radio frequency identification) käyttö logistiikassa mahdollistaa saumattoman ja automaattisen tiedonkeruun toimitusketjun eri vaihessa. Tämä tiedonkeruu ja automaattinen tunnistaminen mahdollistavat toimitusketjuun liittyvien transaktioiden automatisoinnin ja integroinnin taustajärjestelmiin. Diplomityössä on tutkittu miten RFID-tunnistamisen tuottamaa tietoa voidaan integroida ja hyödyntää logistiikan sovellutuksissa, sekä esitetty yleiskäyttöinen palvelinratkaisu erilaisten toimitusketjujen tarpeisiin. Analysointi on tehty tutkimalla neljää yritystä, missä RFID-teknologiaa on käytetty onnistuneesti toimitusketjun hallinnassa. Tuotantokäytössä olevien järjestelmien analysoinnilla on varmistettu että ratkaisu täyttää reaalimaailman vaatimukset. Analyysien pohjalta on esitetty prototyyppiratkaisu Javan luokkamallina ja tietokantarankenteena, ja prototyypin soveltuvuutta käytäntöön on tarkasteltu.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Internet has challenged numerous value chain propositions and processes. Its low cost, low barrier of entry and timely distribution of information provides a seamless extension of processes across company borders. Especially in the business-to-business (828) realm, its introduction has however sparked criticism and controversy and many companies are still weary of trading on-line. e-Procurement is a sound solution for companies to initiate the e-wave as it promises high cost savings. Savings promised include a reduction in processing cost, reduction in the supply base (which leads to cost savings) as well as negotiating better prices through the availability of sufficient post-purchase information. Maverick spending (off contract purchasing) is also reduced through better-controlled purchases. A framework is developed in this research {{to assist in the}} evaluation of the suitability and scope of a proposed e-procurement implementation. Due to the numerous aspects involved in procurement and therefore also e-procurement, the following five dimensions are addressed in the framework: 1. Procurement and Processes. Although e-procurement does not address all procurement related aspects, such as strategic sourcing of supply, it has an operational focus and reduces processing time and costs. 2. Products. Products can be categorised by means of many different aspects, but the following main characteristics influence the categorisation decision: i) Its function within the organisation, ii) Product characteristics (homogenous or heterogeneous), iii) Product value and iv) Number of suppliers. Indirect goods with a low unit value, supplied by a large number of homogenous suppliers are regarded as susceptible for e-procurement. 3. Purchasing role players. Many different role players function within the purchasing arena, each influencing the purchasing function. The main aspects to be considered when considering e-procurement are: i) Buyer characteristics (demography and background), ii) Supplier characteristics and channel strategy (the supplier's position in the value chain as well, as if the relationship is cohesive or conflicting), iii) Market forces (supply and demand laws as well as market competitiveness) and iv) Industry related purchasing (the product purchased and its significance). 4. Purchasing and Supply Chain Management. The {{introduction of}} the Internet has opened up the possibility for planning across the supply chain planning, using techniques such as CPFR. This will result in a pull rather than a push model. For products to be ordered electronically, the following information should be available: i) Stock levels and ii) Current or forecasted demand. Absence of accurate information of any or both of the above would result in a preference for manual ordering. 5. Trading and Information Exchange. Each buying situation may require a different e-procurement solution It is important that users firstly establish the commerce arena requirements (the product characteristics, sophistication of the buyers as well as inefficiencies of current transactions) which will influence the choice in e-procurement business model, trading platform, data format, etc. Thereafter the aspects necessary for consideration are: i) The data format (XML vs. EDIFACT, etc.), ii) Information platform (Internet vs. Intranet, etc.), iii) Integration needs (integrating with <b>back</b> <b>end</b> <b>systems</b> such as an ERP system) and iv) Different e-procurement solutions. Using a qualitative model considering dimensions 1 to 3 above, the susceptibility of different products or commodity groups (products with similar characteristics grouped together) should be examined. For each of these products or commodity groups the preferred e-procurement solution should be crafted by applying dimensions 4 and 5 above. Combining the qualitative ratings with the preferred solution should provide the most feasible e-procurement solution, while simultaneously rating which of the products should be purchased through the solution.

This is accomplished through the use of a counter-based bloomfilter with locality checks in order to reduce false positives and false negatives. The second component is a method of replication called Differentiable Replication, DiR. The novelty of DiR is that the requirements of the files and capabilities of underlying nodes are taken into consideration for replication.

The limited frequency spectrum, which allows only one application to operate {{at the same time}} and frequency, has created resource issue for the wireless communication industry. Hence, new frequency agile technologies such as Software Define Radio and Cognitive Radio systems are being developed. One of the requirements of this type of application is an antenna system that is able to change its operating frequency as instructed by the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> <b>system.</b> This research explores the possibility of integrating band pass filters to manipulate the operating frequency of a broadband antenna. RF diode, inductors and capacitors are used as switching mechanism to actively change the operating frequency. Based on the spectrum allocation in Malaysia, frequency range from 1 GHz to 6 GHz was chosen due to the allocation of many types of communication applications such as mobile applications, unlicensed band and satellite communication. A proof of concept was done for active switching at 1. 3 GHz and 2 GHz of the antenna prototype. Another structure was fabricated to implement frequency reconfigurability operation at 1. 3 GHz, 2 GHz, 3 GHz, 4 GHz, 5 GHz and 6 GHz using copper strips instead of active elements. Simulated and measured results showed good agreement for 1. 3 GHz – 2 GHz active switching prototype while 1. 3 GHz – 6 GHz copper strip prototype shows minor shifts and degradation at high frequencies in measured result. From the data collected in this research, band pass filter integrated antenna shows high potential to be used as frequency agile antenna with active switching capability. The results from simulation and measurement of fabricated structures are analyzed and discussed in detail in this thesis. This research contributes to the development of frequency agile antenna design for future frequency agile application...|$|R

Radio waves are not limited by line of sight, they can penetrate objects and communicate in a wireless fashion. However, the same advantage is also the inherent weakness, as radio waves are susceptible to attack. Ongoing efforts have identified forward secure chain hashing as a viable security protocol for RFID authentication. Today 2 ̆ 7 s typical RFID communications take place with the 2 ̆ 2 host-reader-tag 2 ̆ 2 arrangement where the computational requirements are performed by a <b>back</b> <b>end</b> server <b>system</b> which holds all the intelligence and houses all records for an entire facility.

Because our enhanced reader does not require a server to perform its function, if any readers are breached it only impacts that specific reader, not the entire server. By eliminating the resource heavy server device, we can yield a more robust overall system.
