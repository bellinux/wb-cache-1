The cAd3 vector has a DNA fragment insert that encodes the Ebola virus glycoprotein, which is expressed on the virion surface and is critical for attachment to host cells and catalysis of membrane fusion. It was developed by NIAID in collaboration with Okairos, now a division of GlaxoSmithKline. For the trial designated VRC 20, 20 volunteers were recruited by the NIAID in Bethesda, Maryland, while three dose-specific groups of 20 volunteers each were recruited for trial EBL01 by University of Oxford, U.K. Initial results were released in November 2014; all 20 volunteers developed antibodies against Ebola and there were no significant concerns raised about safety. In December 2014, University of Oxford expanded the trial to include a <b>booster</b> <b>vaccine</b> based on MVA-BN, a strain of Modified vaccinia Ankara, developed by Bavarian Nordic, to investigate whether it can help increase immune responses further.

Most cases occur {{in areas of}} the world to which the disease is endemic, where almost everyone is vaccinated early in life with Mycobacterium bovis BCG, the currently available vaccine against tuberculosis. Thus, while more-potent vaccines are needed to replace BCG, new vaccines are also needed to boost the immune protection of the 4 billion people already vaccinated with BCG. Until now, no <b>booster</b> <b>vaccine</b> has been shown capable of significantly enhancing the level of protective immunity induced by BCG in the stringent guinea pig model of pulmonary tuberculosis, the "gold standard" for testing tuberculosis vaccines. In this paper, we describe a <b>booster</b> <b>vaccine</b> for BCG comprising the purified recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis 30 -kDa protein, the major secreted protein of this pathogen. In the guinea pig model of pulmonary tuberculosis, boosting BCG-immunized animals once with the 30 -kDa protein greatly increased cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to the protein in three consecutive experiments. Most importantly, boosting BCG-immunized animals once with the 30 -kDa protein significantly enhanced protective immunity against aerosol challenge with highly virulent M. tuberculosis, as evidenced by a significantly reduced lung and spleen burden of M. tuberculosis compared with those for nonboosted BCG-immunized animals (mean additional reduction in CFU of 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 log in the lung [P = 0. 03] and 0. 6 +/- 0. 1 log in the spleen [P = 0. 002]).

This study seeks {{to estimate the}} potential cost-effectiveness of a BCG <b>booster</b> <b>vaccine,</b> while accounting for costs of large-scale clinical trials, using the MVA 85 A vaccine {{as a case study}} for estimating potential costs. We conducted a decision analysis from the societal perspective, using a 10 -year time frame and a 3 % discount rate. We predicted active tuberculosis cases and tuberculosis-related costs for a hypothetical cohort of 960, 763 South African newborns (total born in 2009). We compared neonatal vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin alone to vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin plus a <b>booster</b> <b>vaccine</b> at 4 months. We considered booster efficacy estimates ranging from 40 % to 70 %, relative to bacille Calmette-Guérin alone. We accounted for the costs of Phase III clinical trials. The <b>booster</b> <b>vaccine</b> was assumed to prevent progression to active tuberculosis after childhood infection, with protection decreasing linearly over 10 years. Trial costs were prorated to South Africa’s global share of bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination. Vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin alone resulted in estimated tuberculosis-related costs of $ 89. 91 million 2012 USD, and 13, 610 tuberculosis cases in the birth cohort, over the 10 years.

The experimental design included two free-range layer farms in which sera of randomly chosen layers were collected on two occasions from each of the two farms namely: at the time of administration of the killed <b>booster</b> <b>vaccine</b> (23 weeks of age) and three weeks later. The Western immunoblotting technique was used to react the individual pooled sera collected at different times from each farm with antigens used in priming, namely those of the ND-clone 30 virus and the IB-H 120 virus. The optical density bands formed by reactions were compared statistically between seroconverted antibodies at 23 weeks with those of layers aged 26 weeks. The killed <b>booster</b> <b>vaccine</b> offered a significant seroconversion on both farms to the non-protective L-protein (248. 0 kDa) of NDV and on one of the two farms to the non-protective NDV-matrix protein (40. 0 kDa) (p< 0. 05).

Hypothesis: Aged horses will have a lesser increase in serum antibody response to vaccination. Animals: Thirty-four aged healthy horses (>= 20 years) and 29 younger adult horses (4 - 12 years) of various breeds. Methods: All horses were vaccinated with vaccines of killed rabies and influenza virus. Horses in each age group were allocated to receive either rabies or influenza <b>booster</b> <b>vaccine</b> 4 weeks after the initial vaccination. Serum samples were taken at 0, 4, 8, and 24 weeks. Rabies serum neutralization titers and equine influenza virus specific antibody sub-isotypes (IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), and IgA) as well as single radial hemolysis (SRH) titers were determined. Results: Rabies antibody titers were similar in the 2 age groups at all sampling times. Aged horses had higher IgGa and IgGb influenza antibody titers before vaccination than younger horses but similar titers after vaccination (P =. 004 and P =. 0027, respectively). Younger horses had significantly greater increases in titer than aged horses at all sampling times for IgGa (P =. 001) and at 8 and 24 weeks for IgGb (P =. 041 and. 01, respectively).

Therefore, there has been a pressing need for the development of new <b>booster</b> <b>vaccines</b> to enhance existing BCG-induced immunity. Protection following mucosal intranasal immunisation with AdHu 5 Ag 85 A is associated with the localisation of antigen-specific T-cells to the lung airway. However, parenteral intramuscular immunisation is unable to provide protection despite the apparent presence of antigen-specific T-cells in the lung interstitium. Recent advances in intravascular staining have allowed us to reassess the previously established T-cell distribution profile and its relationship with the observed differential protection. Respiratory mucosal immunisation empowers T-cells to home to both the lung interstitium and the airway lumen, whereas intramuscular immunisation-activated T-cells are largely trapped within the pulmonary vasculature, unable to populate the lung interstitium and airway. Given the mounting evidence supporting the safety and enhanced efficacy of respiratory mucosal immunisation over the traditional parenteral immunisation route, a greater effort should be made to clinically develop respiratory mucosal-deliverable TB vaccines...|$|R
40|$|The Steering Committee for the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases in Asia {{recently}} {{conducted a}} survey of primary-care physicians in Asia, which revealed that many physicians administer boosters in their clinical practice {{and that there is}} considerable variation and uncertainty among physicians regarding this practice. This paper serves as a response to physicians’ uncertainties by reviewing the literature regarding the administration of hepatitis B <b>vaccine</b> <b>boosters</b> in high endemicity areas and presenting the Steering Committee’s guidelines for booster administration. While there are few data to support a need for routine hepatitis B <b>vaccine</b> <b>boosters</b> as a public health measure, they help to provide reassurance of immunity against breakthrough infection in certain risk groups. In clinical practice, primary-care physicians must exercise their judgment regarding the need for booster vaccination on an individual basis. This paper examines the available literature on the administration and value of hepatitis B <b>vaccine</b> <b>boosters,</b> explores the differences between the public health approach and clinical practice, and provides guidelines for those who use boosters in high endemicity Asian populations. Relevant articles were identified through searches of MEDLINE (1975 – 2003) and the Cochrane Library, using ‘hepatitis B’ and ‘booster’ as primary search terms. Guidelines for those who decide to administer hepatitis B <b>vaccine</b> <b>boosters</b> include: boosting approximately 10 – 15 years after primary vaccination; boosting rather than not when monitoring of antibody levels is not feasible; boosting immunocompromised patients when the antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen titer falls below 10 mIU/mL; and boosting healthcare workers based on the endemicity of the particular country...|$|R
