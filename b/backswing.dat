5|$|The Brothers {{worked for}} Philadelphia-based Pro Wrestling Unplugged (PWU) {{since at least}} September 17, 2005, when they {{defeated}} The S.A.T. and All Money is Legal to win the then-vacant PWU Tag Team Championship. They held that title until April 22, 2006, when they dropped it to the S.A.T. After further appearances in 2006, which were all matches they lost, the Briscoe Brothers entered PWU's Pitbull/Public Enemy Memorial Cup on October 20. They advanced past the first round match, winning over the Krash Krew, but {{in the course of}} this match, Mark was injured when Jay inadvertently struck him in the mouth with the <b>backswing</b> of a chairshot. Mark was taken to the hospital after the match and subsequently lost a number of teeth and sustained damage to his gums as well.|$|E
25|$|Cobb's {{competitive}} fires {{continued to}} burn after retirement. In 1941, he faced Babe Ruth {{in a series}} of charity golf matches at courses outside New York, Boston and Detroit and won two out of three. At the 1947 Old-Timers' Day game in Yankee Stadium, he warned catcher Benny Bengough to move back, claiming he was rusty and hadn't swung a bat in almost 20 years. Bengough accordingly stepped back to avoid being struck by Cobb's <b>backswing.</b> Having repositioned the catcher, Cobb cannily laid down a perfect bunt in front of the plate and easily beat the throw from a surprised Bengough.|$|E
25|$|During the offseason, Nicklaus {{addressed}} {{two problems}} which had hurt his performance. His lifelong teacher Jack Grout {{noticed that he}} had become much too upright with his full swing, causing a steep, oblique approach into the ball, compared with a more direct hit; this was corrected by slightly flattening his <b>backswing.</b> Then Nicklaus' short game, never a career strength, was further developed {{with the help of}} Phil Rodgers, a friend for more than 20 years, and earlier PGA Tour rival, who had become a fine coach. Rodgers lived for a time at the Nicklaus home while this work was going on.|$|E
50|$|Brooks also {{required}} medical attention {{before leaving the}} Capitol; he had hit himself above his right eye {{with one of his}} <b>backswings.</b> Brooks was arrested for the assault.|$|R
5000|$|The typical {{dimensions}} {{of a golf}} simulator are approximately 4 or 5 m wide × [...] in length and just over [...] in height. This allows freedom of movement whilst swinging. This space typically allows for both left- and right-handed players with [...] <b>backswings</b> and follow throughs.|$|R
50|$|Date-Krumm {{plays with}} short <b>backswings</b> on both {{forehand}} and backhand sides. Date-Krumm's playstyle {{is representative of}} those that dominated during her first career in the 1990s using less topspin in favour of a flatter shot. She is considered to possess the most notable 'pancake' forehand in the Women's game, {{with one of the}} lowest average spin RPM ever. She relies on her opponent's power to hit sharp angles and catch her opponents offguard.|$|R
25|$|A {{variation}} on tweening {{is used by}} a very successful and well-known bowler, Pete Weber, who is considered a power stroker. This term refers to a bowler who relies on a high <b>backswing</b> and open shoulders to generate potential ball speed and a big hook, but uses the timing of a stroker. It {{can also be used}} to describe a stroker with a high rev rate, or a cranker with an unusually smooth release. A power stroker's release is both smooth and powerful, generating many revolutions via a wrist snap or flick of the fingers, without muscling the armswing. Some other famous power strokers include Bryan Goebel, Wes Malott, Doug Kent (often considered a tweener), and Chris Barnes (often considered a stroker).|$|E
500|$|Bradman's early {{development}} {{was shaped by}} the high bounce of the ball on matting-over-concrete pitches. He favoured [...] "horizontal-bat" [...] shots (such as the hook, pull and cut) {{to deal with the}} bounce and devised a unique grip on the bat handle that would accommodate these strokes without compromising his ability to defend. Employing a side-on stance at the wicket, Bradman kept perfectly still as the bowler ran in. His <b>backswing</b> had a [...] "crooked" [...] look that troubled his early critics, but he resisted entreaties to change. His <b>backswing</b> kept his hands in close to the body, leaving him perfectly balanced and able to change his stroke mid-swing, if need be. Another telling factor was the decisiveness of Bradman's footwork. He [...] "used the crease" [...] by either coming metres down the wicket to drive, or playing so far back that his feet ended up level with the stumps when playing the cut, hook or pull.|$|E
500|$|Before {{making a}} shot, the player may select a club {{and adjust the}} general {{direction}} of the swing. As with other golf games, a [...] "swing meter" [...] is used to simulate the act of swinging the club. The player clicks three times: first to initiate the <b>backswing,</b> which causes a timing indicator to move along the meter; second to begin the downswing; and third to [...] "snap" [...] the shot, which determines accuracy. Changes in the timing of these clicks alter the shot. A red section on the far end of the swing meter represents overswinging, which negatively affects shots. The crowd reacts to the player's shots, and Tournament mode features announcer commentary that analyzes the match overall; it can frame the player's current performance in the light of past shots.|$|E
5000|$|Brooks confronted Sumner, who {{was seated}} at his desk, writing letters. He said, [...] "Mr. Sumner, I have read your speech twice over carefully. It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, {{who is a}} {{relative}} of mine." [...] As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks hit Sumner over the head several times with his cane, made of thick gutta-percha with a gold head. Sumner was trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to strike Sumner until Sumner wrenched the desk from the floor {{in an attempt to}} escape. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood. He staggered up the aisle and collapsed unconscious. Senator John J. Crittenden, Representative Ambrose Murray, and others attempted to restrain Brooks before he killed Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who brandished a pistol and shouted at the onlookers to leave Brooks and Sumner alone. [...] Brooks continued beating Sumner until the cane broke, then quietly left the chamber with Keitt and Edmundson. [...] Brooks required medical attention before leaving the Capitol, because he had hit himself above his right eye with one of his <b>backswings.</b>|$|R
500|$|Nix {{praised the}} game's sound design, {{describing}} it as [...] "far and away above {{what would be}} expected on the Game Boy Color." [...] He noted, for example, that [...] "there are individual sounds of the lightsaber swinging back and forth — cutting left will sound differently than the <b>backswing</b> or upswing of the third stroke against an enemy." [...] Samantha Craggs of The Electric Playground praised Obi-Wan's Adventures for its interesting gameplay {{and the use of}} the lightsaber. She commented: [...] "There are quite a few things to like about this game. For one thing, you can't underestimate the feeling of moving across the floor wielding a deadly lightsaber. Also, the levels are interesting. [...] In , Obi-Wan is actually in a boat, going through the Naboo swamp, while battle droids shoot at him from the banks. While you're essentially fighting the same enemies in the same manner, there are enough twists in the level designs to interest you in continuing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "If he executes his <b>backswing</b> properly, as {{his arms}} are {{approaching}} hip level, {{they should be}} parallel with the plane and they should remain parallel with the plane, just beneath the glass, till they reach {{the top of the}} <b>backswing.</b> [...] At the top of his <b>backswing,</b> his left arm should be extended at the exact same angle (to the ball) as the glass." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Hogan advocates {{the use of}} a waggle {{not only}} because it helps you loosen your muscles, but also because it allows for your hands and arms to {{remember}} where to go for the first part of your <b>backswing.</b> The angle of the swing should feel like you are swinging under a slanting plane of glass. [...] The [...] "glass" [...] has a hole for your head while it rests on your shoulders and touches the ground on top of your ball. Also, the <b>backswing</b> should be slightly steeper than the downswing. [...] At the top of your <b>backswing,</b> your back should be facing the target.|$|E
2500|$|... "On the <b>backswing,</b> {{the order}} of {{movement}} goes like this: hands, arms, shoulders, hips." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When {{you finish}} your <b>backswing,</b> your chin should be hitting against {{the top of}} your left shoulder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Notable tweeners include Brian Voss (primarily a stroker, but not [...] "picture perfect"), Mika Koivuniemi (primarily a stroker, {{but with}} a high <b>backswing),</b> and Doug Kent (considered {{by some to be}} a power stroker).|$|E
2500|$|Some crankers use a low <b>backswing</b> {{but have}} a cupped wrist in order to {{generate}} high revolutions; this was the [...] "old-fashioned" [...] way of cranking. Notable bowlers with such a style include Jim Godman, Bob Learn, Jr., Ryan Shafer, Kelly Coffman, and Bob Vespi. Mark Roth {{was among the first}} bowlers to crank the ball using a high <b>backswing</b> and excessive wrist action. Other bowlers who followed this style include Amleto Monacelli, Jason Couch and, more recently, E. J. Tackett. Robert Smith, Mike Fagan, and Tommy Jones are often considered crankers due to their high backswings and RPM rates, but each has a smooth release and slide, so they can also be classified as power strokers.|$|E
2500|$|Tweeners (a term {{derived from}} [...] "in-between") are bowlers that deliver {{the ball in}} a manner that falls somewhere in between {{stroking}} and cranking. This modified delivery could use a higher <b>backswing</b> than is normally employed by a pure stroker or a less powerful wrist position than a pure cranker. Some use the term to refer to a bowler who is simply not a [...] "picture perfect" [...] example of either a stroker or a cranker. A variation on the tweener is the [...] "power stroker". This type of bowler uses a high <b>backswing</b> and/or powerful wrist position, but has the smooth timing and slide step of a stroker. Hall of Famer Pete Weber is perhaps the best-known example of a power stroker.|$|E
2500|$|George Anderson Low, Jr. (July 5, 1912 – April 10, 1995) was an American {{professional}} golfer {{and noted}} putting instructor and designer of golf putters. Low {{was also one}} of golf's greatest—and unabashed—hustlers. [...] He once reportedly said, [...] "Show me a millionaire with a bad <b>backswing</b> and I can have a very pleasant afternoon".|$|E
2500|$|A proper stance {{starts with}} your feet being aligned at the target, {{followed}} by your knees, hips and shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, your front foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target. [...] As you increase in club, your stance should widen for further stability. [...] Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club. [...] Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line. [...] The proper stance affects how controlled the <b>backswing</b> is, governs the amount of hip turn in the <b>backswing,</b> and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing. [...] Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc.|$|E
2500|$|... "As {{you begin}} the <b>backswing,</b> you must {{restrain}} your hips from moving until the turning of the shoulders starts {{to pull the}} hips around…It is this increased tension that unwinds {{the upper part of}} the body. [...] It unwinds the shoulder, the arms and the hands in that order, the correct order. [...] It helps the swing so much it makes it almost automatic." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "chip" [...] or [...] "half-swing" [...] is {{used for}} {{relatively}} short-distance shots near the green, with high-lofted irons and wedges. The goal of the chip is to land the ball safely on the green, allowing it to roll out towards the hole. It {{can also be used}} from other places to accurately position the ball into a more advantageous lie. The <b>backswing</b> typically ends {{with the head of the}} club between hip and head height.|$|E
2500|$|The half-thumb {{variation}} {{is a technique}} employed by Tom Smallwood, the surprise winner of the 2009 PBA World Championship, and involves putting the thumb in the ball only {{up to the first}} knuckle. [...] Thus, the ball is thrown almost entirely with the fingers as a [...] "no thumb" [...] bowler would throw it, with the thumb only providing some control during the <b>backswing.</b> [...] Smallwood also keeps two hands on the bowling ball until roughly midway through his approach.|$|E
2500|$|Later-released titles {{have seen}} mixed {{reactions}} {{in terms of}} control. Of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 from Electronic Arts, Matthew Kato of Game Informer stated that the controller [...] "has a hard time detecting your <b>backswing.</b> Thus, it’s harder to control. There were even times the game putted for me by accident." [...] A GamePro review for [...] offers that the title [...] "is an encouraging sign that developers are finally starting {{to work out the}} kinks and quirks of the Wii Remote." ...|$|E
2500|$|A tweener (a term {{derived from}} [...] "in-between") is a bowler that {{delivers}} {{the ball in}} a manner that falls somewhere in between stroking and cranking. They have rev rates between 300 and 370 rpm. This modified delivery could use a higher <b>backswing</b> than is normally employed by a pure stroker or a less powerful wrist position than a pure cranker. Some use the term to refer to a bowler who is simply not a [...] "picture perfect" [...] example of either a stroker or a cranker.|$|E
2500|$|... he levered the bat up {{by pushing}} {{down with the}} top hand, whilst using the bottom hand as a fulcrum. As it neared {{the top of the}} back-lift, Bradman manoeuvred the bat through a {{continuous}} arc and back towards the plane of the ball during the downswing in preparation for impact. Additionally, his <b>backswing</b> (according to former Australian captain Greg Chappell) kept his hands in close to his body, leaving him perfectly balanced and able to change his stroke mid-swing, if he was initially deceived by the flight of the ball.|$|E
2500|$|Employing a wide, side-on stance at the crease, Bradman {{preferred}} to keep perfectly still as the bowler ran in. Placing the bat between his feet (rather than behind his rear foot) was another unorthodox feature of his game. All these elements combined {{to give his}} <b>backswing</b> a [...] "crooked" [...] look, in that {{the face of the}} bat pointed at the slips cordon, rather than going straight, as advised in the coaching manuals. This [...] "crookedness" [...] troubled his early critics, but Bradman resisted any major technical changes and it became a moot point after he broke the record for the most runs in a Test series during the 1930 tour of England.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "putt" [...] {{is used in}} short-distance {{shots on}} or near the green, {{typically}} made with the eponymous [...] "putter", although similar strokes can be made with medium to high-numbered irons to carry a short distance in the air and then roll (a [...] "bump and run"). The <b>backswing</b> and follow-through of the putt are both abbreviated compared to other strokes, {{with the head of the}} club rarely rising above the knee. The goal of the putt is usually to put the ball in the hole, although a long-distance putt may be called a [...] "lag" [...] and is made with the primary intention of simply closing distance to the hole or otherwise placing the ball advantageously.|$|E
2500|$|Strokers often {{keep their}} {{shoulders}} square to {{the foul line}} and their <b>backswing</b> generally does not go much above parallel to the ground. This type of delivery reduces the ball's rate of revolution, thus decreasing its hook potential and hitting power. Strokers rely on finesse and accuracy, as opposed to crankers, who use speed and power. However, today's modern reactive resin bowling balls now allow strokers to hit the [...] "pocket" [...] at a relatively high angle. [...] Stroking is considered the most classic of all the bowling forms and {{is still the most}} popular style of bowling in the PBA. Walter Ray Williams, Jr., the PBA's all-time leader in titles and earnings, is a stroker.|$|E
2500|$|A stroker {{is a type}} {{of player}} in ten-pin bowling who {{releases}} his or her bowling ball in a smooth manner. They typically have rev rates less than 300 rpm.

2500|$|The cranker {{strives to}} {{generate}} revolutions using a cupped wrist or excessive wrist action. Crankers {{who rely on}} wrist action may have a high <b>backswing</b> and open their shoulders to generate ball speed. These bowlers often cup the wrist, but open the wrist {{at the top of}} the swing. Crankers may also muscle the ball with a bent elbow because their wrist is not strong enough to be cupped at the release. Crankers often use [...] "late" [...] timing, where the foot gets to the foul line before the ball; a technique known as plant and pull, hardly using any slide on their final step and pulling the ball upwards for leverage. The timing between the feet and the ball being delivered is only a fraction of a second. PBA Hall of Famer Mark Roth is a great example of a cranker.|$|E
2500|$|Hobens was victimized {{with some}} horribly bad {{luck in the}} 1904 North and South Open at Pinehurst, North Carolina. After 36 holes of {{regulation}} play he was tied for first place with Alec Ross. The two players went to a playoff where Hobens was one shot ahead {{with just a few}} holes to play. He hooked his tee shot into the left rough on a hole but had an easy, unobstructed shot to the green. [...] Upon making his <b>backswing,</b> his clubhead hooked a weed, or a [...] "creeper" [...] as it was called by Jerome Travers, which caused his ball to move. [...] Hobens, unable to stop his stroke, proceeded to miss the ball completely. [...] The unfortunate result was a one-stroke penalty for causing the ball to move and another stroke for the whiff. He ended up losing the tournament.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{chosen a}} club and stroke {{to produce the}} desired distance, the player {{addresses}} the ball by taking their stance {{to the side of}} it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club behind the ball. The golfer then takes their <b>backswing,</b> rotating the club, their arms and their upper body away from the ball, and then begins their swing, bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball. A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions, and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels. The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single [...] "plane" [...] of motion of the club and clubhead, to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction.|$|E
2500|$|A cranker {{or power}} player is a bowler who strives to {{generate}} revolutions using a cupped wrist or excessive wrist action. They have rev rates over 370 rpm. Crankers {{who rely on}} wrist action may have a high <b>backswing</b> and open their shoulders to generate ball speed. These bowlers often cup the wrist, but open the wrist {{at the top of}} the swing. Crankers may also muscle the ball with a bent elbow because their wrist is not strong enough to be cupped at the release. Crankers often use [...] "late" [...] timing, where the foot gets to the foul line before the ball; a technique known as plant and pull, hardly using any slide on their final step and pulling the ball upwards for leverage. The timing between the feet and the ball being delivered is only a fraction of a second. Even though the plant and pull bowler is sometimes used as another name for a cranker, it is rather misleading because some crankers slide more, while bowlers with other styles can also use this technique. The term [...] "cranking" [...] is used to describe the style of release and heavy wrist action that typifies crankers. Because of the high rev rate and power crankers have, they can throw powerful strikes even on less-than-perfect hits, but are more prone to splits rarely left by strokers or otherwise. Because many bowlers have a style that can be described as a cranker or a power stroker, the term power player is used for any bowler who can generate high revolutions or ball speed.|$|E
2500|$|With Washington {{clinging}} to a 4-3 lead, Max Scherzer came in on short rest to pitch {{the top of the}} fifth inning for the Nationals – his first relief appearance since the 2013 American League Division Series, when he was with the Detroit Tigers – and quickly got two outs; Cubs officials in the stands later told the press that they were preparing for Scherzer to pitch three or four lockdown innings and preserve Washington′s lead late into the game. Then the inning took a bizarre turn and descended into disaster for Washington. Scherzer gave up consecutive singles to Willson Contreras and pinch-hitter Ben Zobrist and a bases-clearing double to Addison Russell that gave the Cubs a 5-4 lead. [...] The Nationals intentionally walked Jason Heyward, and then Scherzer struck out [...] second baseman Javier Báez for what should have been the third out. However, the third strike got past Wieters, and Báez ran to first on the passed ball. Rather than hold the ball at home to prevent the Cubs from scoring, Wieters tried to throw out Báez at first, and his throw went into right field, allowing Russell to score, Heyward to advance to third, and Báez to reach second, and giving Chicago a 6-4 lead. Wieters asked the umpires to declare the ball dead and the play a strikeout on the grounds of offensive interference, claiming Báez's bat had hit him {{in the back of the}} head on the <b>backswing</b> – a contention confirmed by video evidence – but the umpires made a controversial ruling that even if the bat had struck Wieters, it did not interfere with the play and did not merit a ruling that the ball was dead, and they let the play stand. Next, Cubs pinch-hitter Tommy La Stella reached first base on a catcher's interference call against Wieters, loading the bases, and Scherzer followed that by hitting Jon Jay in the foot with a pitch, sending him to first and forcing in Heyward from third to increase Chicago′s lead to 7-4. Kris Bryant returned to the plate as the tenth Cubs batter of the inning, and popped out on Scherzer′s 28th pitch to bring the shocking inning to a close. After the game, Cubs manager Joe Maddon described the inning as [...] "bizarro world," [...] and Scherzer said, [...] "I′m sure I′ve been in some crazy stuff before, but nothing like that." [...] It was the first time in recorded MLB history, a total of some 2.73 million half-innings, that an intentional walk, a passed-ball strikeout, catcher′s interference, and a hit batsman had ever occurred in a single half-inning.|$|E
