The pelts {{were used in}} clothing, tiger-skin chuba being worn by singers and participants in horse racing festivals, and had become status symbols. In 2004, international conservation organizations launched successful environmental propaganda campaigns in China against the Tibetan tiger skin trade. There was outrage in India, where many Tibetans live, and the 14th Dalai Lama was persuaded {{to take up the}} issue.

With Egypt and Tunisia, these had only been restored shortly before the 1972 Olympics.|$|E

The number of vehicles subject to the charge fell by 56.4%, representing an average reduction of 21,274 vehicles per day, with a greater variation among auto drivers when compared to commercial vehicles. The number of exempt vehicles grew by 4.3%, for an average increase of 2.248 vehicles a day.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Gillard {{government}} {{implemented a}} carbon price of $23 per tonne {{to be paid}} by 300 liable entities representing the highest business emitters in Australia. The carbon price will increase to $25.40 per tonne by 2014–15, and then will be set by the market from 1 July 2015 onwards. It is expected {{that in addition to}} encouraging efficient use of electricity, pricing carbon will encourage investment in cleaner renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Treasury modelling has projected that with a carbon price, energy from the renewables sector is likely to reach 40 percent of supply by 2050. Analysis of the first 6months of operation of the carbon tax have shown {{that there has been a}} drop in carbon emissions by the electricity sector. It has been observed that there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in the mix of energy over this period, with less electricity being sourced from coal and more being produced by renewables such as hydro and wind power. The government at the time presented this analysis as an indicator that their policies to promote cleaner energy are working. The carbon pricing legislation was repealed by the Tony Abbott-led Australian Government on 17 July 2014. Since then, carbon emissions from the electricity sector have increased.|$|E

500|$|In late 1981, Brown asked Patton {{to become}} {{vice-chair}} of the Kentucky Democratic Party. He would serve under Dale Sights of Henderson.

500|$|Due to {{globalization}} in {{the past}} thirty years, {{the power of the}} unskilled worker has diminished, and thus, the informal economy has flourished. In Latin America, there is an abundant number of workers to help out with domestic work, and consequently, domestic service is cheap, diminishing the family tensions surrounding the issue of domestic work. Currently, about half of the working population is employed in the informal sector, leading to [...] "unemployment, underemployment, and social exclusion". Because of this, there has been a serious delay in providing welfare for the care of children and the elderly, because the pressure to provide aid for working families is minimal. In addition, domestic workers, many of them women, often leave their countries to work in the informal sector in northern countries in order to increase income for their families, also delaying the pressure for governments to provide aid to these families. However, there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> since the 2000s in thinking about unpaid work due to the influx of paid jobs for women and the shortage of people available to do domestic work.|$|E
500|$|... "A Change in Me" [...] was {{originally}} published in the key of D major, performed at a slow tempo. A [...] "belty" [...] pop ballad often performed within [...] "a plaintive register", its lead vocal spans two octaves, from A3 to F5. Like most of the musical's songs, the melody of [...] "A Change in Me" [...] is borrowed from the film's orchestral score. The New Jersey Montly summarized [...] "A Change in Me" [...] as [...] "a soaring number about how adventure comes in many forms." [...] Beginning, [...] "There's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in me a kind of moving on though what I used to be", the song was identified by author Thomas S. Hischak as a delicate, [...] "moving ballad". Lyrically, the song is [...] "about being at peace with oneself and how it’s expected as you grow up." [...] It has also been described as [...] "uplifting", featuring the lyrics [...] "I never thought I’d leave behind / My childhood dreams / But I don’t mind / I’m where and who I want to be". The chorus ends [...] "Now I love the world I see / No change of heart–a change in me".|$|E
500|$|Frusciante's {{approach}} to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that [...] "even on [...] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars." [...] However, on later albums such as Shadows Collide With People, he pursued the opposite: [...] "I just wanted {{everything to be}} perfect—I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that." [...] Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: [...] "If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it." [...] Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar. He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment. This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency. Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks [...] "music comes alive when [...] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism. With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted that there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new [...] "Progressive Synth Pop" [...] {{that he has been}} working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole. He currently uses the music tracker Renoise as his main Digital audio workstation along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his Doepfer, Arp, and other modular synthesizers.|$|E
