25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} {{has three}} clinical subtypes, denoted as I, II, and III. People with Usher I are born profoundly deaf, {{and begin to}} lose their vision {{in the first decade}} of life. They also exhibit balance difficulties, and learn to walk slowly as children, due to problems in their vestibular system. People with Usher II are not <b>born</b> <b>deaf,</b> but do have hearing loss. They do not seem to have noticeable problems with balance; they also begin to lose their vision later (in the second decade of life) and may preserve some vision even into middle age. People with Usher syndrome III are not <b>born</b> <b>deaf,</b> but experience a gradual loss of their hearing and vision; they may or may not have balance difficulties.|$|E
25|$|People with Usher I {{are usually}} <b>born</b> <b>deaf</b> and often have {{difficulties}} in maintaining their balance owing to {{problems in the}} vestibular system.

Usher syndrome is disproportionately common among the Cajuns of south Louisiana, such as Desormeaux and Catherine Fischer, because of a genetic mutation among early French Acadian settlers in Nova Scotia.|$|E

2500|$|According to Rajneesh, one has {{no right}} to knowingly inflict a {{lifetime}} of suffering: life should begin only at birth, and even then, [...] "If a child is <b>born</b> <b>deaf,</b> dumb, and we cannot do anything, and the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep" [...] rather than [...] "take the risk of burdening the earth with a crippled, blind child." [...] He argued that this simply freed the soul to inhabit a healthy body instead: [...] "Only the body goes back into its basic elements; the soul will fly into another womb. Nothing is destroyed. If you really love the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age. So even if a child is born, if he is not medically capable of enjoying life fully with all the senses, healthy, then it is better that he goes to eternal sleep and is born somewhere else with a better body." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Taste of Chaos tour in March of that year, guitarist Curtis Ward {{left the}} band. Ward's {{relationship}} deteriorated {{with the band}} as his stage performances were poor and he was abusive to the audience during Taste of Chaos, and he contributed little to the writing of Suicide Season. Other reasons included Ward's worsening tinnitus in his one functioning ear. Ward was <b>born</b> <b>deaf</b> in one ear and admitted playing in the band worsened the ringing in his ear {{to such a degree}} that he couldn't sleep at night. Regardless, Ward offered to perform the rest of the tour dates to which the band rejected and instead asked their guitar technician, Dean Rowbotham, to substitute for him over the course of the remaining performances. Lee Malia noted that Ward's departure helped improve everyone else's mood as he was very negative. Within a week of the tour, finishing Sykes started talking to Jona Weinhofen, at the time the guitarist of Bleeding Through and former member of I Killed the Prom Queen, which the band knew him through. He then was asked to join on a permanent basis. Ward has since worked on the TV show Top Gear and has occasionally performed on stage with Bring Me The Horizon, playing [...] "Pray For Plagues", most notably at Wembley Arena in 2015. In 2016, it was announced that Ward had joined the band Counting Days.|$|E

2500|$|In 1929, Hughes' wife, Ella, {{returned}} to Houston and filed for divorce. Hughes dated many famous women, {{many of them}} decades younger, including Billie Dove, Faith Domergue, Bette Davis, Ava Gardner, Olivia de Havilland, Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Janet Leigh, Rita Hayworth, Mamie Van Doren and Gene Tierney. He also proposed to Joan Fontaine several times, according to her autobiography No Bed of Roses. Jean Harlow accompanied him to the premiere of Hell's Angels, but Noah Dietrich wrote many years later that the relationship was strictly professional, as Hughes apparently personally disliked Harlow. In his 1971 book, Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes, Dietrich said that Hughes genuinely liked and respected Jane Russell, but never sought romantic involvement with her. According to Russell's autobiography, however, Hughes once tried to bed her after a party. Russell (who was married at the time) refused him, and Hughes promised it would never happen again. The two maintained a professional and private friendship for many years. Hughes remained good friends with Tierney who, after his failed attempts to seduce her, {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I don't think Howard could love anything that did not have a motor in it." [...] Later, when Tierney's daughter Daria was <b>born</b> <b>deaf</b> and blind and with a severe learning disability because of Tierney's being exposed to rubella during her pregnancy, Hughes saw to it that Daria received the best medical care and paid all expenses.|$|E
