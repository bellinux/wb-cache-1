On the Donegal islands of Arranmore, Gola, Inishfree, Inisbofin and Tory, voting took place on 24 October between 11:00 and 15:00 (11:00 and 19:30 on Arranmore). On 25 October, the Mayo islands of Clare Island, Inishbiggle and Inishturk went to the polls; while the Galway islands of Inishbofin and the Aran Islands voted on 26 October between 07:00 and 22:00.|$|E
5|$|Bradford City {{were formed}} {{following}} {{a series of}} meetings {{during the first half of}} 1903 and replaced the former rugby league club of Manningham, whose Valley Parade ground they used. The club had already signed six players before they were accepted into the league <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the side were later signed by a five-man committee. The board directors appointed Robert Campbell as the club's first manager. Bradford City's first game ended in a 2–0 defeat at Grimsby Town and the first home game resulted in another loss to Gainsborough Trinity. Club captain Johnny McMillan finished the top goalscorer with 14 league and two FA Cup goals.|$|E
5|$|Development of Space Race {{began in}} Summer 1972 {{under the name}} Asteroid by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, based on ideas by him and co-founder Ted Dabney. The final design was done by Dabney, {{possibly}} with assistance by Bushnell and Pong designer Allan Alcorn. The game was planned to be quick to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway. The engineering and prototyping was done by Alcorn; after it was completed and the design given to Midway to be released as Asteroid, Atari produced its own nearly identical version as Space Race. Fifty Space Race cabinets were produced using a fiberglass design by George Faraco <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the production was switched to a cheaper standard cabinet.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} 1st Special Service Brigade, No.4 Commando {{took part}} in the Normandy Landings in June 1944. Landing on Sword beach 30 minutes <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the brigade, their first {{objectives}} were to capture a strong point and gun battery in Ouistreham. After the commandos eliminated these positions they rejoined the brigade, reinforcing the 6th Airborne Division at the Orne bridges. Before the invasion the brigade had been informed that they would stay in France for only a few days. The commando remained there for a further 82 days, protecting the beachhead's left flank. During that period, No.4 Commando endured over 50 percent casualties. Finally withdrawn to Britain in September 1944, they were reassigned to the 4th Special Service Brigade for the assault on Walcheren island. At {{the end of the war}} No.4 Commando became part of the occupation force in Germany, but together with all other army commando units were disbanded in 1946.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, the US 2nd Infantry Division, {{with several}} armor and antiaircraft {{artillery}} units, {{was ordered to}} proceed to the Far East. The next day, MacArthur requested that the 2nd Division be brought to full war strength, if possible, without delaying its departure. He also reiterated his need of the units required to bring the four infantry divisions already in the Far East to full war strength. He detailed these as four heavy tank battalions, 12 heavy tank companies, 11 infantry battalions, 11 field artillery battalions, and four antiaircraft automatic weapons battalions per division. By August 7, the US 9th Infantry Regiment was operational in Korea, and {{had been sent to}} the Naktong Bulge area. However it {{would be the end of}} the month <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the 2nd Infantry Division arrived in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Some of Chopin's {{well-known}} pieces {{have acquired}} descriptive titles, {{such as the}} Revolutionary Étude (Op.10,No.12), and the Minute Waltz (Op.64,No.1). However, {{with the exception of}} his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.35), the one case where he did give a title, was written <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 24 June 1801 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars. A British ship of the line, HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell was passing westwards through the Southern Mediterranean near Cape Derna when it encountered a much larger French squadron under Contre-Amiral Honoré Ganteaume that was also returning westwards after a failed attempt to reinforce the besieged French garrison in Egypt. Although Hallowell immediately recognised the danger his vessel was in and turned to flee, the French ships were much faster and soon closed with his ship. At 14:00, three French vessels were within long gunshot and Hallowell decided that his only hope of escape lay in disabling the three ships <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the French squadron could join the engagement. Turning towards the enemy, Hallowell found that his sluggish ship was unable to respond rapidly to French manoeuvres and within two hours Swiftsure was surrounded. Threatened with complete destruction and unable to escape, the British captain surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Though {{not highly}} {{dangerous}} to humans, the pink whipray's venomous sting {{makes it difficult}} to handle when it is thrashing in a fishing net. Usually, it must be thrown overboard <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the catch can be sorted. Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia, and probably elsewhere in its range, this species is a regular incidental catch of coastal fisheries using tangle nets, bottom trawls, gillnets, seine nets, {{and to a lesser extent}} longlines. When retained, the meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized. Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated, and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate. The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. Off northern Australia, the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), but bycatch levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) became compulsory in 2000.|$|E
5|$|After {{the raid}} on Yarmouth, {{several of the}} III Squadron battleships {{developed}} problems with their condensers. This included König Albert; tubing needed to be replaced in all three main condensers, which necessitated extensive dockyard work. The ship went into drydock in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven on 29 May, two days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the fleet departed for the Battle of Jutland. Work on the ship was not completed until 15 June, and as a result, König Albert was the only German dreadnought in active service to miss the battle. On 18 August 1916, König Albert took part in an operation to bombard Sunderland. Admiral Scheer attempted {{a repeat of the}} original 31 May plan: the two serviceable German battlecruisers— and —augmented by three faster dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers. Scheer would trail behind {{with the rest of the}} fleet and provide support. Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{concept for}} Odin Sphere {{was of a}} story {{revolving}} around a Valkyrie princess, inspired by Kamitani's wish to emulate the protagonist of Princess Crown and hearing at second hand about planning at tri-Ace for , which involved Norse mythology and featured a princess as its main protagonist. Kamitani's Valkyrie protagonist, who would become Gwyndolin, was created <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the game's world and story were finalized. Working from this initial idea and its roots in Norse mythology, Kamitani began writing a romantic storyline for Gwyndolin and Oswald as the central narrative, basing it on Der Ring des Nibelungen by Richard Wagner. He then added further elements inspired by the works of William Shakespeare and traditional European fairy tales. The other narratives focused on different themes: Mercedes' storyline focused on her maturation into a queen, Velvet's story focused on resolving a mystery, while Cornelius' story narrative modeled after traditional fairy tales as a homage to the early PC game Marchen Veil. As with his other projects, Kamitani included strong female characters, as he felt a woman pushed into summoning the courage to fight deserved victory. There were plans to create backstory elements for characters like Odin and an extra book focusing on Ingway, but the negative impact those elements {{would have resulted in}} them being cut.|$|E
5|$|In {{this period}} the Labour Party usually won most Scottish {{parliamentary}} seats, losing this dominance briefly to the Unionists in the 1950s. Support in Scotland {{was critical to}} Labour's overall electoral fortunes as without Scottish MPs it would have gained only three UK electoral victories in the 20th century (1945, 1966 and 1997). The number of Scottish seats represented by Unionists (known as Conservatives from 1965 onwards) went into steady decline from 1959 onwards, until it fell to zero in 1997. The Scottish National Party gained its first seat at Westminster in 1945 and became a party of national prominence during the 1970s, achieving 11 MPs in 1974. However, a referendum on devolution in 1979 was unsuccessful as it did not achieve the support of 40 per cent of the electorate (despite a small majority of those who voted supporting the proposal) and the SNP went into electoral decline during the 1980s. The introduction in 1989 by the Thatcher-led Conservative government of the Community Charge (widely known as the Poll Tax), one year <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the United Kingdom, contributed to a growing movement {{for a return to}} direct Scottish control over domestic affairs. On 11 September 1997, the 700th anniversary of Battle of Stirling Bridge, the Blair-led Labour government again held a referendum on the issue of devolution. A positive outcome led to the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999. The new Scottish Parliament Building, adjacent to Holyrood House in Edinburgh, opened in 2004. Although not reaching its 1970s peak in Westminster elections, the SNP had more success in the Scottish Parliamentary elections with their system of mixed member proportional representation. It became the official opposition in 1999, a minority government in 2007, a majority government from 2011 and a second minority government in 2016.|$|E
