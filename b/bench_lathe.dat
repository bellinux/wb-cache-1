50|$|The terms center lathe, engine lathe, and <b>bench</b> <b>lathe</b> all {{refer to}} a basic type of lathe that may be {{considered}} the archetypical class of metalworking lathe most often used by the general machinist or machining hobbyist. The name <b>bench</b> <b>lathe</b> implies {{a version of this}} class small enough to be mounted on a workbench (but still full-featured, and larger than mini-lathes or micro-lathes). The construction of a center lathe is detailed above, but depending on the year of manufacture, size, price range or desired features, even these lathes can vary widely between models.|$|E

50|$|Turrets can {{be added}} to non-turret <b>lathes</b> (<b>bench</b> <b>lathes,</b> engine lathes, toolroom lathes, etc.) by {{mounting}} them on the toolpost, tailstock, or both. Often these turrets are not as large as a turret lathe's, and they usually do not offer the sliding and stopping that a turret lathe's turret does; but they do offer the ability to index through successive tool settings.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the turret lathe around {{the middle of the}} nineteenth century was a key aspect of the advancement of manufacturing technology. Unlike <b>bench</b> <b>lathes,</b> engine lathes, and toolroom lathes, on which each tool change involved some amount of setup, and toolpath had to be carefully controlled by the operator, turret lathes allowed the multiple tool changes and toolpaths of one part-cutting cycle to be repeated with little time or effort. By taking the tool-changing and the toolpath control out of the hands of the operator and building it into the machine tool, it accomplished several feats: it made interchangeable parts easier, faster, and thus cheaper to produce; and it made their production possible by workers with little skill. As long as a few skilled engineers, toolmakers, and setup technicians made and equipped the machine correctly, just about any operator could be hired (inexpensively) to run it.|$|R

Moulds are designed and fabricated using CAD (AutoCAD-2002) software for outside parties.|$|R
5000|$|A {{machine tool}} may have several spindles, {{such as the}} {{headstock}} and tailstock spindles on a <b>bench</b> <b>lathe.</b> The main spindle is usually the biggest one. References to [...] "the spindle" [...] without further qualification imply the main spindle. Some machine tools that specialize in high-volume mass production {{have a group of}} 4, 6, or even more main spindles. These are called multispindle machines. For example, gang drills and many screw machines are multispindle machines. Although a <b>bench</b> <b>lathe</b> has more than one spindle (counting the tailstock), it is not called a multispindle machine; it has one main spindle.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{turret lathe}} {{was invented by}} Stephen Fitch in 1845.The archetypical turret lathe, and the first in order of {{historical}} appearance, is the horizontal-bed, manual turret lathe. The term [...] "turret lathe" [...] without further qualification is still understood to refer to this type. The formative decades for this class of machine were the 1840s through 1860s, when the basic idea of mounting an indexable turret on a <b>bench</b> <b>lathe</b> or engine lathe was born, developed, and disseminated from the originating shops to many other factories. Some important tool-builders in this development were Stephen Fitch; Gay, Silver & Co.; Elisha K. Root of Colt; J.D. Alvord of the Sharps Armory; Frederick W. Howe, Richard S. Lawrence, and Henry D. Stone of Robbins & Lawrence; J.R. Brown of Brown & Sharpe; and Francis A. Pratt of Pratt & Whitney. Various designers at these and other firms later made further refinements.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Businesses {{producing}} and repairing agricultural technology still largely use NC-led <b>benches</b> – mostly <b>lathes.</b> <b>Benches</b> with technically outdated NC control system {{are still being}} used for the simple and CNC-led benches for handling the complicated surface geometry. Such a work division provides a more economic usage of the CNC-led bench resource. Programming NC-led benches is far more complicated when {{compared to that of}} CNC-led benches – even for handling the simplest surface geometry (phases, cones), a blueprint needs to be compiled with the CAD programme. According to the change in the measurements of the detail, a new blueprint needs to be compiled each time. Compiling the blueprint could be renounced when a mathematical model would be compiled for the corresponding surface element – it would help to find the coordinates of certain points required for programming. The present article describes the mathematical model for calculating the coordinates necessary for programming phases and cones with different measurements. The model has been compiled on the basis of MS Excel, as this programme (or analogues) are used in most of the mechanical engineering businesses...|$|R
