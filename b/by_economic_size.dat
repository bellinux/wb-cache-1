Our main finding is that the unusually low level of African trade is explained <b>by</b> <b>economic</b> <b>size,</b> geographical distance, and population. This result holds after controlling for a country’s access to the sea, composition of exports, linguistic ties with industrial countries, and trade policies. If anything, the average African country tends to “overtrade” compared with developing countries in other regions, although the degree to which Africa overtrades has steadily declined over the past two-and-one-half decades. ...|$|E

Refereed Journal ArticleThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an empirically verifiable {{framework}} for explaining patterns of third world defense expenditures. In doing so we have merged two areas of research that previously have been examined somewhat separately-economic (or ability to spend) with political (willingness to allocate resources to defense). In general our findings indicate that military regimes appear committed to developing the size of the defense sector to levels not warranted <b>by</b> <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> per se. They have done this through extensive use of externally borrowed funds. They have used increases in foreign exchange earnings to expand defense allocations, and they have distorted their price systems in a manner that facilitates increased defense expenditures. The major finding of the study is that ability and willingness factors, rather than external conditions, are instrumental in affecting third world military expenditures...|$|E

Against the backdrop of Australia's historic trade deficit and lower and unimpressive share in the world trade, this study is crucial and will play a contributory role for the policy makers in particular and for the economies of Australia and its trading partners in general. ...|$|E
30|$|On average, the {{variability}} of FI is around 30  % lower that {{the variability}} of MI on average (Table  4). This {{is also the case}} in almost all considered types of farming even if the stabilising effect tends to be higher in those groups of farms where DP contribute the most to farm income (Table  4). This general results is confirmed by data referring to farms grouped <b>by</b> <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> and level of PSE (Table  4). The income stabilising role of DP increases moving from the first to the higher quartiles of PSE. In the farms on the highest quartile the CV of FI is around 64  % lower than that of MI. Moreover, differences between CV(MI) and CV(FI) are almost always statistical significant at 1  % (Table  4). These results suggest that the extent of the stabilising role of DP increases as the relative level of DP increases and confirm that farms enjoying higher levels of DP can afford to cope with high level of market income variability better than other farms (El Benni et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|There {{is arguably}} a {{consensus}} that the current approach to drought relief {{is in need of}} reform and possibly replacement with an improved government financial assistance mechanism. Grants to farmers, in the form of interest rate subsidies, have several difficulties, which in summary are as follows: i. There are typically too few financial resources to be drawn from government to address adequately and equitably the needs of farms in a dire drought situation. ii. The rationing arising from (i) means that access to assistance requires complex eligibility criteria, resulting in application and administrative processes that are complex and thus expensive for both farmers and government. iii. Grants for drought relief are financed by contributions from all taxpayers, and it is very likely to be the case that this is regressive. Average taxpayers will be less wealthy and have fewer other economic advantages than the majority of farmers assisted through drought relief. This paper outlines the potential advantages and challenges associated with the implementation of income related loan arrangements for drought relief as a possible alternative to the existing interest rate subsidy scheme. The conceptual basis of income related loans is explained, and reference is made to the application of policies of this type in other areas of government financial intervention. The paper addresses the administrative challenges associated with such a policy reform, with reference to the idiosyncrasies of agricultural financing. An illustrative example is offered of what an income related loan applied to drought assistance might mean for the time stream of both revenue for the Commonwealth budget and repayment obligations for farms differing <b>by</b> <b>economic</b> <b>size.</b> income related loans, drought policy, agricultural subsidies...|$|E

40|$|This {{publication}} {{presents a}} description of the Community typology for agricultural holdings and the way how that is applied in Finland. The objective of the Community typology is to achieve a uniform classification of holdings in the European Union. The classification is based on the type of farming and the economic size, which are determined on the basis of standard gross margin. The Community typology for agricultural holding and the statistics where it is applied, the Community Farm Accountancy Data Network and the Community farm structure survey are based to the EU legislation. Joining to the EU in 1995 has meant that the stipulations concerning the typology and its applications entered into force also in Finland. The first half of this publication presents a thorough description of the Community typology as well as its main applications. This part also includes the description of the method of classifying the holdings in parallel statistics in Finland. In the empirical part of the publication the Finnish farms are classified according the Community typology rules. The physical characteristics of the holdings are based on the Rural Business Register. The standard gross margins for each characteristic are calculated for four geografical regions in a way agreed with Eurostat and DG VI. The outcome is the breakdown of Finnish farms by type farming and <b>by</b> <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> based on the Community typology. The first concrete applications of the new typology system in Finland are the determination of the sample needed for the Community Farm Accountancy Data Network and the Community Farm Structure Survey. In {{the last part of the}} publication the first sample for FADN in Finland is determined. The Community typology has many benefits in the future in Finland. It will be one important base for international comparations between holdings. It also facilitates for example the development of the calculation the results of Finnish bookkeeping farms.

This policy was motivated <b>by</b> Japan's <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> and dynamism, fears that a unique "Japanese model of capitalism" enabled it to compete unfairly and threaten American prosperity {{during a period of}} prolonged US economic difficulties, and that the United States had unique capabilities to induce policy change in Japan due to its provision of security guarantees. * No More Bashing argues that these assessments are mistaken and that the United States should abandon its Japan-specific policy. Japan's declining relative importance in the world economy, the waning distinctiveness of its economic institutions, the failure of most recent US initiatives toward Japan, and the emergence of strengthened international institutions such as the World Trade Organization, all underscore the advisability of formulating new approaches to bilateral relations rooted more firmly in multilateral institutions. * This volume analyzes the outlook for the Japanese and US economies; their trade and financial relationships, including their trade negotiations over the past decade; the implications of new regional developments, most notably the rise of China and proposals for East Asian economic cooperation; and the roles of the United States and Japan in the provision of international public goods such as development assistance, environmental protection, and international security. It emphasizes that their trade agenda is increasingly moving beyond traditional border impediments toward the more politically sensitive issues of internal regulation and deregulation, such as competition policy.
