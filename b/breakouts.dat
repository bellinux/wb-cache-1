5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small <b>breakouts</b> of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 1/2 May, most of the {{remnants}} of the Berlin garrison attempted {{to break out of the}} city centre in three different directions. Only those that went west through the Tiergarten and crossed the Charlottenbrücke (a bridge over the Havel) into Spandau succeeded in breaching Soviet lines. Only a handful of those who survived the initial breakout made it to the lines of the Western Allies—most were either killed or captured by the Red Army's outer encirclement forces west of the city. Early in the morning of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. The military historian Antony Beevor points out that as most of the German combat troops had left the area in the <b>breakouts</b> the night before, the resistance must have been far less than it had been inside the Reichstag. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 06:00 hours. He was taken to see General Vasily Chuikov at 08:23. Weidling agreed to order the city's defenders to surrender to the Soviets. Under General Chuikov's and Vasily Sokolovsky's direction, Weidling put his order to surrender in writing.|$|E
25|$|The primary tactic {{after being}} {{surrounded}} was to delay until nightfall, after which <b>breakouts</b> would begin. Large formations were {{broken down into}} smaller units to facilitate escape and a rendezvous was pre-planned in advance. Special units were deployed to probe the encirclement, looking for weak points, and decoy units were held ready for action to occupy American forces once the <b>breakouts</b> began. <b>Breakouts</b> could be made with diversions while bodies of troops slipped away, or strength could be concentrated on a weak spot, providing enough local superiority to penetrate the American encirclement and disperse. Escaping units would link up later at designated marshaling points. Harassment and diversionary tactics also paid dividends. As noted by some airpower historians, relatively small bodies of local fighters armed with inexpensive rifles, could divert and tie down expensive and massive allocations of men, material and time deployed by more sophisticated opponents.|$|E

5000|$|The {{success of}} the game {{resulted}} {{in the development of}} Super <b>Breakout</b> a couple of years later. It was released on 126 different machines. While ostensibly very similar to <b>Breakout</b> - the layout, sound, and general behavior of the game is identical - Super <b>Breakout</b> is a microprocessor based game instead of discrete logic, programmed by Asteroids programmer Ed Logg using an early MOS 6502 chip. He developed Super <b>Breakout</b> after hearing that Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari, wanted <b>Breakout</b> updated. Super <b>Breakout</b> can therefore be emulated in MAME and is also featured {{in a number of different}} Atari compilation packs.

25|$|Common {{stabilization}} materials include pozzolan-cement grout and polyurethane. The {{requirements for}} slab stabilization are {{strength and the}} ability to flow into or expand to fill small voids. Colloidal mixing equipment is necessary to use the pozzolan-cement grouts. The contractor must place the grout using a positive-displacement injection pump or a non-pulsing progressive cavity pump. A drill is also necessary but it must produce a clean hole with no surface spalling or <b>breakouts.</b> The injection devices must include a grout packer capable of sealing the hole. The injection device must also have a return hose or a fast-control reverse switch, in case workers detect slab movement on the uplift gauge. The uplift beam helps to monitor the slab deflection and has to have sensitive dial gauges.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 May, the Soviets stormed the Reich Chancellery. In the {{official}} Soviet version, the battle {{was similar to that}} of the battle for the Reichstag. There was an assault over Wilhelmplatz and into the building with a howitzer to blast open the front doors and several battles within the building. Major Anna Nikulina, a political officer with Lieutenant-General I. P. Rossly's 9th Rifle Corps of the 5th Shock Army carried and unfurled the red flag on the roof. However, Beevor suggests that the official Soviet description is probably an exaggeration, as most of the German combat troops had left in the <b>breakouts</b> the night before, resistance must have been far less than that inside the Reichstag.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 local {{programming}} {{on almost}} all Classic Hits stations was reduced {{down to a}} 4-hour breakfast show between 6am and 10am. By using new satellite networking technology, Classic Hits stations were able to have local shows at breakfast time, and have network shows presented from the Classic Hits Auckland studios with local advertisements, weather forecasts and <b>breakouts</b> at other times of the day. The local stations remained commercially viable in otherwise unviable markets and the network was able to invest in its brand and programmes. The company was able to leverage its reach for national advertising clients, including agency campaigns. At this stage Classic Hits 98FM in Christchurch was exempt from these changes and continued to run local shows 24 hours a day. Local content was also retained in Auckland as network presenters began presenting separate voice breaks for local Auckland listeners.|$|E

25|$|Yellow fever {{virus is}} mainly {{transmitted}} through {{the bite of}} the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, but other mostly Aedes mosquitoes such as the tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) can {{also serve as a}} vector for this virus. Like other arboviruses which are transmitted by mosquitoes, the yellow fever virus is taken up by a female mosquito when it ingests the blood of an infected human or other primate. Viruses reach the stomach of the mosquito, and if the virus concentration is high enough, the virions can infect epithelial cells and replicate there. From there, they reach the haemocoel (the blood system of mosquitoes) and from there the salivary glands. When the mosquito next sucks blood, it injects its saliva into the wound, and the virus reaches the bloodstream of the bitten person. Transovarial and transstadial transmission of the yellow fever virus within A. aegypti, that is, the transmission from a female mosquito to her eggs and then larvae, are indicated. This infection of vectors without a previous blood meal seems {{to play a role in}} single, sudden <b>breakouts</b> of the disease.|$|E

Both cities were captured by 28 March. The army was transported across the Danube and attacked Vienna from the northeast. On 13 April, the army cleared Vienna of German troops in conjunction with the 6th Tank Army. The army then fought in the Prague Offensive from 6 May.

The May Day protests in İstanbul, taking place on 1 May, were also met by a heavy-handed police crackdown, with a police van attempting to run over CHP MP Aykut Erdoğdu, who suffered a broken hand while demanding to go with activists who were in police custody. A MHP youth wing leader and Ege University student, Fırat Yılmaz Çakıroğlu was killed by PKK militants who raided the university in Izmir on 21 February.

40|$|<b>Breakout</b> (wall failure) of {{boreholes}} {{within the}} earth can take several forms depending upon physical {{properties of the}} surrounding rock and the stress and flow conditions. Three distinctive modes of <b>breakout</b> are (I) extensile <b>breakout</b> observed in brittle rocks (e. g., Haimson and Herrick, 1986), (II) shear <b>breakout</b> in soft and clastic rocks (Zoback et al., 1985), and (III) fracture-like, slot-shaped <b>breakout</b> within highly porous granular rocks (Bessinger et al., 1997; Haimson and Song, 1998). During fluid production and injection within weakly cemented high-porosity rocks, the third type of failure could result in sustained and excessive sand production (disintegration of the rock's granular matrix and debris production). An objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the physical conditions that result in the formation of slot-shaped borehole <b>breakout,</b> via laboratory experiments. Our laboratory borehole <b>breakout</b> experiment was conducted using synthetic high-porosity sandstone with controlled porosity and strength. Block samples containing a single through-goring borehole were subjected to anisotropic stresses within a specially designed tri-axial loading cell. A series of studies was conducted to examine the impact of (1) stress anisotropy around the borehole, (2) rock strength, and (3) fluid flow rate within the borehole on the formation of slot-shaped borehole <b>breakout.</b> The geometry of the <b>breakout</b> was determined after the experiment using X-ray CT. As observed in other studies (Hamison and Song, 1998; Nakagawa and Myer, 2001), flow within a borehole plays a critical role in extending the slot-shaped <b>breakout.</b> The results of our experiments indicated that the width of the <b>breakout</b> was narrower for stronger rock, possibly due to higher resistance to erosion, and the orientation of the <b>breakout</b> plane was better defined for a borehole subjected to stronger stress anisotropy. In most cases, the <b>breakout</b> grew rapidly once the borehole wall started to fail. This 'run-away' failure growth is induced by monotonically increasing stress concentration at the <b>breakout</b> tips, although this effect may be augmented by the finite size of the sample...|$|R
