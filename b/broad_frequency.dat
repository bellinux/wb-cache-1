5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a <b>broad</b> <b>frequency</b> range.|$|E

2500|$|The use of [...] "full range, flat response" [...] (FRFR) {{amplification}} {{systems by}} electric guitarists has received an extra impetus from modeling amplifiers. Before widespread availability of modeling, guitarists did not commonly plug electric guitars straight into PA systems or powered speakers, because most genres {{relied on the}} tonal coloration of a regular guitar amplifier setup—from the preamplifier, equalization filters, power amp, guitar speakers, and cabinet design. The FRFR approach assumes the tone is shaped by sound processors in the signal chain before the amplifier and speaker stage, so it strives to not add further coloration. or dedicated combo-style amplifiers with a <b>broad</b> <b>frequency</b> range. Such processors can be traditional guitar effects, a modeling amplifier (without power amplifier), or a computer running tone-shaping software.

30|$|Seismic {{reflection}} {{survey was}} conducted from onboard the R/V Kairei of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) along the seismic line NT 501 H in 2005, which followed the axis of the NT southwest of Japan (Fig.  1). In this survey, a total of ca. 552  km of seismic reflection records with very-high vertical-resolution were collected using two GI guns (with a total volume of 12  L). As a receiver, a 5100 -m streamer cable was used. The shot, receiver and common depth point (CDP) intervals were 50, 25 and 12.5  m, respectively. The GI guns and the streamer cable were towed at depths of 5 and 8  m below sea level, respectively; these towing depths are shallower than those of conventional Kairei seismic reflection surveys (10 and 15  m) and provide <b>broader</b> <b>frequency</b> bandwidth because of higher ghost-notch <b>frequencies.</b> <b>Broader</b> <b>frequency</b> bandwidth is advantageous for not only analyzing fault characteristics with high resolution but also estimating seismic attenuation, especially for methods in the frequency domain such as the spectral ratio method.|$|R

50|$|Because superlenses can {{overcome}} the diffraction limit, this {{allows for a}} more efficient coupling to external radiation and enables a <b>broader</b> <b>frequency</b> band.

With superlenses the details of the near field images are not lost. Growing evanescent waves are supported in the metamaterial (n < 1), which restores the decaying evanescent waves from the source. This results in a diffraction-limited resolution of λ/6, after some small losses. This compares with λ/2, the normal diffraction limit for conventional lenses.|$|R
