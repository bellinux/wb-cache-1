5000|$|According to Charles Roeder, a {{professor}} of civil engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, through-truss bridges were a common bridge design in the 1950s (there are 10,200 through-truss bridges in the US), but [...] "if you take {{out some of the}} top framing, you set that bridge up for a stability failure." [...] Before computers, bridge engineers analyzed truss forces by slide rule, with each calculation <b>being</b> <b>time-consuming.</b> Although the finite element method and plastic design theory, both capable of analyzing redundant structures, had recently been formulated and had seen occasional use, they required significantly more calculation than the simple calculation methods for statically determinate structures, which precluded the use of redundant structural members. A great number of bridges were being designed at that time, and there were insufficient design engineers available to design many bridges as indeterminate structures.|$|E
5000|$|As Reufli and Sarrazin observed, the {{key issue}} with {{strategic}} control mechanisms {{is the need to}} deal with uncertainty and ambiguity. A landmark study by Michael Goold and Andrew Campbell identified that a variety of control methods are used across a continuum ranging from purely financial controls at one extreme, through to detailed strategic planning systems at the other. [...] They observed a series of trade-offs between these extremes - financial controls being simpler and therefore cheaper and more flexible to operate, but providing less scope for co-ordination between components of an organisation, strategic planning <b>being</b> <b>time-consuming</b> and expensive to operate, but providing the greatest scope to push for maximum strategic advantage. In the middle of this range, Goold and Campbell described strategic control as allowing firms to [...] "balance competitive and financial ambitions". This idea of a spectrum of control has since been widely adopted.|$|E

OGC presents a drop of accuracy for higher radius values due to the known ‘shrinking problem’ of graph cut. ORFC presented the best results for the liver segmentation, taking advantage of its homogeneous interior.

Nowadays, trends in combustion engine simulations are towards the development of comprehensive multi-dimensional models that accurately describe the performance of engines at a very high level of details. However, these models need a precise experimental input and substantial computational power, which make the process significantly complicated and time-consuming [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. On the other hand, zero-dimensional models, which are mainly based on energy conservation (first law of thermodynamics) with a limited set of experimental data, are preferred due to their simplicity, of <b>being</b> less <b>time-consuming,</b> and their relatively accurate results [7, 8, 9, 10].|$|R

30|$|The {{number of}} methods for dynamic texture {{synthesis}} {{that have been}} proposed can be separated into two groups: parametric and non-parametric. Parametric methods address the problem as a modeling of a stationary process, where the resulting representation allows to generate a new video with similar characteristics as the input sample [2 – 7]. A clear disadvantage of these methods is that the estimation of the parameters may not be straightforward, <b>being</b> <b>time-consuming</b> and computationally demanding. Besides, the synthetic outputs may not be realistic enough, showing some blurred results. In contrast, we have the non-parametric methods, also known as exemplar-based techniques, which actually {{have been the most}} popular techniques up to now. The success of these methods comes from their outcomes, which look more natural and realistic than those of the parametric methods. Considerable work in non-parametric methods has been developed for dynamic texture synthesis along the time domain. Nevertheless, the synthesis in the spatial domain has not received the same attention.|$|E
