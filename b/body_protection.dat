25|$|The Byzantines {{made great}} use of ‘soft armour’ of quilted, padded textile {{construction}} {{identical to the}} “jack” or aketon found later in the Latin West. Such a garment, called the kavadion, usually reaching to just above the knees with elbow or full-length sleeves, was often the sole <b>body</b> <b>protection</b> for lighter troops, both infantry and cavalry. Alternatively the kavadion could provide the base garment (like an arming doublet) worn under metallic armour by more heavily protected troops. Another form of padded armour, the epilōrikion, could be worn over a metal cuirass.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his cricket career, {{which lasted}} from 1948 until the 1977 season, Close {{was one of}} the most charismatic and {{well-known}} cricketers. He scored almost 35,000runs as a batsman, including 52centuries with a highest innings score of 198. He also took 1,168wickets as a bowler, over 800catches as a fielder and one stumping, as a stand-in wicket-keeper. At just over six feet (1.83 m) tall he was a noticeable presence on the field, often fielding at the short leg position, close to the batsman. As cricketers did not use head or <b>body</b> <b>protection</b> in Close's day, he would often get hurt when a batsman struck a ball that hit him. Close was also noted, as a batsman, for standing up to intimidatory bowling, letting the ball hit his unprotected torso rather than flinching.|$|E

25|$|Close was {{recalled}} to the England Test squad in 1963, {{and played}} {{his first full}} series of five matches, against the West Indies. His innings in the second Test at Lord's remains his best known. When England were pressing for a last-day victory, Close took the battle to the fastest West Indian fast bowlers, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith, daring to advance down the wicket to them. This was before <b>body</b> <b>protection</b> and helmets were in use, and time and again the ball struck Close firmly on his body. But he persevered. With no other England player but Ken Barrington scoring above 20, Close's innings of 70 saved the game for England, and came near to winning it. Set 234 to win, England ended on 228 for 9, with Colin Cowdrey famously coming in to bat (for two balls at the non-striker's end) with his broken arm in plaster.|$|E
