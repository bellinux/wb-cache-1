25|$|NASCAR founder William France Sr. began {{planning}} for the track in 1953 {{as a way to}} promote the series, which at the time was racing on the Daytona Beach Road Course. France met with Daytona Beach engineer Charles Moneypenny to discuss his plans for the speedway. He wanted the track to have the highest banking possible to allow the cars to reach high speeds and to give fans a better view of the cars on track. Moneypenny traveled to Detroit, Michigan to visit the Ford Proving Grounds which had a high-speed test track with banked corners. Ford shared their engineering reports of the track with Moneypenny, providing the needed details of how to transition the pavement from a flat straightaway to a <b>banked</b> <b>corner.</b> France took the plans to the Daytona Beach city commission, who supported his idea and formed the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority.|$|E

50|$|The first Japanese Grand Prix was run as {{a sports}} car race at the Suzuka Circuit 80 km south west of Nagoya in May 1963. This marked the {{beginning}} of motor racing in earnest in Japan. For the next 11 years, however; the non-championship Grand Prix was run at the Fuji Speedway, 40 mi west of Yokohama and 66 mi west of the Japanese capital of Tokyo. The circuit had a <b>banked</b> <b>corner</b> called Daiichi and was the scene of many fatal accidents. It was then {{run as a}} number of disciplines of motorsports, particularly Formula 2, sports cars and Can-Am-type sprint racing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} sets {{consisted of}} only {{two different types of}} track part. A 15" [...] straight and a 90 degree bend. Later sets added 45 degree bends and 10" [...] straights. More elaborate sets included a 4 lanes wide straight that allowed you to drive off onto a second track or a pitlane, a <b>banked</b> <b>corner</b> where the centrifugal force generated by a fast moving car would allow it to run off from the electronic power strips onto a banked extension to the outside of the corner and, from a Dukes Of Hazzard TCR set, a ramp and jump.|$|E
50|$|After {{exiting the}} station, the train makes a large right turn and then travels up a chain lift hill. It gently trundles around a curve {{at the top}} of the hill. The train then violently dips downwards. A ratchet that is in place to prevent roll backs precedes a short {{straight}} section. After this straight section, there is another smaller dip. The train takes another trundle round a corner, then travels gently downwards; the train picks up speed before hitting a <b>banked</b> <b>corner.</b> The train then travels through a loop, this is followed by a sharp corner. The train then rolls up and the brakes are only slightly applied. The train travels around more corners, followed by a small bump, then up and into the brake run at the end of the ride.|$|E

France then began working on building funding for the project and found support from a Texas oil millionaire, Clint Murchison. Murchison loaned France $600,000 along with the construction equipment necessary to build the track. France was also able to secure funding from Pepsi-Cola, General Motors designer Harley Earl, a second mortgage on his home and selling 300,000 stock shares to local residents. Ground broke on construction of the 2.5 mi speedway on November 25, 1957.|$|E
50|$|As {{the safety}} car came in, Michael Schumacher jumped Rubens Barrichello {{and went into}} the lead of the race. Further back, Räikkönen attempted, {{although}} unsuccessfully, to overtake Sato for fourth place. On lap nine, Fernando Alonso, in a Michelin-shod Renault, crashed out from third place {{at the end of the}} main straight after his right rear tyre deflated under braking, destroying the front end of the Renault and some polystyrene boards at turn one. Double yellow flags, but not the safety car, was deployed, meaning the drivers were not allowed to overtake in that zone. At the end of lap ten, the Williams of Ralf Schumacher, also, crucially on Michelin tyres, in an alarming precedent for the 2005 United States Grand Prix, suffered a tyre failure in turn thirteen, the only <b>banked</b> <b>corner</b> at the time in Formula One, backing the car into the wall at a ninety-degree angle. The car skidded several hundred metres down the race track before coming to rest. Schumacher sat motionless in the car for two minutes, unable to talk to his team over the radio, as the radio had been smashed in the incident. The safety car was deployed, and so many people opted to make an early pit stop. Michael Schumacher pitted, as did his team mate Barrichello, but Barrichello had to queue behind Schumacher, and also struggled to get going from the stop, costing him track position to Kimi Räikkönen, who also pitted. As he left the pit lane, David Coulthard ran over a piece of debris from Alonso's Renault. Michael Schumacher now led the race from Takuma Sato, Jenson Button, and Juan Pablo Montoya, none of whom had made a pit stop. Kimi Räikkönen was now fifth, ahead of Barrichello in sixth, Trulli in seventh place, and Olivier Panis in the last points position in eighth.|$|E
50|$|Spa was {{modified}} {{to make it}} even faster, shortening it to 8.7 miles (14.1 km). All of the slow corners were taken out - the Stavelot hairpin was bypassed and made into a fast <b>banked</b> <b>corner</b> and the Malmedy chicane was also bypassed. At this time, every corner except La Source was ultra-high speed. Spa over this time became {{known as one of}} the most extreme, challenging and fearsome circuits in motorsports history. 1950 saw the introduction of the Formula One World Championship; the race was dominated by the Alfa Romeos of Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio and Italian Nino Farina. Their closest challenger, Alberto Ascari, ran into fuel problems and fell back. The race was won by Fangio, and Farina won the next year's race in his works Alfa after Fangio dropped back with hub problems. 1953 saw Ascari dominate in his Ferrari while the Maseratis fell apart. Fangio crashed and José Froilán González had a steering failure and stopped out near the banked Stavelot corner. 1955 saw Mercedes dominate, Fangio and his British teammate Stirling Moss led the race distance. Moss followed Fangio closely for most of the race, the Argentine took victory as he had the year before in a Maserati. 1956 saw a wet race, with Moss in a Maserati lead, and Fangio, now driving for Ferrari, made a bad start and dropped to fifth at the start, although he got up to second behind Moss. The track was drying, and Moss lost a wheel at Raidillon corner. Fortunately he didn't hit anything and went back to take over his teammate Cesare Perdisa's car and was able to finish 3rd. The gearbox in Fangio's car broke, and his teammate Peter Collins won the race.|$|E

5000|$|Generally, {{tracks for}} formal {{competition}} may have <b>banked</b> <b>corners</b> and may bridge one section over another, {{but may not}} otherwise use [...] "trick" [...] configurations. Home tracks often include special features to increase the drama and/or challenge of racing, such as slots that wiggle or squeeze the lanes together, bumps, airborne jumps, or uneven surfaces, but these are typically called [...] "toy" [...] tracks and are not used for competition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{track was}} built on marshlands in 1968 and became an {{extremely}} popular venue in the 1970s, just as Swede Ronnie Peterson was {{at the height of}} his career. It has a long straight (called Flight Straight, which was also used as a 980 m aircraft runway [...] ), as well as several <b>banked</b> <b>corners,</b> making car setup an engineering compromise. Unusually, the pit lane is located halfway round the lap.|$|R
