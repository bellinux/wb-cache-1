25|$|Brick, cobblestone, sett, wood plank, {{and wood}} block {{pavements}} such as Nicolson pavement, were once common {{in urban areas}} throughout the world, but fell out of fashion in most countries, due to {{the high cost of}} labor required to lay and maintain them, and are typically only kept for historical or aesthetic reasons. In some countries, however, they are still common in local streets. In the Netherlands, <b>brick</b> <b>paving</b> has made somewhat of a comeback since the adoption of a major nationwide traffic safety program in 1997. From 1998 through 2007, more than 41,000km of city streets were converted to local access roads with a speed limit of 30km/h, for the purpose of traffic calming. One popular measure is to use <b>brick</b> <b>paving</b> - the noise and vibration slows motorists down. At the same time, {{it is not uncommon for}} cycle paths alongside a road to have a smoother surface than the road itself.|$|E
