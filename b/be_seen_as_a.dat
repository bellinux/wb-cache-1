5|$|Although the Battle of Borodino can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{victory for}} Napoleon, some {{scholars}} and contemporaries described Borodino as a Pyrrhic victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{vertical}} trends down groups, helium can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> typical noble gas {{at the head}} of Group 18, but as discussed below, hydrogen's chemistry is unique and it is not easily assigned to any group.|$|E
5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, {{her eyes}} as she checks the {{rear-view}} mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E
50|$|Schumpeterian rent <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of {{economic}} rent, although Schumpeterian rent may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> incentive towards greater economic inefficiency.|$|R
50|$|After WWII {{women were}} {{discouraged}} from entering into engineering. During the war, their efforts <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> patriotic duty. After the war, women in engineering <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> abnormality.|$|R
50|$|In some areas, the {{bullhead}} <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> desirable quarry, for its fighting qualities exceed its size. In other areas, it <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nuisance fish {{due to its}} efficient bait-stealing qualities.|$|R
5|$|Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov– Hopeless drunk who indulges {{in his own}} suffering, {{and father}} of Sonya. Marmeladov could <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Russian {{equivalent}} {{of the character of}} Micawber in Charles Dickens' novel, David Copperfield.|$|E
5|$|Stability {{constants}} of complexes: {{formation of}} a complex can often <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> competition between proton and metal ion for a ligand, which {{is the product of}} dissociation of an acid.|$|E
5|$|The play {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{predecessor}} to the exaggerated emotionalism of later American drama, {{and as an}} early example of how background music would be used in more modern American drama and films.|$|E
50|$|Toad <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> zombie, {{along with}} several {{other members of the}} zombie Freedom Force chasing after the still living Blob. They succeed, <b>as</b> he <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> zombie in Dead Days.|$|R
50|$|Dom Peters <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shining {{example for}} all inner-city {{children}} {{wanting to get}} into professional sport after coming through the Broncos youth system. He <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> highly promising winger when injury-free.|$|R
5000|$|Cashmere Ramada and Shelley Oceans {{appeared}} in the Neil's Puppet Dreams episode [...] "Dream Bump." [...] Cashmere Ramada <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dancer while Shelly Oceans <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> drag queen (performed by Allan Trautman).|$|R
5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} began formulating {{their plans}} for the future direction of the fighting in the wider Pacific with a focus upon retaking the Philippines and the eventual capture of the Japanese Home Islands. The lynchpin to Japanese strength in the region was their main base at Rabaul. The reduction of this base came to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key tenet of success in the SWPA for the Allies and was formalised into Operation Cartwheel.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement {{as seen in}} the carvings could, perhaps, equally easily <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of hanging upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E
5000|$|On January 3, 2017, Bramnick {{announced}} that he would not run for New Jersey governor in 2017, <b>as</b> he <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential frontrunner for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Bramnick <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential 2018 Senate candidate against Sen. Robert Menendez.|$|R
50|$|Comfort food {{consumption}} has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> response to emotional stress and, consequently, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key {{contributor to the}} epidemic of obesity in the United States. The provocation of specific hormonal responses leading selectively to increases in abdominal fat <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of self-medication.|$|R
50|$|He was {{considered}} a moderate in his views. At the conclave of 1963, Confalonieri <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> possible candidate for a transitional pope, one who {{is not likely to}} effect great change during his tenure. Yet his lack of pastoral experience <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hindrance.|$|R
5|$|Although it {{has gained}} a {{significant}} online presence, it was successful {{before the advent of}} Internet communities. The Church was a pioneer in the religious use of zines; Cusack notes that its use of the medium can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rejection of the alienation of labor practices.|$|E
5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or velcro to reduce noise.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{regarded}} as a barren, desolate and dangerous to cross, the Pine Bush has come to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> historical, cultural, and environmental asset to the Capital District and Hudson Valley regions of New York. It {{is home to the}} Karner blue butterfly, an endangered species first identified by author Vladimir Nabokov in 1944 using a type specimen from the Pine Bush.|$|E

50|$|Her life <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} contradictions.|$|R
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; {{it is a place}} of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
5|$|In 1997–98, Jovanovski {{appeared}} in 81 games, recording nine goals and 23 points. With his contract set to expire following the 1998–99 season, Jovanovski {{was beginning to}} <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> disappointment in Florida, failing to improve on his successful rookie year.|$|E
5|$|In Kesselring's memoirs, he {{said that}} in Wolfsberg he was {{approached}} by a former SS major who had an escape plan prepared. According to Kesselring, he declined the offer {{on the grounds that it}} would <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> confession of guilt.

50|$|There {{have been}} widely {{divergent}} views on Khayyám. At {{one end of the}} spectrum, there are nightclubs named after Khayyám, and he <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> agnostic hedonist. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, he <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mystical Sufi Muslim poet with a complex set of ideals.|$|R
5|$|In a 2010 book, the {{environmentalist}} Tim Flannery {{claimed that}} Wallace was 'the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival,' {{and suggested that}} Wallace's understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> forerunner to modern ecological thinking.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's last album, Invincible, was {{released}} six years later, in 2001, his longest period between full studio records. Following {{a conflict between}} Jackson and his record label, Sony Music stopped promoting the album. Invincible {{would go on to}} <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> relative commercial disappointment when compared to Jackson's prior solo material, although it sold 13 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is {{approached by}} the FBI when {{a series of}} bombs are detonated in Washington, DC.
