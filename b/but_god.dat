5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, <b>but</b> <b>God</b> – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing a voice that he thinks is God telling him to murder people, Ned Flanders becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer {{is the one who}} has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything that has happened, <b>but</b> <b>God</b> tells her that Satan is the one who is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E

5|$|Monarchs often pledged various {{items of}} state regalia as {{collateral}} for loans throughout the Middle Ages. At {{some point in}} the 14thcentury, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London due to a series of successful and attempted thefts in a part of Westminster Abbey that housed state regalia. The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey. Arches topped with a monde and cross were added to images of StEdward's Crown by the time of HenryIV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor HenryV. Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one <b>but</b> <b>God,</b> unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E

25|$|When {{he came to}} a {{cave and}} lodged there, God asked him what he was doing there. Elijah said that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told Elijah to stand on the mount, and God passed by. A great wind rent the mountains, and broke the rocks in pieces, <b>but</b> <b>God</b> was not in the wind. Then an {{earthquake}} came, <b>but</b> <b>God</b> was not in the earthquake. Then a fire came, <b>but</b> <b>God</b> was not in the fire. And then came a still small voice, which asked him what he was doing there. Elijah repeated that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told him to go to Damascus and anoint Hazael to be king over Aram, to anoint Jehu to be king over Israel, and to anoint Elisha to succeed Elijah as prophet. God foretold that any who escaped the sword of Hazael would be killed by Jehu; any who escaped the sword of Jehu would be killed by Elisha; and God would leave alive in Israel only the 7 thousand who had not bowed to Baal. So Elijah found Elisha, who was plowing with one of his 12 yoke of oxen, and Elijah cast his mantle on Elisha. Elisha left the oxen, asked Elijah for permission to kiss his parents goodbye, killed the oxen and distributed their meat to the people, and went to follow Elijah.|$|E
25|$|Judgment on wicked Zion (3:1–4): Israel's rulers {{are accused}} of gaining more wealth {{at the expense of}} the poor, by any means.

25|$|Later, Sarah {{gave birth}} to Isaac, and {{the tension between the}} women returned. At a celebration after Isaac was weaned, Sarah found the teenage Ishmael mocking her son.

25|$|Because the Israelites saw no shape when God {{spoke to}} {{them out of the}} fire at Horeb, Moses warned them not to make for {{themselves}} a sculptured image in any likeness whatever — the form of a man, woman, beast, bird, creeping thing, or fish. And when they looked up and saw the sun, moon, stars, and heaven, they were not to be lured into bowing down to them or serving them, for God allotted those things to other peoples, <b>but</b> <b>God</b> took the Israelites and brought them out of Egypt to be God's very own people.|$|E
25|$|The Book records {{a series}} of visions {{received}} by the 6th-century BC prophet Ezekiel, a priest of Solomon's Temple, who was among the captive during the Babylonian exile. The exile, he tells his fellow captives, is God's punishment on Israel for turning away, <b>but</b> <b>God</b> will restore his people to Jerusalem when they return to him. After this message of reassurance, chapters , the Gog oracle, tell how Gog of Magog and his hordes will threaten the restored Israel but will be destroyed, after which God will establish a new Temple and dwell with his people {{for a period of}} lasting peace (chapters 40–48). The Gog oracle, as internal evidence indicates, was composed substantially later than the chapters around it.|$|E
