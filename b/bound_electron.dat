5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a <b>bound</b> <b>electron</b> is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
5|$|If a <b>bound</b> <b>electron</b> is in {{an excited}} state, an {{interacting}} photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching {{the energy of the}} interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a <b>bound</b> <b>electron</b> transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E

25|$|When Z = 1/α (Z ≈ 137), {{the motion}} becomes highly relativistic, and Z2 cancels the α2 in R; the orbit energy begins to be {{comparable}} to rest energy. Sufficiently large nuclei, {{if they were}} stable, would reduce their charge by creating a <b>bound</b> <b>electron</b> from the vacuum, ejecting the positron to infinity. This is the theoretical phenomenon of electromagnetic charge screening which predicts a maximum nuclear charge. Emission of such positrons has been observed in the collisions of heavy ions to create temporary super-heavy nuclei.|$|E
500|$|The {{potential}} energy of an electron in an atom is negative, its dependence of its position reaches the minimum (the most absolute value) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when {{the distance from}} the nucleus goes to infinity, roughly in an inverse proportion to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a <b>bound</b> <b>electron</b> can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level; see time-independent Schrödinger equation for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of electronvolts (eV). The lowest energy state of a <b>bound</b> <b>electron</b> is called the ground state, i.e. stationary state, while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state. The electron's energy raises when n increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on [...] is caused not by electrostatic potential of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.|$|E
2500|$|In that lecture, Rutherford conjectured the {{existence}} of new particles. [...] The alpha particle {{was known to be}} very stable, and it was assumed to retain its identity within the nucleus. [...] The alpha particle was presumed to consist of four protons and two closely bound electrons to give it +2 charge. [...] In a 1919 paper, Rutherford had reported the apparent discovery of a new doubly charged particle of mass 3, denoted the X++, interpreted to consist of three protons and a closely <b>bound</b> <b>electron.</b> [...] This result suggested to Rutherford the likely existence of two new particles, one of two protons with a closely <b>bound</b> <b>electron,</b> and another of one proton and a closely <b>bound</b> <b>electron.</b> [...] The X++ particle was later determined to have mass 4 and to be just a low-energy alpha particle. Nevertheless, Rutherford had conjectured {{the existence}} of the neutron, a neutral particle of mass 1, and the deuteron, a +1 charge particle of mass 2. [...] The latter is the nucleus of deuterium, discovered in 1931 by Harold Urey. The mass of the hypothetical neutral particle would be little {{different from that of the}} proton. Rutherford determined that such a zero-charge particle would be difficult to detect by available techniques.|$|E

5000|$|Electronic {{stopping}} {{refers to}} the slowing down of a projectile ion due to the inelastic collisions between <b>bound</b> <b>electrons</b> in the medium and the ion moving through it. The term inelastic is used to signify that energy is lost during the process (the collisions may result both in excitations of <b>bound</b> <b>electrons</b> of the medium, and in excitations of the electron cloud of the ion as well). Linear electronic stopping power is identical to unrestricted linear energy transfer.|$|R
2500|$|Only orbits {{that begin}} and end at the nucleus are {{important}} in closed-orbit theory. Physically, these {{are associated with the}} outgoing waves that are generated when a tightly <b>bound</b> <b>electron</b> is excited to a high-lying state.

The probability of the {{photoelectric effect}} occurring {{is measured by the}} cross section of interaction, σ.

40|$|A {{scheme for}} {{analyzing}} Thomson scattering of x-rays by warm dense matter, {{based on the}} average-atom model, is developed. Emphasis is given to x-ray scattering by <b>bound</b> <b>electrons.</b> Contributions to the scattered x-ray spectrum from elastic scattering by electrons moving with the ions and from inelastic scattering by free and <b>bound</b> <b>electrons</b> are evaluated using parameters (chemical potential, average ionic charge, free <b>electron</b> density, <b>bound</b> and continuum wave functions, and occupation numbers) taken from the average-atom model.
