40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine relationships between climate and vegetation of the Pacific rim of North America, from the Mediterranean deserts of California to Alaska’s boreal taiga. Relations were inferred from temperature and rainfall data recorded at 457 weather stations and by sampling the vegetation around these stations. Climate data were used to construct climatograms, calculate forty one variables and detect main latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. In order to identify the best functions able to relate our variables, polynomial and non-polynomial regressions were performed. The k-means algorithm was the clustering method used to validate the variables that could best support our bioclimatic classification. The variable that best fitted our classification was finally used to prepare a discriminatory key for <b>bioclimates.</b> Across this extensive area three macrobioclimates were identified, Mediterranean, Temperate and Bo- real, within which we were able to distinguish nine <b>bioclimates.</b> Finally, we relate the different types of potential natural vegetation to each of these <b>bioclimates</b> and describe their floristic composition and physiognomy...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} woody plant colonization of abandoned pastures on soil and litter organic carbon (C) stocks and nitrogen (N) content along a bioclimatic transect in a semi-arid environment (Sicily, Italy). Soil samples were taken in three successional stages (grazed pasture, shrubland, forest) within each of three <b>bioclimates</b> (supramediterranean - “supra”, mesomediterranean - “meso”, thermomediterranean - “thermo”). Organic C and N in litter and soil (0 - 10 cm and 10 - 30 cm depth) were determined, as well as soil bulk density. Especially at 0 - 10 cm depth, changes in C and N contents along successional stages differed among <b>bioclimates.</b> Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock decreased from pasture to shrubland and increased from shrubland to forest in “supra”, increased from pasture to shrubland and then remained stable in “thermo”, and was stable in “meso”.

40|$|Background: Many fungal species occur {{across a}} variety of habitats. Particularly lichens, fungi forming symbioses with {{photosynthetic}} partners, have evolved remarkable tolerances for environmental extremes. Despite their ecological importance and ubiquity, {{little is known about the}} genetic basis of adaption in lichen populations.

We resequenced six populations as pools and identified highly differentiated genomic regions. We then detected gene-environment correlations while controlling for shared population history and pooled sequencing bias, and performed ecophysiological experiments to assess fitness differences of individuals from different environments. Results: We detected two strongly differentiated genetic clusters linked to Mediterranean and temperate-oceanic climate, and an admixture zone, which coincided with the transition between the two <b>bioclimates.</b> High altitude individuals showed ecophysiological adaptations to wetter and more shaded conditions. Highly differentiated genome regions contained a number of genes associated with stress response, local environmental adaptation, and sexual reproduction.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effect of climate change on arctic vegetation, we need to understand how temperature has influenced existing vegetation distribution. The Arctic Tundra <b>Bioclimate</b> Zone was divided into five different <b>bioclimate</b> subzones as part of the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM), in an effort to delineate areas with similar vegetation. However, temperature data are sparse in the Arctic, so these subzones were generalized, based on widely scattered ground climate station data and interpreted from available information about plant distribution in the Arctic, an admittedly somewhat circular process. In this study, an independent source of temperature data, surface temperatures derived from AVHRR satellite data, was compared with the CAVM <b>bioclimate</b> subzones. AVHRR surface kinetic temperature data were summarized into monthly means by NASA (Comiso 2003). Summer temperatures for the earliest ten years of the satellite record (1982 - 1992) were used to calculate mean summer warmth index (SWI).

40|$|Mediterranean {{temporary}} ponds (MTPs) {{are very}} specialised and threatened habitats found in Mediterranean-like <b>bioclimates</b> worldwide. MTPs have received considerable attention {{over the past}} years because of the multiple ecological roles they play in the landscape. Nevertheless, seed germination, dormancy, and desiccation tolerance of species living in MTPs are poorly investigated. Here, we reviewed these topics and found that seed germination data exist for only 48 species. While dormancy differs among the species, germination mostly depends on cool temperatures (< 15 °C) which are associated with the main rainfall season and on the light triggering germination in seeds located close to the soil surface and resulting in the persistence of buried seeds until disturbances occur. Most species seem amenable to seed banking as a means of ex situ conservation but a worldwide comparative study is required to better understand seed lifespan in MTPs. In general, these species exhibit a Mediterranean germination syndrome and plastic germination response that is typical of neither truly aquatic nor wetland plants. The importance of conducting ecologically meaningful germination studies, including germination experiments conducted in the field has been highlighted to gain further insights into the dynamic processes in the vegetation and to test for convergent evolution...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new ordination method to compare several communities containing species that differ {{according to their}} taxonomic, morphological or biological features. The objective is first to find dissimilarities among communities from the knowledge about differences among their species, and second to describe these dissimilarities {{with regard to the}} feature diversity within communities. In 1986, Rao initiated a general framework for analysing the extent of the diversity. He defined a diversity coefficient called quadratic entropy and a dissimilarity coefficient and proposed a decomposition of this diversity coefficient in a way similar to ANOVA. Furthermore, Gower and Legendre (1986) built a weighted principal coordinate analysis. Using the previous context, we propose a new method called the double principal coordinate analysis (DPCoA) to analyse the relation between two kinds of data. The first contains differences among species (dissimilarity matrix); the second the species distribution among communities (abundance or presence/absence matrix). A multidimensional space assembling the species points and the community points is built. The species points define the original differences between species and the community points define the deduced differences between communities. Furthermore, this multidimensional space is linked with the diversity decomposition into between-community and within-community diversities. One looks for axes that provide a graphical ordination of the communities and project the species onto them. An illustration is proposed comparing bird communities which live in different areas under mediterranean <b>bioclimates.</b> Compared to some existing methods, the double principal coordinate analysis can provide a typology of communities takin...|$|R

I use a narrative synthesis approach and multiple examples from the literature on pine species from the Mediterranean Basin and California.

Factors such as ancestral adaptation to wildfire, reduction of effective population size during the Last Glacial Maximum, long distance dispersal during the Holocene, and more recent adaptation to patchy environmental conditions could explain these patterns. Because of contrasted ecological, demographic, historical, and geographical processes, and despite their common biological attributes, pines of the Mediterranean Basin display complex biogeographic patterns at neutral gene level that can help retrace their evolutionary history. Although individual species often represent unique case studies that make generalizations risky, locating habitats of significantly high and low genetic diversity is key for detecting and understanding the major factors affecting gene diversity and may prove useful for profiling areas of high conservation value in the Mediterranean...|$|R
