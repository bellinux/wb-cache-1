As an example, the share of group members with direct and indirect links to the packaging industry is relatively high, and these people may have a personal interest in bringing up and stressing the benefits of packaging but neglecting the negative aspects of packaging. “Green” people with {{a different set of}} values and attitudes related to packaging have not been directly represented in the focus groups, and the outcome may have been different if they had been involved.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} voting {{behavior}} of a small committee that has to approve or reject a proposal whose return is uncertain. Members have heterogenous preferences: some members want to maximize the expected value while other <b>members</b> have a <b>bias</b> toward project approval and ignore their private information. We analyze different voting games when information is costless and communication is not possible, and we provide insights on the optimal composition of these committees. Our main {{result is that the}} presence of <b>biased</b> <b>members</b> can improve the voting outcome by simplifying the strategies of unbiased members. Thus, committees with heterogeneous members can function at least as well as homogeneous committees and in some cases they perform better.

40|$|This paper studies a {{committee}} decision-making problem. Committee members are heterogeneous in their competence, they are biased towards {{one of the}} alternatives and career oriented, and they can choose whether to vote or abstain. The interaction between career concern and bias a¤ects the voting behavior of members depending on transparency of individual votes. We show that transparency attenuates the pre-existing <b>biases</b> of competent <b>members</b> and exacerbates the <b>biases</b> of incompetent <b>members.</b> Public voting leads to better decisions when {{the magnitude of the}} bias is large, while secret voting performs better otherwise. We provide experimental evidence supporting our theoretical conclusions. Committees, Voting, Career Concern, Transparenc...|$|R

50|$|Like {{most other}} sociologists of {{religion}} of his day, Berger once predicted the all-encompassing secularization of the world. He has admitted {{to his own}} miscalculations about secularization, concluding {{that the existence of}} resurgent religiosity in the modernised world has proven otherwise. In The Desecularization of the World, he cites both Western academia and Western Europe itself as exceptions to the triumphant desecularization hypothesis: that these cultures have remained highly secularized despite the resurgence of religion {{in the rest of the}} world. Berger finds that his and most sociologists' misconsensus about secularisation may have been the result of their own <b>bias</b> as <b>members</b> of academia, which is a largely atheist concentration of people.|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for latching an object, {{such as a}} payload for a space vehicle, {{includes an}} expandible latch which is shifted between a relaxed open condition and a flexed closed condition by actuation {{of a pair of}} temperature-responsive members, such as shaped memory alloy (SMA) coil springs. One of the two temperature-responsive <b>members</b> <b>biases</b> an actuator into a first position that allows the expandible latch to open. The other SMA <b>member</b> <b>biases</b> the actuator in the opposite position to close the expandible latch. Heating the appropriate SMA member causes the actuator to move from one position to the other position. In the preferred embodiment, no power is required to maintain the actuator in either position once the position has been established. For example, the actuator may have a rest position that allows the expandible latch to remain open when the two SMA members are cooled and allowed to reach an equilibrium condition with respect to applied force to the actuator. A detent-and-ball arrangement may be used to maintain the position of the actuator after the expandible latch has been closed...|$|R

In this case, the absence of DIF {{is determined by the}} fact that the conditional probability distribution of Y is not dependent on group membership. To illustrate, consider an item with response options 0 and 1, where Y = 0 indicates an incorrect response, and Y = 1 indicates a correct response. The probability of correctly responding to an item is the same for members of either group. This indicates that there is no DIF or item <b>bias</b> because <b>members</b> of the reference and focal group with the same underlying ability or attribute have the same probability of responding correctly. Therefore, there is no bias or disadvantage for one group over the other.|$|R
