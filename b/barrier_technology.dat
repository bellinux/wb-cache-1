50|$|Above slab air {{pressure}} differential <b>barrier</b> <b>technology</b> (ASAPDB) {{requires that the}} interior pressure envelope, most often drywall, {{as well as all}} ductwork for air conditioning systems, be made as airtight as possible. A small blower, often no more than 15 cubic feet per minute (0.7 l/s) may then extract the radon-laden air from these cavities and exhaust it to the out of doors. With well-sealed HVAC ducts, very small negative pressures, perhaps as little as 0.5 pascal (0.00007 psi), will prevent the entry of highly radon-laden wall cavity air from entering into the breathing zone. Such ASAPDB technology is often the best radon mitigation choice for high-rise condominiums as it does not increase indoor humidity loads in hot humid climates, and it can also work well to prevent mold growth in exterior walls in heating climates.|$|E

40|$|The {{infestation}} of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by ectoparasitic {{sea lice}} (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) presents {{a need for}} new approaches to parasite control. One option {{is the use of}} ‘snorkel’ sea lice <b>barrier</b> <b>technology,</b> which restricts salmon from accessing the surface except via a vertical chamber impermeable to sea lice larvae. This prevents the salmon from swimming at the depths where infective sea lice are most abundant. Before snorkels can be implemented in commercial sea-cages, knowledge is required about their effects on salmon welfare and growth. Here, we installed snorkels of 4 m depth into three 12 × 12 × 12 m 3 cages, and recorded the lice infestation of stocked fish along with their growth, behaviour, and snout and fin condition over a 12 -week period. Three standard sea-cages were utilised for comparison, and all six cages were stocked with ~ 3500 salmon (2. 3 ± 0. 6 kg). After 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks, fish in snorkel cages had 65, 24, 43, and 56 % lower lice levels than in standard cages, respectively. Salmon in both snorkel and standard cages grew similarly well and we detected little or no adverse effects on fish mortality or welfare. The results indicate that snorkel sea-cage <b>barrier</b> <b>technology</b> provides a promising new tool in parasite management in salmon aquaculture...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work presented in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} propagation of acoustic waves through phononic crystal systems and their ability to attenuate sound in the low frequency regime. The plane wave expansion method and finite element method are utilised to investigate the properties of conventional phononic crystal systems. The acoustic band structure and transmission measurements of such systems are computed and verified experimentally. Good agreement between band gap locations for the investigative methods detailed is found. The well known link between the frequency range a phononic crystal can attenuate sound over and its lattice parameter is confirmed. This leads to a reduction in its usefulness as a viable noise <b>barrier</b> <b>technology,</b> due to the necessary increase in overall crystal size. To overcome this restriction the concept of an acoustically resonant phononic crystal system is proposed, which utilises acoustic resonances, similar to Helmholtz resonance, to form additional band gaps that are decoupled from the lattice periodicity of the phononic crystal system. An acoustically resonant phononic crystal system is constructed and experimental transmission measurements carried out to verify the existence of separate attenuation mechanisms. Experimental attenuation levels achieved by Bragg formation and resonance reach 25 dB. The two separate attenuation mechanisms present in the acoustically resonant phononic crystal, increase the efficiency of its performance in the low frequency regime, whilst maintaining a reduced crystal size for viable noise <b>barrier</b> <b>technology.</b> Methods to optimise acoustically resonant phononic crystal systems and to increase their performance in the lower frequency regime are discussed, namely by introducing the Matryoshka acoustically resonant phononic crystal system, where each scattering unit is composed of multiple concentric C-shape inclusions...|$|E

Although thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>technology</b> is over thirty years old, the principle failure mechanism is the spallation of the ceramic coating at or near the ceramic/bond coat interface.
