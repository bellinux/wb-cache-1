40|$|The Embedded Information Systems Research Group (EISRG) {{being part}} of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (Budapest, Hungary) {{launched}} the development of a modularized electronic device which will help their students to be introduced in the area of embedded information systems design and application within the frameworks of the Embedded Information Systems Engineering (EISE) major. The device is formed by several modules with many different functions: microprocessor module, radio communication module, accoustical module, Ethernet interface module etc. Within this project, the demand for a motorized mobile rolling subsystem appeared. This would serve to transport the modularized device. For this purpose, not only the transporting mechanics and the motor control hardware has to be worked out but a motor control software has to be implemented as well. During this semester this subsystem has been developed by the author. The developed subsystem consists of two driving motors, a mechanical structure carrying the motors and the electronics, two separated electrical supply system (<b>battery</b> <b>and</b> <b>accumulator</b> holders) for the motors and the modularized electronics, two optical detector modules for motor revolution speed sensing, an 8 -bit Atmel AVR microcontroller -based motor control module and a positioner servo motor with limited rotation and integrated closed-loop position control electronics. The closed loop control algorithm of the driving motors is executed by the microcontroller of the motor control module. The main functions of the subsystem are tested by some special test software implemented by the author. With slight modifications, these software components together will constitute the final control software with a cascade closed-loop control algorithm. Current document aims to present in details the steps of {{the development and implementation of}} the above subsystem, therefore, to certify the suitability of the subsystem for the objectives announced by EISRG and to proove the competency of the author in embedded electronic system engineering.

40|$|During {{past years}} a great {{attention}} is paid to the problem of hazardous waste management, because “prevention costs” of the activities concerned with hazardous waste are lower than “restoration costs” after damage is done. A proper management strategy for hazardous waste {{is one of the key}} components for a sustainable development of society. Existing studies on the management strategies for hazardous waste sector have a static perspective; therefore the objective of the study is to consider the dynamic and interdependent relationships within the waste management system. The paper proposes a model that can be used for thesimulations of various decisions making processes and their effects on the sector of hazardous waste. The model is constructed using the system dynamics methodology, which presents an approach for dealing with interrelationships and dynamics in respect to social, economic and environmental aspects. Within a system dynamic model three modules were elaborated: input, simulation and output module. The major variables that affect the sector are integrated in the dynamic model. Causal loop diagrams and a stock-flow diagram are presented within the research. The case study is used for the validation of the dynamic model. The sector of batteries and accumulations have been chosen as the target for case study, because the amount of waste in this sector have grown by 41. 2 % from the period of 2004 – 2010 and reached 1610000 tonnes in 2010 within the European Union 27 member states. At the same time the Directive 2008 / 103 /EC on <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> <b>accumulators</b> and on waste <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> <b>accumulators</b> forces to implement a better environmental performance within the sector.

Thus in this paper the dynamic model for the management system of waste B&A has been studied. The model is applied for the case study of Latvia. The developed SD model allows the investigation of complex relations and simulation of effects from various policies within the management system of waste B&A, because the model incorporates non-linearities, feedbacks and delays. The results of sensitivity analysis show that the changes in the collection ratio and import rate have both high {{and at the same time}} in the opposite direction aimed influence on the amount of landfilled B&A. This paper shows that the introduction of innovation diffusion model for the sector of waste <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> <b>accumulators</b> can decrease environmental pollution by up to 30. 7 %.

40|$|Cadmium is an oligoelement {{which is}} not {{essential}} for biological systems but is toxic to most organisms. It is widely distributed in the environment at relatively low concentrations (Dunnick et al. 1988). It is {{not found in the}} free state but accompanies Zn in the majority of its minerals. It is used almost exclusively to form alloys, metal for ball bearings, for soldering, in <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> electric <b>accumulators</b> <b>and</b> as an anticorrosive. Its resi-dues have contaminated the environment and its presence in sedimentation sludges used to manufacture fertilizers has given rise to an increase in the content of this metal in trophic chains. The inhalation of industrial powders and smoke represents the principal form of occupational exposure. For the general population the major route of exposure is food, because vegetables absorb it from contaminated soil and water. Tobacco is an even more important source, as absorption of inhaled particles ranges from 10 to 60 %, depending on their size and solubility (Nordberg et al. 1985). The literature indicates great variability in the concentrations of this element in foods in different countries, but in general the concentration ranges between 0. 005 - 0. 1 mg/kg wet weight (Friberg et al. 1986). The lowest concentrations in foods are found in milk and dairy products (a few ~g/Kg), followed by meat, fish and fruit, (1 - 50 ~g/Kg), vegetables and cereals (0. 01 - 0. 15 mg/Kg). Liver and kidney of some animals and molluscs can contain higher concentrations (Bermejo et al. 1981; Lopez-Artiguez et al. 1989).

40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of the}} {{conducted}} {{studies was}} to determine the possibility of selective separation and precipitation of metal ions from polimetalic solution containing nickel(II), cobalt(II), cadmium(II) and zinc(II) cations using polymer inclusive membranes. 1 -decylimidazole was used in membrane as a carrier of ions. The influence of chloride anions concentration on the process has also been investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Polymer inclusive membranes (PIM) containing cellulose acetate as a matrix, orto-nitrophenyl octyl ether (ONPOE) as a plasticizer and 1 -decylimidazole as a carrier were used in investigations. The membrane processes were carried out in a membrane module for 24 hours. Findings: The results obtained point out a significant influence of chloride anions concentration on separation process of certain metal ions. It was observed that zinc(II) ions are isolated most effectively from the solution containing 2 M of chloride anions. About 88 % of Zn(II), 5. 5 % of Co(II), 6. 5 % of Cd(II) and below 1 % of Ni(II) were separated from such a solution. Research limitations/implications: The obtained results show that it is possibility of the selective extraction of heavy metal ions from polymetallic chloride solutions in membrane processes. The aqueous solution containing 2 M of chloride ions was used in the investigation. Practical implications: The results show that Zn(II) can be effectively recovered from solutions containing Co(II), Cd(II) and Ni(II). This process would allow the utilization of waste solutions containing the heavy metal ions.

40|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{different}} chemicals used in common articles. Many hazardous substances are being spread to the environment besides from the use of articles, also from their production and disposal. Management of chemicals in articles is included in EU legislation concerning product safety, waste management, product design and chemicals. There are also other instruments for the management of chemicals in articles, e. g. environmental labelling, international co-operation, industry initiatives, work of the non-governmental organizations as well as national programmes and registers. According to the recommendations of the National Programme on Dangerous Chemicals, more information is needed about chemicals in articles. The aim of this preliminary report is to review how hazards and risks from chemicals in articles could be controlled, through out the life cycles of the articles. This report describes the current legislative situation and voluntary management measures, as well as their possible need for further development. Articles are regarded as e. g. textiles, toys, electrical and electronic equipment, <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> <b>accumulators</b> as well as packaging. Cosmetics are also included in this report, because they present possible significant source of chemical releases to the environment. On the basis of this preliminary report, the legislation concerning chemicals in articles is very scattered, targeted to certain product groups and substances. EU’s new chemicals regulation, REACH, is the most comprehensive legislation on chemicals in articles, because it is applied to all chemicals. There is a general lack of information on the content of chemicals in articles as well as the environmental effects and risks of those chemicals. The lack of labelling requirement is affecting to the consumers’, manufacturers’ and importers’ level of knowledge about chemicals in articles. The surveillance by the authorities is based on notifications of dangerous articles and spot checks. These however only reveal a small proportion of articles on the market containing hazardous chemicals. The management of chemicals in articles could be enhanced e. g. by adding more restricted chemicals or product groups to individual legislation, by including more environmental aspects in product safety legislation or by adding more restrictions concerning chemicals in articles to the REACH Regulation. In order to supervise the compliance with chemicals legislation, more resources are needed, especially on imported articles coming outside EU. The new Waste Framework Directive and the reform of national waste legislation will enhance the control of chemicals in articles, but the collection, recycling and re-use should be further developed. Information on chemicals in articles could be increased by e. g. developing information systems covering the whole supply chain.
