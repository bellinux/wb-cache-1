25|$|Euler {{made the}} first conjectures about <b>biquadratic</b> reciprocity. Gauss {{published}} two monographs on <b>biquadratic</b> reciprocity. In the first one (1828) he proved Euler's conjecture about the <b>biquadratic</b> character of 2. In the second one (1832) he stated the <b>biquadratic</b> reciprocity law for the Gaussian integers and proved the supplementary formulas. He said that a third monograph would be forthcoming with the proof of the general theorem, but it never appeared. Jacobi presented proofs in his Königsberg lectures of 1836–37. The first published proofs were by Eisenstein.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{equivalent}} ways of stating Burde's rational <b>biquadratic</b> reciprocity law.|$|E
25|$|Gauss's {{published}} works mention cubic residues and reciprocity three times: {{there is}} one result pertaining to cubic residues in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801). In {{the introduction to the}} fifth and sixth proofs of quadratic reciprocity (1818) {{he said that he was}} publishing these proofs because their techniques (Gauss's lemma and Gaussian sums, respectively) can be applied to cubic and <b>biquadratic</b> reciprocity. Finally, a footnote in the second (of two) monographs on <b>biquadratic</b> reciprocity (1832) states that cubic reciprocity is most easily described in the ring of Eisenstein integers.|$|E
25|$|The Disquisitiones Arithmeticae {{has been}} {{translated}} from Latin into English and German.

25|$|Pratt {{was known}} as an {{accomplished}} mathematician, and had {{a strong interest in}} astronomy. He offered science-based lectures on these topics to early Mormon audiences in Utah, and published two related books. New and Easy Method of Solution of the Cubic and <b>Biquadratic</b> Equations was published in 1866, and Key to the Universe was published in 1879.|$|E
25|$|From {{his diary}} and other {{unpublished}} sources, {{it appears that}} Gauss knew the rules for the cubic and quartic residuacity of integers by 1805, and discovered the full-blown theorems and proofs of cubic and <b>biquadratic</b> reciprocity around 1814. Proofs of these were found in his posthumous papers, {{but it is not}} clear if they are his or Eisenstein's.|$|E
25|$|He {{first used}} the {{pigeonhole}} principle, a basic counting argument, in {{the proof of}} a theorem in diophantine approximation, later named after him Dirichlet's approximation theorem. He published important contributions to Fermat's last theorem, for which he proved the cases n=5 and n=14, and to the <b>biquadratic</b> reciprocity law. The Dirichlet divisor problem, for which he found the first results, is still an unsolved problem in number theory despite later contributions by other researchers.|$|E

Under {{the supervision of}} Paul Gordan she wrote her dissertation, Über die Bildung des Formensystems der ternären biquadratischen Form (On Complete Systems of Invariants for Ternary <b>Biquadratic</b> Forms, 1907). Although it had been well received, Noether later described her thesis as [...] "crap".|$|E

2500|$|The {{first thing}} to notice when working within the ring Z of {{integers}} {{is that if the}} prime number q is [...] 3 (mod 4) then every quadratic residue (mod q) is also a <b>biquadratic</b> residue (mod q).

Thus, if r [...] a2 (mod q) is a quadratic residue, then if a [...] b2 is a residue, r [...] a2 [...] b4 (mod q) is a <b>biquadratic</b> residue, and if a is a nonresidue, a is a residue, a [...] b2, and again, r [...] (a)2 [...] b4 (mod q) [...] is a <b>biquadratic</b> residue.|$|E
