50|$|A <b>box</b> <b>caisson</b> is a {{prefabricated}} concrete box (it has sides and a bottom); {{it is set}} down on prepared bases. Once in place, {{it is filled with}} concrete {{to become part of the}} permanent works, such as the foundation for a bridge pier. Hollow concrete structures are usually less dense than water so a <b>box</b> <b>caisson</b> must be ballasted or anchored to keep it from floating until it can be filled with concrete. Sometimes elaborate anchoring systems may be required, such as in tidal zones. Adjustable anchoring systems combined with a GPS survey enable engineers to position a <b>box</b> <b>caisson</b> with pinpoint accuracy.|$|E
50|$|The {{four main}} types of caisson are <b>box</b> <b>caisson,</b> open caisson, compressed-air caisson and {{monolith}} caisson.|$|E
50|$|An {{open caisson}} {{is similar to}} a <b>box</b> <b>caisson,</b> except that it does not have a bottom face. It is {{suitable}} for use in soft clays (e.g. in some river-beds), but not for where there may be large obstructions in the ground. An open caisson that is used in soft grounds or high water tables, where open trench excavations are impractical, {{can also be used to}} install deep manholes, pump stations and reception/launch pits for micro tunnelling, pipe jacking and other operations.|$|E
40|$|The {{colonization}} of the F/V Calkdonie Toho 2 was studied {{for a period}} of 13 months after the ship was scuttled. A nearby assemblage of US Marine floating bridge <b>boxes</b> (<b>Caissons)</b> sunk during WWII and a natural fringing reef (Ricaudy) were surveyed at the same time. Species richness on the Calkdonie Toho 2 increased to reach 42 species 398 days after scuttling. Fish density increased for 109 days after scuttling to reach a mean of 8. 15 fish/m 2, with exceptional peaks during recruitment phases. Fish biomass increased in two steps to reach an average of 336 g/m 2 193 days after scuttling. The number of common species was higher between the Cale'donie Toho 2 and the Caissons (54 species) than Calkdonie Toho 2 and Ricaudy (20 species). Ricaudy fish assemblages were characterized by species associated with live corals whereas the artificial reefs were characterized by pelagic and opportunist species. Differences occurred between the Calkdonie Toho 2 assemblage, characterized by numerous sciophylous species (Apogonidae), and the Caissons assemblage, characterized by large carnivorous species (Serranidae, Lutjanidae). These difference...|$|R
5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight <b>boxes</b> called <b>caissons</b> were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|R
40|$|This {{building}} is shaped {{in the form}} of a cross, with ten towers, six of which are 70 m high and the other four 45 m high. &# 13; The most outstanding feature is their slender Steel, water-filled columns supporting the floor construction. The columns, in their turn rest on cross beams placed on <b>box</b> trusses (<b>caisson)</b> connecting the towers. &# 13; The towers were built using sliding forms, while the box trusses were built using scaffold forms. &# 13; Infra-red rays were used in different construction stages to achieve the fast curing of the concrete. &# 13; The building contains, among other areas, an electronic data processing facility, a teaching hall, mess hall, lounge, etc. Este edificio tiene forma de una cruz, con diez torres, cuatro de ellas con una altura de 70 m y las otras seis con una altura de 45 m. &# 13; Su rasgo más característico son unas columnas delgadas de acero llenas de agua, sobre las que se apoyan los forjados de las plantas. Estas columnas, a su vez, se apoyan sobre vigas transversales colocadas sobre las vigas-cajón que unen las torres. &# 13; Las torres fueron realizadas mediante encofrados deslizantes, mientras las vigas-cajón lo fueron con cimbras. &# 13; En diversas fases de la construcción se utilizaron rayos ¡infrarrojos para conseguir un endurecimiento rápido del hormigón. &# 13; El edificio consta de una instalación de elaboración electrónica de datos, una sala de enseñanza, comedor, sala de estar, etc...|$|R
