5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{city walls}} have been {{preserved}} {{to the present}} day, {{not only because of}} the knowledge of the skilled construction workers and the constant care provided by city dwellers that maintained and rebuilt the structures as needed, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the brilliantly reputed diplomacy in Ragusa, which managed on many occasions to avoid dangerous measures taken by enemies against the Republic of Ragusa.|$|E
5|$|The group {{retains a}} high profile largely because of their {{outrageous}} costumes, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their frequent work for charitable organizations. The Hogettes have appeared in a national advertising campaign for VISA, and they provide support for many charities, including Children's Miracle Network, Ronald McDonald House, and March of Dimes. They have raised over US$100 million for these and other charitable causes. Despite their philanthropic work, the Hogettes are disliked by some and have even been attacked by fans of opposing teams.|$|E
5000|$|Wells' {{subsequent}} {{career was}} undermined {{both by the}} increasingly unaffordable ethos of the Arts and Crafts movement after 1918, <b>but</b> probably <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his perceived role in {{the failure of the}} Nobles' marriage.|$|R
5000|$|In {{discussions with}} Cambodia's garment sector workers, many {{have noted that}} {{burdensome}} overtime was particularly strenuous, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> necessary <b>because</b> <b>of</b> falling wages. [...] Moreover, workers in the industry have called for the option to choose when to engage in overtime hours, versus required overtime work delegated to them.|$|R
50|$|The {{upmarket}} northern {{suburb of}} Gallo Manor {{has managed to}} retain an almost park like atmosphere, attributable {{in part to the}} lush lawns, established gardens and tree-lined streets, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> much <b>of</b> the suburb is cordoned off as a high security area, so there is little traffic using this quiet suburb of Johannesburg as a thoroughfare.|$|R
5|$|A {{large amount}} of lakes and rivers {{are found in the}} Eurasian Economic Union. Major lakes include Ladoga and Onega, two of the largest lakes in Europe. The largest and most {{prominent}} of the union's bodies of fresh water is Lake Baikal, the world's deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious fresh water lake. The Baikal lake alone contains over one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water. Russia is second only to Brazil in volume of the total renewable water resources. Of the union's numerous rivers, the Volga is the most famous, not only because it is the longest in Europe, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its major role in history. In Siberia the Ob, Yenisey, Lena and Amur are among the longest rivers in the world.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, Friday the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own Friday the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with Friday the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in horror and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{surprisingly}} {{the guns}} were often mounted in open emplacements, known as [...] "en barbette", simply {{protected by a}} parapet. This was not only to lower the outline <b>of</b> the fortress, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> guns <b>of</b> this period were rifled muzzle loaders (RML), still using black powder as their propellant, which generated large amounts of fumes and smoke.|$|R
50|$|Babur's guns proved {{decisive in}} battle, firstly because Ibrahim Lodi lacked any field artillery, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> the sound <b>of</b> the cannon frightened Lodi's elephants, {{causing them to}} trample Lodi's own men.|$|R
5000|$|Judge Henry Hilton (October 4, 1824 - August 24, 1899) was an American jurist and businessman. He became {{best known}} for the {{so-called}} [...] "Hilton-Seligman Affair" [...] in 1877, his refusal to admit financier Joseph Seligman to the Grand Union Hotel in Saratoga Springs, New York, reportedly because Seligman was Jewish, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> possibly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a personal feud.|$|R
5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E
5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, {{not only because}} of the events in the Caribbean, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.|$|E
5|$|Films {{generate}} {{income from}} several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings {{are the primary}} metric for trade publications in assessing {{the success of a}} film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{actinomycosis}} presenting as a chest wall mass in a 35 year-old man. Thoracic actinomycosis poses a diagnostic challenge to clinicians {{not only because it}} is uncommon and often forgotten, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> culture <b>of</b> the causative microbes is technically difficult. The classic microscopic appearance of this Gram-positive bacteria associated with surrounding sulfur granules often forms the basis of diagnosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|By {{counting}} the rings {{formed by the}} stack of smaller, older scutes {{on top of the}} larger, newer ones, it is possible to estimate the age of a turtle, if one knows how many scutes are produced in a year. This method is not very accurate, partly because growth rate is not constant, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> some <b>of</b> the scutes eventually fall away from the shell.|$|R
50|$|Since World War II, {{most states}} have {{invested}} national {{pride in the}} creation and defence of airlines (sometimes called flag carriers or legacy airlines). Air transportation differs from many other forms of commerce, {{not only because it}} has a major international component, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> these airlines were wholly or partly government owned. Thus, as international competition grew, various degrees of protectionism were imposed.|$|R
5|$|New England {{businessmen}} {{also tried}} to establish a market for ice in England during the 1840s. An abortive first attempt to export ice to England had occurred in 1822 under William Leftwich; he had imported ice from Norway, but his cargo had melted before reaching London. Fresh attempts were made by Jacob Hittinger who owned supplies at Fresh Pond, and Eric Landor, with assets at Wenham Lake, in 1842 and 1844 respectively. Of the two, Landor's venture was more successful and he formed the Wenham Lake Ice Company to export to Britain, building an ice depot on the Strand. Wenham ice was marketed as being unusually pure, possessed of special cooling properties, successfully convincing British customers to avoid local British ice, which was condemned as polluted and unhealthy. After some initial success, the venture eventually failed, {{in part because the}} English chose not to adopt chilled drinks {{in the same way as}} North Americans, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the long distances involved in the trade and the consequent costs of ice wastage through melting. Nonetheless, the trade allowed for some refrigerated goods to arrive in England from America along with ice cargos during the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 mule deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Of 21 grizzlies that were radio-collared and had home ranges where the fires happened, only one was {{believed to have been}} lost. Grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than unburned areas the following year, feeding on the proliferation of roots and foliage as well as on ants which thrived due to all the dead wood. Moose had been declining in the northern sections of the park since the 1960s, but the decline became more obvious after the fires. Unlike elk, which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses, moose {{are more likely to be}} browsers, consuming primarily woody food sources, particularly willow and subalpine fir, which were temporarily reduced by the fires. All ungulates experienced a high initial mortality the winter after the fires, but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than the fires themselves. However, moose populations, unlike other ungulates, have not rebounded in subsequent years. Rodents likely experienced the highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the reduction in forest cover, allowing would-be predators less difficulty in spotting them.|$|E
5|$|Neville was {{appointed}} as Chief Forester under King Richard I in 1198. As the official {{in charge of}} the royal forests, he held one of the four great offices of the state: the others were the justiciar, the chancellor, and the treasurer. The forester was responsible for enforcing the forest law– the special law that applied to the royal forests– and presided over the forest justices, who held forest eyres. There was also a special forest exchequer, or forest treasury. In 1198 Neville presided over an Assize of the Forest that was described by the chronicler Roger of Howden as greatly oppressive. The revenues could be considerable; in 1198 the forest eyre brought in £1,980. Neville stated in 1208 that over the previous {{six and a half years}} the amount raised by the various revenues of the forests had been £15,000; in 1212 it had been £4,486. Forest law was resented by the king's subjects, not just for its severity <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the large extent of the kingdom that it encompassed. It covered not just woodlands, but by the end of the 12th century between a quarter and a third of the whole kingdom. This extent enabled the Norman and Angevin kings to use the harsh punishments of forest law to extract large sums of money for their government.|$|E
50|$|On {{his return}} to Nuremberg, Dürer worked {{on a number of}} grand {{projects}} with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a Sacra Conversazione, though neither was completed. This may have been due in part to his declining health, <b>but</b> perhaps <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the proportions of men and horses, and fortification.|$|R
5|$|In 1254 or 1255, Henry III {{received}} an African elephant from Louis IX of France depicted by Matthew Paris in his ‘Chronica Majora’. A wooden structure {{was built to}} house the elephant, 12.2m (40ft) long by 6.1m (20ft) wide. The animal died in 1258, possibly because it was given red wine, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> perhaps <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the cold climate of England.|$|R

25|$|Command {{was finally}} given to Brown, {{including}} Pío White's vote, {{in part for}} his strength of character, (all candidates had the necessary experience), <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his charisma over the commanders and sailors, most of them Irish, British or Scots.|$|E
