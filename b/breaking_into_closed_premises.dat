50|$|The entire robbery {{took two}} and a half hours. Within that time Bobby G and Comfort were able to <b>break</b> <b>into</b> <b>close</b> to one quarter of the 208 lock boxes in the vault. At 6:15, Bobby Comfort {{informed}} the hostages that they were leaving and to not tell the police if they were able to identify anyone or they would be murdered. Before departing Comfort gave a $20 bill to each hotel employee that they had detained, except for the security guards, and they all left at 6:30, just ahead of the hotel's incoming 7:00 a.m. shift.|$|R
50|$|Boarding {{weapons in}} the Age of Sail {{consisted}} of grenades, muskets, pistols, cutlasses, numerous other blades, and the short-barreled shotguns called blunderbusses. Until the 19th century introduction of the percussion cap, sailors preferred to use flintlocks whenever possible, as the lighted match of a matchlock was extremely dangerous to use on board a ship. Spanish and Portuguese sailors, especially officers, were known to use the rapier throughout the 17th and even into the 18th century, but the close-quarter nature of boarding combat rendered these lengthy swords very ineffective. An important multipurpose weapon was the boarding axe, useful for attacking the enemy, but also essential for chopping down doors and bulkheads to <b>break</b> <b>into</b> <b>closed</b> quarters where defenders of a ship could barricade themselves. The heavy blade could also cut grappling lines.|$|R

50|$|Now {{angry and}} awkward, they enter town {{and find a}} diner where the {{attendant}} also seems to see the doll as a person. They find a map of town and <b>break</b> <b>into</b> the <b>closed</b> library where they research the cemetery and inadvertently spend the night when they all fall asleep. They are woken by Miss Katherine, a young, pink-haired librarian who locks them in a break room and makes them call their respective parents and guardians. The doll, however, is missing, and they resolve to break free, find the doll, and complete the quest. Zach finds the doll in a ladies' restroom in the basement near a display of Lukas Kerchner's exotic pottery and learns about Eleanor's father and her mysterious disappearance.|$|R
50|$|Outside the bar, Brady chastises Don for his {{impulsive}} {{behavior with}} the officers. Don wants revenge against Johns, but Brady dismisses {{the idea and}} reminds his partner that they have other plans. They are going to rob the payroll of the Monterey Theatre, though Don has his doubts about the plan. At the Gregor House, Marilyn has changed into her nightgown while her father sleeps in an armchair, probably drunk. She wakes him up to discuss their concern over Don's nocturnal activities. The father states that he can't see his own son as a wrongdoer. But he also expresses guilt over his own failure as a father. In the theatre, Cotton Watts performs in blackface. After his act, which involves comedy, dancing, and orchestra music, the theatre closes for the night. Brady and Don <b>break</b> <b>into</b> the <b>closed</b> theatre and ambush the nightwatchman (Bud Osborne).|$|R
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} [...] "Vaugirard" [...] in 1970, Swaim {{spent most of}} the seventies writing and {{directing}} documentaries and commercials. Unable to <b>break</b> <b>into</b> the <b>closed</b> world of feature films, he founded, along with several other young filmmakers, a film company to produce their own films. During the few years of their existence, they produced over fifty theatrical short films of young debutant filmmakers including 3 short films that Swaim wrote, directed and produced. The three films won numerous international prizes and awards and enable Swaim to write and direct his first feature film, La Nuit de Saint Germain des Pr√©s (1977) starring Michel Galabru, Mort Shuman, {{and for the first time}} on screen, a young talented actor named Daniel Auteuil. The film also marked the re-discovery of a long forgotten French writer, Leo Malet and introduced his character, Nestor Burma, to a new generation of mystery fans.|$|R
5000|$|Shoplifting (also {{known in}} slang as {{boosting}} and [...] ) {{is a popular}} term used for the unnoticed theft of goods from an open retail establishment. Shoplifting typically involves a person concealing a store item on their person, in pockets or under clothes (or in a bag, baby stroller, etc.) and leaving the store without paying for it. With clothing, shoplifters may put on items from the store and leave the store wearing the clothes. The terms [...] "shoplifting" [...] and [...] "shoplifter" [...] are not usually defined in law. The crime of shoplifting generally falls under the legal classification of larceny. Shoplifting is distinct from burglary (theft by <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> a <b>closed</b> store), robbery (stealing by threatening or engaging in violent behavior) or armed robbery (stealing by using a weapon). In the retail industry, the word shrinkage or shrink {{can be used to}} refer to merchandise lost by shoplifting, but the word also includes loss by other means, such as waste and theft by store employees.|$|R
5|$|In 1921, Skagen's Skipper School {{was opened}} to train navigators for both fishing boats and {{merchant}} ships. It {{is now the}} only remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 students from the whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff. In 2012, the school moved <b>into</b> new <b>premises</b> <b>close</b> to the Kattegat. In 1955, the folkschool Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej, initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes. It has been extended several times over the years, most recently when a new wing was added in 2003. The private school Brovandeskolen, a so-called free school, opened in 1977 for parents wishing to offer their children a new pedagogical approach. A primary goal is active cooperation between pupils, teachers and parents.|$|R
5000|$|Crime authors such as Steve Hodel (son of George Hill Hodel) and William Rasmussen have {{suggested}} {{a link between}} the Short murder and the 1946 murder and dismemberment of six-year-old Suzanne Degnan in Chicago, Illinois. Captain Donahoe of the LAPD stated publicly that he believed the Black Dahlia and the Lipstick Murders were [...] "likely connected." [...] Among the evidence cited is the fact that Short's body was found on Norton Avenue, three blocks west of Degnan Boulevard, Degnan being the last name of the girl from Chicago. There were also striking similarities between the handwriting on the Degnan ransom note and that of [...] "the Black Dahlia Avenger." [...] Both texts used a combination of capitals and small letters (the Degnan note read in part [...] "BuRN This FoR heR SAfTY" [...] sic), and both notes contain a similar misshapen letter P and have one word that matches exactly. Convicted serial killer William Heirens served life in prison for Degnan's murder. Initially arrested at 17 for <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> a residence <b>close</b> to that of Degnan, Heirens claimed he was tortured by police, forced to confess, and made a scapegoat for Degnan's murder.|$|R
40|$|Active {{control of}} a lifted flame is {{investigated}} using a coaxial nozzle with magnetic flap actuators arranged on the inner periphery of the annular nozzle. Near-field vortical structures of the methane/air coaxial jet are manipulated by introducing disturbances directly to the initial shear layer. Through the manipulation, we can improve flame stability and flexibly control the liftoff height. It is found that the large-scale vortical structures play a dominant role in the flame stabilization, and its spatio-temporal evolution is examined {{with the aid of}} PIV and LIF to elucidate the control mechanism. By introducing flap motion driven with a saw-wave signal, we can force the outer shear layer to roll up into strong vortices in synchronization with the flaps. When the flapping Strouhal number is unity, the lifted flame is anchored at x/Do ~ 1. 5. The strong vortices induced by the flaps produce a blob of flammable mixture, which has velocity smaller than the flame speed. The possible stabilization mechanism is that the time period of the premixture supply is balanced with the consumption time of the premixture at the flame base. On the other hand, when the jet is manipulated by a square-wave signal, the lifted flame is located stably at x/Do ~ 4, which is downstream of the inner potential core. It is found that vortical structures in the shear layers <b>break</b> <b>into</b> turbulence <b>close</b> to the nozzle exit. The possible mechanism of the flame stabilization is that the flame propagating upstream is undisturbed due to the absence of intermittent passage of large-scale vortices.
