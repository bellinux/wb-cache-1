40|$|Using {{detailed}} kinetic {{models in}} {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulations is extremely challenging {{because of the large}} number of species that need to be considered and the stiffness of the associated set of differential equations. The high computational cost associated with using a detail-ea kinetic network in CFD simulations is why one-dimensional simulations are still used, although this leads to substantial differences compared to reference three-dimensional simulations. Therefore, a methodology was developed that,allows one to use, detailed single-event microkinetic Models in CFD simulations by on the fly application of the pseudo-steady-state assumption to the radical reaction intermediates. Depending on the reaction model size, a speed-up factor of More than 50 was obtained compared to the standard ANSYS Fluent routines without losing accuracy. As proof of concept, propane steam cracking in a conventional <b>bare</b> <b>reactor</b> and a helicoidally finned reactor was simulated using a reaction model containing 85 species: 41 radicals and 44 transported species. Next to a drastic speedup of the simulations due to the kinetic network reduction technique, significant differences were observed between the bare and the finned reactor in the three-dimensional simulations. In particular, the ethene selectivity is reduced by 0. 20 % by application of the helicoidally finned reactor. The one-dimensional simulations were not able to correctly predict the selectivity effect of the different reactor geometry...|$|E

It is normal then to study individually every aftertreatment technology {{in order to create}} simulation models for these technologies such as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) or Diesel Particle Filter (DPF). For helping the creation of these models, dedicated experiments are carried out. These kinetic experiments must be designed and well-defined such that they provide the necessary information in a reproducible way at minimal time and costs. In {{the first part of the}} work and in order to facilitate measurements with long SDPF specimens, a reactor with a new oven design has been characterized. Its thermal behaviour and the absence of unwanted reactions of the <b>bare</b> <b>reactor</b> (without catalyst) have been checked.

The alternative of the NO 2 /NOx ratio step concept was used for the NOx conversion study of the SCR catalyst. It has been seen that the presence during the experiment of different HC species such as C 3 H 6 and C 2 H 2 had an negative effect in the NOx reduction, and for other HC species as C 3 H 8 the effect was practically inexistent.

Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Operations Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 271 under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 271 consists of 15 Corrective Action Sites (CASs) including: thirteen Septic Systems (25 - 04 - 01, 25 - 04 - 03, 25 - 04 - 04, 25 - 04 - 08, 25 - 04 - 09, 25 - 04 - 10, 25 - 04 - 11, 26 - 04 - 01, 26 - 04 - 02, 26 - 05 - 03, 26 - 05 - 04, 26 - 05 - 05, and 27 - 05 - 02), one Contaminated Water Reservoir (26 - 03 - 01), and one Radioactive Leachfield (26 - 05 - 01). The CASs addressed by CAU 271 are located at Guard Station 500, the Reactor Control Point (RCP), <b>Bare</b> <b>Reactor</b> Experiment - Nevada Tower, and Engine Test State- 1 (ETS- 1) facilities in Area 25; the Port Gaston and Project Pluto facilities in Area 26; and the Baker Site in Area 27 of the Nevada Test Site. Between 1 958 and 1973, the RCP and ETS- 1 facilities supported the development and testing of nuclear reactors for space propulsion {{as part of the}} Nuclear Rocket Development Station. The Project Pluto facilities supported nuclear reactor testing for use as a ramjet propulsion system between 1961 and 1964, followed by similar use for other projects through the early 1980 s. The Baker Site facilities were constructed in the 1960 s to serve as the staging point where the manufactured components of nuclear devices were assembled, disassembled, and modified. The scope of the investigation strategy at these sites will involve biased and random soil sampling in leachfields using excavation (with drilling as a contingency), collection of soil samples underlying the base of proximal and distal ends of septic tanks and distal ends of distribution structures, defining the lateral and vertical extent of contamination through discrete field and possible stepout location sampling, collection system line inspection, and geotechnical/ hydrological laboratory analyses. Based on site history and existing characterization data gathered to support the Data Quality Objectives process, it is believed that the contaminants of potential concern at these CASs may include: volatile organic compounds, fecal coliform bacteria, semivolatile organic compounds, petroleum hydrocarbons, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, gamma-emitting radionuclides, isotopic uranium, strontium- 90, tritium, beryllium, polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, and herbicides.

40|$|Future human {{exploration}} {{of the solar system}} is likely to include establishing permanent outposts {{on the surface of the}} Moon. These outposts will require reliable sources of electrical power in the range of 10 's to 100 's of kWe to support exploration and resource utilization activities. This need is best met using nuclear reactor power systems which can operate steadily throughout the long ~ 27. 3 day lunar rotational period, irrespective of location. Nuclear power systems can potentially open up the entire lunar surface for future exploration and development. Desirable features of nuclear power systems for the lunar surface include passive operation, the avoidance of single point failures in reactor cooling and the integrated power system, moderate operating temperatures to enable the use of conventional materials with proven irradiation experience, utilization of the lunar regolith for radiation shielding and as a supplemental neutron reflector, and safe post-operation decay heat removal and storage for potential retrieval. In addition, it is desirable for the reactor to have a long operational life. Only a limited number of space nuclear reactor concepts have previously been developed for the lunar environment, and these designs possess only a few of these desirable design and operation features. The objective of this research is therefore to perform design and analyses of long operational life lunar reactors and power systems which incorporate the desirable features listed above. A long reactor operational life could be achieved either by increasing the amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel in the core or by improving the neutron economy in the reactor through reducing neutron leakage and parasitic absorption. The amount of fuel in surface power reactors is constrained by the launch safety requirements. These include ensuring that the <b>bare</b> <b>reactor</b> core remains safely subcritical when submerged in water or wet sand and flooded with seawater in the unlikely event of a launch abort accident. Increasing the amount of fuel in the reactor core, and hence its operational life, would be possible by launching the reactor unfueled and fueling it on the Moon. Such a reactor would, thus, not be subject to launch criticality safety requirements. However, loading the reactor with fuel on the Moon presents a challenge, requiring special designs of the core and the fuel elements, which lend themselves to fueling on the lunar surface. This research investigates examples of both a solid core reactor that would be fueled at launch as well as an advanced concept which could be fueled on the Moon. Increasing the operational life of a reactor fueled at launch is exercised for the NaK- 78 cooled Sectored Compact Reactor (SCoRe). A multi-physics design and analyses methodology is developed which iteratively couples together detailed Monte Carlo neutronics simulations with 3 -D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and thermal-hydraulics analyses. Using this methodology the operational life of this compact, fast spectrum reactor is increased by reconfiguring the core geometry to reduce neutron leakage and parasitic absorption, for the same amount of HEU in the core, and meeting launch safety requirements. The multi-physics analyses determine the impacts of the various design changes on the reactor’s neutronics and thermal-hydraulics performance. The option of increasing the operational life of a reactor by loading it on the Moon is exercised for the Pellet Bed Reactor (PeBR). The PeBR uses spherical fuel pellets and is cooled by He-Xe gas, allowing the reactor core to be loaded with fuel pellets and charged with working fluid on the lunar surface. The performed neutronics analyses ensure the PeBR design achieves a long operational life, and develops safe launch canister designs to transport the spherical fuel pellets to the lunar surface. The research also investigates loading the PeBR core with fuel pellets on the Moon using a transient Discrete Element Method (DEM) analysis in lunar gravity. In addition, this research addresses the post-operation storage of the SCoRe and PeBR concepts, below the lunar surface, to determine the time required for the radioactivity in the used fuel to decrease to a low level to allow for its safe recovery. The SCoRe and PeBR concepts are designed to operate at coolant temperatures ≤ 900 K and use conventional stainless steels and superalloys for the structure in the reactor core and power system. They are emplaced below grade on the Moon to take advantage of the regolith as a supplemental neutron reflector and as shielding of the lunar outpost from the reactors’ neutron and gamma radiation. The SCoRe and PeBR concepts are designed with cores divided into six and three sectors, respectively. The sectors are thermally and neutronically coupled but hydraulically decoupled. Each sector is served by a separate cooling loop(s), with independent energy conversion and heat rejection radiator panels. This combination of a sectored core and power system integration with multiple loops avoids single point failures in reactor cooling, energy conversion, and heat rejection. These unique attributes would allow the reactor power system to continue operation, but at lower power, in the event one of the sectors experiences a Loss of Coolant (LOC) or a Loss of Cooling (LOCo). The power system could thus maintain a vital supply of electrical power to the lunar outpost for crew life support. The performed multi-physics design and performance analyses of the SCoRe show that increasing the diameter of the UN fuel rods increases the core excess reactivity. The larger diameter rods, however, increase the NaK- 78 coolant flow bypass near the walls of the core sectors. Scalloping the dividing walls of the core sectors produces a more even flow distribution. The use of 151 Eu spectral neutron poison additive to the UN fuel ensures subcriticality during a water submersion accident, for the compact SCoRe core, with the highest excess reactivity and lowest mass. The redesigned Solid-Core Sectored Compact Reactor (SC-SCoRe) with a monolithic solid core of Oxide Dispersion Strengthened Molybdenum (ODS-Mo) achieves a long operational life of 21 years at a nominal power of 1, 000 kWth. The high thermal conductivity ODS-Mo core structure allows the reactor to continue safe operation in the event that one of the core sectors experiences a LOC of LOCo. The ODS-Mo solid core readily conducts heat generated in that sector to the adjacent core sectors, to be removed by the flowing liquid metal coolant. The SCoRe power system with SiGe energy conversion is fully passive and load following. In addition, the decay heat is removed safely and passively following shutdown of the reactor at end of life. Neutronics and analyses show that the PeBR can achieve a very operational life of 66 years at a nominal thermal power of 471 kWth by fueling the reactor core on the Moon. This full power operational life is beyond what is possible with a reactor fueled at launch like the SC-SCoRe. Neutronics safety analysis of the fuel pellets transport canisters for the PeBR shows that they are made highly subcritical in a water submersion accident. This is achieved using a combination of favorable geometry and neutron absorbers. The DEM fuel loading simulation of the PeBR on the lunar surface demonstrates that the PeBR core sectors can be successfully fueled in lunar gravity. Post-operation storage analyses of the SC-SCoRe and PeBR concepts show that the radioactivity in the fuel decays away to a sufficiently low level within 300 years. The radiation field around the post-operational reactor at that time is low enough to allow humans to safely handle and retrieve the cores, for potential recovery of the valuable quantities of 235 U remaining in the fuel.

The Criticality Safety Group of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) was able to recover and store for possible future use approximately 200 neutron criticality detectors and 20 master alarm panels from the former Rocky Flats Plant in Golden, Colorado when the plant was closed. The Criticality Safety Group participated in a facility analysis and evaluation, the engineering design and review process, as well as the refurbishment, testing, and recalibration of the Rocky Flats criticality alarm system equipment {{to be used in the}} new facility. In order to demonstrate the functionality and survivability of the neutron detectors to the effects of an actual criticality accident, neutron detector testing was performed at the French CEA Valduc SILENE reactor from October 7 to October 19, 2010.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of symmetrical coupled-core systems {{has been extensively}} studied, {{yet there is a}} dearth of research on asymmetrical systems due to the increased complexity of the analysis of such systems. In this research, the multipoint kinetics method is applied to asymmetrical zero-power, subcritical, <b>bare</b> metal <b>reactor</b> systems. Existing research on asymmetrical reactor systems assumes symmetry in the neutronic coupling; however, it will be shown that this cannot always be assumed. Deep subcriticality adds another layer of complexity and requires modification of the multipoint kinetics equations to account for the effect of the external neutron source. A modified set of multipoint kinetics equations is derived with this in mind. Subsequently, the Rossi-alpha equations are derived for a two-region asymmetrical reactor system. The predictive capabilities of the radiation transport code MCNP 6 for neutron noise experiments are shown in a comparison to the results of a series of Rossi-alpha measurements performed by J. Mihalczo utilizing a coupled set of symmetrical bare highly-enriched uranium (HEU) cylinders. The ptrac option within MCNP 6 can generate time-tagged counts in a cell (list-mode data). The list-mode data can then be processed similarly to measured data to obtain values for system parameters such as the dual prompt neutron decay constants observable in a coupled system. The results from the ptrac simulations agree well with the historical measured values. A series of case studies are conducted to study the effects of geometrical asymmetry in the coupling between two bare metal HEU cylinders. While the coupling {{behavior of}} symmetrical systems has been reported on extensively, that of asymmetrical systems remains sparse. In particular, it appears that there has been no previous research in obtaining the coupling time constants for asymmetrically-coupled systems. The difficulty in observing such systems {{is due in part to}} the inability to determine the individual coupling coefficients from measurement: unlike the symmetrical cases, only the product of the values can be obtained. A method is proposed utilizing MCNP 6 tally ratios to separate the coupling coefficients for such systems. This work provides insight into the behavior of asymmetrically-coupled systems as the separation distance between the two cores is changed and also as the asymmetry is increased. As the separation distance increases, the slower observable prompt neutron decay constant increases in magnitude while the faster decay constant decreases. The coupling time constants are determined from the measured decay constants. As the separation distance increases, both coupling coefficients decrease as expected. As the asymmetry increases, the difference between the faster and slower decay constants and between the coupling time constants increases as expected. Based on these findings, an effective computational method utilizing MCNP 6 and the Rossi-alpha technique can be applied to the prediction of asymmetrical coupled system measurements...|$|R
