5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> escape.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 An FDA panel voted {{unanimously}} to recommend approval of florbetapir, which is currently used in an investigational study. The imaging agent can help to detect Alzheimer's brain plaques, but will require additional clinical research <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be made available commercially.|$|E
5|$|Members of the General Assembly {{are elected}} from districts that are realigned every ten years. Representatives serve terms {{of two years}} and {{senators}} serve terms of four years. Both houses can create bills, but bills must pass both houses <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be submitted to the governor and enacted into law.|$|E

5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} level, the rocket stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling {{back to the first}} after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E

50|$|Homemade {{versions}} {{might include}} scallion, century egg, or dried shrimp. These additional ingredients {{are added to}} the egg mixture <b>before</b> steaming. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> also be enjoyed with soy sauce. The taste is usually savory (as opposed to a sweet custard).|$|R
5|$|Delta Squad {{kills the}} Riftworm <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> sink Jacinto {{and returns to}} the surface. They are ordered to {{investigate}} a nearby abandoned COG outpost where they encounter experimented creatures of unknown origin and learn of a back door entrance to the Hollow in the nearby Kadar Mountains. They find prisoner cages and Dom convinces Marcus that Maria (Dom's wife) must be inside one of them. They manage to find her, but the Locust imprisonment and torture has left her severely disfigured and traumatized, unable to communicate. Faced with the nigh-vegetative state Maria is in, Dom tearfully chooses to euthanize her. Marcus and Dom then charge into the Locust stronghold.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join {{the attack and}} overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch escapes from his own damaged aircraft, wearing an AMP suit and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Hugh LeMessurier and Brian Andrew Hills {{published}} their paper, A thermodynamic approach {{arising from}} a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, which suggested that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in asymptomatic bubble formation which must then be re-dissolved at the decompression stops <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase gas for efficient decompression.|$|E

6000|$|I {{dare say}} there are several {{questions}} {{you would like to}} ask {{at the very beginning of}} this history. First: Who is the Monarch of Mo? And why is he called the Magical Monarch? And where is Mo, anyhow? And why have you never heard of <b>it</b> <b>before?</b> And <b>can</b> <b>it</b> be reached by a railroad or a trolley-car, or must one walk all the way? ...|$|R
5|$|Later that night, Detweiler {{arrives at}} a vet's office to get tranquilizers and leaves. The vet goes to the back and is {{attacked}} by the Dhole but he locks the room <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> cause any harm. The dog catchers arrive and open fire on the wrong dog. While the vet tries to operate on the hurt dog Scully enters the building and begins to hear screaming in the back room. She discovers that the vet has been attacked. After Scully leaves, the hurt animal transforms into the dhole, revealing that the dog can mimic any shape.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{she finds}} an old den made of logs and bedded with leaves, and settles down there. The next day, while hunting prey she {{encounters}} a tom named Pine, who engages {{in conversation with}} Sasha. He warns her of the Clan cats living in the forest, in the process taking off her collar for her. The next morning, a ShadowClan patrol consisting of Tigerstar, Rowanpaw, and Jaggedtooth comes along, and Sasha takes a particular interest in Tigerstar. After Rowanpaw scents traces of foxes, a frog appears, although he is unsuccessful at catching it. <b>Before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> get away, though, Sasha drops on it and says that it slipped through their paws.|$|E
5|$|The game's storyline {{focuses on}} {{a young man named}} Wander who enters a {{forbidden}} land. Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with whom to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi. Shadow of the Colossus {{has been described as a}} puzzle game, as each colossus' weakness must be identified and exploited <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be defeated.|$|E

5|$|There is {{considerable}} uncertainty about which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments {{of people who}} harm themselves are most effective. Psychiatric and personality disorders are common in individuals who self-harm {{and as a result}} self-harm may be an indicator of depression and/or other psychological problems. Many people who self-harm have moderate or severe depression and therefore treatment with antidepressant medications may often be used. There is tentative evidence for the medication flupentixol; however, greater study is required <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be recommended.|$|E
5|$|Chakotay pleads their case, but Janeway {{decides not to}} help them. As Chakotay {{returns to}} Voyager on board a shuttle, the Co-operative use their telepathic link {{to force him to}} travel to the Borg cube with Voyager in pursuit. Both Chakotay and an away team board the cube, and despite a firefight, he manages to reactivate the generator. This creates the new joint mind as expected, but also {{activates}} the cube, which begins powering up to attack Voyager. Chakotay and the away team are beamed back to Voyager as the Co-operative trigger the cube's self-destruct <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> endanger the Federation ship. The planet's inhabitants thank Voyager, but {{as a result of their}} actions, Chakotay later questions the morality of the Co-operative's motives with Janeway, as it connected many of the former Borg together in a new hive mind without consulting them.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing {{there is not}} such a mirror in creating a European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E
50|$|Experiential {{knowledge}} is knowledge gained through experience, {{as opposed to}} a priori (<b>before</b> experience) knowledge: <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also be contrasted both with propositional (textbook) knowledge, and with practical knowledge.|$|R
50|$|Household water {{treatment}} {{a means to}} improve quality of water <b>before</b> consumption. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> be implemented under a self-supply approach, but also under other approaches. The most ubiquitous method of household {{water treatment}} {{in the world is}} boiling. Other methods that have been advocated are point-of-use chlorination, SODIS, and various types of water filters.|$|R
5000|$|Aquadag {{consists}} of a dispersion of colloidal graphite in distilled water. [...] It is provided in concentrated paste form and is usually diluted with distilled water to a desired consistency <b>before</b> application. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> be applied by brushing, swabbing, spraying, or dipping, after which the surface is dried, leaving a layer of pure graphite.|$|R
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> flower. This dormancy {{is linked to}} starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars {{are created by}} firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the bullet <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
5|$|One of six {{predetermined}} origin stories {{begins the}} game, {{depending on the}} player character's race and class. Each story ends with the player being introduced to and leaving with Duncan, the commander of Ferelden's Grey Wardens {{who is trying to}} find new recruits, selecting the player as a potential candidate. The two journey to a fortress in southern Ferelden called Ostagar. There, they join Cailan, the King of Ferelden, and his father-in-law Loghain, a legendary general. The three leaders plan to make a stand against the encroaching Darkspawn before a new Blight overwhelms Ferelden. Duncan senses the influence of an Archdemon, a god-like being hosted in the body of a powerful Dragon that commands the Darkspawn, which makes this the first true Blight in over 400 years. Duncan emphasizes the importance of defeating the Blight <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> gain enough momentum to threaten the rest of Thedas.|$|E
50|$|Walnut ink is an ink {{made from}} the green husk {{surrounding}} the nut of walnuts. The Black Walnut Juglans nigra is usually used. The ink may be liquid or made of crystals that are mixed with water <b>before</b> use. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> be used to produce stains and darken paper {{to make it look}} older.|$|R
50|$|Incremental lists {{typically}} have no structure and new items {{are added to}} the bottom of the list as they come up. If the list is compiled immediately <b>before</b> use, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be organized by store layout (e.g. frozen foods are grouped together on the list) to minimize time in the store. Preprinted lists can be similarly organized.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to a study}} {{mentioned}} in Bit of News, taking photos of pleasurable food, such as cakes, <b>before</b> eating <b>it</b> <b>can</b> increase the savoring — [...] "the increased anticipation built up from taking photos of the food made it taste better." [...] If people don't take a photo, they may even feel something is missing from the savoring experience.|$|R
