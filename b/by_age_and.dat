5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, Yorkshire failed to win the Championship, {{although}} they never finished lower than fourth in the table. The team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling, particularly {{after the death of}} Roy Kilner in 1928. The effectiveness of the main bowlers was reduced <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> injury; only Macaulay remained at something approaching his bowling peak. However, his performances worsened each year. His bowling figures in the 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926, showing only a slight decline, but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930.|$|E
5|$|The {{biological}} half-life of strontium in humans has variously been reported as from 14 to 600 days, 1000 days, 18 years, 30 years and, at an upper limit, 49 years. The wide-ranging published {{biological half-life}} figures are explained by strontium's complex metabolism within the body. However, by averaging all excretion paths, the overall biological half-life {{is estimated to}} be about 18 years. The elimination rate of strontium is strongly affected <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> sex, due to differences in bone metabolism.|$|E
5|$|From birth, leopard sharks form large schools {{generally}} segregated <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> sex, {{which may}} intermingle with grey or brown smoothhounds (Mustelus californicus and M. henlei) or spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). These schools are apparently nomadic, often appearing suddenly {{in an area}} {{for a few hours}} and then vanishing just as quickly. In captivity, larger sharks have been observed establishing their dominance over smaller individuals via light nips to the pectoral fins. During summer days, large aggregations of mature females assemble in shallow bays and estuaries, dispersing at night. As these females follow the warmest patches of water, allowing them to raise their internal body temperatures by up to 3°C (5.4°F), they are speculated to be taking advantage of the heat to speed their growth and that of their gestating young. The membership of these aggregations is inconstant, with individual females periodically switching between different sites scattered over several kilometers.|$|E

5|$|Merrick {{became one}} of 928 {{residents}} in the workhouse. The group was segregated <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> sex, and therefore Merrick was housed with the other men between 16 and 60. On 22 March 1880, only 12 weeks after entering, Merrick signed {{himself out of the}} workhouse and spent two days looking for work. With no more success than before, he found himself with no option but to return to the workhouse. This time he stayed for four years. Around 1882, Merrick underwent surgery on his face. The protrusion from his mouth had grown to 8–9inches and severely inhibited his speech and made it difficult to eat. He was operated on in the Workhouse Infirmary under the direction of Dr Clement Frederick Bryan and had {{a large part of the}} mass removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{spinner shark}} is a fast, active swimmer that {{sometimes}} forms large schools, segregated <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> sex. Young individuals prefer cooler water temperatures than adults. Off South Africa, females are found close to shore year-round while males only appear during the summer. Smaller spinner sharks may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites of the spinner shark include the copepods Kroyeria deetsi, Nemesis pilosus, and N. atlantica, which infest the shark's gills, Alebion carchariae, which infests the skin, Nesippus orientalis, which infests {{the mouth and}} gill arches, and Perissopus dentatus, which infests the nares and the rear margins of the fins.|$|E

The twins were arranged <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> sex and kept in barracks between experiments, which ranged from injection of different dyes into the eyes of twins to see whether it would change their color to sewing twins together in attempts to create conjoined twins.|$|E
25|$|Use of BPO pantomimes, {{instead of}} the IO pantomimes {{dominant}} in non-apraxic patients (i.e. BPO errors), {{is one of the}} diagnostic error patterns in apraxia.

However, it has been asserted that these apparently contradicting results may be {{due to a lack of}} control for confounding factors. For example, BPO errors are differentially affected <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> educational level in normal subjects; older, healthy people (tested group average 69 years old) and healthy adults with lower amount of education (tested group with average 7.2 years of formal education) make significantly more BPO errors than the average adult population.|$|E

25|$|The qasgiq {{was served}} as a school and {{workshop}} for young boys, where they could learn the art and craft of mask making, tool making, and kayak construction. It was also a place for learning hunting and fishing skills. At times, the men created a firebath, where hot fires and rocks produced heat to aid in body cleansing. Thus, the qasgiq was a residence, bathhouse, and workshop {{for all but the}} youngest male community members who still lived with their mothers. Although there were no formally recognized leaders or offices to be held, men and boys were assigned specific places within the qasgiq that distinguished rank of males <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> residence.

25|$|In March 1912, after {{assignments}} in the Philippines that saw him tour battlefields of the Russo-Japanese War and conclude that war with Japan was inevitable one day, Mitchell {{was one of}} 21 officers selected {{to serve on the}} General Staff—at the time, its youngest member at age 32. Ironically, he appeared in August 1913 at legislative hearings considering a bill to make Army aviation a branch separate from the Signal Corps and testified against the bill. As the only Signal Corps officer on the General Staff, he was chosen as temporary head of the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, a predecessor of the present day United States Air Force, in May 1916, when its head was reprimanded and relieved of duty for malfeasance in the section. Mitchell administered the section until the new head, Lieutenant Colonel George O. Squier, arrived from attaché duties in London, England, where World War I was in progress, then became his permanent assistant. In June, he took private flying lessons at the Curtiss Flying School because he was proscribed by law from aviator training <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> rank, at an expense to himself of $1,470 (approximately $33,000 in 2015). In July 1916, he was promoted to major and appointed Chief of the Air Service of the First Army.|$|E

25|$|Like other macaques, rhesus troops {{comprise}} {{a mixture of}} 20–200 males and females. Females may outnumber the males by a ratio of 4:1. Males and females both have separate hierarchies. Female philopatry, common among social mammals, has been extensively studied in rhesus macaques. Females tend not to leave the social group, and have highly stable matrilineal hierarchies in which a female’s rank {{is dependent on the}} rank of her mother. In addition, a single group may have multiple matrilineal lines existing in a hierarchy, and a female outranks any unrelated females that rank lower than her mother. Rhesus macaques are unusual in that the youngest females tend to outrank their older sisters. This is likely because young females are more fit and fertile. Mothers seem to prevent the older daughters from forming coalitions against her. The youngest daughter is the most dependent on the mother, and would have nothing to gain from helping her siblings in overthrowing their mother. Since each daughter had a high rank in her early years, rebelling against her mother is discouraged. Juvenile male macaques also exist in matrilineal lines, but once they reach four to five years of age, they are driven out of their natal groups by the dominant male. Thus, adult males gain dominance <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> experience.|$|E

40|$|Both Brugada Syndrome (BrS) and {{progressive}} cardiac conduction defect (PCCD) are associated respectively with diffuse and discrete alterations in conduction pathways affected <b>by</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> sex. This study assessed for contributions of such processes to {{the mechanism of}} conduction changes in Scn 5 a(+/-) and WT hearts stratified <b>by</b> <b>age</b> (3 <b>and</b> 12 months) and sex. In vivo electrocardiographic chest-lead assessment demonstrated greater incidences of bundle branch block in all Scn 5 a(+/-) mice compared to WT. Frequency analysis of right ventricular (RV) epicardial activation obtained from a 64 -channel multi-electrode array demonstrated greater prominence of late conducting components in Scn 5 a(+/-) compared to WT male, and in male compared to female Scn 5 a(+/-) following stratification by genotype and sex. Similar differences were observed between old male Scn 5 a(+/-) and young male Scn 5 a(+/-), old female Scn 5 a(+/-), and old male WT, following stratification <b>by</b> genotype, <b>age</b> <b>and</b> sex. These findings directly correlated with histomorphometric assessment of regional fibrosis in both septa and free walls preferentially involving the RV. We demonstrate complex alterations in conduction distributions suggesting a conversion of normal to slow-conducting tissue, modulated <b>by</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> sex, coupled with fibrosis in Scn 5 a(+/-) hearts. These features suggest an overlap between pathophysiological processes related to BrS and PCCD in Scn 5 a(+/-) hearts...|$|R
