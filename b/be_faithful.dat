5|$|The {{history of}} Antoinism {{was very quiet}} after 1940. In Belgium, Joseph Nihoul, the President of the Antoinist Council, then his successors, led the {{religion}} until their death, alongside {{the members of this}} body. The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement, which has withdrawn the religious changes she made: removal of photographs in the temples, deletion of baptism, marriage and communion, opposition to the translation of Antoine's works... However, a Belgian group who, claiming to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to the true Antoinist tradition, opened a temple in Angleur on 1 April 1943, preferred to keep the portraits of the Antoines in the temple. In France, the Antoinists wanted to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to all requirements provided by the founding couple. In spite of these differences, the two branches show each other support and tolerance. Thus, after the death of Catherine, there were two forms of Antoinism, which still remain different today: one in Belgium, and one in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} in {{development}} for approximately {{three years at}} Paramount Pictures, during which time a screen adaptation that differed significantly from the novel was written. Summit Entertainment acquired {{the rights to the}} novel after three years of the project's stagnant development.

Principal photography took 44 days and completed on May 2, 2008; the film was primarily shot in Oregon.|$|E

50|$|And I say unto you, Make to yourselves {{friends of}} the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into {{everlasting}} habitations.

And if ye have not <b>been</b> <b>faithful</b> in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.|$|R
5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E
5|$|His {{works on}} Shakespeare were devoted {{not merely to}} Shakespeare, but to {{understanding}} literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.|$|E
5|$|In Sorceria, {{the party}} learns {{that this is}} Ashlynn's home. The elders tell Ashlynn that the Demon Lord is {{watching}} her and give her the powerful spell Magic Burst to fight him.

While doing so, the Hero meets his double in Real Weaver's Peak, who gets spooked, and speaks 'Y-You. Y-You're m-m-me!', and says that he must prove himself to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to his family if he is to join powers. Returning to Real Somnia, the King and Queen tell the Hero that he is indeed the prince. When he fused with his clone, the Hero gained his memory back, much like Ashlynn and Carver had done.|$|E
