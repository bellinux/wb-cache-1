25|$|Several {{experts who}} {{observed}} video evidence suggested Mehserle might have confused his gun for his Taser, {{causing him to}} mistakenly believe he was tasering Grant. If Mehserle thought he was firing his Taser, this could provide a full or partial defense to the murder charge. It depended on whether Mehserle had a legal right to use his Taser at all, which was questioned. Prosecutors alleged that paperwork, including a <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>test,</b> completed by Mehserle after the shooting showed that he had changed his story about what occurred.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{was arrested}} in Fairfax County, Virginia at 2:45am on October 27, 2004 for {{allegedly}} {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol following a birthday party in Washington for former Redskins receiver Rod Gardner. Pulled over for driving 82mph on the Beltway, where the speed limit is 55mph, Taylor failed a field sobriety test and then refused a blood alcohol (BAC) test, which resulted in his arrest. A Fairfax County judge acquitted Taylor of the charges in March 2005 after viewing a videotape of Taylor's roadside sobriety tests that, according to the judge, failed to demonstrate obvious intoxication. Taylor was, however, convicted for refusing to take a <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>test</b> requested by a Virginia state police officer. But when this case was heard on appeal in March 2005, Taylor was acquitted of refusing to take the BAC test, with the judge ruling there was a lack of probable cause for the request.|$|E
2500|$|George Thackston pleaded {{no contest}} to a charge of {{reckless}} endangerment arising out of the fatal accident. On March 26, 1992, a judge sentenced him to 11 months and 29 days of probation and also ordered him to complete an alcohol treatment program. A <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>test</b> performed after the crash found that Thackston had a blood alcohol level of [...]08, which was not {{enough for him to}} be deemed intoxicated under Tennessee law.|$|E

25|$|Breath gas {{analysis}} {{is a method}} for gaining non-invasive information on the clinical state of an individual by monitoring volatile organic compounds present in the exhaled breath.

40|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} in Ireland {{has nearly doubled}} during the period 1989 - 2001. To evaluate the relationship of alcohol to fatal head injuries in the acute hospital setting we created a data base of all fatal traumatic brain injuries in the Department of Neuropathology at Beaumont Hospital over a ten year period (1997 - 2006 inclusive). 498 cases were identified (351 males: 147 females). Fatalities were highest in males aged 19 - 25 years (N= 101) and 51 - 70 years (N= 109). Falls (N= 210) and road traffic accidents (N= 183) were the commonest modes of presentation. 36 / 210 (17 %) falls had positive <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>testing,</b> 9 / 210 (4. 3 %) had documentation of alcohol in notes but no testing, 35 / 210 (16. 7 %) <b>tested</b> negative for <b>alcohol</b> and 130 / 210 (61. 9 %) were not tested. The RTA group (N= 183) comprised drivers (n= 79), passengers (n= 47) and pedestrians (n= 57). 65 / 79 (82. 2 %) of drivers were males aged 19 - 25 years. <b>Blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> was only available in 27 / 79 (34. 1 %) drivers and was positive in 13 / 27 (48. 1 %). 14 / 75 (18. 7 %) pedestrians were <b>tested</b> for <b>alcohol,</b> 4 / 14 (28. 6 %) were positive. Overall 142 / 183 (77. 6 %) of the RTA group were not tested. The contribution of alcohol to fatal traumatic brain injuries is probably being underestimated due to omission of <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration <b>testing</b> on admission to hospital. Absence of national guidelines on <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>testing</b> in the emergency department compounds the problem...|$|R
2500|$|The {{findings}} {{concluded that}} 164 witness statements had been altered. Of those statements, 116 were amended to remove or change negative comments about South Yorkshire Police. South Yorkshire Police had performed <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>tests</b> on the victims, {{some of them}} children, and ran computer checks on the national police database {{in an attempt to}} [...] "impugn their reputation". The report concluded that the then Conservative MP for Sheffield Hallam, Irvine Patnick, passed inaccurate and untrue information from the police to the press.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>tests</b> {{assume the}} {{individual}} being tested is average in various ways. For example, on average {{the ratio of}} <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> content to breath alcohol content (the partition ratio) is 2100 to 1. In other words, there are 2100 parts of <b>alcohol</b> in the <b>blood</b> for every part in the breath. However, the actual ratio in any given individual can vary from 1300:1 to 3100:1, or even more widely. [...] This ratio varies not only from person to person, but within one person from moment to moment. Thus {{a person with a}} true <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> level of [...]08% but a partition ratio of 1700:1 at the time of testing would have a [...]10 reading on a Breathalyzer calibrated for the average 2100:1 ratio.|$|R
50|$|Donald Bullcoming of New Mexico {{was arrested}} on {{suspicion}} of driving while intoxicated. He was sentenced {{to two years in}} prison for a felony aggravated DWI/DUI.

At his trial, the prosecution presented a lab report indicating that his blood-alcohol levels were elevated. But rather than calling the technician who had prepared and signed the report, prosecutors called a colleague who had not observed or reviewed the analysis.|$|E

While he {{was found not guilty}} of the DUI, he was found guilty of refusing to submit to a <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>test.</b> As a result of his refusal, his drivers license was suspended for three years, because he had previously admitted guilt in a drunken-driving diversion program that he completed in 2003.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} not advisable to use isopropyl alcohol to cleanse the venipuncture site when obtaining a specimen for a <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>test.</b> This has been related largely to the potential legal implications associated with use of alcohol based cleaners that could theoretically impact analysis. Numerous police alcohol collection kits have been marketed that incorporate a sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate preservative and non-alcohol based cleansing agents to ensure proper collection. Using soap and hot water or a povidone iodine swab are advisable alternatives to isopropyl alcohol in this case.|$|E

40|$|Four {{thousand}} fifty-six consecutive {{emergency room}} trauma visits {{in a small}} community hospital were evaluated {{to determine the extent}} of coexisting alcohol usage.

The need for early recognition of problem drinkers is emphasized by the fact that 85 % of known alcoholics are not receiving formal treatment. Reasons for failure to recognize the problem are discussed. The responsibility of the surgeon aggressively to pursue early identification is stressed...|$|R
