40|$|Body packing {{is a way}} {{to deliver}} packets of drugs across {{international}} borders by ingestion. The aim {{of the study was to}} provide an estimate of the medical risks of body packing, describe predictors for hospital referral in detained <b>body</b> <b>packers</b> and provide an estimate for the prevalence of body packing in the Amsterdam area. From May 2007 to December 2008, we studied medical records of <b>body</b> <b>packers</b> immediately detained after arrival at Amsterdam Schiphol airport, hospital records of both detained <b>body</b> <b>packers</b> and self-referrers at two emergency departments of hospitals in Amsterdam and records kept by forensic physicians in charge of post-mortem examinations of all unnatural deaths in the area (years 2005 - 2009). In airport detainees, the hospital referral rate was 4. 2 % (30 out of 707 detained <b>body</b> <b>packers),</b> the surgery rate was 1. 3 %. Significant predictors of hospital referral were delayed production of drug packets after arrest, cigarette smoking and country of departure. The surgery rate in self-referrers was comparable to the rate observed in those referred from the detention centre to hospital (30 % vs. 31 %). In addition, from 2005 to 2009, 20 proven cases of lethal body packing were identified. Based on our data, it is estimated that minimally 38 % of all incoming <b>body</b> <b>packers</b> were missed by airport controls. The risk for lethal complications due to body packing is low on a population basis and comparable to other studies. This also applies for the hospital referral and surgery rates found in this study.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: With {{the term}} <b>Body</b> <b>packers</b> we {{identify}} people who carry drugs hidden {{in their bodies}} especially on international flights. These event are constantly increasing all over the world. The accidental spontaneous opening of the drug packers is the major risk for patient's life, because the release cocaine inside the bowel can stir up the <b>Body</b> <b>packers</b> Syndrome. This eventuality is a medical surgical emergency that needs a wel timed diagnosis and a sudden treatment. CASE REPORT: We report {{a case of a}} 31 years old Caucasian woman, admitted from Rome International Airport to the nearest Emergency Unit and then moved to our Department because of suspected epilepsy hiding a diagnosis of <b>Body</b> <b>packers</b> Syndrome in acute phase. When the diagnosis was made, the woman was submitted to a colonoscopy and ciecotomy, and fifty-three packets were removed. In intensive care any complication occurred after surgery. CONCLUSION: The Body packing of drugs it's constantly a going problem. In Italy currently there aren't shared guide lines about the management of these patients. The international experience reports that in asymptomatic patients is enough a conservative treatment to help the spontaneous evacuation of packets but if the <b>Body</b> <b>packers</b> Syndrome is already present the best treatment is the surgical one.

40|$|Introduction. ‘Body packer’ {{syndrome}} {{with severe}} intoxication or sudden death may happen in persons who smuggle drugs in their body cavities. In case of lethal outcome when carrying cocaine, it is important, but sometimes {{difficult to determine}} whether death was due to intoxication or due to other causes. Therefore, it is necessary not only to quantify cocaine and its metabolites in biological material, but also based on their distribution in body fluids and tissues to conclude whether it is acute intoxication. We described a well-documented case of fatal poisoning in a <b>body</b> <b>packer</b> and post mortem distribution of the drug in biological samples. Case report. A 26 -year-old man was brought to hospital with no vital signs. Resuscitation measures started at once, but with no success. Autopsy revealed 66 packets of cocaine in his digestive tract, {{one of which was}} ruptured. Hyperemia of the most of all internal organs and pulmonary and brain edema were found. High concentrations of cocaine, its metabolites benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester, as well as cocaine adulteration levamisole were proven in the post mortem blood and tissues by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MC) method with selective-ion monitoring. Conclusion. The ratio of cocaine and its metabolites concentrations in the brain and blood obtained by LC-MS method can be used for forensic confirmation of acute intoxication with cocaine...|$|E
40|$|Background: During {{the last}} decade, {{increased}} rates of drug traffic {{have led the}} smugglers to use various methods. One of these methods of illicit drug smuggling is body packing. Smuggling by intra-abdominal concealment is called "body packing". In this research, mortality rate was investigated due to body packing in Tehran. Methods: A descriptive study (case series) was designed on all corpses referred to the Forensic Medicine Organization of Tehran between April 1999 - December 2000. Demographic data such as sex, age, marital status, addiction, job, education level, type of opioid and the weight, number of packets, and results of blood and urine morphine tests by thin-layer chromatographic method were investigated. Results: Continental system of law is used in Iran and 0. 06 % of the referred corpses to Forensic Medicine Organization of Tehran were body packers. There were 12 cases, {{all of them were}} men. The mean age of body packers was 43 years (range 20 – 62). The minimum weight of the packets was 20 g and the maximum weight was 1400 g (mean = 501 g). The minimum number of the packets was one and the maximum number of the packets was 48. Twenty five percent of the corps were putrefied and one corpse was mummified. None of the body packers had academic education nor were employed. Nine of them lived in cities. Twenty five percent of them were intravenous addicts. The corpses were found mostly in terminals (17 %), roads (58 %), and cities (25 %). Conclusion: Hospital physicians may neglect this type of gastrointestinal foreign body if they are not aware of the <b>body</b> <b>packer</b> syndrome. Body packing should be suspected in anyone with signs of drug-induced toxic effects after a recent arrival on city terminals or when there is no history of recreational drug use...|$|E
40|$|Background: People who ingest {{packets of}} illicit drugs or insert them into body {{cavities}} {{in an attempt}} to smuggle them are termed <b>body</b> <b>packers.</b> People who do this {{in an attempt to}} hide the drugs when encountered by law enforcement are called body stuffers. Severe toxicity and death occurs in <b>body</b> <b>packers</b> and <b>body</b> stuffers, and this is usually secondary to leaking of drug from packets in the gastrointestinal tract. This is well reported with cocaine and heroin and occurs less commonly with methamphet-amine. We report an unusual case of intravaginal body stuffing that lead to severe methamphetamine toxicity in a young woman. Case Report: A 20 -year old female, who was in police custody, developed multiple seizures, altered mental status, tachycardia and hypertension shortly after admitting to having drugs enclosed in plastic bags in her vagina. She was hospitalized for 4 days with gradual improvement in her symptoms {{with the exception of a}} resting tachycardia. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of the urine at this time confirmed the presence of methamphet-amine and the amphetamine metabolite, co-intoxicants were excluded based on comprehensive urine drug screening using GCMS. Quantitative serum levels of methamphetamine and amphetamine were 3100 ng/ml and 110 ng/ml, repectively. Conclusions: We report an unusual case of intravaginal body stuffing that lead to severe methamphetamine toxicity in a young woman. This case highlights the potential for severe methamphetamine poisoning secondary to intravaginal stuffing. If either body packing or stuffing is suspected, a vaginal exam may be warranted...|$|R

40|$|Background: Intra-corporeal {{concealment}} {{of illicit}} drugs known as ‘body packing’ is uncommonly reported. These drugs mainly comprise opium, heroin, cocaine, 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), amphetamines, and marijuana or hashish. <b>Body</b> <b>packers</b> {{may also be}} called swallowers, internal carriers, couriers or mules.   Although this practice is not new, its medical complications {{have always been a}} matter of concern. Some have reported improved packaging methods to deal with such complications. Body packing is an on-going drug smuggling method and authorities across the world are always on the alert. Case Presentation: It has reported a case of death due to the effects of heroin concealed in a man who was attempting to smuggle the drug within his gastro-intestinal track. According to forensic procedure of sudden unnatural death, the decedent had to accept a series of examination such as CT scan, autopsy and toxicological analysis. He was found dead from acute heroin intoxication due to the rupture of drug packet in the stomach. Discussion: This case illustrates the challenges to forensic diagnosis in forensic medical methods in evaluation of potential drug packers and therefore it needs to consider all methods and finally best method involved in forensic diagnosis. Conclusion: In conclusion, in <b>body</b> <b>packer’s</b> postmortem pathological signs are combined with evidence of the presence of drug pellets in the body as well as toxicological analysis in the ante-mortem history, and clinical reports. Toxicological analysis of the presence of the drug in body fluids, such as plasma, and in tissue extracts may not be of value when the level of the drug decreases after a period of metabolism...|$|R
40|$|A {{broad range}} of {{peripheral}} neurological complications have been recognized in heroin addicts. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) involvement, usually secondary to trauma during loss of consciousness, commonly manifests as compressive neuropathy or rhabdomyolysis. Other, rare, non traumatic PNS lesions include poliradiculopathy, plexopathy, Guillan-Barrè syndrome and mononeuropathy. Acute heroin related non compressive neuropathy is rare, and the aetiology is still unclear. In heroin abusers painful acute neuropathy has rarely been described. We report {{the case of a}} 33 -year-old male with a history of heroin abuse. He was found in his home in coma, maintaining the same sitting position for several hours. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, where rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute renal failure was diagnosed, requiring treatment with haemodialysis. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed the presence of several foreign bodies in sigma and the urinary exams showed high concentration of opiates, revealing that the patient was a <b>body</b> <b>packer.</b> Further laboratory exams showed Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection with normal liver function. Upon awakening, five days after admission, the patient complained of severe burning pain, mechanical allodynia, itch, tingling and pinprick sensation in both feet and legs. The Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions (DN 4) scale was 8 / 10, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scale score was 9 / 10 and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) score was 37. Neurologic examination showed reduced sensitivity to temperature and pinprick in both legs and feet. Neurophysiological evaluation, performed 4 weeks after admission, showed normal nerve conduction studies. Thermal Quantitative Sensory Testing (t-QST) showed a patchy distribution of cold and warm hypoesthesia in the lower limbs. The patient also described positive symptoms (hyperalgesia and aftersensation following hot stimuli, mechanical static and dynamic allodynia) in the same areas. Sympathetic Skin Response (SSR) performed in both arms and feet was normal. Laser Doppler Flowmetry showed reduced local vasodilation after heat stimulus (C-mediated local axonal reflex) and normal vasoconstriction reflex (mediated by adrenergic sympathetic fibres) distally in the legs. The patient declined undergoing a skin biopsy for diagnostic purposes. The clinical and neurophysiological findings indicate the presence of small fibre neuropathy, with main involvement of C fibres, following a length-dependent distribution. To relieve the severe painful symptoms the patient was treated with gabapentin, fentanyl, duloxetina and pregabalin, with a gradual resolution of pain. The follow up examination, performed after 12 months, showed an improvement of the small fibre related symptoms with resolution of spontaneous pain and attenuation of itch, tingling and pinprick sensation, confirmed by the t-QST evaluation. A {{broad range of}} peripheral neurological complications have been recognized in heroin abusers. Peripheral nerve lesions in drug addicts may be caused by injection of substances in the vicinity of a nerve, local infection or nerve compression during coma. Combined nerve or plexus lesions and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in relation to possible trauma but they may occur also without apparent trauma to muscles or nerves. In these latter cases toxic or allergic reaction to heroin or adulterants are probably more important causes of rhabdomyolysis and nerve lesions than limb compression. Reports on acute heroin-related non compressive neuropathy are scarce. Dabby et al. described six patients who developed acute PNS injury following intravenous or intranasal heroin self administration with no evidence of compression injury or inflammation. Four patients had plexopathy and two had symmetric distal axonal sensorimotor neuropathy; five had concomitant rhabdomyolysis. They proposed that a toxic mechanism could be responsible for acute neuropathy following heroin abuse. In heroin abusers painful complications have been reported, but the pain was related to myelopathy, plexopathy, sciatic neuropathy and rhabdomyolysis 4; none of these cases had length-dependent symptoms or clinical signs of small fibre damage. Numerous studies in humans and animals report that opioids can elicit abnormal pain, like thermal hyperalgesia and/or mechanical allodynia, following both acute and chronic administration of morphine, heroin, methadone, fentanyl and remifentanil. The mechanism responsible for the tactile and thermal hypersensitivity observed following opioid exposure is still unclear. Many hypotheses have been put forward, including sensitization of peripheral nerve endings or second-order neurons, enhanced descending facilitation of nociceptive pathways, increased production, release and decreased re-uptake of neurotransmitters involved in nociception, activation of glial cells and opioid associated epigenetic changes in Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) methylation. Prolonged exposure to opioids results in long-lasting neuroadaptive changes that promote a state of hypersensitivity to normal non-noxious tactile and to noxious thermal stimulation that may promote activation of the nociceptive system. The aetiology of acute PNS complication in heroin addicts can be related to different mechanisms. The impurities and additives present in illicit drugs may cause allergies and have their own toxic effects; mechanical trauma is a potential mechanism of focal nerve injury and rhabdomyolysis. Evidence of an immunologic cause has been found in three patients who developed acute brachial plexopathy and rhabdomyolysis after heroin administration and in one heroin addict who developed a lumbosacral plexus neuropathy and responded to steroid therapy. We describe the case of a <b>body</b> <b>packer</b> who developed acute painful neuropathy with involvement of small nerve fibre with concomitant rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. The patient was HCV positive; all the other causes of Small Fibre Neuropathy (SFN) were excluded. In our patient {{there was no evidence of}} an inflammatory or immunologic process and mechanical factors probably didn’t play a major role in the pathogenesis. The patient had a history of prolonged lying before arriving to the emergency room but the neuropathy was symmetric and distal, being inconsistent with focal trauma or compression. Acute renal failure and haemodialysis can be possible causes of SFN but in our patient there was not a correlation of the symptoms with the haemodialytic sessions and there was not an improvement of symptoms after achieving normal renal function. HCV infection can play a role in SFN, but the acute presentation of the symptoms in temporal relation with heroin intoxication and their gradual improvement suggest that a toxic effect of heroin or added substances can be responsible for neural and muscle toxicity in our patient. In conclusion a careful neurophysiological evaluation should be considered in heroin abusers presenting with acute pain to rule out SFN...|$|E

Obstruction of the lower oesophagus or stomach is not frequently reported. We report {{the case of a}} 49 -year-old woman who had ingested 92 cocaine-containing packages. She was admitted to the hospital after opioid syndrome related to the intake of morphine and codeine to decrease intestinal transit. The presence of more than 80 packages was suspected in the stomach on the initial abdomen computed tomography. Due to the absence of progression of the packages after four days of well-conducted laxative therapy and to major gastric distension at abdomen tomography, surgery was decided and gastrotomy allowed the evacuation of 80 packages that were still present in the stomach or in the lower oesophagus. In addition, 12 other packages had been retrieved either after laxative therapy (9) or by evacuation via the anal canal (3) after palpation of the intestine during the surgical procedure. No complication was observed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Body packing is a {{distinct}} method of drug smuggling. Surgeons and intensive care specialists will be confronted with <b>body</b> <b>packers</b> when packets do not pass spontaneously and rupture, causing drug toxicity. CASE REPORT: We report of a 32 -year-old Liberian male who presented with abdominal complaints and anxiety after having ingested 50 cocaine-containing packets of which 49 had passed the natural route in the previous days. X-ray of his abdomen showed a structure possibly compatible with a packet in or projected over the stomach. We decided to transfer the patient to the operation theatre for surgical removal via gastrotomy. However, no packet was found. During his first day {{in the intensive care}} unit he did not regain consciousness. Repeated urine analyses for cocaine were negative. After one day he deteriorated: he needed circulatory support because of hypotension, without signs of sepsis. Repeated surgery revealed no packet. In the end he turned out not to be suffering from cocaine intoxication. CONCLUSIONS: When confronted with a case of body packing in which packets do not pass spontaneously and produce bowel obstruction or in which badly wrapped packets rupture, causing drug toxicity, it is of utmost importance to establish the nature of the packet's conten...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Background: <b>Body</b> <b>packers</b> {{are those}} people who swallow opiate drug {{packages}} for smug-gling purposes. According to a report of forensic medicine journal, one tonne of opiate drugs are annu-ally transported in this way. Ninety percent of all opiate drugs in the prisons {{are estimated to be}} smug-gled through swallowing the packages or rectal or vaginal concealment. Plain abdominal x-ray is the usual and widespread technique for the radiologic confirmation of diagnosis. Due to air entrapment be-tween the cover and the materials (opiate drugs), a double condom or double crescent sign confirms the diagnosis. Patients & Methods: A study on 16 patients was con-ducted, in which we used a new pelvic and abdomi-nal CT scanning without contrast to make a diagnosis. They were 15 male and one female patients mostly in their third decade of life. Number of concealed pack-ages ranged from 1 to 150 with a total weight of about 1 to 5 kgs. One of the patients died because of the complications following package rupture. Results: As the density of opium and heroin is about 140 - 170, we recommend a CT scan without contrast as the modality of choice for the diagnosis of these foreign body concealments. In this way we can also follow management of the patient regarding complete removal of the packages. Conclusion: In suspicious cases, however, barium en-ema is required increasing the risk of packages rup-ture. Doing a CT scan with contrast also has the shortcoming of under- diagnosis in bowels full of contrast media due to the density of opiate drug packages. So based on our study, the best way for di-agnosing body packing remains a CT scan without contrast...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{retrospectively}} evaluate the specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of computed tomography (CT), digital radiography (DR) and low-dose linear slit digital radiography (LSDR, Lodox(®)) in the detection of internal cocaine containers. METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained. The study collectively consisted of 83 patients (76 males, 7 females, 16 - 45 years) suspected of having incorporated cocaine drug containers. All underwent radiological imaging; a total of 135 exams were performed: nCT= 35, nDR= 70, nLSDR= 30. An overall calculation of all "drug mules" and a specific evaluation of <b>body</b> <b>packers,</b> pushers and stuffers were performed. The gold standard was stool examination in a dedicated holding cell equipped with a drug toilet. RESULTS: There were 54 drug mules identified in this study. CT of all drug carriers showed the highest diagnostic accuracy 97. 1 %, sensitivity 100 % and specificity 94. 1 %. DR in all cases was 71. 4 % accurate, 58. 3 % sensitive and 85. 3 % specific. LSDR of all patients with internal cocaine was 60 % accurate, 57. 9 % sensitive and 63. 4 % specific. CONCLUSIONS: CT was the most accurate test studied. Therefore, the detection of internal cocaine drug packs should be performed by CT, rather than by conventional X-ray, in order to apply the most sensitive exam in the medico-legal investigation of suspected drug carriers. Nevertheless, the higher radiation applied by CT than by DR or LSDR needs to be considered. Future studies should include evaluation of low dose CT protocols {{in order to address}} germane issues and to reduce dosage...|$|R
40|$|Context. A {{position}} {{paper on the}} use of whole bowel irrigation (WBI) was fi rst published in 1997 by the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT) and the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and updated in 2004. The aims of this paper are to briefl y summarize the content of the 2004 Position Paper and to present any new data and recommendations. Methods. A systematic review of the literature from January 2003 to February 28, 2013 was conducted using multiple online databases for articles concerning WBI for gastrointestinal decontamination. An evidence table was created for applicable articles. The authors produced the initial draft that was reviewed by AACT and EAPCCT. Results. The literature search produced 60 articles with the possibility of applicable human data. Based mainly on volunteer studies, WBI can be considered for potentially toxic ingestions of sustained-release or enteric-coated drugs particularly for those patients presenting later than 2 h after drug ingestion when activated charcoal is less effective. WBI can be considered for patients who have ingested substantial amounts of iron, lithium, or potassium as the morbidity is high and {{there is a lack of}} other potentially effective options for gastrointestinal decontamination. WBI can be considered for removal of ingested packets of illicit drugs in “ <b>body</b> <b>packers.</b> ” However, controlled data documenting improvement in clinical outcome after WBI are lacking. WBI is contraindicated in patients with bowel obstruction, perforation, or ileus, and in patients with hemodynamic instability or compromised unprotected airways. WBI should be used cautiously in debilitated patients and in patients with medical conditions that might be further compromised by its use. The concurrent administration of activated charcoal and WBI might decrease the effectiveness of the charcoal. The clinical relevance of this interaction is uncertain. Conclusion. WBI can facilitate removal of select toxicants from the gastrointestina...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{cooperative}} hunting {{is always an}} ESS when attacking multiple prey, both large and small. This is because cooperators {{no longer have to}} pay costs of dividing meat if they can each make their own kill. Another benefit is that when prey is sufficiently large it can be shared among cooperators if one member was unable to make a kill. Moreover, cheaters and scavengers only do well when hunting costs are very high, since they forgo the chance to get their own prey. In these parts of the model, cooperative hunting is always favorable, {{as long as there is}} some form of increase in net efficiency over solitary hunting. However, in their <b>body</b> of research, <b>Packer</b> and Ruttan found very few instances of this clear advantage over solitaries. They concluded that cooperative hunting in multiple prey situations is more likely to be a result of pre-existing social bonds rather than an evolutionary adaptation, but that this hunting behavior is still important for establishing the social fabric of the group.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out on the {{poisoning}} cases admitted in National Poison Control Centre, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, from January 1999 to December 2002. The poisoning cases dealt during this period were classified into 6 groups such as, chemicals, heavy metals, plant and natural alkaloids, animal bites, <b>body</b> <b>packers,</b> and unknown poisoning. Chemical group has been further classified into 7 subgroups, which were organophosphate, corrosives, rodenticide, kerosene oil, drug overdose, naphthalene, and alcohol. Heavy metals were sub grouped into mercury, lead arsenic, and copper sulfate. Plant group comprises of 2 sub groups, which were datura and opium and its derivatives. Lastly animal group was subdivided into snakebite and insect bite. Overall 14 subgroups were studied during this 4 -year period. Total number of various poisoning cases admitted in NPCC was 4894. Chemicals constitute {{the largest group of}} poisoning that comprises of 3334 (68. 12 %) patients. In this study every patient was examined and his/her mode of presentation was noted, after which he/she was treated according to the said protocol. Each patient was subject to diagnostic evaluation in terms of blood picture and chemistry, urine analysis, radiological examination like X-ray and ultrasound and electrocardiogram. Specific examinations were also carried out as and when required. During the stay in the word, day to day evaluation was done in terms of their clinical response and laboratory data. It was noted that out of 4894 cases of poisoning the male population was 2956 (60. 40 %) in comparison to females, which was 1938 (39. 60 %). The male versus female pattern of suffering appears to change in the recent years. The medico legal aspect that comes to be apparent was that, suicidal attempt was the major cause of poisoning and it alone constitutes 2504 (51. 16 %) cases. Accidental poisoning comes next and had 1702 (34. 78 %) cases, whereas homicidal poisoning had the least number of patients which were 310 (6. 33 %Significant increase in the incidence of poisoning in our social setup is definitely alarming and needs special attention. Above all the suicidal attempt reflects the social tendency was, economic crisis as well as joblessness or even the emotional urge of love and hatred. Intolerant behavior and decline in the family values/split families, is also a contributing factor. The media unfortunately is no saint, which plays an important role by displaying fiction serials and dramas, which has mostly no part in real life, but definitely may {{have a negative impact on}} the younger generation. The younger, especially and females are more demanding even beyond the means of the earning member in the family resulting in development of disputes, and leading to the unfortunate attempt of suicide. The majority of accidental cases were due to carelessness or preoccupied mind and also due to unawareness. Simple awareness programs for the publics can be much helpful in reducing the incidence of accidental poisoning. National Poison Control Center launches several awareness programs for the public on chemical safety, but still there is further need for more and a continuous flow of awareness either through seminars of through press and electronic media. In this study we have introduced some new protocols of treatment according to our need, in reference to a developing country where most of the population is still unable to take care of their medical bills. Glycopyrrolate was cried in organophosphate poisoning in combination with atropine instead of pralidoxime, which is a costly drug, and found successful. This was the first detailed study of poisoning cases in our country that included types of poisoning gender ratio, age group, route of administration, clinical presentations, diagnostic data analysis, complication of poisonings, outcome in terms of recovery and death, and medico legal aspects in terms of suicide, accident or homicide. No aspect of medical and social importance of poisoning was overlooked. A sincere effort to the best of our capability was made to attain the objectives and reach a conclusion to manage poiosoning cases along with reducing its rate of incidence while providing awareness and providing better medical car...|$|R
