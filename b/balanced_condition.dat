A wire wound coil is the secondary winding. The current through the secondary winding is zero at the <b>balanced</b> <b>condition.</b> In balance condition, the flux due to the current through the phase wire will be neutralized by the current through the neutral wire, since the current, which flows from the phase {{will be returned to}} the neutral. When a fault occurs, a small current will flow to the ground also. This makes an unbalance between line and netural current and that creates an unbalanced magnetic field. This induces a current through the secondary winding, which is connected to the sensing circuit. This will sense the leakage and send signal to tripping system.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCertain {{theoretical}} frameworks {{have successfully}} explained motor learning in either unimanual or bimanual movements. However, no single theoretical framework can comprehensively explain motor learning in {{both types of}} movement because {{the relationship between these}} two types of movement remains unclear. Although our recent model of a balanced motor primitive framework attempted to simultaneously explain motor learning in unimanual and bimanual movements, this model focused only on a limited subset of bimanual movements and therefore did not elucidate the relationships between unimanual movements and various bimanual movements. Here, we extend the balanced motor primitive framework to simultaneously explain motor learning in unimanual and various bimanual movements as well as the transfer of learning effects between unimanual and various bimanual movements; these phenomena can be simultaneously explained if the mean activity of each primitive for various unimanual movements is balanced with the corresponding mean activity for various bimanual movements. Using this <b>balanced</b> <b>condition,</b> we can reproduce the results of prior behavioral and neurophysiological experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the <b>balanced</b> <b>condition</b> can be implemented in a simple neural network model...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of the balance in inhibitory and excitatory couplings in the brain has increasingly been realized. Despite the key role played by inhibitory-excitatory couplings in the functioning of brain networks, {{the impact of a}} <b>balanced</b> <b>condition</b> on the stability properties of underlying networks remains largely unknown. We investigate properties of the largest eigenvalues of networks having such couplings, and find that they follow completely different statistics when in the balanced situation. Based on numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the transition from Weibull to Fréchet via the Gumbel distribution can be controlled by the variance of the column sum of the adjacency matrix, which depends monotonically on the denseness of the underlying network. As a <b>balanced</b> <b>condition</b> is imposed, the largest real part of the eigenvalue emulates a transition to the generalized extreme value statistics, independent of the inhibitory connection probability. Furthermore, the transition to the Weibull statistics and the small-world transition occur at the same rewiring probability, reflecting a more stable system. Comment: 7 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
