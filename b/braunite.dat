The mineral exists in two polysomes, normal <b>braunite</b> (or <b>braunite</b> 1) which corresponds to chemical com-position 3 Mn~O 3. MnSiO 3 with about 10 % SiO 2 and a rarer form, <b>braunite</b> II, which appears to contain certain essential calcium and iron, much less SiO 2 (about 4 %) and has an ideal formula Ca(Mn 12 Fe 2) 3 +SiO 24 (de Villiers, 1980). The existance of other elements, such as magnesium, barium and boron, in the mineral has been reported by Frenzel (1980). Studies by Kleyen-stuber (1984) on thc Kalahari manganese ores of South Africa suggest that <b>braunite!</b> {{is a product of}} sedimentary-diagenetic to very low grade metamorphism, (Mamatwan-type ores) while <b>braunite</b> II is characteristic of hydrothermal alteration zones (Wessels-type ore). <b>Braunite</b> is thus currently considered to have a wide oxide stability field and a number of modes of origin, i. e. sedimentary-diagenetic, metamorphic and hydrothermal. However, supergene formation of <b>braunite,</b> postulated by Hewett (1972), is con-sidered 'extremely doubtful ' (Roy 1981).

40|$|Abstract: The {{manganese}} ores of the Northern Apennine ophiolites (Val Gravegila, Eastern Liguria, Italy) {{occur within}} chert sequences, mainly as stratiform layers (0. 1 - 1 m thick) or massive lenses (5 - 20 m thick). The ores {{originated in the}} Ligurian-Piedmont oceanic basin (Middle Callovian) during turbiditic resedimentation of hydrothermally Mn-enriched submarine muds. During Upper Cretaceous-Lower Cenozoic orogenic events, the primary sedimentary oxide assemblages were completely recrystallized to <b>braunite</b> + quartz assemblages under prehnite-pumpellyte facies conditions (T = 275 f 25 "C; P = 2. 5 f 0. 5 kbar). This tectonic event induced mobilisation of Mn and Si, and thickening of the mineralised layers. A complex network of sigmoidal quartz veins formed at this stage. The interaction between the Mn mineralisation and the circulating fluids generated centimetric to decimetric reaction rims in the wall rock, where the <b>braunite</b> + quartz assemblage is replaced by Mn silicates'(main 1 y bementite, johannsenite, parsettensite and rhodonite) and carbonates (mainly Mn-bearing calcite and rhodochrosite) with a zoned distribution. Mineral zoning points to an early interaction between the Mn mineralisation and Hz 0 -C 02 fluids with high water activity. Two distinct types of fluids are present in syntectonic quartz veins, namely a low-salinity water-rich fluid, and a Mn-Ca-Na-Mg-Fe-bearing aqueous solution that in all probability represent a relict of an early fluid phase circulating during breakdown of <b>braunite.</b> The isochore distribution related to low-salinity fluids indicates that veining processes {{took place during the}} main tectono-metamorphic events, at peak P-T conditions.

The {{published}} version can {{be found}} at: [URL] Mn-and Fe-rich micro-crystalline precipitates formed in the decorations of lead glazes during ceramic firing are responsible for colour, shine and opacity, among other visual characteristics, besides being the most important relics of the technology. Due to their small size and growth habits, the micro-crystalline precipitates may remain unidentified on polished cross sections of the glazes. Thin-section petrography, combined with synchrotron-radiation X-ray micro-diffraction, {{appears to be a}} very powerful tool to reveal the presence, growth habits, distribution and nature of the micro-crystallites. This is illustrated here by two case studies directly related to the brown decorations technology: the 19 th century French imitations of the Ligurian Taches Noires pottery from the Joques workshop and the 17 th century Catalan-decorated tablewares. Melanotekite, cristobalite and hematite micro-crystallites were found in the glazes of the French imitations. Hematite acted as nucleating agent effective in promoting both the crystallization of melanotekite and cristobalite. The presence of cristobalite is not related to alkali ions, which are normally responsible for its formation far from equilibrium conditions. Melanotekite and cristobalite can be considered as technological markers associated to the Joques production and then be used to identify imitations of this workshop. <b>Braunite</b> and kentrolite were identified in the brown decoration of the Catalan tablewares. The manganese pigment was probably mixed with a lead oxide compound and applied directly over the raw glaze. The presence of <b>braunite</b> and kentrolite indicates a firing temperature of about 950 °C. Thin-section petrography reveals that the crystallite growth has taken place under two different conditions. Euhedral <b>braunite</b> crystallites were produced during the heating.

It was also the objective of this study to determine the timing and duration of supergene alteration. Samples for polished thin sections were carefully selected from eight representative boreholes to be representative of all the lithostratigraphic zones and ore types. The thin sections were used to study mineralogy by means of reflected light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. X-ray powder diffractometry on representative powder samples were used to study the mineralogy and geochemistry of the samples. Microprobe analyses were also performed on the representative samples. Finally the samples were submitted for 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology. In this supergene enrichment zone carbonates are leached (associated with an increase in porosity) and Mn 2 +/Mn 3 + -bearing minerals (kutnahorite, Mn-calcite an <b>braunite)</b> are altered to supergene Mn 4 +-bearing mineral phases (todorokite and manganomelane) and minor quartz. This process upgrades ore from 38 wt% Mn to ore with more than 40 wt% Mn. Element fluxes, enrichment and depletion of major and trace elements were quantified by mass balance calculations. Na 2 O, K 2 O, Sr, Ba, Zn and H 2 O were enriched, while Mn 3 O 4, Fe 2 O 3, CaO, MgO, P, B and CO 2 were leached from the ore during supergene alteration. Results {{of this study suggest that}} the development of Post African I erosional surface may have taken place 45 Ma ago. The bottom of the weathering profile gives a well-defined peak at ca. 5 Ma that may possible coincide with the development of Post African II erosional surface. The major characteristics of the alteration process of the unaltered Mamatwan-type ore to supergene altered <b>braunite</b> lutite can be summarized as follow: • Leaching of Mn carbonates and Mn 2 +/Mn 3 +-oxides. • Formation of Mn 4 +-oxyhydroxides and quartz. • Decrease in relative density of the ore. • Increase in porosity of the ore. • Leaching of Mn 3 O 4, Fe 2 O 3, CaO, MgO, P, B, CO 2. • Enrichment of Na 2 O, K 2 O, Sr, Ba, Zn, H 2 O.

40|$|Urucum {{is one of}} the {{youngest}} banded iron-formations (BIFs) yet its exact age remains uncertain. ^(40) Ar/^(39) Ar geochronology on late-diagenetic to early metamorphic cryptomelane from the Urucum sequence reveals a minimum depositional age of 587 ± 7 Ma. Metamorphic <b>braunite</b> age spectra yield flat segments defining apparent ages of 547 ± 3 Ma to 513 ± 4 Ma, interpreted as recrystallization or cooling ages. Metamorphic muscovite grains from a meta-arkose interbedded with the BIF yield reproducible plateau ages of 513 ± 3 Ma. Cryptomelane ages are interpreted to record the minimum timing of the extensional tectonic events that generated the graben systems at the southeastern border of the Amazon craton, including the Chiquitos-Tucavaca aulacogen and the Jacadigo Basin, which hosts the Urucum banded iron-formation. Structurally controlled hydrothermal alteration resulted in crystallization of <b>braunite</b> and muscovite during the interval between 547 and 513 Ma coeval with post-collisional decompression that resulted in granite emplacement (e. g., São Vicente Granite) in the Paraguay Belt. Subsequent uplift and erosion of the Precambrian sequence possibly succeeded metamorphism. A chemically distinct cryptomelane generation identified in surface samples yield ca. 60 Ma results. These ages provide evidence for supergene recrystallization after exhumation in the Mesozoic/Cenozoic. ^(40) Ar/^(39) Ar systematics implies that the oldest cryptomelane samples experienced Ar-loss probably via thermally induced diffusion. This suggests that the Urucum BIF was buried and heated to significant temperatures in the late Proterozoic, consistent with present mineralogy and isotopic composition that do not reflect the original characteristics of the depositional environment...|$|E
