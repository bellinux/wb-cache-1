5|$|Supervision of {{the mission}} was {{assigned}} to the German Ambassador to Turkey, Hans von Wangenheim, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was ill, his functions were delegated to Prince zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Following Wangenheim's death in 1915, Count von Wolff-Metternich was designated his successor. He had little contact with the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose {{made his}} {{debut in the}} English County Championship for Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 1989—the club signed him for the 1988 season <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was playing in the West Indies touring team, he was {{unavailable}} that year. He took a wicket with his first delivery for the club, but was not particularly successful {{in the first part}} of the season; he settled down later and took 28 first-class wickets at 28.39 for Northamptonshire in nine games.|$|E

5|$|Nuyts {{acquired}} some notoriety while Governor for apparently taking native {{women to}} his bed, {{and having a}} translator hide under the bed to interpret his pillow-talk. He was also accused of profiting from private trade, something which was forbidden under company rules. Some sources claim that he officially married a native Formosan woman during this time, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was still legally married to his first wife Cornelia, this seems unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{had decided}} on a mixed {{transport}} strategy, relying on contributions from dogs, motor sledges and ponies. He appointed Cecil Meares {{to take charge of}} the dog teams, and recruited Shackleton's former motor specialist, Bernard Day, to run the motor sledges. Oates would {{be in charge of the}} ponies, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could not join the expedition until May 1910, Scott instructed Meares, who knew nothing of horses, to buy them—with unfortunate consequences for their quality and performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{duties of}} the {{principal}} secretary were not defined formally, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> handled all royal correspondence and determined the agenda of council meetings, he could wield great influence in all matters of policy and in every field of government, both foreign and domestic. During his term of office, Walsingham supported the use of England's maritime power to open new trade routes and explore the New World, and {{was at the heart}} of international affairs. He was involved directly with English policy towards Spain, the Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland and France, and embarked on several diplomatic missions to neighbouring European states.|$|E

5|$|The {{publisher}} was Clark Publishing Company for {{the first}} two issues. The editor for those issues was Raymond Palmer, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was hospitalized much of the work was done by Bea Mahaffey. As a result, these two issues are sometimes indexed with Mahaffey as editor. With the third issue, Greenleaf Publishing Company became the publisher and William Hamling took over as editor, a position he retained throughout the magazine's life.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, William Gibbs and {{his wife}} Matilda Blanche Crawley-Boevey (known as Blanche), principally lived in London, for {{the greater part of}} his {{marriage}} at 16 Hyde Park Gardens, which the family owned until Blanche's death. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> travelled regularly on business to the Port of Bristol he required a residence in the area; thus it was, in 1843, he came to buy Tyntes Place, which he subsequently renamed Tyntesfield. Within a few years of making his purchase, Gibbs began a major program of rebuilding and enlarging of the mansion.|$|E

5|$|While Ellis {{attended}} LAHC, various Major League Baseball teams {{attempted to}} sign {{him to a}} professional contract, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> heard the Pittsburgh Pirates gave out signing bonuses of $60,000, he held out until the Pirates made him an offer. He was arrested for stealing a car, and given probation. Brewer, working as a scout for the Pirates, signed Ellis to the Pirates; {{as a result of}} the arrest, the Pirates offered Ellis $500 a month and a $2,500 signing bonus.|$|E
5|$|While Marge and the {{children}} are enjoying dinner, Homer begins pursuing the family with an axe and Bart uses his powers to call Willie, who immediately runs to the family's rescue, abandoning his portable television in the snow in the process. Homer kills him by striking {{him in the back}} with the axe. Homer pursues his family outside <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is about to kill them, Lisa discovers Willie's abandoned television. Homer's insanity gradually decreases and the family freezes in the snow as they are watching.|$|E
5|$|While leaving, Snake arrives to rob {{the desk}} clerk.

Homer then {{says he does not}} trust himself and asks Marge to throw the gun away herself. However, Marge sees a {{reflection}} of herself holding it in the trash can and decides to keep it.|$|E

5|$|Zane's {{signal leads}} Alan to a sawmill, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> explores it, {{he finds himself}} back in a setting of his city apartment. Zane appears, and tells Alan that it is himself—the maniacal figure on the televisions—that is keeping him in the Dark Place. Alan refuses {{to believe that he}} is {{trapping}} himself, but soon faces a monstrosity of several televisions, with the irrational Alan on them that tries to kill him. Alan is able to defeat the crazed version of himself, waking up back at the cabin in the lake, and realizes that he is still trapped.|$|E
5|$|A second war in Bernicia, {{probably}} in 1018, was more successful. The Battle of Carham, by the River Tweed, {{was a victory}} for the Scots led by Malcolm II and the men of Strathclyde led by their king, Owen the Bald. By this time Earl Uchtred may have been dead, and Eiríkr Hákonarson was appointed Earl of Northumbria by his brother-in-law Cnut the Great, although his authority seems to have been limited to the south, the former kingdom of Deira, and he took no action against the Scots so far as is known. The work De obsessione Dunelmi (The siege of Durham, associated with Symeon of Durham) claims that Uchtred's brother Eadwulf Cudel surrendered Lothian to Malcolm II, presumably {{in the aftermath of the}} defeat at Carham. This is likely to have been the lands between Dunbar and the Tweed as other parts of Lothian had been under Scots control before this time. It has been suggested that Cnut received tribute from the Scots for Lothian, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had likely received none from the Bernician Earls this is not very probable.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} to swing Vindictive broadside {{on into the}} channel mouth, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel. The damaged propeller made this maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entranceway.|$|E

5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E
5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{made up his}} mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the law}} on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E
5|$|At the Hyrule Castle garden, Link meets Princess Zelda, who {{believes}} Ganondorf, {{king of the}} Gerudo, is seeking the Triforce, a holy relic that gives its holder godlike power. Zelda asks Link to obtain the three Spiritual Stones so he can enter the Sacred Realm and claim the Triforce before Ganondorf reaches it. Link collects the other two stones: the first from Darunia, leader of the Gorons, and the second from Ruto, princess of the Zoras. Link returns to Hyrule Castle, where he sees Ganondorf chase Zelda and her caretaker Impa on horseback, and unsuccessfully attempts to stop him. Inside the Temple of Time, he uses the Ocarina of Time, a gift from Zelda, and the Spiritual Stones {{to open the door}} to the Sacred Realm. There he finds the Master Sword, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> pulls it from its pedestal, Ganondorf appears and claims the Triforce.|$|E
