We conducted a sur-vey of 231 small business owners in midsize cities in the northeastern and midwestern United States. Of the total sample, 118 are businesses in which two or more family members are employed. This study examines both the reported conflict and the positives of family-member involvement. The find-ings indicate that there is no overall difference in business-related goals be-tween the two groups, but that owners of <b>businesses</b> <b>with</b> family participation do experience significantly more business-family conflict. The study also con-cludes that this conflict is generally well managed and does not interfere <b>with</b> <b>business</b> objectives. In fact, the authors conclude that owners of <b>businesses</b> <b>with</b> family participation see the involvement of family members as a posi-tive. Managerial implications and research suggestions are also discussed...|$|R
