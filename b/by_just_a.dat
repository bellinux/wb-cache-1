5|$|Satellite {{measurements}} made in 1999 {{with the}} Wide Field Infrared Explorer {{showed that the}} brightness of Altair fluctuates slightly, varying <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few thousandths of a magnitude with several different periods less than 2 hours. As a result, it was identified in 2005 as a Delta Scuti variable star. Its light curve can be approximated by adding together a number of sine waves, with periods that range between 0.8 and 1.5 hours. It is a weak source of coronal X-ray emission, with the most active sources of emission being located near the star's equator. This activity {{may be due to}} convection cells forming at the cooler equator.|$|E
5|$|In 1294, Wales {{broke out}} in {{rebellion}} led by Madog ap Llywelyn, prince of Wales. As Caernarfon was the centre of administration in Gwynedd and a symbol of English power, it was targeted by the Welsh. Madog's forces captured the town in September, {{and in the process}} heavily damaged the town walls. The castle was defended <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> ditch and a temporary barricade. It was quickly taken and anything flammable was set alight. Fire raged across Caernarfon, leaving destruction in its wake. In the summer of 1295, the English moved to retake Caernarfon. By November the same year, the English began refortifying the town. Rebuilding the town walls was a high priority, and £1,195 (nearly half the sum initially spent on the walls) was spent on completing the job two months ahead of schedule. Attention then shifted to the castle and on finishing the work that had halted in 1292. Once the rebellion was put down, Edward began building Beaumaris Castle on the Isle of Anglesey. The work was overseen by James of Saint George; as a result, Walter of Hereford took over as master mason for the new phase of construction. By the end of 1301, a further £4,500 had been spent on the work with the focus of work on the northern wall and towers. The accounts between November 1301 and September 1304 are missing, possibly because there was a hiatus in work while labour moved north to help out with England's war against Scotland. Records show that Walter of Hereford had left Caernarfon and was in Carlisle in October 1300; he remained occupied with the Scottish wars until the autumn of 1304 when building at Caernarfon resumed. Walter died in 1309 and his immediate subordinate, Henry of Ellerton, took over the position of master mason. Construction continued at a steady rate until 1330.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} season, Wales {{completed}} their first full Home Nations Championship; Gould played as the lone centre {{in all three}} games. It was a fairly successful Championship for the Welsh, with a draw, a win and a loss, leaving them second in the table. Of note during the series was Bob Gould's captaincy in the second match, against Scotland, and Gould's first ever international dropped goal – which gave Wales a win over Ireland and made up for him missing a dropped goal <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> yard in their draw against England. Due to work commitments, Gould only played {{one of the two}} Wales games of the 1888 Home Nations Championship, in the country's first victory over Scotland, thanks to a single try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins. In the second game, played away to Ireland, George Bowen was given the centre position in the last match Wales would play with a three threequarter system. Gould then missed the first Welsh international against an overseas touring side, when the New Zealand Natives were beaten at St. Helen's in Swansea, and was still absent two months later for the opening game of the 1889 Championship. Gould returned in time for the clash with Ireland where he was given the captaincy and played alongside Llanelli centre Tom Morgan. Gould lost his first match as captain, losing by two tries to nil at home – this was the first of 18 caps he earned leading his country.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Burmese Army's {{performance}} vis-a-vis European forces grew {{worse as}} the technology gap grew wider.

25|$|Seven four-car trains {{operated}} the line (six off-peak, seven during peak hours when Shoreditch was open). Off peak, train seven became the spare. The line operated {{some of the}} shortest trains on the network, necessitated by short platforms. The small number of trains made the line particularly sensitive to disruption caused by vandalism, train faults or staff shortages. Sometimes in the early 2000s only two trains were running. Trains were operated <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> driver: the decision to withdraw the guards prompted an unsuccessful strike by the National Union of Railwaymen in May 1985.|$|E
25|$|The eight centenary {{cars are}} single deck, one-man {{operated}} trams with flat ends and a revised door layout, {{giving them a}} more bus-like appearance compared to previous tramcar designs. They were numbered 641–648 (648 originally numbered 651) and have a capacity of 52 passengers (of which 16 are standing). The position of the doors means {{that they can be}} operated <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> driver, as opposed to having a crew of two or three on board. This was useful during low season and early morning/late night services when there was little demand, as it allowed the network to keep labour costs down.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 McCarthy's side fell to Tipperary in the Munster semi-final. The qualifiers {{proved a}} happy hunting ground for Waterford as they won {{every one of}} their games in the round robin and topped the group. The men from the Deise later gained revenge on Tipp in the All-Ireland quarter-final before lining out against Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final. Once again the game {{proved to be an}} {{exciting}} and close affair, with neither side gaining any huge lead. Cork led with just seconds remaining in the game when Donal Óg Cusack, Cork's goalkeeper, saved a '65' from going over the bar. The sliothar was subsequently cleared, and Cork won the game <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> single point. After the game McCarthy came in for some criticism, however, the players insisted that he was the men to lead them again for another season.|$|E

25|$|When Fignon left Guimard in 1992, Bjarne Riis {{contacted}} fellow Danish rider Rolf Sørensen, who {{got him a}} job as a rider for Italian team Ariostea under sporting director Giancarlo Ferretti.

He finished 5th place overall, which was the best Danish result in Tour history at the time, bettering former World Champion Leif Mortensen's 6th-place finish in the 1971 Tour de France. Riis was ill during the 1994 Tour de France but went on a break-away and then racing solo for the last 30km of the day.

25|$|Venezuelan {{consumers}} mainly had {{negative feelings}} toward the fingerprint rationing system, stating that it created longer lines; especially when fingerprint machines malfunctioned, {{and that the}} system does nothing to relieve shortages because it only overlooks the large economic changes that the country needed to make. Following {{the announcement of the}} fingerprint system, protests broke out in multiple cities in Venezuela denouncing the proposed move. The MUD opposition coalition called on Venezuelans to reject the new fingerprinting system and called on supporters to hold a nationwide cacerolazo that were primarily heard in traditionally government opposing areas. Students in Zulia state also demonstrated against the proposed system. Lorenzo Mendoza, the president of Empresas Polar, Venezuela's largest food producer, expressed his disagreement with the proposed system, saying it would penalize 28 million Venezuelans for the smuggling carried out <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few. Days after the announcement, the Venezuelan government scaled back its plans on implementing the new system, saying the system is now voluntary and is only for 23 basic goods.|$|E
25|$|The besiegers, {{irritated by}} the {{obstruction}} to their works, decided to storm the ramparts even exposed to enemy fire, {{taking advantage of}} their numerical superiority.

The following night, Frederick Henry in person led {{an assault on the}} ravelin which protected the gate of Mechelen, guarded <b>by</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> handful of Irish. Despite the initial success of the attack, the Irish, aided by some Germans and bourgeois, managed to reject Frederick Henry inflicting him serious losses. Much of the failure was caused {{by the fact that the}} maneuvers of his army were being observed from a well-fortified tower, situated between the gates of Mechelen and Vilvoorde, popularly called Verlooren-Kost. This tower, besides as artillery position, served as look-out to Baron of Grobbendonck.
