40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} 21 kJ m− 2 d− 1 of <b>biologically</b> <b>effective</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>{{radiation}}</b> (UV-BBE) radiation on plant growth, chlorophyll and iron contents, and on iron distribution between root symplastic and extraplasmatic compartments was evaluated in {{10 days old}} maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings grown in nutrient solution. Furthermore, owing {{to the ability of}} light to interfere with the redox status of iron complexes, the effect of illumination of the root environment was also studied. The results showed that UV-B radiation had no significant effect on plant growth, whereas illumination of the root environment decreased leaf and root biomass production, regardless of the UV-B radiance. Exposure of plants to UV-B radiation increased both chlorophyll and leaf and root iron contents, in both plants with illuminated and darkened roots. The iron content was much lower in leaves than in roots, where it was mainly located in the extraplasmatic compartment. Illumination of the root environment resulted in higher root iron contents, but this increase was mainly due to the extraplasmatic fraction...|$|R

Variation in manikin topography has been modelled for three dimensional visualisation of the received <b>biologically</b> <b>effective</b> solar UV exposure to the face, neck, arms, hands and legs. Exposures to each of the modelled regions have been extensively measured at specific manikin sites using polysulphone dosimeters. The measurement sites allow the formation of a network of contours over the body to display <b>biologically</b> <b>effective</b> solar UV exposure relative to the incident horizontal plane <b>biologically</b> <b>effective</b> solar UV irradiance. Contour mesh functions have been developed for each body part that are consequently weighted to surface topography, providing a method for the estimation of biologically weighted incident solar UV irradiance across exposed body areas that minimises uncertainty due to exposure interpolation between widely spaced dosimeter sites.

Exposure models for clear sky conditions and a solar zenith angle range of 30 o- 50 o have been developed.

The extraterrestrial solar UV radiation ranges over the whole spectrum from vacuum-UV (λ< 200 nm) to UVA (315 nm<λ< 400 nm), which causes photolesions (photoproducts) in the nucleic acids/their components either by photoionization or excitation. However, these wavelengths cause not only photolesions but in a wavelength-dependent efficiency the reversion of some photolesions, too.

The LOOH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) concentrations of these plant tissues were assessed with the FOX and iodometric assays for the former and a modified TBARS assay for the latter. There was generally good agreement between the FOX and iodometric methods both prior to and following the UV exposure. However, the iodometric assay appeared to have some difficulty in consistently quantifying lower LOOH levels (< 11 3 ̆bcM), whereas the FOX assay measured LOOH concentrations as low as 5 3 ̆bcM. All tissues exhibited UV-induced increases in TBARS, indicating a marked degree of cellular oxidation in the exposed tissue segments. Compared with the iodometric assay, the FOX method consistently generated less variable LOOH values. The presence of authentic linoleic acid 2 ̆ 212 OOHs in spiked avocado and spinach samples (11 3 ̆bcM) was identified with liquid chromatography 2 ̆ 212 mass spectrometry techniques, which validated corresponding FOX assay results. The FOX method is inexpensive, is not sensitive to ambient O 2 or light levels, and can rapidly generate LOOH measurements.

Evidence acquisitionStudies assessing MCCW and MM interventions to prevent skin cancer by reducing <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure were evaluated using Community Guide systematic review methods. Relevant studies published between 1966 and 2013 were included and analyzed for this review. Evidence synthesisSeven studies evaluating the effectiveness of MCCW interventions showed a median increase in sunscreen use of 10. 8 percentage points (interquartile interval= 7. 3, 23. 2); a small decrease in <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure; a decrease in indoor tanning device use of 4. 0 percentage points (95 % CI= 2. 5, 5. 5); and mixed results for other protective behaviors. Four studies evaluating the effectiveness of MM interventions found that they generally led to improved ultraviolet protection behaviors among children and adults.
