5000|$|The G3's {{exterior}} {{incorporates a}} scratch-resistant [...] "metallic skin"—consisting of polycarbonate finished {{to look and}} feel like brushed metal; despite being branded as [...] "metallic", the G3's exterior does not use actual metal. The finishing is intended primarily to improve grip, {{and to make the}} rear casing less susceptible to fingerprint smudging. The G3 is available in black, white, gold, <b>burgundy,</b> and <b>violet</b> color finishes. Design elements from the G2 are retained by the G3, such as its rear-mounted volume and power buttons. In comparison to the G2, the buttons were given a flatter design with a new, rounded shape. The G3 features a 5.5 in, 1440p quad HD IPS LCD display—the first major [...] "global" [...] smartphone to use such a display. As with the G2, the G3 was designed with minimal screen bezels to ensure a compact form.|$|R
50|$|While {{exhibited}} at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, Uklanski's abstract sculpture Untitled (Story of the Eye) almost stole the viewers' attention from his photography works that were hung on the walls around it. Made of multiple layers of fiber-reactive dyed oxidized jute and hemp textile, cotton and nylon rope, polyester batting, resin, aluminum, and steel. The piece peers over its viewers at 12 feet in height. The work doesn't look like a rendition of an eye immediately, until the viewer notices the overlapping bright orange and white weaved centerpiece, hanging by rope of the same colors. Wrapped and sculpted around the dangling pupil are larger pieces of material fashioned together with a thicker rope. Instead of continuing the use of bright colors, a deep <b>burgundy,</b> dark <b>violet,</b> grey, and silver tinged blue material are threaded through one another, creating an enormous eye muscle. Towards {{the bottom of the}} piece, each different colored fabric, except the burgundy, transform into braided tassels with fringe at the end- a couple of which are orange from the pupil's tassels- which hang heavy, dragged down by gravity. Uklanski's artistic choices with this piece demonstrate his Modernism style and his appreciation for visual pleasure, ensuring that looking upon the sculpture is easy, following the lines of the work create a soft and light looking structure, even though the color and materials themselves are quite the opposite. In fact, due to the expressive use of color and dramatic draping of material one might be reminded of stage designs by Polish artists in the 50's and 60's.|$|R
