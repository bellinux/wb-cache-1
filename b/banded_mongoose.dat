[...] <b>Banded</b> <b>mongoose</b> (Mungos mungo) groups vocalize more and inspect more scent samples in response to olfactory cues of neighbours than strangers. [...] It has been suggested that increased aggression towards neighbours is more common in social species with intense competition between neighbours, as opposed to reduced aggression towards neighbours typical for most solitary species.

During 2011 – 12, we screened <b>banded</b> <b>mongooses</b> (Mungos mungo) in the bTB highprevalence zone of the KNP for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex members. Fecal swabs, tracheal swabs, and tracheal lavages of 76 <b>banded</b> <b>mongooses</b> caught in cage traps within a 2 -km radius of Skukuza Rest Camp were submitted for Mycobacterium culture, isolation, and species identification. Lesions and lymph node samples collected from 12 animals at postmortem examination were submitted for culture and histopathology. In lung and lymph nodes of two <b>banded</b> <b>mongooses,</b> well demarcated, irregularly margined, gray-yellow nodules of up to 5 mm diameter were identified with either central necrosis or calcification, characterized on histopathology as caseating necrosis with epithelioid macrophages or necrogranuloma with calcified centre. No acid fast bacteria were identified with Ziehl– Neelsen stain. We isolated Mycobacterium bovis from lung, lymph node, and liver samples, as well as from tracheal lavages and tracheal swab from the same two <b>banded</b> <b>mongooses.</b> Blood samples were positive by ElephantTB STAT-PAKt Assay for 12 and Enferplexe TB Assay for five animals. Only the two <b>banded</b> <b>mongooses</b> positive on pathology and M. bovis culture were positive on both serologic assays.

50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>mongoose</b> {{is found}} in {{a large part of}} East, Southeast and South-Central Africa. There are also populations in the {{northern}} savannas of West Africa. The <b>banded</b> <b>mongoose</b> lives in savannas, open forests and grassland, especially near water, but also in dry, thorny bushland but not deserts. The species uses various types of dens for shelter, most commonly termite mounds. They will also live in rock shelters, thickets, gullies, and warrens under bushes. Mongooses prefer multi-entranced termitaria with open thicket, averaging 4 m from the nearest shelter, located in semi-closed woodland. In contrast to the den of the dwarf mongoose, <b>banded</b> <b>mongoose</b> dens are less dependent on vegetation cover and have more entrances. Banded mongooses live in larger groups than dwarf mongooses and this more entrances means more members have access to the den and ventilation. The development of agriculture in the continent has had a positive influence on the number of banded mongooses. The crops of the farmland serve as an extra food source.|$|E

40|$|Predation is a {{powerful}} selective force shaping the behaviour of prey animals. As a consequence, a variety of birds and mammals have developed referential and/or urgency-based alarm call systems. Since antipredator behaviour {{is likely to be}} costly, it should pay to attend to warning signals given by other species. Evidence that animals respond to heterospecific alarm calls is abundant. However, studies showing whether animals extract information on predator types or urgency levels from heterospecific alarms are rare. Using playback experiments, we investigated whether <b>banded</b> <b>mongooses,</b> Mungos mungo, respond to alarm calls of several sympatric plover species, Vanellus spp. and how mongooses respond to plover alarms that differ in their level of urgency. <b>Banded</b> <b>mongooses</b> responded to alarm calls of the three plover species tested. Even though the response intensity varied over a large scale, the responses to plover alarms did not differ between calls representing high and low urgency. Our results indicate that <b>banded</b> <b>mongooses</b> use heterospecific alarms for predator avoidance but do not use additional information provided in these signals. How commonly animals attend to and why in some cases animals do not attend to additional information provided by heterospecific alarms remains an open question and deserves further investigation...|$|R
