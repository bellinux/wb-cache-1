25|$|Its {{operations}} {{reached their}} zenith about 1904–1908, when it numbered over 2,000 members, including over 700 paramilitary personnel, {{and carried out}} over 2,500 operations. The organization had over 5,000 members {{at the height of}} its power. Afterwards it declined and was dissolved in 1911. Its goal was to create an armed resistance movement against the Imperial Russian authorities in partitioned Poland. Its most notable operations included the <b>Bloody</b> <b>Wednesday</b> of 15 August 1906; the failed assassination attempt against the Governor-General of Warsaw, Georgi Skalon, 18 August 1906; and Bezdany raid, a major train robbery, 26 September 1908.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 August, {{following}} {{the security forces}} raids on Cairo protest camps held by supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi, churches across Egypt came under frenzied attack Thursday as Morsi loyalists allegedly orchestrated nationwide assaults on Christian targets throughout the country. It's estimated {{that as many as}} 36 churches were [...] "completely" [...] devastated by fire across nine Egyptian governorates and many other churches were looted or stormed. Egypt's army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi pledged the military would cover the costs of restoration for all damaged churches. Morsi's Islamist backers also set dozens of police stations ablaze across Egypt and attempted to storm provincial governor offices following <b>Wednesday's</b> <b>bloody</b> crackdown. A group of Morsi supporters also set fire to the finance ministry building in Cairo's Nasr City district.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bloody</b> <b>Wednesday</b> (Krwawa środa) {{refers to}} the events of 15 August 1906 in the (Congress) Kingdom of Poland, where the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party (OB PPS) carried out a series of attacks on Russians, {{primarily}} police officers and informants. This took place {{in the context of the}} Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905-1907), and represented one of the biggest actions in the history of OB PPS.|$|E
50|$|The Avalanche-Red Wings brawl was a {{large-scale}} on-ice melee that occurred March 26, 1997, at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan, United States, between two National Hockey League rivals, the Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings. The brawl, {{which has been}} nicknamed <b>Bloody</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> Fight Night at the Joe and Brawl in Hockeytown, stemmed from a previous on-ice incident between the two teams during the 1996 Western Conference Finals.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} decades of Tsarist rule, many Siedlce activists (both Polish and Jewish) {{took part in the}} 1905 Revolution. After a series of attacks on Russians in all of Poland on <b>Bloody</b> <b>Wednesday</b> (15 August 1906) the Russian {{authorities}} organized a pogrom in Siedlce in reprisal on 8-10 September 1906, in which 26 Jews perished. In the wake of the First World War the town was affected by the Polish-Soviet War, being occupied by the Red Army in 1920 and taken over by the Polish Army in 1921.|$|E

The organization had over 5,000 members {{at the height of}} its power. Afterwards it declined and was dissolved in 1911.

50|$|Siedlce had a {{significant}} Jewish population (estimated at 10,000 to 64% out of 24,000 total (so about 15,000)). In {{the larger context of}} the widespread unrest it was the site of socialist and Polish patriotic agitation and demonstrations (organized by Polish Socialist Party and Jewish Bund), and the government desired to make a vivid response to the <b>Bloody</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> a series of attacks on government officials organized by PPS that took place barely a months earlier, and other similar events. On August 26 an OB PPS activist, disguised as a Jew, assassinated a Russian police captain in Siedlce. As many Jews took part in the protests, the Russian government saw the Siedlce as a ripe territory to show its force.|$|E
5000|$|The {{official}} story spun by Russian propaganda {{was that}} the events in Siedlce were triggered by [...] "revolutionaries", whose plot has been discovered and put down {{by the police and}} the army. Despite their leading role in the pogrom, some soldiers and policemen were recognized with medals or honorable mentions. OB PPS carried out a successful assassination of one of high-ranking Russian officials involved in organizing the Siedlce pogrom, Colonel Obruczew, in December of that year. Nonetheless, the fact that the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party (OB PPS), which organized the events of <b>Bloody</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> took no other significant action in response to the Siedlce pogrom, was, {{in the words of one}} of the PPS leaders, Józef Piłsudski, [...] "a moral defeat" [...] for OB PPS; further, it demonstrated to OB PPS that they had no power to stop the Russian military from carrying out such brutal demonstrations of force at any time and place of their choosing.|$|E
