5|$|When the war ended, Herring {{wished to}} return to Australia and see Mary before {{resuming}} his studies at the University of Oxford in October 1919. Mary wrote back pointing out the impracticality of this idea; while she would be disappointed not to see him, he should remain in England and complete his course at Oxford first. The university had awarded him a wartime Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1915; the Rhodes Scholarship Trust allowed him to resume his scholarship, and he studied for a <b>Bachelor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Law</b> (BCL) degree. Since it had been five years since he had been awarded his BA, he was entitled to a MA as well, and graduated with both degrees in July 1920.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} professionalism, {{the practice of law}} is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a bar association, bar council or law society. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a Bachelor of Laws, a <b>Bachelor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Law,</b> or a Juris Doctor degree. Higher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a Master of Laws, a Master of Legal Studies, a Bar Professional Training Course or a Doctor of Laws.), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment (being admitted to the bar). There are few titles of respect to signify famous lawyers, such as Esquire, to indicate barristers of greater dignity, and Doctor of law, to indicate a person who obtained a PhD in Law.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Bachelor</b> <b>of</b> laws (LL.B.) {{degree course}} was, initially, {{started as a}} two-year {{part-time}} course, teaching being conducted {{in the morning with}} ten teachers. In 1942, along with the morning, evening classes were also started. In 1944, the one-year Master of laws (LL.M.) degree course was introduced. In 1947, after Independence and partition of the country, the demand for the study of law increased. It was also time to look beyond the entrenched British model and restructure legal education {{to meet the demands of}} a now Independent India clamouring for equality in access to power, respect and knowledge. Lawyers played a major role in the struggle for freedom. They now had to be trained to create & use law as an instrument of social change and, as Nehru put it, to wipe a tear from every eye. In 1947, LL.B. was made a full-time course (classes being held both in the morning and evening) and new courses were added. LL.M. was made a whole time two-year course. Two new courses, namely, Certificate of Proficiency (<b>Law)</b> and <b>Bachelor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Laws</b> (B.C.L.) were introduced (later abolished in 1961 and 1966, respectively).|$|R

500|$|On 9 July 1740, {{after only}} {{a year and a}} half as a Bachelor of Arts student, Blackstone was {{admitted}} to study for a <b>Bachelor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Law</b> degree, civil law being the only legal area recognised by his university. This degree course was seven years long, the first two [...] "supposedly devoted to a broad course of reading in humane studies", which allowed him to study his own interests. On 20 November 1741 he was admitted to the Middle Temple, the first step on the road to becoming a barrister, but this imposed no obligations and simply allowed a legal career to be an option. At the time there was no proper legal education system, and Blackstone read (in his own time) Coke on Littleton, the works of Henry Finch, and related legal tracts.|$|E

50|$|Albert {{was born}} in McAlester, Oklahoma. Shortly after his birth {{his family moved to}} a small town just north of McAlester called Bugtussle. He {{was the son of a}} coal miner and farmer and grew up in a log cabin on his father's farm. In high school he excelled in debate, was student body president, and won the {{national}} high school oratorical contest, earning a trip to Europe. During this time he was an active member of his local Order of DeMolay chapter and is an inductee of the Order of DeMolay Hall of Fame. Albert later petitioned his local Masonic Lodge and became an active Freemason. He entered the University of Oklahoma in 1927. There, he majored in political science and won the National Oratorical Championship in 1928, receiving an all-expense-paid trip to Europe. He earned enough money to fund the rest of his undergraduate education.

500|$|Sir William Blackstone [...] (10 July 1723 – 14 February 1780) was an English jurist, {{judge and}} Tory {{politician}} {{of the eighteenth}} century. He is most noted for writing the Commentaries on the Laws of England. Born into a middle-class family in London, Blackstone was educated at Charterhouse School before matriculating at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1738. After switching to and completing a <b>Bachelor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Law</b> degree, he was made a Fellow of All Souls, Oxford on 2 November 1743, admitted to Middle Temple, and called to the Bar there in 1746. Following a slow start to {{his career as a}} barrister, Blackstone became heavily involved in university administration, becoming accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 and Senior Bursar in 1750. Blackstone is considered responsible for completing the Codrington Library and Warton Building, and simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college. On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and instead embarked on a series of lectures on English law, the first of their kind. These were massively successful, earning him a total of £453 (£ in [...] terms), and led to the publication of An Analysis of the Laws of England in 1756, which repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works.|$|E
