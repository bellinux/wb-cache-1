2500|$|The old {{man came}} back after walking a {{distance}} and praised Zhang Liang, [...] "This child can be taught!" [...] and asked Zhang Liang {{to meet him at}} the bridge again at dawn five days later. Zhang Liang was confused but agreed. Five days later, Zhang Liang rushed to the bridge at the stroke of dawn <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> was already waiting for him there. The old man chided him, [...] "How can you be late for a meeting with an elderly man? Come back again five days later!" [...] Zhang Liang tried his best to be punctual the second time <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> still arrived earlier than him, and he was scorned by the old man once more and told to return again five days later. The third time, Zhang Liang went to the bridge at midnight and waited until the old man appeared. This time, the old man was impressed with Zhang Liang's fortitude and humility, that he presented Zhang with a book, saying, [...] "You can become the tutor of a ruler after reading this book. Within ten years, the world will become chaotic. You can then use your knowledge from this book to bring peace and prosperity to the empire. Meet me again 13 years later. I'm the yellow rock at the foot of Mount Gucheng." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now there wasn't a knot {{which the}} riggers knew [...] <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> made it--and better too; [...] Nor there wasn't a sheet, or a lift, or a brace, [...] <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> knew its lead and place.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> only {{laughed a}} dreadful laugh, {{and made no}} reply.|$|E
60|$|Two of the gypsies leaped forward, {{stick in}} hand; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>man</b> present {{said a word}} or two to them, in their own dialect.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was a great}} {{compliment}} to his son, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> {{was troubled}} in his mind. [...] "What dost mean, keeper, by a year or so?" [...] he asked.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>men,</b> {{those who}} had mayhap more than once {{witnessed}} street rioting and the bloody reprisals that invariably followed open rebellion--they counselled prudence, an acceptance of what had come about, since the imperial decree had been fixed to the rostrum of the great Augustus, promising pardon for all delinquencies.|$|R
60|$|The Prince {{gathered}} up his reins; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> lurching forward, touched his stirrup.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> paid no {{attention}} to this lover's nonsense. It's doubtful whether he even heard.|$|E
60|$|Neither {{of the men}} made answer, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> turned an inquiring look at {{his young}} leader.|$|E
50|$|Late July 1948: Tayo {{says he is}} better, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> {{believe that}} he needs a {{stronger}} ceremony, so they refer him to Betonie. Tayo leaves {{for a while and}} meets Harley, Leroy and Helen Jean, who go as far away as San Fidel. He wakes {{up in the morning and}} vomits, and finally sees the horrible truth about his friends' drunkenness.|$|R
50|$|Tony Lock recalls {{himself as}} a child in the 1960s at the age of four, part of an aloof family in Trentham, Victoria. His father was an {{alcoholic}} agricultural labourer. Tony developed a warm attachment to his father's workmate and drinking friend Gordon Kerr, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> then sexually assaulted both Tony and his younger brother periodically ten years before his parents unexpectedly saw this for themselves and were forced to acknowledge what was happening.|$|R
60|$|And up {{the slope}} of Cooper’s Hill, just opposite, are {{gathered}} the wondering rustics and curious townsfolk, who have run from Staines, and none are quite sure what the bustle is about, but each one has a different version of the great event that {{they have come to}} see; and some say that much good to all the people will come from this day’s work; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> shake their heads, for they have heard such tales before.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Allen was in tears; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> {{having taken}} his stand, {{was going to}} keep it.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{tied the}} {{handkerchief}} tightly around his eyes, {{and then he}} was as blind as a bat.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> slept. Nor until Meller came at {{his usual}} hour of half-past twelve, was it {{known that he}} would never wake.|$|E
50|$|Charley, {{who insists}} on paying for his crimes by {{pleading}} guilty, arranges for Jim to get arrested for receiving the $800 from him, {{as it was}} part of the money he took from Mrs. Frazier. Jim is infuriated when he is thrown in a cell with Charley, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> explains that he needed time to tell Jim his life story so that he can write a book about him. Jim is released the next day and writes Charley's book, which becomes a best-seller.|$|R
50|$|Something is amiss: after {{telling him}} Sandra {{died in the}} crash, the {{professor}} launches into a defeatist diatribe. Startled by the mans uncharacteristic pessimism, Koenig realises {{the true nature of}} this experience—then is attacked by a gang of grotesque humanoids, all victims of horrific medical experiments—then is in the centre of a frigid void, strapped in an Eagle pilot seat and draped in cobwebs. He sees Bergman is running toward him, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> makes no headway. Koenig screams as he feels himself receding into non-existence...|$|R
6000|$|A growl of assent passed {{round the}} circle, {{and there was}} a general {{repetition}} of the words, [...] "It is not natural, comrade. Even in Spain," [...] one said, [...] "where they hate us like poison, the people don't leave their villages like this. The young <b>men</b> may go, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> and <b>the</b> women and children remain, and the priest is sure to stop. Here there is {{not so much as a}} fowl to be seen in the streets. The whole population is gone--man, woman, and child." ...|$|R
60|$|Middleton {{was glad}} to be silent; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> who had listened to their words, drew a little nigher, and {{continued}} the discourse.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Her letters come {{addressed}} 'Miss Helen McLaren.' What {{that means}} I can't say. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> spoke {{of her as}} his daughter." ...|$|E
60|$|Alf {{winked at}} 'im, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> drew hisself up {{and stared at}} 'im, and then 'e {{turned and walked away}} with his 'ead in the air.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> when <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> went to Fort Garry {{and visited}} his son, he stifled his pathetic feelings, and {{appeared}} before him {{with all the}} offended dignity of an injured member of the great clan McKay.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I was you," [...] he said, [...] "I'd {{go to the}} Eyengel." [...] We didn't {{know what}} this name meant, <b>but</b> as <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> said he would take us there we agreed to go.|$|R
50|$|Johnson, in turn, {{enjoys the}} {{compliment}} to his courage and, when Gollup next attacks him, retaliates. Gollup {{does not take}} this kind of violence seriously and thinks no less of Johnson, but he cannot have an employee who has struck him in public. Johnson is let go and leaves Fada. Meanwhile, a shortage of political officers means that Rudbeck must return. He immediately recommences his road-building. Rudbeck and his superior work out {{the extent to which}} he can finagle road-building funds from <b>the</b> accounts, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> warns Rudbeck that another scandal will destroy his career.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> started, {{and grew}} pale, and said, ‘Do you {{not know the}} oracle, my son, that you go so boldly through the town with but one sandal on?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{is that to}} you?' was the answer; 'mind {{your own}} business.' <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> only {{repeated}} his question, and Peppe, {{to get rid of}} him, exclaimed in anger, 'Dirt.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a {{great deal}} to be said on both sides," [...] March began, hoping to lead up through this {{generality}} to the fact of Lindau's death; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> went on: ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{generation}} of innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honour, Glory and England, {{went off to}} war {{to make the world}} safe for democracy. They were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals. Those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not <b>the</b> Germans, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> at home who had lied to them. They rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance.|$|R
60|$|He {{waited for}} a reply, <b>but</b> none came. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> with set face, walked on rapidly.|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} silence; <b>but</b> this time <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{made an effort}} to rise and ring the bell.|$|R
6000|$|... "We ARE ashamed," [...] said a girl. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{with the}} beard went on eating plum tart. Mrs. Durrant laughed and leant {{back in her}} chair, as if indulging him.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{would not}} reply. There came over his {{withered}} features that stony stare of resolute contempt which he evidently intended to maintain {{to the last}} in spite of torture and death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Got away {{about eight}} o'clock. Lawson went with them, though he's {{coming back to}} see you clear of this war. He's a crackerjack, is Lawson; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> has you marked for slaughter." ...|$|E
5000|$|While on a {{submarine}} patrol mission, his [...] "father" [...] orders an unauthorized and premature {{attack on a}} German submarine, (orders {{have been sent to}} break off the attack, the [...] "father" [...] does not convey <b>the</b> orders) <b>but</b> <b>the</b> youngster's bomb misses and the submarine fires back, hitting the airship. Trumpet takes over the controls and sinks <b>the</b> submarine, <b>but</b> Weaver faces a court-martial for disobeying orders <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> takes <b>the</b> blame for his actions. Young Weaver is awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, he gives the DFC ribbon to his [...] "father." [...] Leaving Lakehurst, young Weaver attends pilots training at NAS Pensacola.|$|R
60|$|The villain, by the way, {{has never}} a penny to bless himself with, and cannot even pay his own debts, let alone helping anybody else {{out of a}} scrape. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> good <b>old</b> <b>man</b> does not think of this.|$|R
60|$|That night, as he {{came home}} {{carrying}} his nets over his shoulder, whom should he meet <b>but</b> <b>the</b> little <b>old</b> <b>man</b> in gray, with the white beard and the black cap {{on his head and}} the long staff in his hand.|$|R
