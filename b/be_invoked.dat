5|$|Utmost {{necessity}} may <b>be</b> <b>invoked</b> {{where an}} interest {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may <b>be</b> <b>invoked</b> only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E

To move units, players can shift the mouse to select units on the main map, move to the unit menu to select an action, {{and then back to}} the main map or minimap to specify the target area; but shortcut keys can eliminate the middle mouse action in this cycle.|$|E

5|$|In Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Miller and his co-authors {{tried to}} explain through an artificial-intelligence {{computational}} perspective how animals plan and act. This was a radical break from behaviorism which explained behavior as a set or sequence of stimulus-response actions. The authors introduced a planning element controlling such actions. They saw all plans as being executed based on input using a stored or inherited information of the environment (called the image), and using a strategy called test-operate-test-exit (TOTE). The image was essentially a stored memory of all past context, akin to Tolman's cognitive map. The TOTE strategy, in its initial test phase, compared the input against the image; if there was incongruity the operate function attempted to reduce it. This cycle would be repeated till the incongruity vanished, and then the exit function would <b>be</b> <b>invoked,</b> passing control to another TOTE unit in a hierarchically arranged scheme.|$|E
5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under a dim light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would <b>be</b> <b>invoked,</b> with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E

25|$|Accelerators are {{a form of}} selection-based search {{which allow}} a user to invoke an online service from any other page using only the mouse. Actions such as {{selecting}} the text or other objects will give users access to the usable Accelerator services (such as blogging with the selected text, or viewing a map of a selected geographical location), which can then <b>be</b> <b>invoked</b> with the selected object. According to Microsoft, Accelerators eliminate the need to copy and paste content between web pages. IE8 specifies an XML-based encoding which allows a web application or web service to <b>be</b> <b>invoked</b> as an Accelerator service. How the service will <b>be</b> <b>invoked</b> and for what categories of content it will show up are specified in the XML file. Similarities have been drawn between Accelerators and the controversial Smart tags feature experimented with in the IE 6 Beta but withdrawn after criticism (though later included in MS Office).|$|E

25|$|A common {{situation}} in which noninertial reference frames are useful is when the reference frame is rotating. Because such rotational motion is non-inertial, due to the acceleration present in any rotational motion, a fictitious force can always <b>be</b> <b>invoked</b> by using a rotational frame of reference. Despite this complication, the use of fictitious forces often simplifies the calculations involved.|$|E
