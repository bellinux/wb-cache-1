5|$|Angel is a {{proposed}} {{station on the}} Crossrail 2 (Chelsea-Hackney line) project, providing an interchange between Crossrail 2 and the Northern Line. Depending on the route constructed, it would be between King's Cross St. Pancras and Dalston Junction or Hackney Central. It was officially safeguarded {{as part of the}} route in 2007, although there had been proposals for a route for some time previously and safeguarding had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> since 1991.|$|E

5|$|Eventually {{a little}} after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags was supposed to have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> {{that are designed to}} prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} the start of the 2014–15 season, Sakic was given the title of general manager while Sherman was demoted to {{assistant}} general manager, thus formalizing the de facto arrangement that had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> since 2013. Despite the front office changes, the Avalanche failed to qualify for the 2015 playoffs after finishing with a record of 39–31–12, resulting in a seventh-place finish in the Central Division.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles, which had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> since the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to {{maintain}} an air force. After the 1926 signing of the Kellogg–Briand Pact, police aircraft were permitted. Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the Luftwaffe was formally acknowledged, with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for a route {{avoiding}} Central London had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> {{since the}} early 20th century due to increasing levels of traffic. In 1910, the London Traffic Division of the Board of Trade had built up schemes for new roads, including what became the North Circular Road, {{which was designed to}} skirt the extent of urban development along suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> since 2007 when {{graduate}} endowments were abolished. Labour's education spokesperson Rhona Brankin criticised the Scottish system {{for failing to}} address student poverty. Scotland has fewer disadvantaged students than England, Wales or Northern Ireland and disadvantaged students receive around £560 a year less in financial support {{than their counterparts in}} England do.|$|E

5|$|A mayor-council {{government}} has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in Tulsa since 1989 {{when the city}} converted from a city commission government deemed wasteful and less efficient. Since the change, Tulsa mayors have been given more power in accordance with a strong mayoral system and have greater control of a more consolidated array of governmental branches. Plurality voting is used to elect mayors, who serve a term in office of four years. The present mayor of Tulsa is Republican G. T. Bynum who won the 2016 mayoral election and took office on December 5, 2016. Another Tulsa political figure, Jim Inhofe, who now represents Oklahoma in the United States Senate, served as the mayor of Tulsa early in his political career.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel {{as they had}} in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{his first}} term, Rosas was {{generally}} credited with having staved off political and financial instability, but he faced increased opposition in the House of Representatives. All members of the House were Federalists, as Rosas had restored the legislature that had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> under Dorrego, and which had subsequently been dissolved by Lavalle. A liberal Federalist faction, which accepted dictatorship as a temporary necessity, called for the adoption of a constitution. Rosas was unwilling to govern constrained by a constitutional framework and only grudgingly relinquished his dictatorial powers. His term of office ended soon after, on 5 December 1832.|$|E

5|$|Finally, at 8:00 am., some of Frederick's army {{emerged from}} the woods, with most of Generalleutnant Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz's cavalry {{and the rest of}} his artillery; a short time later, the rest of the Prussians {{emerged from the}} woods, and the Russians {{realized}} it was not a scouting party, but the main army. The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest. Finck's artillery park had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> since dawn and, at 11:30 am, Moller initiated bombardment of the Russian position from the northern and northeastern ends of the Russian line (now the Russian left). In error, the Russian artillery had faced their batteries to the meadows beyond the Mühlberge, not the ravine, and had to be reset. For 30 minutes, the two sides bombarded each other.|$|E
5|$|In Granville, NY22 was {{originally}} routed on Quaker, Main, and North streets. It was rerouted {{in the mid-1960s}} to bypass Granville on a new highway west of the village. NY149 was then extended northward along NY22's former routing to the junction of Main and North streets in Granville. From there, it continued eastward on Main Street to reach the Vermont state line, where it connected to VT30B, a spur route of VT30 that had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> since 1935. Vermont renumbered VT30B to VT149 {{at this time to}} match the highway it now connected to in New York.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{many of the}} large country estates in the area, with their mansions and {{associated}} grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting haphazard housing development and small farms. By {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 Crawley had grown into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area and those passing through on the A23 London–Brighton road. Three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for 50years. An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This was a private concern until the Second World War when it was claimed by the Royal Air Force.|$|E

Stafford was the third Premier of New Zealand. William Fox then formed the second Fox Ministry, which <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> from 12 July 1861 to 6 August 1862. Fox had previously been the Premier under the second administration. Alfred Domett, the fourth Premier, led the fifth administration, the Domett Ministry.

5|$|Many {{people in}} China {{and other parts}} of Asia have a belief that various tiger parts have {{medicinal}} properties, including as pain killers and aphrodisiacs. There is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs. The use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical drugs in China is already banned, and the government has made some offences in connection with tiger poaching punishable by death. Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and a domestic trade ban has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in China since 1993.|$|E
5|$|Much {{criticism}} {{focused on}} the role of human error in the collision; once the engineer had forgotten (or missed) the approach signal there was no automatic system to prevent the collision. The NTSB noted that had a positive train control system <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> on the Metropolitan Subdivision the collision would have been less likely: the system would have detected MARC #286's unauthorized speed and stopped the train. The NTSB also strongly criticized CSX and the Federal Transit Administration for the removal of a signal between Kensington and Georgetown Junction as part of capacity improvements on the Metropolitan Subdivision. The NTSB argued that having this signal after Kensington would have reduced the likelihood of the sort of human error which caused the crash, and in the NTSB's view CSX and the FTA did not properly assess the effects of removing the signal.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{recession}} of the 1990s, downtown Albany was home to four Fortune 500 companies. After the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton, the political environment changes. Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led {{to a lack of}} interest in city politics. The election of Gerald Jennings was a surprise, and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement at the end of 2013. His tenure essentially ended the political machine that had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> since the 1920s.|$|E
