5|$|Early plans also {{included}} a northsouth freeway {{on each side of}} the Los Angeles Central Business District, splitting at the merge of the Harbor Parkway (Harbor Freeway) and Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway (Pasadena Freeway) and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. Initially known as the East <b>By-Pass</b> and West <b>By-Pass,</b> the latter later became part of the Harbor Parkway, while the former remained as a separate route roughly along Main Street. The state legislature added the East <b>By-Pass</b> to the state highway system in 1947 as Route 222. The Los Angeles City Planning Commission approved a revised master plan in mid-1955, based on various studied that had been made. A new Industrial Freeway replaced the Terminal Island Freeway and Alamitos Parkway between Terminal Island and downtown Los Angeles, where it then continued north along the former East <b>By-Pass</b> (which was not kept south of the Santa Monica Freeway) and the southern part of the Riverside Parkway to the interchange of the Glendale Freeway and Golden State Freeway (which had replaced the rest of the Riverside Parkway). The Industrial Freeway south of the Santa Monica Freeway became Route 270 in 1959, but the ex-Riverside Parkway piece north of the Arroyo Seco Parkway never became a state highway.|$|E
5|$|Land use is mixed. The land to {{the extreme}} north {{adjacent}} to the river is mostly industrial, split by the Felling <b>By-Pass.</b> The land south of the <b>By-Pass</b> towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates. Centrally the land is mixed between residential properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square. At High Felling, land use is predominantly residential but there is around 25% green-space, including a park, cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street.|$|E
5|$|Other than Carisbrook, the suburb's main {{sports ground}} is Bathgate Park, which {{lies at the}} border of Caversham and South Dunedin in the southeast. There are several open areas of {{recreation}} ground and parkland, notably Kew Park at Forbury Corner and Sidey Park and adjacent parkland along the northern flank of the <b>by-pass,</b> and there are tennis courts close to Kew Park on Thorn Street, and a croquet club between South Road and the Caversham <b>by-pass.</b> Kew Park {{is also home to}} one of the area's most prominent pétanque clubs.|$|E
40|$|Using {{data from}} a survey of urban {{residents}} of Dhaka, Bangladesh, the phenomenon of <b>by-passing</b> national health care resources in favor of foreign ones has been analyzed. The results clearly suggest {{that the incidence of}} national health care <b>by-passing</b> is relatively widespread, particularly among the wealthy residents of Dhaka. The findings of this study show that the health care system in Bangladesh is costly, some specialized care is not available, and the quality of services obtained in foreign countries is perceived as better than what is available nationally. While complete prevention of national health care <b>by-passing</b> is not possible, improvement in health care services available within Bangladesh will help in decreasing the incidence of <b>by-passing.</b> National health care <b>by-passing</b> Medical treatment Quality of services Professional Nonprofessional Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|In a well‐structured soil at {{or close}} to pedal saturation, {{rainfall}} intensity in excess of pedal Ksat is predicted to result in <b>by‐passing</b> flow through well connected structural voids. The depth of solute penetration (tracer dye and nitrate) under <b>by‐passing</b> flow has been predicted by Df=(P‐Cp) /θf, where Df is the depth of penetration of {{the leading edge of}} solute in <b>by‐passing</b> flow, P is gross precipitation, Cp is the input volume transmitted through the soil peds and θf is the operational volumetric moisture content in <b>by‐passing.</b> The timing of surface applied nitrate arrival at a channel bank is demonstrated to be related to <b>by‐passing</b> flow rather than uniform displacement. The relationship between nitrate load in soil drainage waters (Y, mg s‐ 1) and water discharge (X, dm 3 s− 1) was Y∼ 6 X after nitrate fertilizer application but subsequently declined to Y 0. 5 X It is deduced that the decline resulted from inefficient leaching under <b>by‐passing</b> conditions once surface applied nitrate had become relocated within the soil peds...|$|R

5|$|The routes {{around the}} city of Preston, {{including}} the <b>by-pass</b> {{as part of the}} modern day M6 motorway, are recognised as being some of the most congested in the UK, with traffic to and from Preston being labelled amongst the country's top 25 most congested routes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>by-pass</b> has {{undergone}} two separate lane-widening schemes during its existence, firstly in 1966 {{when it was}} widened to three lanes, then in the 1990s to expand it to four lanes in each direction. The latter upgrade was significant enough to require reconstruction of the entire route including all bridges {{and it is now}} effectively a different motorway from the one that opened in 1958.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} third lane {{was added}} {{in each direction}} in 1966 using the land reserved within the central reservation, without the need to modify existing bridges. Despite the relative ease in this work, the lack of hard shoulders at the bridges meant the number of available lanes during engineering works was inadequate {{to cope with the}} traffic volumes of the time, estimated to be have been in the region of 140,000 vehicles daily. Construction of the M61 motorway in 1969–1970 to carry Manchester traffic northbound had its northern terminus connect to a new junction on the <b>by-pass</b> at Bamber Bridge, requiring the construction of Blacow Bridge to carry the north-bound M61 traffic over the M6.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe kinetic {{constants}} of internalization of asialoorosomucoid {{were determined}} for normal and jejuno-ileal <b>by-passed</b> rat hepatocytes. In <b>by-passed</b> rats the maximum velocity of asialoorosomucoid internalization is decreased 3 -fold, without any modification of apparant constant of internalization. Moreover, the rate constant of internalization {{was the same}} in the two groups of rats. These data suggest that the process of asialoorosomucoid internalization is not altered in <b>by-passed</b> hepatocytes and that the decrease of maximal velocity is only due to a decrease of total uptake receptor number...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, transport links are fairly restrictive. The original road layout followed the valleys with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out of work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda <b>by-pass</b> have been created out of former railway lines.|$|E

As Maguire continued ahead, up the <b>by-pass</b> towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from {{where it had been}} parked in a lay-by. Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing its lights. Two men had been observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's movements were being carefully monitored.|$|E
5|$|As an {{animator}} {{of various}} Hanna-Barbera children's cartoons, Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci was bothered {{by people who}} thought that animation was only for children, prompting him to produce edgy adult works such as Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers Grunt. Antonucci was later dared to produce a children's cartoon and accepted the challenge. Antonucci drew the Eds while designing a commercial. Impressed, he spent months designing the show and then faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network (CN) and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both responded quickly with high interest, but demanded creative control, to which Antonucci refused. After CN agreed to let Antonucci have creative control, a deal was made that his studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce the series. The show entered production in 1997, making it Cartoon Network's first original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Hanna-Barbera, {{as well as the}} first to <b>by-pass</b> a seven-minute short.|$|E

5|$|The Preston <b>By-pass,</b> {{opened in}} 1958, {{was the first}} {{motorway}} in the UK, and today an extensive network connects the major cities of the North. The main western route through the North is the M6, part of a chain of motorways from London to Glasgow, while the main eastern motorway is the M1/A1(M), which runs {{as far north as}} Newcastle. The M62 links Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Hull across the Pennines. Other trans-Pennine roads are comparatively minor, and the lack of any dual-carriageway connection between the east and west coasts anywhere in England north of the M62 has been identified by the Department for Transport as a significant hindrance to the Northern economy. In many cases, modern roads still follow ancient routes: the M62 motorway effectively duplicates the Roman road between York and Chester, while the Great North Road, the stagecoach route from London to Scotland, became the modern A1 road.|$|E
5|$|Although the PVA 13th Army had {{a nominal}} {{strength}} of 230,000 men, its actual strength {{during the battle}} could be as low as 150,000 men. The PVA 66th Corps, for example, had only 6,600 men per division {{at the start of}} the battle, as opposed to the expected 10,000 men per division. There were also only one firearm available for every three Chinese soldiers, and the rest were employed as grenade throwers. Because most of the Chinese howitzers and guns were left behind in Manchuria, mortars were the only artillery support available for the Chinese. For the counteroffensive, the average Chinese soldier were issued with only five days worth of rations and ammunition, and resupply could only be obtained by scavenging on the battlefield. To compensate for its shortcomings, the Chinese relied extensively on night attacks and infiltrations in order to avoid the UN firepower. The primitive logistics system had also allowed the Chinese to maneuver over the rough hilly terrains, thus enabled them to <b>by-pass</b> the UN defenses and to surround the isolated UN positions. Because the Chinese had captured large numbers of Nationalist weapons during the Chinese Civil War, most of the Chinese weapons were composed of US made small arms such as the Thompson submachine gun, the M1 Garand rifle, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, the bazooka and the M2 mortar.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{motorway}} was constructed, the A6 {{road through}} Preston handled north-south traffic with tailbacks and congestion a common occurrence, more so during special occasions {{such as the}} Blackpool Illuminations. The route had been planned {{as far back as}} 1937–1938, with the basic alignment still deemed feasible by the time Lancashire County Council gave approval in the mid 1940s. Chief engineer Drake was part of a delegation from Lancashire that travelled to Germany in 1938 in order that a plan could be drawn up by the council. The agreed route formed part of the County Surveyors' Society's national proposals and was protected by Lancashire County Council from any future developments. During planning, the legal powers necessary for motorway construction did not exist, until the introduction of the Special Roads Act in 1949 that made it lawful to construct roads that were to be used only by certain classes of vehicle. The <b>by-pass</b> was seen as an experiment for the future motorway construction, with many lessons and techniques were learned that would help towards successful future projects. When the proposals were made public, including a large-scale model to ease the explaining of the scheme, only a handful of formal objections were raised and were resolved by agreement without the need to initiate a public inquiry, cited in part because of close personal involvement of Lancashire County Council and the surveyor during consultation.|$|E

5|$|Route 37 {{was defined}} as the {{proposed}} Winchester <b>By-Pass</b> by 1963, and was included in the statewide Arterial Network when it was created in 1964. When I-81 opened past Winchester in November 1965, it included an interchange south of Winchester, taking traffic between I-81 and US 11 along a short connecting road. The north half of the bypass, from US 50 west of Winchester north and east to US 11 north of the city, opened in the late 1960s, and the semicircle was completed in the late 1970s, with the linking of Route 37 to the existing I-81/US 11 connection. A new bridge carrying southbound SR 37 over I-81 was built, but otherwise the diamond interchange was not modified. The only change to the major bypass since it was constructed has been a new trumpet interchange serving the Winchester Medical Center; construction began in September 2000 and was completed in November 2001. A single ramp from SR 37 north to Cives Lane, allowing traffic {{at the north end of}} the bypass to access US 11 south, was built in about 2000.|$|E
