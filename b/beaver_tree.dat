The characteristics of the damage areas, types of damage and the severity of the damage were examined. The size of the damage areas averaged 2. 2 ha. The damage areas occurred on peatland forest more (p < 0. 05) than expected. The dominant tree species were commercially valuable trees such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) (33 %), Norway spruce (Picea abies) (18 %) and birches (Betula spp.) (47 %). Birch occurred as dominant tree species more (p < 0. 05) than expected. The proportion of older forest development classes was considerable.

Well- preserved skull of Castoroides ohioensis but with the mandibles lost, both zygomatic arches missing, and the facial portions of the maxillae broken away; dental series complete and in good condition. Castoroides had cutting teeth up to 15 cm-long with prominently-ridged outer surfaces. These strong enamel ridges would have acted as girders to support such long teeth. Further, the deep masseteric fossa of the lower jaw suggests a very powerful bite. Perhaps their teeth could have acted as both wood-cutters and gouges. There is no clear evidence that the giant <b>beaver</b> felled <b>trees</b> or built dams, but a possible lodge was discovered near New Knoxville, Ohio around 1912. Part of a giant beaver skull and the lodge were located in a peaty layer surrounded by loam. In Ohio, there have been claims of a possible giant beaver lodge four feet high and eight feet in diameter, formed from small saplings. The recent discovery of clear evidence for lodge building in the related genus Dipoides indicates that the giant beaver probably also built lodges. Fossils of Castoroides are concentrated around the midwestern United States in states near the Great Lakes, particularly Illinois and Indiana, but specimens are recorded from Alaska and Canada to Florida. In Canada, fossils of this species are commonly found in the Old Crow Basin, Yukon, and single specimens are known from Toronto, Ontario and Indian Island, New Brunswick. A hitherto overlooked 1891 record of a Castoroides skull from near Highgate, Ontario is the earliest for Canada. In Old Crow region, Castoroides fossils occur in deposits of the Sangamonian interglacial.|$|R

40|$|North American beavers (Castor canadensis) were {{introduced}} into southern South America in 1946. Since that time, their populations have greatly expanded. In their native range, beavers shape riparian ecosystems by selectively feeding on particular plant species, increasing herbaceous richness {{and creating a}} distinct plant community. To test their effects as exotic engineers on sub-Antarctic vegetation, we quantified <b>beaver</b> impacts on <b>tree</b> canopy cover and seedling abundance and composition, {{as well as their}} impacts on herbaceous species richness, abundance and composition on Navarino island, Cape Horn County, Chile (550 S). Beavers significantly reduced forest canopy up to 30 m away from streams, essentially eliminating riparian forests. The tree seedling bank was greatly reduced and seedling species composition was changed by suppressing Nothofagus betuloides and Nothofagus pumilio, but allowing Nothofagus antarctica. Herbaceous richness and abundance almost doubled in meadows. However, unlike beaver effects on North American herbaceous plant communities, much of this richness was due to invasion by exotic plants, and beaver modifications of the meadow vegetation assemblage did not result in a significantly different community, compared to forests. Overall, 42 % of plant species were shared between both habitat types. Our results indicate that, as predicted from North American studies, beaver-engineering increased local herbaceous richness. Unlike in their native range, though, they did not create a unique plant community in sub-Antarctic landscapes. Plus, the elimination of Nothofagus forests and their seedling bank and the creation of invasion pathways for exotic plants together threaten one of the world's most pristine temperate forest ecosystems...|$|R
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the dam is to create {{deepwater}} refugia enabling the beaver to escape from predators. When deep water is already present in lakes, rivers, or larger streams, the beaver may dwell in a bank burrow and bank lodge with an underwater entrance. The beaver dam is constructed using branches from <b>trees</b> the <b>beavers</b> cut down, as well as rocks, grass, and mud.

Besides providing a safe home for the beaver, beaver ponds also provide habitat for waterfowl, fish, and other aquatic animals. Their dams help reduce soil erosion and can help reduce flooding. However, beaver dams are not permanent and depend on the beavers' continued presence for their maintenance. Beavers generally concentrate on building and repairing dams in the fall in preparation for the coming winter. In northern areas, they often do not repair breaches in the dam made by otters, and sometimes breach the dam themselves and lower the water level in the pond to create more breathing space under the ice or get easier access to trees below the dam. In a 1988 study in Alberta, Canada, no beavers repaired [...] "sites of water loss" [...] during the winter.

Podaci se prikupljaju pomoću mreže suradnika, odnosno po evidenciji događaja. Na temelju analize prikupljenih podataka o stradanju dabrova u proteklih 18 godina, uočava se porast stradalih dabrova, posebice nakon porasta populacije i prostornog širenja dabrova, odnosno 10 godina nakon ispuštanja u Hrvatskoj. U promatranom razdoblju u Hrvatskoj je evidentirano ukupno 111 gubitaka dabrova, dok je u Srbiji taj broj znatno manji i iznosi 36 jedinki. U Srbiji nije primjetan proporcionalni porast stradanja dabrova u odnosu na dinamiku populacije. Najviše dabrova stradava u prometu, 40 % u Hrvatskoj i 17 % u Srbiji, te nezakonitim lovom i ribolovom 22 % u Hrvatskoj i 19 % u Srbiji. Iznimku čini jedna jedinka koja je stradala uslijed pada stabla na odraslog dabra. Često se kod pronalaska lešine ne može utvrditi uzrok uginuća 21 % u Hrvatskoj i 28 % u Srbiji. U Srbiji je utvrđen značajan udio uginuća zbog bolesti, čak 25 % evidentiranih gubitaka. Što se tiče starosne strukture stradalih dabrova, najvećim dijelom stradavaju adultne jedinke a potom subadultne, dok je, s obzirom na brojne nepotpune informacije, često starost nepoznata. Kada se analizira spol stradalih jedinki, također je nepoznato najviše zastupljeno, što je donekle razumljivo jer ne postoji kod dabra izraženi spolni dimorfizam, a kod utvrđenog spola neznatno više stradava mužjaka. S obzirom na vrijeme stradavanja, najviše jedinki je evidentirano u proljeće i jesen, dok najmanje dabrova stradava tijekom zime. Kao mjere zaštite dabrova u prvom redu poziva se na poštivanje zakonskih propisa vezano za ilegalni lov i ribolov, a stradavanju u prometu moguće je smanjiti ili ponegdje u potpunosti spriječiti postavljanjem žičane ograde uz prometnicu na problematičnim prijelazima. Također se mogu uspješno spriječiti gubici kod radova na vodotocima u području koje nastanjuju dabrovi, da se stručno i tehničko osoblje koje obavlja zahvat na uređenju vodotoka educira i orijentira na mjere zaštite dabrova kod izvođenja radova (zaštita nastambi i jedinki od radnih strojeva). Takozvani „opasni“ objekti u koje dabrovi mogu upasti i u njima stradati, mogu se prilagoditi na način da se dabrovima onemogući ulazak u takav prostor ili da se osigura mogućnost izlaska iz takovog prostora.

Population {{monitoring of}} beavers in Croatia and Serbia is being continuously run {{since the first}} release of beavers in 1996. in Croatia(Grubešić i Krapinec, 1998, Grubešić, 2014). Serbia has started with monitoring in 1999. When the first beak has been registered {{in the north of}} Vojvodina and it has been intensified since 2004. when they started with inhabitation – reintroduction (Ćirović, 2010). As a part of monitoring beavers in Croatia and Serbia since their reintroduction, beaver losses are being recorded by place and time of death, cause, sex and age of individuals. Information is being gathered with help of a network of associates, and by evidence of events. Based on the analysis of gathered information on beaver killings in the past 18 years a growth of killed beavers has been noticed, especially after the population growth and territorial expansion of beavers, and 10 years after the release in Croatia. In the observed period in Croatia a total of 111 beaver losses have been registered, while in Serbia this number is significantly lower and amounts to 36 individuals. Based on registered beaver losses a significant rise in beaver losses in the past 7 years has been noticed on the territory of Republic of Croatia. Actually the number of killed individuals has risen significantly when the beaver population has stabilized and increased its numbers and after 10 years since the inhabitation. In Serbia, despite the stabilization and territorial expansion, registered losses are relatively small, and stagnation or slight drop in killed or died animals has been noted. The main factor of mortality in Croatia and Serbia has been traffic. About one third of beavers (50 individuals) have been killed in traffic accidents. Traffic share in beaver mortality is equal or even somewhat smaller when compared to results from some parts of Germany, where this share is from 50 % to even 86, 5 % (Pokorny and associates 2014., Muller 2014). Strangulation in fishing nets has been the second most significant beaver loss in populations on the territory of Posavina and Podravina (22 beavers – 15 %). Autopsy unquestionably proved that 17 beavers (11. 6 %) died from illness. For 33 of them (22, 4 %), due to untimely findings or delivery to autopsy, a precise cause of death could not have been determined. When we look at beaver loss causes on the territory of Republic of Croatia traffic absolutely dominates, followed by unknown causes, and in third place illegal hunting and fishing (especially gillnets). In Serbia alongside unknown causes significant influences have diseases. From all 147 losses, only one beaver has been killed underneath a tree. Even though it has been noted he has been “killed at work” the position of the <b>beavers</b> body and <b>tree</b> points that the killing was not a consequence of knocking down the tree in question (Picture 1 and 2), but that the tree fell on the beaver as it has been passing by, most likely as a consequence of wind blowing the bitten tree down or exceptionally that an another individual knocked down the tree and it fell on the beaver passing by. Mostly adult individuals are being killed (Croatia 39, Serbia 14 beavers) which is linked to their increased activity in search for food and in moving about in general. Reasearch of other authors also shows that adult individuals are mostly being killed and mainly females (Pokorny and associates 2014). Sub adult individuals are being killed when exploring the territory (new locations) or when they inhabit a zone where the get killed easily, especially in traffic. This age group has mostly been killed in Serbia (15 beavers). In relation to sexual structure in Croatia and in Serbia a larger number of males were killed than females. Unfortunately, for half of killed beavers {{we were not able to}} tell the sex. If we look at beaver killing on a seasonal level, then two periods stick out, mostly spring then autumn. In spring beavers move more, especially the sub adult ones in search for foo and exploration of new habitats, while in autumn when they are more active in agricultural lands, they are being killed in traffic or in illegal hunting (this influence is most likely significantly bigger than the recorded one, but the prefix “illegal” points to unavailability of information and data on individuals killed this way). Illness for now are not a more significant cause of population loss, but in the future, especially in areas overcrowded by beaver, the might have a more significant role in the reduction of population, considering that we are dealing with a species (rodents) that are sensitive to certain diseases (leptospirosis, tularemia) (Parker and ass. 1951, Hopla 1974, Hornfeldti sur. 1986, Morneri sur., 1988, Wolli sur. 2012). Certain problems or flaws in delivering information on losses emerge due to associates not being educated; these are accidental findings by people who have seen this species most likely for the first time. Apart from that some information has been delivered without details that would give a clearer picture in determining a cause of death, age and sex. As a measure of protecting beavers first in line is respecting the legislation connected to illegal hunting and fishing, and the traffic killing might be decreased or somewhere completely prevented by setting up a wire fence alongside roads in troubling crosses. Also losses can be successfully prevented in watercourse construction in territories inhabited by beavers, that the personnel that is carrying out the construction is being educated and pointed to beaver protection measures while carrying out the work (lodge and animal protection from excavators). So called “dangerous” objects in which beavers can fall into and get hurt, can be adjusted in a way that beavers are enabled to get into such spaces but also to ensure the possibility of getting out from such a space. Beaver protection is being carried out by good media presentation and informing the public of beavers and their way of life, protection measures and citizen education. Such direct communication enables and simplifies information gathering on beavers, also including information on killed or died individuals...|$|R
