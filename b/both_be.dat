He was also present for the trial of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was posthumously found guilty for the crime of maiestas (treason). On 16 December, his father gave a eulogy for Germanicus during a Senate meeting, and he gave a eulogy the next meeting. It was decided that their eulogies would <b>both</b> <b>be</b> inscribed in bronze: that of Tiberius for future generations, but the libellus (eulogy) of Drusus to demonstrate the devotion of Drusus for his adoptive brother {{in a show of}} pietas (piety).|$|E
5000|$|In {{regard to}} whether two given propositions {{can have the}} same truth value, there are four {{separate}} logical possibilities: the propositions <b>are</b> subalterns (possibly <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true, and possibly <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false); subcontraries (it <b>is</b> possible that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true, but not that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false); contraries (it <b>is</b> possible that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false, but not that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true); or contradictories (it is not possible that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true, {{and it is not}} possible that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false).|$|R

5|$|In December 1966, the Army asked Bell {{to prepare}} a {{detailed}} deployment concept combining the light defense of Nth Country with the point defense of Hardsite. On 17 January 1967, this became the I-67 project, which delivered its results on 5 July. I-67 was essentially Nth Country but with more bases near Minuteman fields, armed primarily with Sprint. The wide-area Zeus and short-range Sprint bases would <b>both</b> <b>be</b> supported by the PAR network.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of May 9, Benedict Arnold quite unexpectedly arrived on the scene. Flourishing a commission from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, he asserted his right to command the expedition. The assembled men refused to acknowledge his authority, insisting they would only follow Allen's lead. In a private discussion, Allen and Arnold reached an accommodation, the essence of which was that Arnold and Allen would <b>both</b> <b>be</b> {{at the front of}} the troops when the attack on the fort was made.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenalism is {{the theory}} that {{representations}} (or sense data) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then <b>both</b> <b>be</b> properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral monism, as it is called, resembles property dualism.|$|E

On February 27, 2017, she was announced as an inductee in the WWE Hall of Fame. Her induction made her the quickest female to be inducted after her retirement. Additionally, she and Edge became the first real-life couple to <b>both</b> <b>be</b> inducted.|$|E

5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could <b>both</b> <b>be</b> effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} Liverpool 13th {{appearance}} in the final. They had won on six occasions (1965, 1974, 1986, 1989, 1992, 2001) and lost six times (1914, 1950, 1971, 1977, 1988, 1996). West Ham were appearing in their fifth final, they had previously won three (1964, 1975, 1980) and lost once in the 1923 FA Cup Final. Liverpool had won both the meetings between the teams in the Premier League during the season. A 2–0 home victory {{at the end of}} October, was followed by a 2–1 win at the end of April. The latter match saw Liverpool midfielder Luis García and West Ham defender Hayden Mullins sent off, which meant they would <b>both</b> <b>be</b> suspended for the final.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{butterflies}} have been divided into the superfamily Papilionoidea excluding the smaller {{groups of the}} Hesperiidae (skippers) and the more moth-like Hedylidae of America. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the traditional Papilionoidea is paraphyletic {{with respect to the}} other two groups, so they should <b>both</b> <b>be</b> included within Papilionoidea, to form a single butterfly group, thereby synonymous with the clade Rhopalocera.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can <b>both</b> <b>be</b> noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of war, gout began to cause Battenberg considerable pain, and the naval staff he had set up did not function {{as well as it}} ought to have done. On 6 August 1914 Battenberg and the French Deputy Chief of Staff of the Navy Antoine Schwerer signed a convention in London on the division of responsibilities between the two navies. The convention confirmed the terms of the Entente Cordiale, and placed France in command of all naval operations in the Mediterranean. Malta and Gibraltar would <b>both</b> <b>be</b> treated as French naval bases. In the event that Austria entered the war France would act against its naval forces, and would at minimum prevent them passing the Strait of Otranto.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of their station on Bermuda, Beebe and Elswyth gave up on their {{compromise}} of finding a research station where they could <b>both</b> <b>be</b> happy. Elswyth, who was most content in temperate environments, began searching for a home in New England where she could continue her writing. Meanwhile, Beebe began searching for a new tropical research station to replace Kartabo, which had fallen victim to deforestation just like Kalacoon before it. Beebe eventually helped Elswyth purchase a small farm near Wilmington, Vermont, where he visited her frequently. Elswyth explained in a magazine interview that she was uncomfortable on Beebe's expeditions, so {{the two of them had}} agreed that they would keep their careers separate from their private lives.|$|E

60|$|It {{is also to}} be observed, that {{towards the}} end of Charles II.'s reign, the High Churchmen and the Catholics {{regarded}} themselves as on the same side in political questions, and not greatly divided in their temporal interests. <b>Both</b> <b>were</b> sufferers in the Plot, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> enemies of the sectaries, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> adherents of the Stuarts.|$|R
50|$|The {{temporary}} union between Nikita Khrushchev and Marshal Georgy Zhukov {{was founded}} on their similar backgrounds, interests and weaknesses: <b>both</b> <b>were</b> peasants, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> ambitious, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> abused by Stalin, both feared the Stalinists, and both wanted to change these things. Khrushchev and Zhukov needed one another to eliminate their mutual enemies in the Soviet political elite.|$|R
5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must <b>both</b> <b>be</b> recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|Edge {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{decorated}} professional wrestlers of all-time, having won 31 championships in WWE overall, including the WWE Championship four times, the World Heavyweight Championship a record seven times, the Intercontinental Championship five times, the United States Championship once, the WWE Tag Team Championship twice, and the WWF/World Tag Team Championship a record twelve times. He is WWE's 14th Triple Crown Champion and 7th Grand Slam Champion. He also won the 2001 King of the Ring tournament, was the first Money in the Bank ladder match winner in 2005, and won the Royal Rumble match in 2010, making him the first wrestler in history to achieve all three of those accomplishments. He headlined multiple pay-per-view events for WWE, including WrestleMania XXIV, and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Christian in 2012. His wife Beth Phoenix joined the Hall of Fame in 2017, making them the first real-life couple to <b>both</b> <b>be</b> inducted.|$|E
5|$|Gadret rode {{both the}} Giro and the Tour in 2010, an {{arrangement}} {{which resulted in}} some controversy when he refused to grant Roche, the squad's leader for the race, his wheel after the Irishman had punctured at a particularly inopportune time. This coupled with Gadret's recuperation after the extremely difficult Giro, and his admission that he prefers the Italian Grand Tour in any event, led to speculation {{as to whether the}} two would <b>both</b> <b>be</b> named to the squad. He claimed he would ride only to support Roche, if he rode at all. Lavenu stated that Gadret's impressive Giro had grown his standing with the team, and that the feud between him and Roche had been forgotten, so he hoped Gadret would ride the Tour. Confident of his recovery abilities, Gadret did indeed start the Tour.|$|E
