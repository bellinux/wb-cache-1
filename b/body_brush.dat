In some Bara villages, it is forbidden {{to carry a}} load alone; {{at least two people}} must carry it together. A common prohibition throughout Bara communities forbids serving food or drink to someone with the utensils, plates or cups that were used to serve another.

25|$|Thielmann {{correctly}} deduced {{that the}} French manoeuvrer {{was designed to}} reinforce I Corps. But his superior the Duke of Saxe-Weimar believed that Maison wanted to capture Brussels, {{a belief that the}} Frenchman encouraged by spreading false rumours among the Belgians. Saxe-Weimar shifted Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn's division from Leuven to Aalst where he concentrated 9,000 foot soldiers and 900 horsemen. Coalition detachments reoccupied Courtrai, Deinze and Harelbeke while Helwig's Freikorps was sent to observe Valenciennes and Condé-sur-l'Escaut. The real danger to Maison remained Thielmann who might cut off the French with his total force of 12,000 troops in 15 battalions and 500 cavalry. On 30 March, Maison abandoned Ghent, marching south-west along the Leie River with the main body of I Corps. To shield the movement, he sent Solignac's division and one squadron of the 2nd Guard Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment farther east to Petegem. At Deinze the main <b>body</b> <b>brushed</b> aside Major Puckler's small force and continued to Courtrai. The latter place was evacuated by some Prussian cavalry when the I Corps appeared.|$|R

40|$|Butterflies play {{vital role}} in the ecosystem, there is co-evolutionary {{relationship}} between butterflies and plants, their lives are interlinked. Butterflies are also called flying flower, whenever goes displaying its beauty. These insects enhance the aesthetic value of the environments by their exquisite wing colors. Butterflies are the wild indicators of the ecosystem; these insects tell us everything about the healthier ecosystem. These are effective pollinators, butterflies visit the flower to eat nectar, tiny scales on their <b>bodies</b> <b>brush</b> against the anthers and pollen sticks to these scales, then butterfly visits the next flower, the pollen stuck to its scales brushes onto stigma’s flower. Some species of butterflies migrate over long distance; carry pollen to be shared across plants which are far apart from one another. This migration of pollens induces genetic variation in plants species and give a better chance at survival against different disease. These insects also provide food for other organisms, for example; birds, reptiles, amphibians and also acts as biological pest control. But the population of these insects decline rapidly due to human activities, habitat destruction, uses of pesticides and unawareness of people {{about the importance of}} flying flowers...|$|R
6000|$|... 1453. The running {{together}} or coalescence of different lines of discharge (1412.) is very beautifully {{shown in the}} brush in air. This point may present a little difficulty {{to those who are}} not accustomed to see in every discharge an equal exertion of power in opposite directions, a positive brush being considered by such (perhaps in consequence of the common phrase direction of a current) as indicating a breaking forth in different directions of the original force, rather than a tendency to convergence and union in one line of passage. But the ordinary case of the brush may be compared, for its illustration, with that in which, by holding the knuckle opposite to highly excited glass, a discharge occurs, the ramifications of a brush then leading from the glass and converging into a spark on the knuckle. Though a difficult experiment to make, it is possible to obtain discharge between highly excited shell-lac and the excited glass of a machine: when the discharge passes, it is, from the nature of the charged <b>bodies,</b> <b>brush</b> at each end and spark in the middle, beautifully illustrating that tendency of discharge to facilitate like action, which I have described in a former page (1418.).|$|R

Gobo, poor fellow, required no second invitation; indeed, his haste was his undoing. He went at the projecting rock with a bound. The end of the tusk was still hanging over, and instead of grasping the rock he caught at it. It twisted in his hand--he slipped--he fell; with one wild shriek he vanished into the abyss beneath, his falling <b>body</b> <b>brushing</b> me as it passed. For a moment we stood aghast, and presently the dull thud of his fall smote heavily upon our ears. Poor fellow, he had met the Fate which, as he declared, walked about loose in Wambe's country. Then with an oath the remaining man sprung at the rock and clambered over it in safety. Aghast at the awfulness of what had happened, I stood still, till I saw the great blade of a Matuku spear pass up between my feet. That brought me to my senses, and I began to clamber up the rock like a cat. I was half way round it. Already I had clasped the hand of that brave girl Maiwa, who came down to help me, the men having scrambled forward with the ivory, when I felt some one seize my ankle.|$|R
50|$|In the {{application}} method, formerly {{assumed to be}} the only one used for faience glazing; silica, lime and alkalis are ground in the raw state to a small particle size, thus mixed in water to form a slurry which is then applied to the quartz core. Partial fritting of the slurry favors the first stages of vitrification, which in turn lowers the final firing temperature. The slurry can be then applied to the <b>body,</b> through <b>brushing</b> or dipping, to create a fine, powdery coating. Upon firing, the water from the melting glaze partially diffuses in the sand body, sintering the quartz particles and thus creating some solid bridges in the body.|$|R

5000|$|A unique {{aspect of}} the {{reproduction}} of this species has been well studied. The female has two sperm-storage sites in its body. There {{are two types of}} males, the larger [...] "consort" [...] males and the smaller [...] "sneaker" [...] males. Consorts insert sperm into the oviduct of the female, and sneakers place sperm into specialized tissue near the female's mouth. The two male types produce different types of sperm, as well: the large consorts produce sperm with short flagella, while the sneaker males have sperm with longer flagella.

6000|$|While {{attending}} thus, {{he heard}} a scream. Having by temperament considerable caution, but little fear, he waited till {{he heard a}}nother, and then got out of bed. Taking the poker in his hand, and putting on his spectacles, he hurried to the door. Many a time and oft in old days had he risen in this fashion to defend the plate of the [...] "Honorable Bateson" [...] and the Dowager Countess of Glengower from the periodical attacks of his imagination. He stood with his ancient nightgown flapping round his still more ancient legs, slightly shivering; then, pulling the door open, he looked forth. On the stairs just above him Mrs. Hughs, clasping her baby with one arm, was holding the other out at full length between herself and Hughs. He heard the latter say: [...] "You've drove me to it; I'll do a swing for you!" [...] Mrs. Hughs' thin <b>body</b> <b>brushed</b> past into his room; blood was dripping from her wrist. Creed saw that Hughs had his bayonet in his hand. With all his might he called out: [...] "Ye {{ought to be ashamed}} of yourself!" [...] raising the poker to a position of defence. At this moment--more really dangerous than any he had ever known--it was remarkable that he instinctively opposed to it his most ordinary turns of speech. It was as though the extravagance of this un-English violence had roused in him the full measure of a native moderation. The sight of the naked steel deeply disgusted him; he uttered a long sentence. What did Hughs call this--disgracin' of the house at this time in the mornin'? Where was he brought up? Call 'imself a soldier, attackin' of old men and women in this way? He ought to be ashamed! ...|$|R

40|$|Domestic {{environmental}} pollution resulting from urban livestock farming {{was investigated in}} Makurdi using parasitological techniques. The test tube flotation technique {{was used for the}} parasitological analysis of animal faecal matter and soil samples collected from residential premises. Ectoparasitic fauna of dogs, goats, sheep and cattle cohabiting with humans within the same residential compound were also collected and identified. The hand-picking and <b>body</b> <b>brushing</b> methods were employed to search for ticks, fleas, lice and mites. Of the 150 soil samples examined, 55 (36. 7 %) were positive for 1 or more eggs of helminth parasites. There {{was no significant difference in}} the distribution of eggs in the soil samples from the 3 areas sampled (c 2 = 0. 046, df= 2, P&gt; 0. 05). Ascaris species were the dominant parasite eggs found. Of the 180 faecal samples examined, 107 (59. 4 %) were positive for 1 or more eggs of helminth parasites. Chi-square analysis showed no significant difference in the level of infection of different animal faeces sampled (c 2 = 5. 74, df= 4, P&gt; 0. 05). Ascaris species were again the dominating helminth parasite eggs found. There was also no significant difference in the prevalence of helminth eggs in the animal faecal samples from the 3 areas sampled (c 2 = 5. 99, df= 4, P&gt; 0. 05). A total of 1908 ectoparasites was recovered (ticks: 32. 80 %; lice: 22. 43 %; fleas: 22. 06 % and mite: 22. 69 %). There was no significant difference in infestation animals between sexes (c 2 = 0. 10, df= 4, P&gt; 0. 05). The predominant genus encountered for ticks were Amblyomma, while Linognathus (43. 90 %), Ctenocephalides (97. 38 %) and Sarcoptes (58. 89 %) were most predominant for lice, fleas and mites respectively. The public health implications of the findings, especially as these relate to the increasing incidence and prevalence of zoonotic infections, are discussed...|$|R
