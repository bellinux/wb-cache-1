40|$|AbstractThe {{mathematical}} model of static and dynamic {{calculation of the}} improved design of balancing device with the hydraulically unloaded resiliently <b>mounted</b> <b>ring</b> is represented in work. For the dynamic analysis of system {{it is necessary to}} consider the connected oscillations of resiliently <b>mounted</b> <b>ring</b> and disk of balancing device. For the improved design device rigidity of the disk is much more than rigidity of the resiliently <b>mounted</b> <b>ring.</b> Therefore at calculation of the balancing device special attention is to be paid to dynamic analysis of axially moving ring. The forced angular oscillations of ring, which are caused by a possible misalignment of the rotating disk, are also considered...|$|R

50|$|The Coolpix 9xx {{series of}} cameras is {{noteworthy}} for the swivel style body. This allowed {{the user to}} rotate the lens {{with respect to the}} LCD screen and controls providing comfortable viewing {{in a wide range of}} shooting positions. The swivel body also allowed a physically much larger lens to be packaged into the camera with a wide telephoto range and exceptional macro capabilities. The internal lens does not use a pop out design and a fixed 28mm threaded lens <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> was included at the front. The diameter of the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> happens to coincide with that of most clinical microscopes, resulting in the 9xx series becoming popular for hand-held eyepiece-projection photomicrography. This <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> is present on the entire series, making them system cameras; a set of intercompatible telephoto, wide-angle, and fish-eye converters were available, and worked on any of the 9xx cameras.|$|R

40|$|A {{wind energy}} {{harvester}} inspired by music playing harmonicas was proposed for micro-power generation. The energy harvester utilizes flow-excited self-sustained oscilla-tions of a piezoelectric cantilever <b>beam</b> <b>mounted</b> in a wind pipe to generate electric power. The {{dependence of the}} energy harvester’s power generation performance {{on a set of}} the design parameters such as the chamber volume, aperture width and beam dimensions has been studied previously. However, the performance of the nonlinear multi-physics system with two-way fluid structure coupling also depends on other design parameters such as the geometry of the oscillatory <b>beam,</b> the <b>beam</b> <b>mounting</b> configuration and the geometry of the pipe outlet. A systematic design analysis of the effects of these parameters is necessary for the optimization of the energy harvester. In this study, theoretical and computational modeling and design analysis are per-formed to investigate the influence of the design parameters of beam geometry and pipe outlet structure on the performance of the wind energy harvester. It is known that the in-crease of the beam bending displacement induces a larger strain in the piezoelectric laye...|$|R
50|$|The Ye-151 cannon-armed {{version was}} {{designed}} {{in parallel with}} the Ye-150 but did not proceed to the hardware stage. The weapon system was to have consisted of twin TKB-495 or Makarov TKB-539 cannon, with a rate of fire of 2,000 rds/min, mounted on a rotating <b>ring</b> in tilting <b>mounts.</b> The mounts could tilt ±30° and the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> could rotate 360°, which gave the installation a 60° cone of fire around the centreline of the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring.</b> To accommodate the ring turret, the inlet duct was lengthened with the rotating ring forming the inlet lip, wind tunnel testing confirming that the extended inlet duct would actually improve aerodynamic and inlet performance; the lengthened inlet was retained for all later Ye-150 series aircraft (without cannon installation). Further tunnel testing with an inlet mounting fitted with cannon revealed destabilising forces when the cannon were deflected, making accurate weapon aiming impossible and precluding further development. Studies were carried out with the cannon mount aft of the cockpit to reduce the destabilising moment, as the Ye-151-2, but no hardware resulted.|$|R
50|$|Starting in the 1930s, filters {{were also}} {{made in a}} sizing system known as a series mount. The filters {{themselves}} were round pieces of glass (or occasionally other materials) with no threads. Very early filters had no rims around the glass, but the more common later production filters had the glass mounted in metal rims. To mount the filters on a camera, the filter was placed between two rings; the <b>mount</b> <b>ring</b> either screwed into the lens threads or was slipped over the lens barrel and the retaining ring screws into the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> to hold the filter in place. The series designations are generally written as Roman numerals, I to IX, though {{there are a few}} sizes not written that way, such as Series 4.5 and Series 5.5. Most Series filter sizes are now obsolete, production having ceased by the late 1970s. However, Series 9 became a standard of the motion picture industry and Series 9 filters are still produced and sold today, particularly for professional motion picture cinematography.|$|R
