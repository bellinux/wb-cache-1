[...] "We have no other option but to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> and elect a new assembly to write the constitution," [...] he said in a nationally televised speech.

2500|$|In a {{statement}} issued on 25 September, the Thai Journalists Association and the Broadcast Journalists Association did not condemn the coup, nor did it protest the junta's orders restricting freedom of the press.

[...] It also urged the junta to ensure that the promised constitution gave similar rights to the abrogated 1997 People's Constitution and also to allow the public to participate in its drafting, as the 1997 Constitution was.|$|E
2500|$|In practice, {{after the}} Second Vatican Council, altars that obliged the priest {{to have his}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> were {{generally}} {{moved away from the}} apse wall or reredos, or, where this was unsuitable, a new freestanding altar was built closer to the people. This, however, is not universal, and in some churches and chapels it is physically impossible for the priest to face the people throughout the Mass, as before 1970 some churches, especially in Rome, had altars at which it was physically impossible for the priest not to face the people throughout the Mass.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} half of the 17th century, it became {{customary}} to place the tabernacle on the main altar of the church. When a priest celebrates Mass at such an altar with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> he sometimes necessarily turns his back directly to the Blessed Sacrament, as when he turns to the people at the Orate fratres. This seeming disrepect is absent when the priest stands on the side of the altar away from the people; but locating so large an object on the altar is arguably inconvenient for a celebration in which the priest faces the people. Accordingly, the revised Roman Missal states: ...|$|E

2500|$|Criticism {{also came}} from Emerson's fellow Conservatives. Garth Turner, a Conservative MP from Ontario said that [...] "anyone who crosses the floor {{ultimately}} should go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> for ratification and I stick {{by it and}} hopefully {{in this case that}} will happen..." [...] Turner later stated his belief that his criticism [...] "seriously limited" [...] his future in the party. Subsequently, he was eventually kicked out of the Conservative caucus and crossed the floor to sit as a Liberal for which he was also criticized. Myron Thompson of Alberta has also called for Emerson to step down and run in a by-election.|$|E
2500|$|Under Umar's rule, {{in order}} to promote strict discipline, Arab {{soldiers}} were settled outside of cities, between the desert and cultivated lands in special garrison towns known as [...] "amsar". Known examples of such settlements are Basra and Kufa, in Iraq, and Fustat south of what would later become Cairo. His goal was to keep his troops separate form settled peoples. His soldiers were forbidden to own land outside of Arabia. There were restrictions on their right to seize buildings and other immovable things usually thought to be prizes of war. Movable spoils were shared to people <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of the umma, regardless of their social stratum.|$|E

[...] He highlighted education and training issues, and said that Canada should be more accommodating to new immigrants. [...] Volpe also argued that Canada should return to a peacekeeping ethos in foreign affairs, rather than primarily engaging in combat missions. [...] After the party's first all-candidates debate, he accused frontrunner Michael Ignatieff of echoing the foreign policy vision of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.|$|E

2500|$|Mapp {{consulted}} on {{and fixed}} multiple cases. Some {{of her most}} noteworthy cases are recorded in James Caulfied's Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters of Remarkable Persons where he recorded an account from October 21, 1736, [...] "On Monday, Mrs. Mapp performed two extraordinary cures; one on a young lady of the Temple, who had several bones out from the knees to her toes, which she put in their proper places: {{and the other on}} a butcher, whose knee-pans were so misplaced that he walked with his knees knocking one against another. Yesterday she performed several other surprising cures; and about one set out for Epsom, and carried with her several crutches, which she calls trophies of honour." [...] At one point, some surgeons tried to fool Mapp and show that she was not skilled by sending her a healthy patient who claimed he had a damaged wrist. This test angered Mapp and she dislocated the patient's wrist and sent him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who had tried to trick her.|$|E
2500|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about associations' property, that came to be the dominant and practical view, was first stated by Brightman J in Re Recher's Will Trusts. Here it was said that, if no words are used that indicate a trust is intended, a [...] "gift takes effect in favour of the existing members of the association as an accretion to the funds which are the subject-matter of the contract". In other words, property will be held according to the members' contractual terms of their association. This matters for deciding whether a gift will succeed or be held to fail, although that possibility is unlikely on any contemporary view. It also matters where an association is being wound up, and there is a dispute over who should take the remaining property. In a recent decision, Hanchett‐Stamford v Attorney‐General Lewison J held that the final surviving member of the [...] "Performing and Captive Animals Defence League" [...] was entitled to the remaining property of the association, although while the association was running any money could not be used for the members' private purposes. On the other hand, if money is donated to an organisation, and specifically intended to be passed onto others, then the end of an association could mean that remaining assets will go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> the money came from (on [...] "resulting trust") or be bona vacantia. In Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts, Goff J held that a fund set up for the dependants of police staff, which was being wound up, which had been given money expressly for reason of benefiting dependants (and not to benefit the members of the trust) could not be taken by those members. The rules have also mattered, however for the purpose of taxation. In Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell it was held that the Conservative Party, and its various limbs and branches, was not all bound together by a contract, and so not subject to corporation tax.|$|E
