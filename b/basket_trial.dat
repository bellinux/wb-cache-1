40|$|Advances {{in the new}} {{sequencing}} {{technologies have}} enabled us to explore global genetic alterations including driver genes {{in a wide range}} of cancers. Concordantly, successes of molecular target ther-apy promoted the validity of tumor classification based on the combination of targetable genetic abnormalities, and next-generation sequencing-based genetic profiling using target gene capturing or multiplex-polymerase chain reaction has already been tested or adapted in many cancer centers. Driver gene-based classification may be applicable beyond organs, and clinical trials incorporating this genomic information, called as a <b>basket</b> <b>trial,</b> have been executed, although it should be consid-ered that similar therapeutic efficacies against drivermutations are not invariablymaintained among different cancer types. Research efforts to identify still missing driver genes in rare cancers, to com-plete functional annotation of infrequent driver genes, and multiple-layered omics approaches are further expected for better classification of tumor. Emerging clinical interests in the development of immunotherapies postulate a new molecular classification of tumors. Recent studies reported that total number of mutations and the frequent appearance of neo-antigens by protein-coding mutations were associated with a better response, and genetic evaluation of both tumor and hos...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the era of}} {{targeted}} therapies, clinical trials in oncology are rapidly evolving, wherein patients from multiple diseases are now enrolled and treated according to their genomic mutation(s). In such trials, known as basket trials, the different disease cohorts form the different baskets for inference. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to efficiently use information from all baskets while simultaneously screening to find individual baskets where the drug works. Most proposed methods are developed in a Bayesian paradigm that requires specifying a prior distribution for a variance parameter, which controls {{the degree to which}} information is shared across baskets. Methods: A common method used to capture the correlated endpoints across baskets is Bayesian hierarchical modeling. We evaluate a Bayesian adaptive design {{in the context of a}} <b>basket</b> <b>trial</b> and investigate two popular prior specifications: an inverse-gamma prior on the basket-level variance and a uniform prior on the basket-level standard deviation. Results: From our simulation study, we see the inverse-gamma prior is highly sensitive to the input hyperparameters. When the prior mean value of the variance parameter is set to be near zero (3 ̆c 0. 5), this can lead to unacceptably high false positive rates (3 ̆e 40...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} work primarily {{focuses on}} Bayesian adaptive design for phase I and phase II clinical trials. Specifically, it includes three topics: 1) developing an adaptive dose modification design for phase I clinical trials, 2) proposing a calibrated Bayesian hierarchical model for <b>basket</b> <b>trial</b> design, and 3) originating a Bayesian latent subgroup design for basket trials. ^ Most phase I dose-finding methods in oncology aim {{to find the}} maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) from a set of prespecified doses. However, in practice, {{due to a lack}} of understanding of the true dose-toxicity relationship, it is likely that none of these prespecified doses is equal or reasonably close to the true MTD. To handle this issue, we propose an adaptive dose modification (ADM) method that can be coupled with any existing dose-finding method to adaptively modify the dose, when it is needed, during the course of dose finding. To reflect clinical practice, we divide the toxicity probability into three regions: underdosing, acceptable and overdosing regions. We adaptively add a new dose whenever the observed data suggest that none of the investigational doses is likely to be located in the acceptable region. The new dose is estimated via a nonparametric dose-toxicity model based on local polynomial regression. The simulation study shows that ADM substantially outperforms the similar existing method. We applied ADM to a phase I cancer trial. ^ The <b>basket</b> <b>trial</b> evaluates the treatment effect of a targeted therapy in patients with the same genetic or molecular aberration, regardless of their cancer types. Bayesian hierarchical modeling has been proposed to adaptively borrow information across cancer types to improve the statistical power of basket trials. Although conceptually attractive, research has shown that Bayesian hierarchical models cannot appropriately determine the degree of information borrowing and may lead to substantially inflated type I error rates. We propose a novel calibrated Bayesian hierarchical model approach to evaluate the treatment effect in basket trials. In our approach, the shrinkage parameter that controls information borrowing is not regarded as an unknown parameter. Instead, it is dened as a function of a similarity measure of the treatment effect across tumor subgroups. The key is that the function is calibrated using simulation such that information is strongly borrowed across subgroups if their treatment effects are similar, and barely borrowed if the treatment effects are heterogeneous. The simulation study shows that our method is more powerful than the independent approach, and has substantially better controlled type I error rates than the Bayesian hierarchical model. ^ Motivated by the heterogeneity feature of basket trials, we propose a Bayesian latent subgroup trial (BLAST) design to accommodate such treatment heterogeneity across cancer types. We assume that a cancer type may belong to the sensitive subgroup, which is responsive to the treatment, or the insensitive subgroup, which is not responsive to the treatment. Conditional on the latent subgroup membership of the cancer type, we jointly model the binary treatment response and the longitudinal biomarker measurement that represents the biological activity of the targeted agent. The BLAST design makes the interim go/no-go treatment decision in a group sequential fashion for each cancer type based on accumulating data. The simulation study shows that the BLAST design outperforms existing trial designs. It yields high power to detect the treatment effect for sensitive cancer types that are responsive to the treatment, and maintains a reasonable type I error rate for insensitive cancer types that are not responsive to the treatment. ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{genomics}} era, {{our main}} {{goal should be}} to identify large and meaningful differences in small, molecularly selected groups of patients. Classical phase I, II and III models for drug development require large resources, limiting the number of experimental agents that can be tested and making the evaluation of targeted agents inefficient. There is an urgent need to streamline the development of new compounds, with the aim of identifying “trials designed to learn”, which could lead to subsequent “trials designed to conclude”. <b>Basket</b> <b>trials</b> are often viewed as parallel phase II trials within the same entity, designed {{on the basis of a}} common denominator, which can be a molecular alteration(s). Most <b>basket</b> <b>trials</b> are histology-independent and aberration-specific clinical trials. Umbrella trials are built on a centrally performed molecular portrait and molecularly selected cohorts with matched drugs, and can include patients’ randomisation and strategy validation. Beyond new designs, new end-points and new evaluation techniques are also warranted to finally achieve methodology and clinical improvements, in particular within immunotherapy trials...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} of the BAsel Stent Kosten-Effektivitäts <b>Trial</b> (<b>BASKET)</b> the <b>trials</b> {{and their impact on}} {{coronary}} stenting practice were examined, basing the clinical questions of each study on the findings of the previous study. Are the new drug-eluting stents (DES) cost-effective compared to standard bare-metal stents (BMS) if used in all patients? No. Are there specific subgroups of patients with a particular benefit? Yes. A "targeted stent use" was proposed for daily practice. What is the long-term safety of DES? Unexpected safety problems were observed. Was this a chance finding? No. However, with improved stenting techniques, newer stents and intensified antiplatelet regimens late problems were minimised as shown in the BASKET-PROspective Validation Examination (BASKET-PROVE). Further stent developments? Wait and see! - Many additional questions were raised and answered or are still under investigation. Obviously, answers were not always simple and needed a closer look and this is discussed. The <b>BASKET</b> <b>trials</b> proceeded not only from one question to the other, but also in size and methodology. From the restricted single-centre "local" BASKET study to multicentre international long-term trials, all prospective, randomized and investigator-driven. Their relevance was acknowledged by publications in major medical journals as well as by their impact on US and European practice guidelines and on DES research. These aspects are summarised in the present review, highlighting lessons learned from each study and commenting on the possibilities and difficulties of performing such clinical research in Switzerland...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Molecular {{alterations}} in neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (NTRK) genes {{have been identified}} in several solid tumors including lung cancer. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggested their potential role as oncogenic drivers and predictive biomarkers for targeted inhibition, leading to the clinical development of a new class of compounds blocking the NTRK molecular pathway, which are currently undner early clinical investigation. Area covered: This review describes the biology of the NTRK pathway and its molecular {{alterations in}} lung cancer. It focuses on the pre-clinical and clinical development of emerging NTRK inhibitors, which have shown very promising activity in early phase I studies. Expert opinion: Among the several NTRK-inhibitors, entrectinib and LOXO- 101 are those in more advanced stage of clinical development. Both agents have shown encouraging activity along with a tolerable safety profile in patients with different solid tumors harboring NTRK-fusions, emerging as new promising therapeutic options for molecularly selected patients with advanced Trk-driven lung cancers. Results from ongoing phase II <b>basket</b> <b>trials</b> are eagerly awaited...|$|R

Interim results from two ongoing phase 1 trials have been recently reported at the 2016 AACR American Association for Cancer Research Conference in April 2016: among the patients treated with entrectinib, four patients had tumors harboring NTRK fusions, including patients with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC), mCRC, salivary gland cancer, and astrocytoma.|$|R
40|$|High-throughput {{technologies}} of molecular profiling in cancer, such as gene-expression profiling and next-generation sequencing, are expanding {{our knowledge of}} the molecular landscapes of several cancer types. This increasing knowledge coupled with the development of several molecularly targeted agents hold the promise for personalized cancer medicine to be fully realized. Moreover, an expanding armamentarium of targeted agents has been approved for the treatment of specific molecular cancer subgroups in different diagnoses. According to this paradigm, treatment selection should be dictated by the specific molecular aberrations found in each patient's tumor. The classical clinical trials paradigm of patients' eligibility being based on clinicopathologic parameters is being abandoned, with current clinical trials enrolling patients on the basis of specific molecular aberrations. New, innovative trial designs have been generated to better tackle the multiple challenges induced by the increasing molecular fragmentation of cancer, namely: (1) longitudinal cohort studies with or without downstream trials, (2) studies assessing the clinical utility of molecular profiling, (3) master or umbrella <b>trials,</b> (4) <b>basket</b> <b>trials,</b> (5) N-of- 1 trials, and (6) adaptive design trials. This article provides an overview of the challenges for clinical trials in the era of molecular profiling of cancer. Subsequently, innovative trial designs with respective examples and their potential to expedite efficient clinical development of targeted anticancer agents is discussed.

40|$|Background: Innovative trial {{designs are}} sought to {{streamline}} drug development in rare diseases. Basket- and integrated protocol designs {{are two of}} these new strategies and have been applied in a handful oncologic trials. We have taken the concept {{outside the realm of}} oncology and report about a first-in-human integrated protocol design that facilitates the transition from phase Ia in healthy volunteers to phase Ib in patients with rare complement-mediated disorders driven by the classical pathway. Results: We have been conducting a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled first-in-human study with TNT 009, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the C 1 s subunit of human complement component C 1. The trial consisted of three subparts, including normal healthy volunteers (part one and two) and a single cohort of patients in part three. Patients suffered from various complement-mediated diseases sharing the same pathophysiological mechanism, i. e. bullous pemphigoid, antibody-mediated rejection of organ transplants, cold agglutinin disease and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Primary objective of the trial has been to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TNT 009 in humans. Conclusions: This trial provides probably the first example that <b>basket</b> <b>trials</b> may not be limited to single genetic aberrations, which is overly restrictive, but our trial design demonstrates that pathway specificity is a viable paradigm for defining baskets. This will hopefully serve as a role model that could benefit other innovative drug development programs targeting rare diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{landscape}} for early phase cancer clinical trials is changing dramatically {{due to the}} advent of targeted therapy. Increasingly, new drugs are designed to work against a target such {{as the presence of}} a specific tumor mutation. Since typically only a small proportion of cancer patients will possess the mutational target, but the mutation is present in many different cancers, a new class of <b>basket</b> <b>trials</b> is emerging, whereby the drug is tested simultaneously in different baskets, i. e., sub-groups of different tumor types. Investigators not only desire to test whether the drug works, but also to determine which types of tumors are sensitive to the drug. A natural strategy is to conduct parallel trials, with the drug’s effectiveness being tested separately, using for example, the popular Simon two-stage design independently in each basket. The work presented is motivated by the premise that the efficiency of this strategy can be improved by assessing the homogeneity of the baskets’ response rates at an interim analysis and aggregating the baskets in the second stage if the results suggest the drug might be effective in all or most baskets. Via simulations we assess the relative efficiencies of the two strategies. Since the operating characteristics depend on how many tumor types are sensitive to the drug, there is no uniformly efficient strategy. However, our investigation demonstrates substantial efficiencies are possible if the drug works in most or all baskets, at the cost of modest losses of power if the drug works in only a single basket...|$|R
30|$|The centennial {{success of}} {{pediatric}} oncology {{was based on}} the multidisciplinary approach involving less mutilating surgery in a neo-adjuvant setting as well the cytotoxic modalities of mutagenic cell toxins (e.g., war-agent derivatives) and ionizing radiation with ensuing long-term toxicity in cancer survivors. Disruptive high-throughput technologies may provide an urgently needed paradigm shift here. The current concept of randomized trials may not fully appreciate the heterogeneity of increasingly subdivided entities and is being replaced by individualized therapies according to genomic and other high throughput analyses. This individualization implies the risk that the efficacy (and even more superiority) of these novel therapies may be difficult to prove when only a few patients are treated with a specific treatment regimen. These challenges have to be addressed by novel study concepts, including adaptive design, <b>basket</b> and umbrella <b>trials,</b> establishing surrogate endpoints (e.g., biomarkers) as well as multi-modal high throughput molecular analyses of individual patients. This individualization of therapy will put the individual patient into the focus of research.|$|R
40|$|Renal cell cancer (RCC) is {{characterized}} by histological and molecular heterogeneity that may account for variable response to targeted therapies. We evaluated retrospectively with a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach using a pre-designed cancer panel the mutation burden of 32 lesions from 22 metastatic RCC patients treated {{with at least one}} tyrosine kinase or mTOR inhibitor. We identified mutations in the VHL, PTEN, JAK 3, MET, ERBB 4, APC, CDKN 2 A, FGFR 3, EGFR, RB 1, TP 53 genes. Somatic alterations were correlated with response to therapy. Most mutations hit VHL 1 (31, 8 %) followed by PTEN (13, 6 %), JAK 3, FGFR and TP 53 (9 % each). Eight (36 %) patients were wild-type at least for the genes included in the panel. A genotype concordance between primary RCC and its secondary lesion was found in 3 / 6 cases. Patients were treated with Sorafenib, Sunitinib and Temsirolimus with partial responses in 4 (18, 2 %) and disease stabilization in 7 (31, 8 %). Among the 4 partial responders, 1 (25 %) was wild-type and 3 (75 %) harbored different VHL 1 variants. Among the 7 patients with disease stabilization 2 (29 %) were wild-type, 2 (29 %) PTEN mutated, and single patients (14 % each) displayed mutations in VHL 1, JAK 3 and APC/CDKN 2 A. Among the 11 non-responders 7 (64 %) were wild-type, 2 (18 %) were p 53 mutated and 2 (18 %) VHL 1 mutated. No significant associations were found among RCC histotype, mutation variants and response to therapies. In the absence of predictive biomarkers for metastatic RCC treatment, a NGS approach may address single patients to <b>basket</b> clinical <b>trials</b> according to actionable molecular specific alterations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Based on a {{subgroup}} {{analysis of}} 18 -month BAsel Stent Kosten Effektivitäts <b>Trial</b> (<b>BASKET)</b> outcome data, {{we hypothesized that}} very late (< 12 months) stent thrombosis occurs predominantly after drug-eluting stent implantation in large native coronary vessel stenting. METHODS: To prove or refute this hypothesis, we set up an 11 -center 4 -country prospective trial of 2260 consecutive patients treated with < or = 3. 0 -mm stents only, randomized to receive Cypher (Johnson; Johnson, Miami Lakes, FL), Vision (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Laboratories, IL), or Xience stents (Abbott Vascular). Only patients with left main or bypass graft disease, in-stent restenosis or stent thrombosis, in need of nonheart surgery, at increased bleeding risk, without compliance/consent are excluded. All patients are treated with dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months. The primary end point will be cardiac death/nonfatal myocardial infarction after 24 months with further follow-up up to 5 years. RESULTS: By June 12, 229 patients (10 % of the planned total) were included with a baseline risk {{similar to that of}} the same subgroup of BASKET (n = 588). CONCLUSIONS: This study will answer several important questions of contemporary stent use in patients with large native vessel stenting. The 2 -year death/myocardial infarction-as well as target vessel revascularization-and bleeding rates in these patients with a first- versus second-generation drug-eluting stent should demonstrate the benefit or harm of these stents compared to cobalt-chromium bare-metal stents in this relevant, low-risk group of everyday patients. In addition, a comparison with similar BASKET patients will allow to estimate the impact of 12 - versus 6 -month dual antiplatelet therapy on these outcomes...|$|R
