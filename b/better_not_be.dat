Claudia Black and Michael Shanks protested against this intended story, as Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at arms length because {{of the fear of}} getting too close." [...] Cooper rewrote the scene to show Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel share his true feelings of a relationship. The actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character. The scene was rehearsed a lot and was filmed over the course of six hours. Cooper was nevertheless concerned that Daniel appeared too edgy and mean, although his feelings were motivated by the two years of torment with Vala, and losing his wife nearly ten years before. Daniel's line, [...] "You <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> messing with me", was only said in one take by Michael Shanks. Since Cooper prefers to follow up on such emotional scenes with a laugh, the immediate next scene shows Vala coming out of Daniel's room, where she encounters a disbelieving Mitchell jogging by. In Cooper's mind, Daniel held a crying Vala in another scene because she had gotten pregnant and had lost the baby. To contrast the obvious relationship between Daniel and Vala, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge subtly played their scenes as if their characters also had a romantic relationship.|$|E

In September 2011, Rihanna again took to the social networking site {{to confirm that the}} plans had been scrapped, with the singer tweeting [...] "I [...] a , but LOUD is its own body of work! Plus [...] guys work so hard that [...] deserve to act brand new". On September 19, 2011, Rihanna further provoked excitement amongst her followers when she posted that she was listening to the song, only to be re-tweeted by Calvin Harris, who replied [...] "Sometimes it feels like we find love in the most hopeless place", suggesting that his response contained possible lyrics from the song. In an interview with Capital FM, Harris – who produced the track – explained that followers of Rihanna had sent messages to him regarding their expectations of the song, saying [...] "The song <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> rubbish", which he interpreted as slightly threatening, but {{went on to say that}} [...] "it's all part of the fun". In an interview for Q magazine, Harris said of the lyric, [...] "we found love in a hopeless place," [...] "It could have been Jumpin Jaks in Dumfries (Harris' home town), I don't know exactly what I was thinking about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gray was a keen {{student of}} medieval history, {{and in time}} came to make a {{particular}} study of the oldest Welsh poetry, though without actually learning the language. [...] Several pages of his commonplace books are devoted to notes on Welsh prosody, and he also mentioned there a legend, now considered quite unhistorical, which he had come across in Thomas Carte's A General History of England (1747–1755). [...] When Edward I conquered Wales, [...] "he is said", wrote Gray, [...] "to have hanged up all their Bards, because they encouraged the Nation to rebellion, but their works (we see), still remain, the Language (tho' decaying) still lives, {{and the art of}} their versification is known, and practised to this day among them". [...] Gray also studied early Scandinavian literature, and found in one Old Norse poem the refrain [...] "'Vindum vindum/ Vef Darradar'", which was to reappear in The Bard as [...] "Weave the warp and weave the woof". [...] In 1755 he began work on The Bard, and by August of that year had completed two thirds of the poem. [...] Initially he worked with a speed and a sense of identification that were both unusual for him. [...] "I felt myself the Bard", he declared. [...] But composing the third and final strophe proved more difficult, and he eventually ground to a halt. [...] For two years the poem remained unfinished, but then in 1757 he attended a concert by John Parry, a blind harpist who claimed that the traditional Welsh harp repertoire went back as far as the druids. [...] Gray was so inspired by this experience that he returned to The Bard with new enthusiasm, and was soon able to tell his friend William Mason, [...] "Mr Parry, you must know, has set my Ode in motion again, and has brought it at last to a conclusion." [...] Gray sold the copyright of this poem and of his [...] "The Progress of Poesy" [...] to the publisher Robert Dodsley for 40 guineas, and Dodsley issued them together under the title Odes by Mr. Gray. [...] The book was printed by Gray's friend Horace Walpole who had just set up a printing press at his home, Strawberry Hill, and who had set his heart on inaugurating the enterprise with Gray's poems. [...] The Odes were published on 8 August 1757 as a handsome quarto, with a print run of 2000 copies priced at one shilling. [...] Walpole prevailed on Gray to add four footnotes to The Bard for the first edition, though Gray told Walpole, [...] "I do not love notes…They are signs of weakness and obscurity. [...] If a thing cannot be understood without them, it had <b>better</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> understood at all." [...] These proved, for many readers, inadequate to explain the poem, and Gray complacently wrote to Mason [...] "nobody understands me, and I am perfectly satisfied." [...] Rather against his will, he was persuaded to add a few more notes for the 1768 edition.|$|E
