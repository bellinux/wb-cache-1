40|$|Regional data {{needed for}} {{effective}} stream restoration include hydraulic geometry relationships (i. e., regional curves) and reference channel morphology parameters. Increasingly ecological conditions are being considered when designing, implementing, and assessing restoration efforts. We provide morphology relationships and associated ecological endpoint curves for reference streams in the Alabama piedmont. Twenty-one reference stream reaches {{were identified in}} the Tallapoosa drainage of Alabama, ranging from 0. 2 to 242 km 2 <b>drainage</b> <b>area.</b> Geomorphic surveys were conducted in each stream to measure riffle cross-sections and longitudinal profiles and related to <b>drainage</b> <b>area</b> to develop regional curves. Fish, crayfish, and benthic macroinvertebrates were collected from each surveyed reach and related to <b>drainage</b> <b>area</b> and geomorphic data to provide associated biological community endpoints. Bankfull channel cross-section area, width, mean depth, and estimated discharge were strongly correlated to watershed <b>drainage</b> <b>area,</b> similar to efforts {{in other areas of}} the Piedmont ecoregion.

3000|$|Because of {{the short}} spacing between fractures, {{intermediate}} radial flow regime which represents the radial flow toward each fracture from nearby <b>drainage</b> <b>area</b> cannot be observed. In addition, the small <b>drainage</b> <b>area</b> means that the pressure pulse reaches the boundary after short production time. Therefore, there is no enough time for the pseudo-radial flow to fully develop. The dominated flow regimes in this case are the early linear flow which represents the flow from the <b>drainage</b> <b>areas</b> between fractures toward them and the pseudo-steady-state flow which represents {{the effect of the}} reservoirs boundary.|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the factors which influence the direct drainage from the <b>drainage</b> <b>area.</b> The thesis specifically {{deals with the}} <b>drainage</b> <b>area</b> of the Kopaninský brook. Drainage is always influenced by several factors at the same time. These factors are above all climate, anthropogenic impact, underdrainage, shape and extent of a <b>drainage</b> <b>area,</b> land use, geologic structure, location and altitude of a <b>drainage</b> <b>area.</b> The direct <b>drainage</b> can be separated by different methods (modificated semi-graphical method, GROUND method, method of hydrogram separation, method of digitals filtres) or CN- curves can be used for calculation. This thesis used the method of CN curves to process the results of a given <b>drainage</b> <b>area.</b> In the methodical part of the thesis I reached to the creation of direct drainage maps with the utilisation of the BPEJ maps together with the input data gained by the method of CN curves. These outputs were created at different values of design rains repetition time N= 2, 10, 50 and 100 years. The volume of a direct drainage was calculated by a classic method and by a method using the ArcMap programme. Another part of the thesis was simulation of different area utilisation situations (real condition versus grassing of ploughland) and saturation of <b>drainage</b> <b>area,</b> or more precisely water content in soil (dry soil, middle dry soil, wet soil) ...|$|R
