500|$|Crookedstar's Promise was {{released}} on 5 July 2011. It {{takes place at the}} same time as Bluestar's Prophecy and details the life of Crookedstar, initially Stormkit. As a kit, Stormkit falls into the river after he sneaks out of camp and attempts to chase ThunderClan medicine cat Goosefeather away from Sunningrocks, a part of RiverClan territory (at the time). This leads him to break his jaw on a rock. [...] Rainflower, Stormkit's mother, rejects Stormkit due to his disfigured appearance and demands that RiverClan leader Hailstar perform a renaming ceremony to rename Stormkit to Crookedkit. Feeling rejected, Crookedkit is visited in a dream by Mapleshade, a Dark Forest cat who allows Crookedkit to believe that she is from StarClan. She tells him that she can give him anything he wants as long as he is faithful to his Clan and puts all other things aside. Crookedkit quickly accepts this promise, believing it not to be a difficult promise, as he was already loyal to his Clan, and believes that Mapleshade can help him become leader. Mapleshade then uses Crookedkit's promise to seemingly bring about the deaths of Crookedkit's loved ones. When Crookedjaw is chasing away a dog, the dog knocks his mother, Rainflower, into a river, and she hits her head on rocks. Mapleshade urges Crookedjaw to focus on the dog instead of bringing his mother to the medicine cat, and she dies. Crookedjaw then becomes deputy upon his father Shellheart's retirement; shortly after, Shellheart dies of a lump in his stomach. Not long after, Hailstar loses his last life while fighting rats in a barn: although Mapleshade urges him to not protect Hailstar so he can become leader, Crookedjaw ignores her, having discovered that she is actually from the Dark Forest. Nonetheless, Hailstar is killed. Despite his insistence that she stay away from him, Mapleshade continues to haunt Crookedstar: his mate, Willowbreeze, dies of a respiratory infection days after giving birth to his three kits, and two of the kits die as well. When Crookedstar confronts Mapleshade, she reveals that she had once been the mate of Crookedstar's great-grandfather. Mapleshade had been a ThunderClan cat, while her mate had been from RiverClan: Mapleshade is rejected by her Clan for taking a forbidden mate, then loses the kits in the river when she attempts to bring them to RiverClan. Her mate blames her for letting the kits drown in the river, and RiverClan, too, rejects Mapleshade. As a result, Mapleshade vows revenge on her mates descendants, one of whom is Crookedstar. When Crookedstar finally reveals his promise and his belief that it caused the deaths of his loved ones, to his medicine cat <b>Brambleberry,</b> she argues that the deaths were not in fact Mapleshade's fault. Following the conclusion of the novel, Oakheart is killed, then in the manga feature, Silverstream, Crookedstar's only remaining kit, dies after giving birth to Graystripe of ThunderClan's kits. Mapleshade asserts that these deaths were her doing as well, but Crookedstar tells Mapleshade that she has failed to punish him, as his loved ones live on in StarClan, while she has no one. Finally, Crookedstar dies as well. A sad ending, but it has to fit in with the rest of the series.|$|E

5000|$|Two main {{kinds of}} downstep can be distinguished. The first, more usually called {{automatic}} downstep, downdrift or catathesis, occurs when {{high and low}} tones come in the sequence H L (L) H; the second high tone tends to be lower than the first because of the intervening low toned syllable. That phenomenon is common in African languages, such as Chichewa. [...] It has also been argued that the same phenomenon causes English sentences, such as I really believe Ebenezer was a dealer in magnesium or I bought blueberries, bayberries, raspberries, mulberries, and <b>brambleberries</b> (if the sentences are pronounced with a falling intonation), to fall gradually in pitch, with each accented syllable (here underlined) slightly lower than the last.|$|R

On Deudermont's return to Waterdeep, he meets with Lord <b>Brambleberry</b> of Waterdeep, {{and the two of them}} decide to stop Arklem Greeth and his pirate crews.|$|E

5000|$|In British English, a [...] "bramble" [...] is any rough (usually wild) tangled prickly shrub—specifically the {{blackberry}} bush (Rubus fruticosus)—or any hybrid of similar appearance, with thorny stems. Bramble or <b>brambleberry</b> may also {{refer to the}} blackberry fruit or products of its fruit (e.g., bramble jelly). [...] The shrub grows abundantly {{in all parts of}} the British Isles and harvesting the fruits in late summer and autumn is often considered a favourite pastime. It can also become a nuisance in gardens, sending down its strong suckering roots amongst hedges and shrubs. Many consider it a weed due its tendency to grow in neglected areas and its sharp, tough thorns which can be hazardous to children and pets.|$|E

40|$|SummaryTo {{accommodate}} the large cells following zygote formation, early blastomeres employ modified cell divisions. Karyomeres are one such modification, mitotic intermediates wherein individual chromatin masses {{are surrounded by}} nuclear envelope; the karyomeres then fuse to form a single mononucleus. We identified <b>brambleberry,</b> a maternal-effect zebrafish mutant that disrupts karyomere fusion, resulting in formation of multiple micronuclei. As karyomeres form, <b>Brambleberry</b> protein localizes to the nuclear envelope, with prominent puncta evident near karyomere-karyomere interfaces corresponding to membrane fusion sites. <b>brambleberry</b> corresponds to an unannotated gene with similarity to Kar 5 p, a protein that participates in nuclear fusion in yeast. We also demonstrate that <b>Brambleberry</b> is required for pronuclear fusion following fertilization in zebrafish. Our studies {{provide insight into the}} machinery required for karyomere fusion and suggest that specialized proteins are necessary for proper nuclear division in large dividing blastomeres...|$|E
30|$|The {{fruit of}} the Rubus adenotrichos Schltdl. species is {{commonly}} known as blackberry or <b>brambleberry</b> and its habitat is found in the mountain regions of Mexico, Ecuador and Costa Rica (Martínez-Cruz et al. 2011). The main polyphenols that are comprised in the Rubus adenotrichos Schltdl. blackberry are cyanidin 3 -glucoside, cyanidin- 3 -malonyl glucoside, lambertianin C and sanguiin H- 6 (Azofeifa et al. 2013). Recent research have determined that this species originated from Costa Rica, and presents high antioxidant contents (Acosta-Montoya et al. 2010; Mertz et al. 2009). Moreover, the protective effect of blackberry (Rubus adenotrichos Schltdl.) juice has been established against human epidermal cell, as well as in a reconstructed model of skin damaged by UVB radiation (Calvo-Castro et al. 2014). However, all the studies have been performed with the fruit or the juice, and the production of these compounds through biotechnological techniques has not been explored.|$|E
