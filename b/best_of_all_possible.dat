5|$|Typical to {{variations}} of the Irenaean theodicy {{is the notion that}} the present world is the greatest possible world, or the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds.

5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E

500|$|Firstly, {{the concept}} of {{adaptation}} is itself controversial, {{as it can be}} taken to imply, as the evolutionary biologists Stephen J.

However, all that evolutionary biology requires is the weaker claim that one trait is at least slightly better in a certain context than another, and hence is selected for.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new technique for generating more efficient networks by systematically interlacing bypass rings to torus networks (iBT networks). The resulting network can improve the original torus network by reducing the network diameter, node-to-node distances, and by increasing the bisection width without increasing wiring and other engineering complexity. We present and analyze the statement that a 3 D iBT network proposed by our technique outperforms 4 D torus networks of the same node degree. We found that interlacing rings of sizes 6 and 12 to <b>all</b> three dimensions <b>of</b> a torus network with meshes 30 × 30 × 36 generates the <b>best</b> network <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> networks, including 4 D torus and hypercube of approximately 32, 000 nodes.

500|$|Interestingly, this {{critique}} of Voltaire's {{seems to be}} directed almost exclusively at Leibnizian optimism. Candide does not ridicule Voltaire's contemporary Alexander Pope, a later optimist of slightly different convictions. Candide does not discuss Pope's optimistic principle that [...] "all is right", but Leibniz's that states, [...] "this is the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds". However subtle {{the difference between the}} two, Candide is unambiguous as to which is its subject. Some critics conjecture that Voltaire meant to spare Pope this ridicule out of respect, although Voltaire's Poème may have been written as a more direct response to Pope's theories. This work is similar to Candide in subject matter, but very different from it in style: the Poème embodies a more serious philosophical argument than Candide.|$|E
500|$|In Voltaire's Candide, Dr. Pangloss {{is portrayed}} as a clueless scholar who, despite the evidence, insists that [...] "all is for the best in this <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds". Gould and Lewontin {{asserted}} that it is Panglossian for evolutionary biologists to view all traits as atomized things that had been naturally selected for, and criticised biologists for not granting theoretical space to other causes, such as phyletic and developmental constraints. The relative frequency of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features in nature, remains a controversial topic in evolutionary biology. An illustrative example of Gould's approach {{can be found in}} Elisabeth Lloyd's case study suggesting that the female orgasm is a by-product of shared developmental pathways. Gould also wrote on this topic in his essay [...] "Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples" [...] prompted by Lloyd's earlier work.|$|E
500|$|Voltaire {{actively}} rejected Leibnizian optimism {{after the}} natural disaster, {{convinced that if}} this were the best possible world, it should surely be better than it is. In both Candide and Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne ("Poem on the Lisbon Disaster"), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief. He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both Candide and his Poème to argue this point, sarcastically describing the catastrophe {{as one of the most}} horrible disasters [...] "in the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds". Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and Candide, has analysed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event. Wade speculates that Voltaire's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work Relation historique du Tremblement de Terre survenu à Lisbonne by Ange Goudar.|$|E

A straightforward method called multiple-choice sequence (MCS) is proposed in [20]. The data symbol is element-wise produced {{by a set of}} vectors. The product that yields the lowest OOBE is chosen as the mapping output. The information that shows which vector is chosen should also be known by the receiver as the overhead for each symbol. Another method is called CE [13]. It increases the constellation points so that there are multiple choices for each subcarrier input. The <b>best</b> combination <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> inputs is chosen to minimize the OOBE. The minimum distance of the constellation points is reduced as the points increase, so the BER performance would become worse. Another scheme called N-continuous symbol mapping is proposed in [17]. Instead of designing a precoding matrix, N-continuous symbol mapping designs a perturbation vector depending on the current and the previous symbols so that the corresponding time-domain symbols have continuous values and derivatives everywhere. Since the perturbation vector may not be correctly estimated at the receiver, an iterative decoder is used.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the behavior of}} the limited memory L-BFGS algorithm as a representative constraint-free gradient-based algorithm which is used for multiobjective (MO) dose optimization for intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Using a parameter transformation, the positivity constraint problem of negative beam fluences is entirely eliminated: a feature which to date has not been fully understood by all investigators. We analyze the global convergence properties of L-BFGS by searching for the existence and the influence of possible local minima. With a fast simulated annealing algorithm FSA we examine whether the L-BFGS solutions are globally optimal. The three examples used in our analysis are a brain tumor, a prostate tumor and a test case with a C-shaped PTV. In one percent of the optimizations global convergence is violated. A simple mechanism practically eliminates the influence of local minima and the obtained solutions are globally optimal. A single-objective dose optimization requires less than 4 seconds for 5400 parameters and 40000 sampling points. The elimination of the problem of negative beam fluences and the high computational speed permits constraint-free gradient-based optimization algorithms to be used for MO dose optimization. In this situation, a representative spectrum of possible solutions is obtained which contains information such as the trade-off between the objectives and range of dose values. Using simple decision making tools the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the <b>possible</b> solutions can be chosen. We perform MO dose optimization for the three examples and compare the spectra of solutions, firstly using recommended critical dose values for the organs at risk and secondly, setting these dose values to zero...|$|R
40|$|In the era Voltaire criticized Leibnizian {{optimism}} and Rousseau defended {{it on the}} occasion of the disaster of Lisbon, the theological thought that God chose and created the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the <b>possible</b> worlds certainly deserved criticizing or defending. However, after Auschwitz had made the idea of theodicy completely futile, as Levinas put it, could it be of any use to discuss the significance of Leibnizian optimism in our time? In reality the question that should be raised is rather why catastrophic disasters never fail to recall some kind of theodicies even among people who don' t seem to believe in God any longer. Like other theodicies in general, Leibnizian theodicy had the theoretical functions to relieve people of their intolerable evils and pains, so its substitutes must have been indispensable ever since theodicy in a strict sense lost its validity. As a result, various forms of theodicies in a broader sense that appeared through their modern history, which can be characterized by the "humanization of theodicy" and then by the "naturalization of evils", have now transformed into handy tools of justification and remission largely accompanied by Panglossian optimism. Today, living after Fukushima, we need new theodicy and another optimism, whether we still believe in God or not. My point is that the metaphysical system of Leibniz can offer an effective model of ontology and ethics we are forced to adopt under our current predicaments. In particular, the idea of "re-moralization of evils" by sharing them in common with our monadological relations would be essential for us to realize Leibnizian optimism in its original sense, which will never forget our obligations to others and toward the future...|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} {{historical}} events inspired Voltaire to write Candide, {{most notably the}} publication of Leibniz's [...] "Monadology", a short metaphysical treatise, the Seven Years' War, and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. [...] Both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in Candide and are cited by scholars as reasons for its composition. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, tsunami, and resulting fires of All Saints' Day, had a strong influence on theologians {{of the day and}} on Voltaire, who was himself disillusioned by them. The earthquake had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism, a philosophical system which implies that such events should not occur. Optimism is founded on the theodicy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz that says all is for the best because God is a benevolent deity. This concept is often put into the form, [...] "all is for the best in the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds" [...] (Fr. Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles). Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into the optimist world view.|$|E
500|$|Charles Brockden Brown, {{an early}} American novelist, {{may have been}} {{directly}} affected by Voltaire, whose work he knew well. Mark Kamrath, professor of English, describes {{the strength of the}} connection between Candide and Edgar Huntly; or, Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker (1799): [...] "An unusually large number of parallels...crop up in the two novels, particularly in terms of characters and plot." [...] For instance, the protagonists of both novels are romantically involved with a recently orphaned young woman. Furthermore, in both works the brothers of the female lovers are Jesuits, and each is murdered (although under different circumstances). Some twentieth-century novels that may have been influenced by Candide are dystopian science-fiction works. Armand Mattelart, a French critic, sees Candide in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, three canonical works of the genre. Specifically, Mattelart writes that in each of these works, there exist references to Candides popularisation of the phrase [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds". He cites as evidence, for example, that the French version of Brave New World was entitled Le Meilleur des mondes (En. literally [...] "The best of worlds").|$|E

40|$|Renewable energy forms {{have been}} widely used in the past decades {{highlighting}} a "green" shift in energy production. An actual reason behind this turn to renewable energy production is EU directives which set the Union's targets for energy production from renewable sources, greenhouse gas emissions and increase in energy efficiency.

Towards the fulfillment of 20 - 20 - 20 EU targets, in Greece a specific strategy which promotes the construction of large scale Renewable Energy Source plants is promoted.

Fruits such as açaí berries, blueberries, blackberries, black cherries, Concord grapes, cranberries, and pomegranates are rich in potentially health-supporting polyphenolics, which makes the juices of these fruits attractive for nutraceutical optimization. The compositional, sensory, and stability properties of blueberry, blackberry, and Concord grape juice blends were explored in an extended shelf-life study. Initially, 100 % blueberry juice had the highest total monomeric anthocyanins (67. 40 mg/ 100 mL), 100 % blackberry juice had the highest total phenolics (249. 24 mg/ 100 mL), and 100 % Concord juice had the highest polymeric color (23. 21 %). Consumer-oriented optimization techniques based on a ten-blending-treatment mixture design were compared during a central location test (n= 108). In the validation study (n= 78), the desirability function solution (87 % Concord + 13 % blackberry) achieved the highest overall liking mean (7. 55), {{although it was not}} statistically different than the ideal point solution (9 % blackberry+ 20 % blueberry+ 71 % Concord) (6. 95), the intuitive optimum (66 % Concord+ 34 % blueberry) (6. 9), or 100 % Concord (7. 33). Willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the desirability function solution (87 % Concord + 13 % blackberry) was assessed with a non-hypothetical second-price experimental auction. Random effects regression showed WTP was higher when subjects tasted the product first and then received health information about anthocyanins, which indicates a contrast effect due to treatment order. Choice surveys identified the <b>best</b> blend out <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> combinations <b>of</b> açaí, black cherry, blueberry, Concord grape, cranberry, and pomegranate juices based on antioxidant status and perceived sensory properties. The black cherry, Concord grape, and pomegranate juice blend had the highest marginal utility (x= 0. 51) and was further optimized with sensory affective testing (n= 100). Consumer data was analyzed with a desirability function, and the optimum juice blend was 75 %Con+ 12 %Pom+ 13 %BlkCh based on antioxidant status and sensory properties. WTP for nutraceutical juice based on antioxidant information and sensory properties was evaluated. Average WTP for the juice blend was $ 3. 45, and average overall liking (OL) was 7. 42. WTP and OL were similarly affected by variables not just-about-right (sweetness, black cherry flavor, and bitterness).
