40|$|In a rollover, the lap {{part of the}} 3 -point belt {{certainly}} restrains {{the occupant}} from being fully ejected out of the vehicle, however the upper torso of the far side occupant may slip out of the shoulder belt. In this study the combination of <b>reversed</b> 3 -point <b>belt</b> geometry (seat integrated), inboard torso side-support and buckle pretensioner were evaluated regarding the ability to better restrain the upper torso to the seat to prevent head-to-interior impacts. The method of evaluation, proposed and used in this paper, was a new sled test method simulating full-scale tripped rollovers along the longitudinal axis during the initial phase of tripping, the airborne phase and the first ground impact. The roof was assumed in the tests {{to be able to}} withstand the ground impact. Since car occupants normally are seated with a certain kyfosis and may straighten and elongate their spine, standard HIII ATDs were modified with 3 D-flexible lumbar spines and used in both front seat positions. As a result, the rollover sled test method worked properly with good repeatability. While the head of the non-leading side (far-side) dummy impacted the inner roof in the standard 3 -point belt configuration, the seat integrated 3 -point <b>belt</b> with <b>reversed</b> geometry and buckle pretensioner showed ability to restrain the torso from moving inboard and towards the roof during the rollover tests...|$|R
40|$|Children can modify learned motor skills, such as walking, {{to adapt}} to new environments. Movement errors in these new {{situations}} drive the learning. We used split-belt walking to determine whether size of the error affects the degree of learning. Twenty-two children (aged 2 - 5 y) walked on the split-belt treadmill on two separate days spaced 1 week apart. Twenty-eight adults served as controls. On Day 1, children experienced an abrupt change in belt speeds (from 1 : 1 to 2 : 1 differential) resulting in large errors, or a gradual change (same change in speed over 12 - 15 min), resulting in small errors. Learning {{was measured by the}} size of the aftereffect upon return to a 1 : 1 differential. On Day 2 (1 week later), the leg on the fast <b>belt</b> was <b>reversed,</b> as was the method of introducing the speed differential. We found that the error size did not affect learning. Unexpectedly, learning was greater on Day 2 compared to Day 1, especially for children under 4 y of age, despite the fact that the task was opposite to that of Day 1, and did not influence learning in adults. Hence, 11 additional children under 4 y of age were tested with belts running at the same speed on Day 1, and with a 2 : 1 speed differential (abrupt introduction) on Day 2. Surprisingly, learning was again greater on Day 2. We conclude that size of error during split-belt walking does not affect learning, but experience on a treadmill does, especially for younger children...|$|R
40|$|Monthly {{time series}} of {{nutrient}} pools and transport in the Baltic Entrance {{were computed for}} the period 1974 – 1999 {{from a combination of}} hydrodynamic model results and observational data obtained in national monitoring programmes. Significant seasonal variations in both nutrient pools and transport were found. For example,inflowing dense nutrient-rich Skagerrak water causes net transport of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and inorganic nitrogen (DIN) towards the Baltic during summer where surface concentrations are low. Surface-water concentrations of DIN and DIP increase during winter and the net transport may reverse. The computations indicated that the pools of dissolved inorganic phosphorus and total phosphorus (TP) were larger in the 1980 s than in previous and following decades. Variations in pools of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and total nitrogen (TN) were more irregular throughout the period. Computed nutrient transports likewise exhibited long-term variations. Net transport of DIN and DIP was southward,from the Skagerrak to the Kattegat and further into the Belt Sea,during the 1970 s. In the same period,the transport of DIN and DIP from the Baltic Sea to the Baltic entrance was below average. In both the Kattegat and the <b>Belt</b> Sea transports <b>reversed</b> during the 1980 s. In the 1990 s the southward transport of DIP was restored,but the transport of DIN was not restored to the same extent. Between the Kattegat and the Skagerrak the transport diminished while the Belt Sea continued to export DIN to the Kattegat. Northward transports of TN and TP persisted throughout the period. A notable maximum TP transport was found to have taken place during the 1980 s...|$|R
40|$|In {{northern}} Istria certain structural particularities {{exist that}} till now were not explained,and {{some of them}} not even known. They are all associated with underthrusting of the Adriatic microplate (Istra) under the Dinarides. The Rokava fault of cross-dinaricdirection was discovered that exerts an important influence on hydrographic pattern {{in this part of}} Istria. The cross-dinaric sinistral strike-slip faults above Glinščica stream (Rosandra) are of local importance only, since at Kastelec and Črni Kal the dextral strikeslip faults of NNW-SSE direction occur as their conjugated equivalents. This particular feature has been named the Gročana (Grozzana) structure. The reason for such a structure is the echelon folding (complete folding) in the Istrian hinterland (the Kras-Notranjsko folded structure). In the Tinjan area a wedge shaped block occurs between two thrust faults that are turned up and quite steep owing to secondary folding. The wedge is open northwestward, and the flysch beds within it are folded in the cross-dinaric direction. Theyrepresent an indication of lateral squeezing in a limited area, since in the close-by roadcut of the Ankaran–Trieste motorway no trace of these folds remains (the Tinjan structure). In the Izola and Strunjan area a complex overthrust structure is present that rapidly wedges out toward central Istria. Indirect data suggest that it extends northwestward below the Bay of Trieste. The elements of this structure are the Izola thrust fault with Izolaanticline in the thrust block, and folds at Strunjan that were formed in the <b>belt</b> between the <b>reverse</b> overthrusts in the Strunjan bay and Izola thrust fault area (the Strunjan structure) ...|$|R
5000|$|The David Clinton {{incarnation}} of Chronos {{appears in the}} two-part Justice League Unlimited animated series episode [...] "The Once and Future Thing" [...] voiced by Peter MacNicol. A meek physics professor from the Batman Beyond era, he was ostracized by his peers for his theories on time travel but secretly perfected a time-traveling device. Aware {{of the problems of}} time paradoxes, he uses the device to add to his collection of rare artifacts, stealing the items from the past at the points when they would no longer be missed (e.g. Cleopatra's comb, an early draft of the Magna Carta, etc.). Eventually, the incessant hectoring from his wife Enid Clinton (voiced by Mindy Sterling) drove him to retreat into the past. While trying to steal Batman's utility belt, he attracts the attention of Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern so he tries to escape and they follow him and are accidentally pulled into the Old West. In the time between his arrival and theirs, Clinton's time belt was stolen by local villain Tobias Manning and used it to steal future technology and take over the town. After the three League members as well as several Western heroes (consisting of Jonah Hex, Bat Lash, El Diablo and Ohiyesa Smith) defeat Manning, Clinton tricked Batman into enabling him to get the belt and retreated into his time. Now power-hungry and increasingly unstable, he makes himself [...] "the undisputed master of space and time" [...] while adopting his Chronos identity. After following Chronos to the Batman Beyond era, the three Leaguers discover that his trips through time have severely impacted the timeline; the Titanic and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are situated alongside Gotham's architecture, amongst other bizarre things. The three Leaguers also find that Chronos has allied with the third brand of the Jokerz. Chronos's irresponsible actions are causing time to collapse. After Wonder Woman was erased from existence, Batman and Green Lantern team up with the remaining roster of the JLU: Warhawk, Static, Batman II and the future version of Bruce Wayne. Now fearful, Enid leads the combined Justice League to the Old West jail that Chronos had brought to the future where he slept every night (presumably because his six months in the jail cell were a vacation away from his nagging wife and far more comfortable to him). After a pitched battle where Static and Batman II are killed and Warhawk barely survived, only Batman, Green Lantern and Chronos are left unincapitated. As time begins to fall apart all around them, Chronos escapes into the timestream intending to return to the beginning of time to reset and make himself into a god. When the two heroes catch up with him, Batman inserts a disc into Chronos's <b>belt</b> that <b>reverses</b> everything that had happened just before they reach the Beginning. With the timeline restored, Green Lantern and Batman return to the present day (retaining the memories of their experience but Wonder Woman does not) while Clinton himself is stuck in a permanent time-loop of the last few seconds of his life before the whole chain started, which happens to be his wife Enid berating him for all eternity (a la Groundhog Day).|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of cooling}} age {{patterns}} yielded by lowtemperature thermochronometers provides key {{information about the}} role played by tectonic discontinuities during the late stages of exhumation of metamorphic belts. In the Western Alps, fission track data published so far are heterogeneously scattered and concentrated in few structural domains, preventing analyses at the scale of the whole belt. The new apatite fission track data reported in this work, obtained with the external detector method as well as the population method in very low U content samples, fill this gap. They constrain the postmetamorphic evolution of the Western Alps along two transects from the foreland to the retroforeland, unraveling the effective role played by some major faults during the exhumation of the belt at shallow crustal levels. A clear regional pattern, characterized by decreasing ages moving from the axial sector to the European external sector of the belt and by an along-strike gradient with increasing ages from north to south, has been unraveled. Evident breaks in this age pattern have been detected in correspondence of faults that are near-parallel to the trend of the belt, pointing to the occurrence of active tectonics during and after exhumation. The most apparent breaks have been observed in the axial sector of the belt, where the postmetamorphic deformation would have been negligible according to classic tectonic models. Faults located in the axial sector split the belt into two major blocks (eastern and western). Since the Miocene, the western block experienced higher exhumation rates than the eastern one. Such differential exhumation was accommodated in the northern portion of the <b>belt</b> thanks to <b>reverse</b> motion along the Internal Houiller Fault, which occurred in a convergent transcurrent framework. To the south, it was accommodated instead by normal reactivation of the Brianc¸onnais Front and by activity of the Longitudinal Fault System, which occurred in a divergent transcurrent framework. The tectonic activity affecting the axial sector of the belt, in a context of regional dextral strike slip, is coeval with the forward propagation of the external thrusts, and of similar magnitude. We suggest that the contrasting kinematic regimes (i. e., convergent versus divergent transcurrence) observed in the Western Alps moving along strike were responsible of the increasing exhumation rates toward the north, revealed in both blocks by the along-strike age gradient. The higher exhumation rates recognized northward would be related to an increasing importance of crustal shortening that promoted erosion during the late stages of exhumation of the belt...|$|R
40|$|This thesis' {{work has}} been {{conducted}} at and made possible by Autoliv Sverige AB in Vårgårda. The aim of this thesis is to study how the occupant experience of the belt changes when it is moved from a traditional installation point in the car's B-pillar, to the seat. This shall be studied {{in terms of how}} the perceived comfort is influenced by a belt in seat in an upright and a reclined seat back position of 20 and 45 degrees, for different sizes of occupants. Also how the ability to reach a belt in seat is affected by the size and mobility of the occupant. Based on this new knowledge, an optimal outlet position for a belt in seat shall be proposed, from a comfort perspective. The work has used a cross-sectional research approach to achieve its purpose. Through the cross-sectional approach, several different qualitative and quantitative methods have been used. Initially, a literature study where subjects relevant to the forthcoming study was studied. Meanwhile, a competitive analysis of existing belt in seat installations in new cars available on the market was planned and carried out. In the main element of this work, a two-part comfort and mobility study with a belt in seat was performed. The study combined the methods interview, survey and observation. Through the interview, qualitative questions were asked as a complement to the quantitative responses given by the test subjects on scales in the survey. Observations were used to observe the subjects' behavior and difficulties regarding the belt in seat. A major limitation {{of the results of the}} study is the deficient distribution of sitting heights and genders in the group of test subjects, which founded a certain bias in the results. This has been the reason why it has not been possible to draw any certain conclusions from the results, however, some trends have been seen. The comfort study revealed several different assessments of the belt that contributed to discomfort, including the perception of the belt being too close to the neck or too far out on the shoulder. Additionally, the discomfort significantly impaired when the seat was reclined to the relaxed state. The mobility study showed that more subjects felt limited by their own bodies in the movement than by the belt. In addition did the <b>reversed</b> <b>belt</b> geometry create large discomfort issues at the neck. An important conclusion of this thesis is that the seat's design is as important to the customer experience of discomfort of the belt as the positioning of the outlet. It has also become clear that the accessibility of a belt in seat is strongly limited, as it was tested in this study...|$|R
