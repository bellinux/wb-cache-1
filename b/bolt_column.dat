40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural EngineeringKimberly W. KramerIn {{structural}} steel connection design, simple shear connections {{are one of}} the most common connection types utilized. The industry, especially from the side of the engineer, tends to lean toward using Double Clip Angle Connections as the default standard for simple shear connections. A double clip angle connection is a connection consisting of two angles transferring the shear forces from one member to the next either through bolts or welds. The design of Double Clip Angle Connections is efficient and the connections themselves are easy to fabricate. However, benefits to utilizing other types of shear connections exist. Many of these benefits are seen in the fabrication shop or during erection and construction. This is especially true of single shear plate or shear tab connections when applied to open structure design. Shear tab connections consist of a single plate that transfers the shear forces from one member to the next with bolts or with welds. The design of shear tab connections can be a more involved process than the design of double clip angles. Sometimes the shear plate or shear tab has to be longer than is typical. This is called an extended shear plate connection. These extended shear plates can bring other variables into the design that typically don’t occur with Double Clip Angle Connections such as bending of the plate or the need for multiple <b>bolt</b> <b>columns.</b> However, with proper planning and detailing, the benefits and savings experienced in the fabrication or construction phase may outweigh what can be seen as a more laborious design task. The purpose of this report is to identify the possible benefits achieved in using each of these connections, highlight the differences in the design approach for each, and use a study model to compare the outcome of using one connection over another in the design of a typical open structure. Double clip angles are typically the most efficient approach when speed of design and simplicity of fabrication are the desired outcomes. However, shear plate or shear tab connections have the potential to provide safer erection alternatives and materials savings if used in appropriate ways and with the right applications...|$|R

Steel jacketing, concrete jacketing and composite jacketing, are commonly adopted for upgrading the axial load capacity of RC columns. However, {{no matter which}} jacket is used to strengthen RC columns, stress-lagging effect between the preloaded concrete core and the new jacket exist; {{which can lead to}} significant reduction in the ultimate load capacity of the strengthened column. In this presentation, post-compressed plates will be introduced to strengthen rectangular RC columns. In this approach, curved steel plates with a total length slightly longer than the clear height of the column are attached to the column. By pressing the curved steel plates to a flat shape through tightening the <b>bolts,</b> the <b>column</b> is stretched due to arching actions, and the existing axial load in the original column is simultaneously shared with the steel plates. As similar strains are induced in the RC column and external steel plates, the stress-lag problem is alleviated. A higher axial load capacity for the strengthened columns can be achieved. Experimental results will be shown to illustrate the effectiveness of this new strengthening method.

The results from the pre-test numerical simulations are further presented for each beam-to-column joint assembly, in terms of overall response (moment-rotation curve, failure mechanism), as well as local response, particularly the behavior of joint components (stress distribution, plastic strain, force level in the preloaded bolts). Finite element simulations highlighted that plastic deformations occurred in the beam close to the end of the haunch. In addition, minor plastic deformations were observed in the bolts close to the beam flange in tension, and therefore also higher force levels compared to the computed design capacity. As a result, the design procedure was adjusted with the aim of keeping the non-dissipative components of the joints in the elastic range.

In Finland (and Sweden and Norway), there is no formal procedure on how to design rock spaces. The design is based on a designer’s expertise, experience, views, and specific procedures. The problem here is that identical initial data could generate very different results depending on the way the initial data is interpreted and which design methods are used.

The steelwork part of the connection used an end plate, welded to the beam and <b>bolted</b> to the <b>column</b> flange. For comparison, a sixth test was on a bare steel connection of the same type. Increasing the amount of reinforcement caused a rise not only in moment resistance but also in the rotation capacity of the composite connection.

Plastic analysis of the composite connections, with forces in tension bolts predicted by Annex J of Eurocode 3, provides satisfactory prediction of moment resistance. Good rotation capacity in hogging bending is associated with a plastic neutral axis for the composite beam being in the top flange of the steel section.

The discrete connections, being structural <b>bolts</b> on the <b>column</b> and beam {{in every corner of}} the steel frame and confining the precast concrete infill panel within the steel frame, have a large influence on the global structural behaviour.

Mechanisms that influence the connection behaviour include indentation of steel plates under compression produced by bolts, bolt deformation and flange bending. These mechanisms act in series. Experimental tests were performed on components of the steel-concrete connection to establish the stiffness and failure load of the several mechanisms. A FE model was developed for the component ‘flange bending’ of the connection, taking non-linear material properties and geometrical non-linearity into account. A comparison between the experiments and FE model shows that the FE model enables to simulate the connection component behaviour. The validated FE model was used to carry out a parametrical study.

From experimental test results, {{the effects of}} different geometric parameters on the joint strength were discussed. These parameters include the end-distance, the side-distance, the pitch-distance, the plate thickness and the joint eccentricity. Then, the experimental results were compared to predicted results using design references and geometric recommendations proposed by design references were critically examined.

In those and other (Pirmoz et al. 2009) research articles, the stress-deformation pattern developed by FE analyses showed that plastic yielding initiated at {{the toe of}} the tension angle’s fillet, followed by yielding in the area under the tension bolt head for thinner angles (e.g., for the cases of 0.7 ex 3 / [...].- 0 pt 0.7 ex 8 ^" [...] angle thickness), and {{in the areas of}} tension bolthole for the cases of thicker angles. Thus, it is noted that as the tension angle thickness increases, the zone of plastic yielding moves toward the centreline of the bolthole of the vertical leg. Shen and Astaneh-Asl (1999) also found similar deformation history of the connections in their experimental programs and observed that plastic deformations were developed in the vertical leg of top-angle and horizontal leg of seat-angle for connections with thinner angles, whereas the plastic deformations were formed at the central line of the <b>column</b> <b>bolts</b> of top-angle’s vertical leg together with shank areas of bolts for relatively thick angles. Simultaneously, FE analysis results showed that the stresses higher than the yield point were generated in the bolt shank near the bolt head. It indicates that the nonlinear behaviour of the connection differs from some assumptions of Kishi–Chen’s power model. With this background, the place of formation of the upper plastic hinge in the top angle’s vertical leg has been revised and an additional plastic hinge is supplied in the tension bolts according to the results of tests (Shen and Astaneh-Asl 1999) and FE analyses (Ahmed et al. 2001; Ahmed 2002; Pirmoz et al. 2009) for the proposed prediction model in determining the ultimate connection moment.|$|R

Although the topic rarely receives media attention, many media identities {{have a vested interest}} in the outcome of an election. The media are uncharacteristically shy about exploring the {{extent to which}} journalists’ careers are sometimes tied to political fortunes. One difference in the media compared to when Labor last won power in 1983 is the plethora of columnists in the press, expressing largely predictable opinions only minimally disciplined by any evidence that does not fit their prejudices, and overwhelmingly skewed to right of the political spectrum. The News Limited trio of Janet Albrechtsen, Andrew Bolt and Piers Akerman constitute a conformist echo chamber reliably savaging all critics of the Howard government while amplifying the main themes the government wants to promote. The one occasion when they went off script was during the APEC summit, the event from which the government was desperately hoping for an electoral bounce. Rather unhelpfully, first Bolt, then Albrechtsen - in what she said was one of the hardest columns she will write - started writing that it was time for Howard to go. This clumsy episode, about which we may never know the full truth, ended when Howard stared down his cabinet colleagues, a majority of whom thought it was time for him to go. At one level it will make little difference to them which party is in government. Indeed their level of vitriol will simply be increased once their opponents are no longer in opposition. But while they will carry on predictably - <b>Bolt’s</b> <b>column</b> might simply be re-titled Not Happy Kevin - their relevance will be greatly diminished. Of course there will be no perks, no further appointments to the ABC Board for Howard’s motley collection of cultural warriors. But more importantly the columnists will lose any cache as insiders, a status that occasionally gave their rants some political currency. Presumably Labor ministers will be less inclined to share confidences, to use them as the conduit for planting stories. Loss of perceived political clout and the subsequent ego sagging may also encourage Howard’s strongest radio supporter, Sydney shock jock Alan Jones, to retire to the Surrey countryside. Jones, who has complemented his on-air crusades with behind-the-scenes letter writing and lobbying for causes he believes in, is likely to find the new Labor government - especially given the geographic spread of its leaders - less accessible and less inclined to stroke his ego. Support for the Howard government is more generationally divided than ever before in Australian politics, and the demographic of Jones’s audience - older listeners generally rusted on to Howard - is likely to decline in political importance once Howard loses. The Liberals’ path back to power will have to involve finding ways of appealing to younger age groups. Like the columnists, the shrillness of Jones’s anger will if anything be increased once government changes, but its predictability will be tiresome to all but his core fans, and he too may lack the access that gives his program its political impact. The interests of these obviously opinionated media figures are immediately apparent, but more intriguing are those of reporters in the Canberra press gallery. One of the greatest role strains in reporting is the need to maintain journalistic independence while at the same time cultivating closeness. Often there is a trade-off, usually tacit, whereby a journalist obtains information in exchange for running the story the way the source wants. While the doyens of the gallery, such as Michelle Grattan, Laurie Oakes and Paul Kelly, are adept at dealing with all sides of politics, some journalists have built their reputation on their closeness to the Howard government. According to Howard’s biographers, Peter Van Onselen and Wayne Errington, Howard thinks Dennis Shanahan can be relied upon to report his views accurately. Certainly the prime minister could not ask for interpretations of political developments and polls more sympathetic than Shanahan has provided. His tetchy and world weary account of the leaders’ debate suggests he is looking forward to a holiday. News Limited’s Glenn Milne has come to wider attention several times with his willingness to publicly report on rumours of private behaviour by Labor figures. The case which gained most notoriety this year was his revelation on the front page of the Daily Telegraph that its former editor, now Murdoch’s editor of the New York Post, Col Allan, had taken Kevin Rudd to a strip club in New York - a story Labor charges was leaked by Downer’s office. Milne has also made an impact as a purveyor of stories from the Costello camp. Again his anonymous sources have been able to show how a recent development was really a triumph for Costello or that it was time for the Liberal party to turn to Costello. With the Liberals in government these stories have attracted great attention - although not always to Costello’s political advantage - but such scoops are going to be merely quaint curiosities once Costello is in the wilderness of opposition. This article has looked mainly at examples from within Rupert Murdoch’s News Limited, the most politicised of news organisations. It raises the larger question of where Murdoch’s allegiance will go in the coming election. There is sometimes journalistic commentary on how politicians come courting Murdoch, but less about Murdoch’s need to court politicians. Murdoch needs to be seen as on the winning side, and many of his changes in editorial support over recent decades owe much to this. While posing as the creator of bandwagons, his publications have more often been followers rather than setters of political fashion. At the moment his tabloid papers are still feral in their anti-Labor appetites, and it will be interesting to see whether - if Labor’s poll numbers hold up through the campaign - the Murdoch press will try to jump aboard before polling day. Publicly Murdoch has rediscovered coyness and refused to make any comment, saying he will leave it to his Australian editors. The self-image they present as being the people’s champions will be rather dented if the people vote the other way. Apart from journalistic posturing, being on the winning side is also important to Murdoch’s corporate lobbying. When a result seems clear, prudent interest groups start positioning themselves to live with the new reality. This may partly explain recent behaviour by Telstra and Archbishops Pell and Jensen. Murdoch’s media interests are so intertwined with government that a sympathetic ear in regulatory and policy matters is crucially important to him. As he knows very well, a government that has won without his support, or even worse in the face of strong opposition from him, is likely to need more persuading. • Rodney Tiffen is Professor of Government and International Relations at the University of Sydney.

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to conventional structures for tall buildings, a hybrid lateral load resisting building system has been designed, enabling the assembly of tall buildings directly from truck. It consists of steel frames with discretely connected precast concrete infill panels provided with a window opening. Besides the stiffening and strengthening effect of the infill panels on the frame structure, economical benefits may be derived from saving costs on materials and labour, and from reducing construction times. Design rules are needed to facilitate the application of this lateral load resisting structure {{for the construction of}} tall buildings. In order to come to design rules, the infilled frame structure is currently subject to experimental, numerical, and theoretical analyses. This article concerns the experimental part of the research. To provide insight into the composite behaviour between steel frames and discretely connected precast concrete infill panels, and at the same time, provide a basis for development of numerical models, the structure was subject to experimental research. Ten full-scale tests on one-storey, one-bay, 3 by 3 m infilled frame structures were performed. The steel frame consists of HE 180 M sections in S 235 which are simply connected, and is subjected to lateral load. The precast concrete panels provided with a window opening are made of C 45 / 55 and have a thickness of 200 mm. To investigate the effect of the size and position of a window opening, five different opening geometries were tested. The precast concrete panel is connected to the steel frame by discrete steel-to-concrete connections that are realized by structural <b>bolts</b> on the <b>column</b> and beam in every corner of the steel frame. The infilled frames are designed to fail by a bolt failure mechanism. The experiments show that discretely connected precast concrete panels provided with a window opening can significantly improve the performance of steel frames. The observed lateral stiffnesses of the infilled frames range between 4 and 13 times that of the bare frames. All infilled frame structures were able to support a lateral load of over 583 kN. For four panel geometries, the discrete connections were governing the strength of the structure while for the test with the largest panel opening, the infill panel failed first...|$|R
40|$|Concrete filled steel tubular (CFT) columns can {{employ the}} {{advantages}} of both materials: steel and concrete. Connection to such columns, however, is problematic. This is especially so if the required connection is both bolted and moment-resisting. To address this issue, a novel blind-bolted and moment-resisting connection to CFT column has been developed. This connection uses an innovative blind-bolt, introduced in previous research at the University of Nottingham and is termed the Extended Hollobolt (EHB). The EHB has been developed to provide sufficient tensile resistance and stiffness for the connection to develop resistance to moment. Previous research work has studied the performance of this connection under monotonic loading. The performance of such connection under cyclic loading, however, is not yet investigated. The work presented in this thesis addresses this gap in knowledge. This thesis reports {{on a series of}} full scale testing of joints consisting of beam endplates connected to CFT columns using this blind bolt. The test connections were constructed with relatively thick endplate so as to isolate the CFT column and the blind bolt as the relatively weak elements in the connection system. This study focuses on the behaviour of the connections with principal failure modes attributed by the blind bolt and the CFT column. The experiments were conducted to obtain insights into the hysteretic moment-rotation relationship, available ductility & energy dissipation capacity, observe typical failure modes, and develop relevant understandings of the Extended Hollobolt-endplate connection subjected to cyclic loading. The selected connection details were chosen to examine the influential parameters of the joint hysteretic moment-rotation behaviour. From the experimental results, two representative failure modes, <b>bolt</b> fracture and <b>column</b> face bending failure, were observed and categorized in relation to the connection configuration. The connection behaviour are described and compared with respect to the influences of bolt grade, cyclic loading procedure, tube wall thickness and concrete grade. Based on the experimental hysteretic moment-rotation relationships, an evaluation of the cyclic characteristics and an analysis' of the cumulative damage were carried out for the two representative connection categories. The joint hysteretic moment-rotation response was assessed in term of degradations of strength, stiffness, ductility, and energy dissipation. The use of damage levels and stages in the interpretation of damage evolutions for the connection behaviour is also described in this thesis. The findings of cumulative damage analysis suggest that the energy based cumulative damage index outweighs the other indices in characterizing the progressive damage process of the connections in this study. This is especially the case for those related to hysteresis loops at repeated cycles of each loading amplitude. Following the experimental study, 3 D nonlinear finite element models of the connections were developed to analyse the mechanical response of the connection. The comparison of the numerical and experimental moment-rotation envelope curve is discussed with respect to related geometric and material parameters. The connection failure modes and displacement distributions were further examined as a supplement to the experimental findings that were necessarily limited by instrumentations. This work also presents mathematical models for the hysteretic moment-rotation relationships simulating the loading, unloading and reloading segments of the hysteresis loops. Characterizing parameters were introduced to, allow for the softening slope, linear segment slope, and degradations of strength and energy dissipation. This study concluded that the proposed finite element model simulates well the behaviour of the connection with good prediction of the moment-rotation envelope curves and of the failure mode. It is also concluded that the proposed mathematical models define well the non-linear loading and unloading paths with reasonable accuracy. It is finally claimed that the Extended-Hollobolt endplate connection provides a stable improvement in strength and stiffness under cyclic loading compared with other similar connections...|$|R
