40|$|Inhelder and Piaget (1958) {{suggested}} that formal logical reasoning {{can be described}} by 16 <b>combinations</b> of <b>binary</b> propositions. Several studies (Airasian, Bart, 2 ̆ 6 Greaney, 1975; Jansson, 1979, 1986) have used ordering analysis to examine individually administered propositional logic games to investigate the hierarchical order of the 16 <b>binary</b> <b>combinations.</b> Ordering analysis examines the qualitative, logical relationships among items or tasks to yield hierarchical orderings. Research using the individually administered propositional logic games has yielded similar hierarchical orders. ^ This study investigated whether or not using a paper-and-pencil test of propositional logic yields the same hierarchical order as that yielded by individually administered tests. Also, it investigated whether or not using a college age subject pool and allowing subjects to practice some propositional logic problems would further discriminate {{the order of the}} more difficult <b>binary</b> <b>combinations.</b> Past research found junior high and high school age subjects unable to do the more difficult <b>binary</b> <b>combinations.</b> ^ Subjects recruited from classes in a large midwestern university were administered one of two test forms. Form 1 was a paper-and-pencil version of the Geometric Garden game (Jansson, 1986). Form 2 was the same test except practice problems were provided for subjects to work. Subjects were given class credit for their participation. ^ An ordering analysis of the paper-and-pencil test yielded a hierarchical order of the 16 <b>binary</b> <b>combinations</b> similar to that found for the individually administered propositional logic games. However, using college age subjects and providing subjects practice problems had no apparent effect on discriminating the more difficult <b>binary</b> <b>combinations.</b> ^ The paper-and-pencil test of Piaget 2 ̆ 7 s 16 <b>binary</b> <b>combinations</b> appears to be a valid measurement methodology. The use of a paper-and-pencil test eliminates some of the measurement problems inherent in an individual test administration.

50|$|In March 1995 Guo et al. {{were the}} first to report the use of a laser to ablate a block of pure {{graphite}}, and later graphite mixed with catalytic metal. The catalytic metal can consist of elements such as cobalt, niobium, platinum, nickel, copper, or a <b>binary</b> <b>combination</b> thereof. The composite block is formed by making a paste of graphite powder, carbon cement, and the metal. The paste is next placed in a cylindrical mold and baked for several hours. After solidification, the graphite block is placed inside an oven with a laser pointed at it, and argon gas is pumped along the direction of the laser point. The oven temperature is approximately 1200 °C. As the laser ablates the target, carbon nanotubes form and are carried by the gas flow onto a cool copper collector. Like carbon nanotubes formed using the electric-arc discharge technique, carbon nanotube fibers are deposited in a haphazard and tangled fashion. Single-walled nanotubes are formed from the block of graphite and metal catalyst particles, whereas multi-walled nanotubes form from the pure graphite starting material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Terpenes {{are found}} in {{abundance}} in all plant essential oils. In the present study two pure volatile compounds of terpene group, α-pinene and β-caryophyllene have been evaluated for their repellent, acute toxicity and developmental inhibitory activities alone and in <b>binary</b> <b>combination</b> against red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. In repellency assay, α-pinene and β-caryophyllene repelled T. castaneum adults significantly even at 0. 025 % concentrations. Fumigation of larvae and adults of T. castaneum with these two compounds caused lethality in them. Median lethal concentrations (LC 50) of α-pinene and β-caryophyllene against adults were 0. 998 and 1. 624 µl/cm 3 and against larvae were 1. 379 and 1. 949 µl/cm 3 respectively. In <b>binary</b> <b>combination,</b> the LC 50 values against adults and larvae were found 1. 277 and 1. 438 µl/cm 3 respectively. Fumigation with two sublethal concentrations viz. 40 and 80 % of 24 -h LC 50 of these two compunds alone and in <b>binary</b> <b>combination</b> significantly reduced oviposition potential of adults and inhibited pupation and adult emergence in larvae.

A two years field experiment {{was performed to}} estimate interference of T. portulacastrum and C. rotundus and to evaluate the role of allelopathic water extracts for effective weed management in maize. Five plant water extracts in ten binary combinations were foliar applied in triplicated randomized complete block design.

The highest density of both weed species was observed at 45 days after sowing (DAS) while weed dry biomass was higher at 60 DAS. <b>Binary</b> <b>combination</b> of sorghum-sunflower depicted greater suppression for weed density, dry biomass and persistence index (88 - 92 % for T. portulacastrum and 65 - 81 % for C. rotundus) as compared with weedy check.
