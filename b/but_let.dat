5|$|On 13 April 1968, {{in another}} one of his {{frequent}} cabinet reshuffles, Bokassa demoted Banza to minister of health, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> him remain in his position as minister of state. Cognizant of the president's intentions, Banza increased his vocalization of dissenting political views. A year later, after Banza {{made a number of}} remarks highly critical of Bokassa and his management of the economy, the president, perceiving an immediate threat to his power, removed him as his minister of state.|$|E

That year's conference was underattended and their report attracted scant attention. Coincidentally, many experts in impact craters and the K–Pg boundary were attending a separate conference on Earth impacts. Although Penfield {{had plenty of}} geophysical data sets, he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, {{a dispute}} formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted {{a rule that}} made any player who had signed an NHL {{contract}} but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, {{as long as they}} had not played in any NHL games. This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the World Hockey Association—were allowed to play. Canadian hockey official Alan Eagleson stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs. Murray Costello of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> the individual sport federations decide if they wanted to allow professionals.|$|E

5|$|By September15, shelters {{were opened}} {{throughout}} Tinian and Saipan at local schools, most schools and all governmental buildings {{were closed and}} residents rushed to board up their homes. The American Red Cross had also mobilized on the islands by this time. Some private schools were open during the morning <b>but</b> <b>let</b> out early to allow students {{to return to their}} families before the typhoon's arrival. On Saipan, 179 residents sought refuge in shelters by the afternoon of September15, by which time heavy rain had begun falling. Only one flight was delayed by the typhoon across all the islands. The youth basketball league in the Northern Mariana Islands canceled their games for the time Choi-wan passed through the islands. At the height of the storm, a total of 270 residents sought refuge in shelters on Saipan.|$|E
5|$|Figard {{spent the}} summer of 1995 working {{at a hotel in}} Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the {{opportunity}} to improve her English. She returned to the UK in December to spend another two weeks with Jean-Marc. After leaving on Monday, 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the Channel the following day, arriving in Ashford, Kent. She intended to travel to Fordingbridge by train; her escort found another French lorry driver, Roger Bouvier, who was willing to take her to Chieveley Services near Newbury, Berkshire. When they arrived, Figard tried to phone Jean-Marc to ask him to pick her up, but misdialed. She was offered a lift to Salisbury by the driver of a white Mercedes lorry. Bouvier had reservations about the driver, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> her go with him nonetheless. Figard left the service station with the driver at around 4:30 pm. She never arrived at her destination, and was reported missing.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season Vézina again led {{the league}} in goals against, as well as winning eight games, along with 10 losses. Vézina recorded his first career shutout during the 1912–13 season, defeating Ottawa 6–0 on , 1913, for one of his nine wins in the season. The Canadiens finished first in the NHA {{for the first time in}} 1913–14, in a tie with the Toronto Blueshirts. Once again, Vézina {{led the league}} with the fewest goals against, while posting 13 victories and seven losses. Under the NHA rules, the first place team would play in the Stanley Cup Finals, but due to the tie for first, the Canadiens had to play a two-game, total-goals series against Toronto. Vézina shut out the Blueshirts in the first game, a 2–0 win for Montreal, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> in six goals in the second game, allowing the Blueshirts to play for the Stanley Cup, which they won.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{happiness}} measures could be used not as a replacement for more traditional measures, but as a supplement.

25|$|The mass {{execution}} {{was soon}} called the ″Huruslahti Lottery″ as the victims {{seemed to have}} been selected randomly.

Although, the later {{studies have shown that the}} executed were actually not picked randomly but they were mostly Red Guard or trade union activists. The White commander C. G. E. Mannerheim had learned the manner on his years in the Russian Army. The idea was to suppress the military revolts by killing the leaders <b>but</b> <b>let</b> the ordinaries live. Now he presumably used the tactic against the Finnish Reds.|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} Amenemhat II has been often {{characterized}} as largely peaceful, but {{record of his}} genut, or daybooks, have cast doubt on that assessment. Among these records, preserved on temple walls at Tod and Memphis, are descriptions of peace treaties with certain Syrio-Palestinian cities, and military conflict with others. To the south, Amenemhet sent a campaign through lower Nubia to inspect Wawat. It does not appear that Amenemhet continued his predecessors' policy of appointing Nomarchs, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> it become hereditary again. Another expedition to Punt dates to his reign.

25|$|Msiri's capital Bunkeya and {{surrounding}} villages had a population estimated at 60,000–80,000 in 1891. A year after Msiri's death, it was 10,000–20,000. In {{that part of}} Africa people disperse into the bush when threatened. For instance, David Livingstone reported twenty years earlier that Mwata Kazembe VIII Chinkonkole Kafuti so tyrannised his people that many had moved away, and he could muster scarcely 1000 men. Continuing the contrast with Msiri, when the assassins sent by Msiri and Tippu Tib advanced on his boma, Chinkonkole Kafuti’s people did not warn him, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> him be taken by surprise.|$|E
