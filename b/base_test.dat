[...] The first test performed at the HHSTT was the launching of the Northrop N-25 Snark in 1950, but soon included human tolerance testing {{under the command of}} Colonel John P. Stapp. [...] Col. Stapp was the last human test subject to ride the rocket-powered sleds at the HHSTT in December 1954. [...] The track was lengthened to 5,000 ft (1,524m) in 1956, followed by another extension to 35,000 ft (10,668 m) in 1957. The next major track extension occurred in 1974 when the rails from the Edwards Air Force <b>Base</b> <b>test</b> track were shipped to Holloman and added to the existing tracks to give a new total length of 50,771 ft (15,475 m). During this upgrade, a third rail, approximately 15,000 ft (4,572 m), was added for high-speed, narrow-gauge sleds. In 2000, pulldown extensions of 149 ft (46.4 m) were added to the north end of each rail, bringing the two primary rails to 50,917 feet (15,536 m). The last major upgrade to the primary rail system occurred in 2002, when the narrow-gauge track was lengthened to 20,379 ft (6,212 m).

40|$|Programs for Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) {{are often}} written in {{graphical}} or textual languages. Control engineers design {{and use them}} in systems where safety is vital, such as avionics, nuclear power plants or transportation systems. Malfunction of such a computer could have severe consequences, therefore thorough testing of PLCs are important. The Base Choice (BC) combination strategy was proposed as a suitable technique for testing software. Test cases are created based on BC strategy by varying the values of one parameter at a time while keeping {{the values of the}} other parameters fixed on the values in the base choice. However, this strategy might not be as effective when used on embedded software where parameters need to be set for {{a certain amount of time}} in order to trigger a certain interesting behavior. By incorporating time as another parameter when generating the tests, the goal is to create a better strategy that will increase not only code coverage but also fault detection compared to base choice strategy. Timed Base Choice (TBC) coverage criteria is an improvement upon the regular Base Choice criteria with the inclusion of time. We define TBC as follows: The <b>base</b> <b>test</b> case in timed base choice criteria is determined by the tester of the program. A criterion suggested by Ammann and Offutt is the “most likely value” from the point of view of the user. In addition, a time choice T is determined by the tester as the most likely time for keeping the <b>base</b> <b>test</b> case to the same values. From the <b>base</b> <b>test</b> case, new test cases are created by varying the interesting values of one parameter at a time, keeping the values of the other parameters fixed on the <b>base</b> <b>test</b> case. Each new test case is executed with the input values set for a certain amount of time determined by the time choice T. The time choice is given in time units. The research questions stated in this thesis are as follows: Research Question 1 (RQ 1) How does Timed Base Choice tests compare to Base Choice tests in terms of decision coverage? Research Question 2 (RQ 2) How does Timed Base Choice tests compare to Base Choice tests in terms of fault detection? In order to answer these questions, an empirical study was made in which 11 programs was tested along with respective test cases generated by BC and TBC. Each program was executed on a PLC along with the belonging test cases and several faulty programs (mutants). From this testing we got the corresponding decision coverage for each program achieved by BC and TBC respectively as well as a mutation score measuring how many of the mutated programs was detected and killed. We found that TBC outperformed BC testing both in terms of decision coverage and fault detection. Using TBC testing we managed to achieve full decision coverage on several programs that we were unable to achieve using regular BC. This shows that TBC is an improvement upon the regular BC in both ways, thus answering our previously stated research questions...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the effects of}} intranasal oxytocin, a naturally occurring hormone, {{on the behavior of}} pet dogs during an attachment test. Each dog participated in two testing sessions. On one visit saline was administered nasally, and on another, oxytocin was administered nasally. For half of the dogs (n = 20), solutions were administered with a Mucosal Atomization Device (MAD) and for half of the dogs (n = 20), solutions were administered using a nasal spray bottle. Condition order was counterbalanced and a double-blind methodology was employed. Following a 30 -min wait period after administration of solutions, dog-owner pairs participated in the Secure <b>Base</b> <b>Test,</b> a short attachment test consisting of three 2 -min phases: (1) Baseline- the owner was present, dogs were able to freely explore the testing room (2) Alone- dogs were left alone in the testing room (3) Return- owners re-entered the room and were reunited with their dog. In each phase the dog was evaluated for contact seeking, exploration, and avoidance behaviors. Although, oxytocin administration was expected to increase owner-directed proximity and contact seeking behavior, this effect was not observed. In fact, in the baseline phase, dogs spent significantly more time seeking the proximity of their owners when they received saline than when they received OT (p < 0. 05). Sex differences were also assessed for the behavioral variables of interest in the Secure <b>Base</b> <b>Test,</b> and results indicated that OT did not affect dogs' behavior in the alone phase, but when saline was administered, females spent significantly more time in contact with the door than males in the alone phase (p < 0. 05). Overall, the effects of nasally administered oxytocin on attachment related behavior appeared to be limited or inconsistent for this pet dog population...|$|E

40|$|The Model <b>Based</b> <b>Testing</b> {{is one of}} {{the modern}} {{automated}} testing methodologies used to generate test suits automatically from the abstract behavioral or environmental models of the System Under Test (SUT).

The Model <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> can be applied in different ways and it has several dimensions during implementation that can be changes with nature of the SUT. Since model <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> is directly related with models, the model <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> can be applied at early stages of development that helps in validation of both models and requirements that could save time of test development at later stages. With the automatic generation of test cases, requirements change is very easy to handle with the model <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> as it requires fewer changes in the models and reduces rework. It is also easy to generate a large number of test cases with full coverage criteria using the model <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> that was hard to produce with traditional testing methodologies. Testing non-functional requirements is one field in which the model <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> is lacking; quality related aspects of the SUT difficult to be tested with the model <b>based</b> <b>testing.</b> The effectiveness and performance of model <b>based</b> <b>testing</b> {{is directly related to the}} efficiency of CASE tool that implementing it.

Some claim that the criterion-referenced enterprise is dead, save its legacy in score reporting (Davidson, 2012, p. 198). We argue that announcing the demise of CRT is premature. But we do acknowledge that what now passes as CRT is in fact not criterion-referenced, but is based upon a corruption of the original meaning of “criterion ” as domain-specific performance.

40|$|Background: In April 2009, a new {{influenza}} A(H 1 N 1) {{virus was}} detected circulating in humans. Its rapid widespread transmission {{led to the}} declaration by the WHO of an influenza pandemic. This virus had origin in a reassortment between a North American swine lineage (already a triple reassortant, circulating in pigs since the late 1990 ’s) and a Eurasian swine lineage (which contributed to the A(H 1 N 1) 2009 with the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (MP) gene segments). Pandemic H 1 N 1 viruses, as well as Eurasian swine viruses are resistant to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine), since they carry the S 31 N change in the M 2 protein. The majority of A(H 1 N 1) 2009 viruses were sensitive to NA inhibitors (NAI).

Besides thermal and solidification studies a detailed description is given of the quantitative metallographic technique which is appropriate for characterizing eutectic structures. This method should prove a key tool for evaluating specimen microstructure which is the most sensitive indicator of changes produced during solidification. It has been recommended that single grain pre-frozen eutectic specimens be used to simplify microstructural evaluation and to eliminate any porosity in the as-cast eutectic specimens. High purity (99. 999 %) materials from one supplier should be employed for all experiments. Laboratory studies indicate that porosity occurs in the MRC as-cast eutectic ingots but that this porosity can be eliminated by directional freezing. Chemical analysis shows that the MRC ingots are slightly Al rich and contain about. 03 % impurity.
