A focus on the <b>home</b> and its <b>surroundings</b> complements more traditional applications for domestic computing. Whereas conventional systems for the home focus on bringing placeless and generic content into the home, Threshold devices, in contrast, particularise content by linking it to the home’s physical location.

40|$|This {{article is}} based on a survey carried out in Denmark that asked a random sample of the {{population}} about their preferences for <b>home</b> <b>surroundings</b> and locations. It shows that the characteristics of social surroundings are very important and can be divided into three independent dimensions: avoiding social nuisances, preferring social homogeneity and living close to one’s social network and place of origin. The study shows that most people have many detailed preferences, whereas some have very few. This confirms an earlier theory that some people are very connected to certain places with given characteristics and thus do not have priorities regarding <b>home</b> <b>surroundings</b> and locations. For others, mostly young people and singles, home is just a place to sleep and relax, whereas life is lived elsewhere. For this group, there are only preferences for location and there are few specific preferences for surroundings...|$|R

5000|$|In psychiatry, oikophobia (synonymous with domatophobia and ecophobia) is {{an aversion}} to <b>home</b> <b>surroundings.</b> It {{can also be used}} more {{generally}} to mean an abnormal fear (a phobia) of the home, or of the contents of a house ("fear of household appliances, equipment, bathtubs, household chemicals, and other common objects in the home").

When he reached it he sat down upon {{the arm of the}} one opposite, took off his sombrero, and deliberately looked at Helen. His eyes were light, glinting, with hard, restless quiver, and his mouth was coarse and arrogant. Helen had never seen him detached from her <b>home</b> <b>surroundings,</b> and now the difference struck cold upon her heart.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} patients’ attitudes towards tele-rehabilitation in the Danish TELEKAT (for Telehomecare, Chronic Patients and the Integrated Healthcare System) project, in order to better understand patients’ behavior when performing tele-rehabilitation activities in <b>home</b> <b>surroundings.</b> A total of 111 COPD patients were included in the study, and they were randomized into an intervention group (n = 60) and a control group (n = 51). However, a non-randomized design was used to analyze the qualitative perspectives of the patients’ attitudes towards tele-rehabilitation. From the intervention group, 22 COPD patients were selected for qualitative interviews and participant observation in their homes. The theoretical framework for this study is based on learning theory and the “communities of practice” approach inspired by Etienne Wenger. COPD patients exhibit four types of attitudes about their tele-rehabilitation: indifference, learning as part of situations in everyday life, feeling of security and motivation for performing physical training. The patients express the view that they circulate between these attitudes depending on their physical and emotional state as they perform their training. The COPD patients and healthcare professionals have created a community of tele-rehabilitation across sectors, exchanging experiences, stories and strategies for how to manage rehabilitation in <b>home</b> <b>surroundings...</b>|$|R

The producer was suggested by SST because they could get a good deal. I regret it, because in terms of material, it should {{have been one of the}} best records we ever did. It actually slowed down our momentum a little bit because it didn't really sound like us." ...|$|R

50|$|The most {{confusing}} {{thing about}} the imprisoned animals was that even supposing Oleg took their side and had the power, he would still not want {{to break into the}} cages and liberate them. This was because, deprived of their <b>home</b> <b>surroundings,</b> they had lost the idea of rational freedom. It would only make things harder for them, suddenly to set them free.This was the odd way Kostoglotov reasoned. His brain was so twisted that he could no longer see things simply and dispassionately.
