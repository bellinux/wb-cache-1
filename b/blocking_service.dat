50|$|The U.S. {{government}} has given money to many school boards to purchase computers for educational applications. Schools may have multiple computer labs, which contain these computers {{for students to}} use. There is usually Internet access on these machines, but some schools will put up a <b>blocking</b> <b>service</b> to limit the websites that {{students are able to}} access to only include educational resources, such as Google. In addition to controlling the content students are viewing, putting up these blocks can also help to keep the computers safe by preventing students from downloading malware and other threats. However, the effectiveness of such content filtering systems is questionable since it can easily be circumvented by using proxy websites, Virtual Private Networks and for some weak security systems merely knowing the IP address of the intended website is enough to go through.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-stage tandem G-queue with <b>blocking,</b> <b>service</b> requirements of phase type and arrivals of units and of signals - which cancel one unit {{waiting in line}} or in service - both assumed to be Markovian arrival processes. The main characteristic of the service process in this tandem queue is blocking, which occurs according to a BAS (blocking after service) mechanism. A finite queue of capacity K >= 0 is allowed between servers, so that a unit having completed processing on Station I attempts to join Station 2. If K + 1 units are accommodated into Station 2, then the completed unit is forced to wait at Station I occupying the server space until a space becomes available at Station 2. Thus the first server becomes blocked or not available for service on incoming units. Our purpose is to study the influence of several flows of signals on the performance evaluation of the queueing model through various probabilistic descriptors. By means of a numerical investigation, we study four two-stage tandem G-queues with blocking depending {{on the existence of}} flows of signals affecting Station 1 and/or Station 2. The essential tool in our analysis is the general theory of quasi-birth-and-death processes...|$|E

40|$|Americans have {{received}} unwanted telemarketing calls for decades. In {{response to a}} rapid increase in pre-recorded calls made using autodialer devices, Congress enacted the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) in 1992. The TCPA imposes restrictions on calls made to consumers’ residences and wireless phones using autodialer devices, {{even if they are}} not telemarketing calls. Congress appointed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe rules and regulations to enforce the TCPA. In 2015, the FCC released an order that defined autodialer more broadly under the statute. Consequently, devices that have the potential to become autodialers in the future, even if they are not presently able to perform autodialer functions, will constitute autodialers for purposes of the TCPA. This new scope of autodialers includes everyday technology, such as smartphones, that consumers and businesses use on a regular basis. As a result, the FCC has unreasonably broadened the scope of the TCPA to limit the use of everyday technology. This note examines the new autodialer definition and argues that it is problematic for several reasons. The new autodialer definition does not comport with a plain reading of the TCPA, Congressional intent, or recent federal case law. Furthermore, this note predicts that the broader autodialer definition will have two detrimental effects—it will shift TCPA enforcement efforts away from purposeful, predatory TCPA violators and will increase TCPA litigation against companies engaged in legitimate business or between individual consumers. This note also examines recent trends in TCPA class action suits, including financial incentives for plaintiff attorneys to pursue TCPA lawsuits. Ultimately, the FCC should reinterpret the statute so that autodialers only include devices with the present ability to perform autodialer functions and should further require service providers, such as AT 2 ̆ 6 T and Verizon, to offer consumers a more widespread call <b>blocking</b> <b>service</b> to help protect them from predatory robocall...|$|E

We also prove the monotonicity of throughput (of queues) {{with respect to the}} number of queues and number of customers in these models.
