40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology to accurately model {{the effects of}} gear blank topology on the global gear compliance of spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gears.</b> The methodology {{is part of an}} ongoing development to create a gear contact code, which can be included in a general-purpose multibody code in order to enable system-level analysis of <b>bevel</b> <b>geared</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The contact compliance is decomposed into a non-linear local contact compliance and a linear bulk compliance. The linear contribution is extracted from a finite element(FE) representation of the spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gear.</b> A dedicated software tool has been developed to automate the whole procedure, starting from the simulation of the cutting process to describe the gear teeth, over the FE model creation and finally the computation of the tooth bulk stiffness.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the advantages of using multibody simulation to develop proper models for power train analyses of azimuth propulsion systems. Azimuth thrusters are commonly installed on ice classed offshore vessels and icebreakers, and are hence exposed to extreme ice loads. This poses a risk for safe operation. It is therefore {{of great interest to}} study in detail how these impulse loads affect the system components. A multibody simulation model of a Rolls-Royce Azipull thruster has been developed in SIMPACK version 9. 6, comprising the electrical motor, shafts, bearings, <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions</b> and the propeller. It is a decoupled analysis, i. e. the propulsion system is assumed to have no feedback to the environmental load or the electrical motor. The ice load is based on the IACS Polar Class code. The results reveal that multibody simulation in SIMPACK is well suited for dynamic analyses of azimuth propulsion systems. It is an efficient tool for developing detailed models and comprises strong solver capabilities. Furthermore, it can be concluded that all components of the propulsion line are to some extent, experiencing the ice load. The gear contact forces increase significantly during the ice-propeller interaction, and the gear forces cause the load on the surrounding bearings to increase accordingly. The bearing closest to the propeller is by far most prone to the extreme ice load. Verification of the model parameters and further improvement of the global analysis will increase the validity of the results. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{longitudinal}} crankshaft two-cylinder V as seen on Moto-Guzzis {{and some}} Hondas is less common. This orientation is suited to shaft drive, {{eliminating the need}} for a 90° <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> at the <b>transmission</b> end of the shaft. A longitudinal crankshaft engine fits neatly into a typical motorcycle frame, leaving ample room for the transmission, and cooling is facilitated by cylinder heads and exhausts protruding into the air stream. Longitudinal crankshaft mounting is associated with a torque reaction that tends to twist the motorcycle to one side on sharp acceleration or when opening the throttle in neutral and in the opposite direction on sharp deceleration. Many modern motorcycle manufacturers correct for this effect by rotating flywheels or alternators in the opposite direction to that of the crankshaft.|$|R
