She was inspired to depict women in their regional dress digging potatoes, comforting their children, or attending fairs and festivals. She painted pictures of women and girls in 1924 and again in 1926 while in Lipetsk; colorful images with reds, greens and ambers in a noted series called [...] "Tambov women"; picturesque scenes from <b>Bashkiria</b> and Udmurtia; and a critically acclaimed series created in Crimea and Novgorod. The Novgorod paintings began in a period when the Effimovs had fled Moscow in 1935 because of political turmoil. During this time, purges of 1933 and the party restructuring that followed in 1935, bureaucrats, corrupt officials, shirkers and those who sought personal gain over state benefit were targeted, rather than previous purges which had focused upon bourgeoisie elements. Even if one were not a target of the purge, {{a broad range of}} society was effected, because the purges were aimed at eliminating all those affiliated with a targeted party member. Fear of arrest, denunciation, or extortion, created uncertainty for every strata of society. The paintings from the period comprise mostly landscapes of the area surrounding the city and ancient buildings, where Simonovich-Efimova walked to enjoy the peace of her surroundings.|$|E
