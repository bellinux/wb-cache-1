5|$|Threats to B.cuneata include land clearing, {{which leads}} to direct plant loss and {{population}} fragmentation, grazing pressure, competition from exotic weeds, changes to the fire regime, and encroaching salinity. The Banksia Atlas survey found one population to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of a road; the plants were aging with no new seedlings noted, and the site was weed-infested. A {{large part of the}} surviving populations are on private land, and depend on good relationships with local landowners. Many have obliged by fencing off areas and restricting entry of rabbits. There has been some attempt by CALM to translocate populations away from hazardous areas; these have met with some success, helped with watering in the first year.|$|E

25|$|In October 1985, the {{moderate}} {{section of the}} former ALÖ met in Salzburg and formed the Citizen's Parliamentary Initiative (BIP) {{as an attempt to}} bring together a more professionalised and less ideologically divided Green political organisation. The meeting was arranged under the auspices of former ALÖ leaders Günther Nenning, Gerhard Heilingbrunner and Michael Mayrhofer. Meissner-Blau {{and a number of other}} leading greens figures were in attendance at the first meeting on October 26, 1985. As a well spoken, widely respected and nationally known figure in the environmental movement, Meissner-Blau was nominated by the BIP to run as the first green candidate for the Austrian Presidency at a meeting in Graz on January 6, 1986. In February, the opposing left-wing of the former ALÖ declined to join the BIP, instead forming their own Green political movement - the Green Alternative Rally (GRAS). Momentum appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the BIP though, as a number of green fractions moved over to join with the BIP. The media gave a large degree of attention to Meissner-Blau in the lead-up to the May Presidential vote. The movement's profile received a significant boost after the Chernobyl disaster in April and government controversy over the government deployment of the Saab 35 Draken fighter airplane. On May 4, Meisser-Blau received 5.5% of the vote. The result, whilst still small, was the best result for the Green movement to that point, and the campaign had cemented Meissner-Blau's position at the apex of that movement.|$|E

It was a moral dilemma to do that, but the approach was that it was better to fight from inside than not at all. The moral dilemma came up when I had to apply the law." [...] He noted in 1992 that most South African judges [...] "applied such [...] laws without commenting upon their moral turpitude." [...] A number, including Goldstone, were more outspoken – a policy that he felt aided the credibility of the courts. There was a fine dividing line between applying moral standards and promoting political doctrines, but Goldstone believed that [...] "in my view, if a judge is to err, it should <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of defending morality." [...] He took the view that [...] "judges have a duty to act morally, and if they're dealing with laws which have an unjust effect, I think it's their duty – if they can, within the powers they've got legitimately – to interpret the laws and give judgments which will make them less harsh and less unjust." [...] Being a judge in apartheid-era South Africa was a challenge, but it had its rewards; [...] "I hated in the morning the thought of having to do this for another day, [...] {{by the end of the}} day, I was exhilarated at the reaction and how important the work was." ...|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly said that the character was exemplary of the funky feel of the show citing his naturalistic dialogue, soulful voice and easy rapport with his African-American work partners. The character {{has been described as}} defying genre conventions – although his actions drive several plot points he is not quite the central character implied by the show's opening or promotional material. Flak Magazine also picked McNulty as a central character and commented on the uncommon experience of having the main character fit to a standard police character archetype ("He has poor impulse control. He's personally fearless and outspoken, and he bangs babes like a hunchback rings bells...") but also exposing the archetype as self-destructive and emotionally immature. Salon.com described McNulty as [...] "The heart, soul and oft-impaired nervous system of [...] "The Wire"", again selecting him as a central character. Salon also chose McNulty's pride as his main character trait, saying that this aspect of his personality made him a successful investigator and a failure in most other aspects of his life. Entertainment Weekly picked McNulty as offering one of the show's most wicked ironies: {{he is one of the}} characters you would expect to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of law and order as a police detective but they describe him as a [...] "boozing cop who pisses on authority and order." ...|$|E

Clinton said that due to the direct and indirect communications she had had with Suu Kyi over the years, [...] "it was like seeing a friend you hadn't seen {{for a very long}} time even though it was our first meeting." [...] The outreach to Burma attracted both praise and criticism, with Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen saying it [...] "sends the wrong signal to the Burmese military thugs" [...] but others saying the visit combined idealism with respect to reform and realpolitik with respect to keeping Burma out of the direct Chinese sphere of influence. Clinton had had to overcome internal administration opposition from the White House and Pentagon, as well as from Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, to make the move, eventually making a personal appeal to Obama and gaining his approval. Regarding whether the Burmese regime would follow up on reform pledges, Clinton said, [...] "I can't predict what's going to happen, but I think it certainly is important for the United States to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of democratic reform ... This is a first date, not a marriage, and we'll see where it leads." [...] She continued to address rights concerns in a December 2011 speech a few days later before the United Nations Human Rights Council, saying that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights abroad and that [...] "Gay rights are human rights" [...] and that [...] "It should never be a crime to be gay."

On the other hand, a group of Israeli human rights organizations including the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Bimkom, B'Tselem, Gisha, Hamoked, Physicians for Human Rights and Yesh Din, stated [...] "as leaders of a sector within Israeli civil society that monitors and often criticizes government and military policy for violating human rights, {{we do not see}} such actions as plausible reason for denying Mrs. Robinson the award." [...] In response to the protests by some Jewish groups and commentators, Robinson said she was “surprised and dismayed” and that [...] "this is old, recycled, untrue stuff,” “I have been very critical of the Palestinian side. My conduct continues to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination,” Robinson said. [...] "There's a lot of bullying by certain elements of the Jewish community. They bully people who try to address the severe situation in Gaza and the West Bank. Archbishop Desmond Tutu gets the same criticism," [...] Robinson also said. In an open letter to Robinson, Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, rejected Robinson's claim at being misunderstood or bullied by those who criticize her role in Durban. He said that she failed to confront purveyors of anti-Israel rhetoric. [...] "You {{may not have been the}} chief culprit of the Durban debacle, but you will always be its preeminent symbol", he added.
