40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine the damping of the fundamental antisymmetric mode of oscillation of liquids contained in an oblate spheroidal tank. The decay of the fundamental mode was studied {{for a range of}} liquid depths in tanks with and without baffles. In the investigation of <b>baffle</b> effects, <b>ring</b> and cruciform <b>baffles</b> of various sizes were fixed at different locations within the tank. Data presented show the variation of the damping factor with tank fullness and with baffle type, width, location, and orientation as well as the effects of the amplitude of the liquid oscillations and of small variations in the liquid kinematic viscosity on the damping factor. The results of the investigation indicate that the addition of <b>ring</b> <b>baffles</b> to the tank results in an increase in the available effective damping when the baffle plane is in a region near the equilibrium liquid surface, and that cruciform baffles are effective in the damping of the fundamental mode in the near-empty tank. No apparent changes in damping for the tanks having <b>ring</b> <b>baffles</b> were observed as the kinematic viscosity of the liquid was varied over a small range...|$|R

Experimental and analytical data are presented as a function of slosh velocity or amplitude, baffle spacing, and baffle locations both above and below the liquid surface.

40|$|The Miles {{equation}} {{has long}} been used to predict slosh damping in liquid propellant tanks due to <b>ring</b> <b>baffles.</b> The original work by Miles identifies defined limits to its range of application. Recent evaluations of the Space Launch System identified that the Core Stage baffle designs resulted in violating {{the limits of the}} application of the Miles equation. This paper describes the work conducted by NASA/MSFC to develop methods to predict slosh damping from <b>ring</b> <b>baffles</b> for conditions for which Miles equation is not applicable. For asymptotically small slosh amplitudes or conversely large baffle widths, an asymptotic expression for slosh damping was developed and calibrated using historical experimental sub-scale slosh damping data. For the parameter space that lies between region of applicability of the asymptotic expression and the Miles equation, Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of slosh damping were used to develop an expression for slosh damping. The combined multi-regime slosh prediction methodology is shown to be smooth at regime boundaries and consistent with both sub-scale experimental slosh damping data and the results of validated Computational Fluid Dynamics predictions of slosh damping due to <b>ring</b> <b>baffles...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the process of liquid reorientation {{from one end of}} a scale-model Centaur liquid-hydrogen tank to the other end by means of low-level accelerations. Prior to reorientation, the liquid was stabilized {{at the top of the}} tank at a Bond number of 15. Tanks both with and without <b>ring</b> <b>baffles</b> and with tank radii of 5. 5 and 7. 0 centimeters were used in the study. Reorientation acceleration values were varied to obtain Bond numbers of 200 and 450. Liquid fill levels of 20 and 70 percent were used. From the data in this study, relations were developed to estimate reorientation event times in unbaffled tanks through the point of final liquid clearing from the top of the tank. The insertion of <b>ring</b> <b>baffles</b> drastically changed the reorientation flow profiles but resulted in only minor differences in the times of tank-top uncovering and liquid collection...|$|R

A comparison of cylindrical canisters with length-to-diameter ratios of 0. 15, 0. 29, 0. 44, 0. 80, 1. 16, and 2. 125 was completed with a constant mass of three pounds of Sodasotb. Annular <b>ring</b> <b>baffles</b> and disk baffles were employed to get a more evenly distributed usage of the Sodasorb with the results compared to the 'straiht' through type canisters for the above L/D ratios.

40|$|Propellant slosh is a {{potential}} source of disturbance critical to the stability of space vehicles. The slosh dynamics are typically represented by a mechanical model of a spring mass damper. This mechanical model is then included in the equation of motion of the entire vehicle for Guidance, Navigation and Control analysis. Our previous effort has demonstrated the soundness of a CFD approach in modeling the detailed fluid dynamics of tank slosh and the excellent accuracy in extracting mechanical properties (slosh natural frequency, slosh mass, and slosh mass center coordinates). For a practical partially-filled smooth wall propellant tank with a diameter of 1 meter, the damping ratio is as low as 0. 0005 (or 0. 05 %). To accurately predict this very low damping value is a challenge for any CFD tool, as one must resolve a thin boundary layer near the wall and must minimize numerical damping. This work extends our previous effort to extract this challenging parameter from first principles: slosh damping for smooth wall and for <b>ring</b> <b>baffle.</b> First the experimental data correlated into the industry standard for smooth wall were used as the baseline validation. It is demonstrated that with proper grid resolution, CFD can indeed accurately predict low damping values from smooth walls for different tank sizes. The damping due to <b>ring</b> <b>baffles</b> at different depths from the free surface and for different sizes of tank was then simulated, and fairly good agreement with experimental correlation was observed. The study demonstrates that CFD technology {{can be applied to}} the design of future propellant tanks with complex configurations and with smooth walls or multiple baffles, where previous experimental data is not available...|$|R
40|$|Polar Satellites Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is {{the work}} horse of ISRO. It is used to launch 1000 kg {{satellites}} in polar orbits and upto 1600 kg satellites in low earth orbits. PSLV is a 4 stage vehicle weighing 315 tonnes. It uses liquid propulsion for second and fourth stages. The fourth stage propulsion tank {{is made up of}} Titanium Alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) (1335 mm dia). The configuration of tank is monocoque, with a common bulkhead to separate the fuel and oxidiser. The top compartment is used for fuel and bottom compartment is filled with oxidiser. Anti-slosh baffles (Ring Baffles) are used in both compartments to suppress slosh. Sloshing is a common phenomenon in partially filled liquid container. The rocket motor cases, filled with liquid propellants are left with an internal ullage volume (free volume) for the pressuring gas to stabilise. This creates a free surface of liquid. Sloshing is defined as the oscillation of the free surface of a liquid in a partially filled container due to external disturbances. Baffles are essentially ?plates? fixed inside the container to arrest sloshing. The slosh waves, during the causes of travel, hits the plates breaks and dies out. This reduces the slosh forces on the walls of container. Presently the <b>ring</b> <b>baffles</b> are supported from top flange of tank for launching satellites up to 1200 kg. For this propellant loading is upto 2. 5 t. Now a PS 4 stage is reconfigured with 0. 8 t loading to launch 500 kg satellites. In this tank the liquid levels are less. Hence <b>ring</b> <b>baffles</b> are supported from bottom flange of tank to reduce the total mass of the baffle system.

40|$|Determination of slosh damping {{is a very}} {{challenging}} task {{as there is no}} analytical solution. The damping physics involve the vorticity dissipation which requires the full solution of the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, previous investigations and knowledge were mainly carried out by extensive experimental studies. A Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) based CFD program developed at NASA MSFC was applied to extract slosh damping in a baffled tank from the first principle. First, experimental data using water with subscale smooth wall tank were used as the baseline validation. CFD simulation was demonstrated to be capable of accurately predicting natural frequency and very low damping value from the smooth wall tank at different fill levels. The damping due to a <b>ring</b> <b>baffle</b> at different liquid fill levels from barrel section and into the upper dome was then investigated to understand the slosh damping physics due to the presence of a <b>ring</b> <b>baffle.</b> Based on this study, the Root-Mean-Square error of our CFD simulation in estimating slosh damping was less than 4. 8 %, and the maximum error was less than 8. 5 %. Scalability of subscale baffled tank test using water was investigated using the validated CFD tool, and it was found that unlike the smooth wall case, slosh damping with baffle is almost independent of the working fluid and it is reasonable to apply water test data to the full scale LOX tank when the damping from baffle is dominant. On the other hand, for the smooth wall, the damping value must be scaled according to the Reynolds number. Comparison of experimental data, CFD, with the classical and modified Miles equations for upper dome was made, and the limitations of these semi-empirical equations were identified...|$|R

The slosh dynamics are typically represented by a mechanical model of a spring-mass-damper. This mechanical model is then included in the equation of motion of the entire vehicle for Guidance, Navigation and Control analysis.

A fundamental study has been undertaken at NASA MSFC to understand the fluid damping physics from a <b>ring</b> <b>baffle</b> in the barrel section of a propellant tank.

40|$|Bubbles in gas-solid {{fluidized}} {{beds are}} generally beneficial as they promote solids mixing, heat transfer and mass transfer. In most fluidized beds, the local bubble gas flux varies greatly over the cross-section. A novel triboelectric method is developed {{to measure the}} bubble gas distribution in a fluidized bed. A correlation relates the local bubble gas flux to the triboelectric signal generated by {{the impact of the}} gas bubbles on a triboprobe. Several signal analysis tools, such as power spectrum, cycle analysis and signal moments, were used to determine the best experimental fit for the profile of the bubble gas flux. The triboelectric method is used to study the impact of baffle and fluxtube on the distribution of the gas bubbles. Efficient and uniform liquid feed distribution in Fluid CokersTM enhances the yield of valuable products and the coker operability by reducing the formation of wet agglomerates. A promising method to improve liquid distribution could be the modification of bed hydrodynamics and mixing characteristics using <b>ring</b> <b>baffles</b> with and without fluxtubes. In small scaled-down bed, such a baffle changed the fluidized bed hydrodynamics by redirecting gas bubbles above the baffle region, directed towards the jet spray, which improved liquid distribution by reducing agglomerate formation. The experimental results show that the best liquid distribution is obtained when the tip of the liquid injection nozzle is aligned just above the baffle tip. As long as the baffle angle with the vertical is less than 45 o, this will also prevent the formation of any deposit on the baffle...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. NASA is {{currently}} in development of a vertical test bed vehicle demonstrating new green propellant propulsion systems and autonomous landing and hazard detection technology. The vehicle is required {{to land on the}} Earth???s surface without the aid of parachutes using a single gimbaled LOX/Methane engine to control its descent. One of the many challenges of this system is the ability to control the descent while the vehicle is exposed to external and internal disturbances, and under changing mass properties (propellant consumption). In order to develop a suitable control system, the maximum expected magnitude of the disturbance inputs must be predicted. One such disturbance is the propellant slosh created during vehicle accelerations. This paper analyzes the effects of propellant slosh on the rigid body motion of the vehicle for both liquid methane (fuel) and liquid oxygen (oxidizer) residing in spherical propellant tanks containing cruciform and rigid <b>ring</b> <b>baffles.</b> This was accomplished by analysis and software simulation. The results are compared with the NASA models as well as existing historical data. With a validated analysis model, the software can be used to run multiple scenarios to gain information on vehicle response prior to testing using expensive vehicle hardware. The software used for the simulation is SimWise 4 D by Design Simulation Technologies, Inc. Modeling of the rigid body vehicle was done using Pro ENGINEER and Siemens NX 8 CAD software. Simulation in SimWise 4 D showed that the induced vehicle rotation rates due to propellant slosh in the spherical tanks are dependent on the propellant fuel height, slosh frequency, slosh amplitude, and propellant mass. Induced angular rates and accelerations decreased with a decrease of propellant loading beginning at the 2000 lb load case. Higher load cases (at 4000 lb for example) exhibited decreased induced velocity due to decreased sloshing as the liquid free surface decreased within the spherical tank.
