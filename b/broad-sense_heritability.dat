40|$|BACKGROUND: Aspen {{naturally}} {{grows in}} large, single-species, even-aged stands that regenerate clonally after fire disturbance. This offers {{an opportunity for}} an intensive clonal forestry system that closely emulates the natural life history of the species. In this paper, we assess the potential of genetic tree improvement and clonal deployment to enhance the productivity of aspen forests in Alberta. We further investigate geographic patterns of genetic variation in aspen and infer forest management strategies under uncertain future climates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genetic variation among 242 clones from Alberta was evaluated in 13 common garden trials after 5 - 8 growing seasons in the field. <b>Broad-sense</b> <b>heritabilities</b> for height and diameter at breast height (DBH) ranged from 0. 36 to 0. 64, allowing 5 - 15 % genetic gains in height and 9 - 34 % genetic gains in DBH. Geographic partitioning of genetic variance revealed predominant latitudinal genetic differentiation. We further observed that northward movement of clones almost always resulted in increased growth relative to local planting material, while southward movement had a strong opposite effect. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Aspen forests are an important natural resource in western Canada that is used for pulp and oriented strandboard production, accounting for ~ 40 % of the total forest harvest. Moderate to high <b>broad-sense</b> <b>heritabilities</b> in growth traits suggest good potential for a genetic tree improvement program with aspen.

We specifically asked whether such variation in trophic morphology and fitness is present in Scaphiopus couchii, a species that serves as a proxy for ancestral Spea. We also asked whether corticosterone, a vertebrate hormone produced in response to environmental signals, mediates the expression of this variation.
