50|$|Around {{the same}} time, the Victorian Railways was experimenting with {{replacing}} cast-iron <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> with a non-metallic compound (probably asbestos), so Set 11 was fitted with these, and tested between Seaford and Frankston, in 5 mph increments up to line speed, in both directions. Four tests were made - first using the non-metallic <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> with empty and later loaded with cast-iron blocks, equal in weight to a crush load of passengers, {{and then with}} the cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> fitted to the train, as well as simulating the load, and finally the empty train with cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>blocks.</b> It was found that the new type of <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> performed better at higher speeds, but worse at lower speeds, so on average they gave similar performance and were approved for use. A similar test was later conducted with the Walker railmotors between Laverton and Werribee.|$|R

If the saw detects a change in this current (as would occur if a hand or other body part came into contact with the blade), an automatic braking system is activated, forcing an aluminum <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> into the blade. This aluminum block is designed to absorb the energy of blade by deforming.|$|E
5000|$|The {{brake shoe}} carries the <b>brake</b> <b>block.</b> The block was {{originally}} {{made of wood}} but is now usually cast iron. When the brake is applied, the shoe moves and presses the block against the tread of the wheel. As well as providing braking effort this also [...] "scrubs" [...] the wheel and keeps it clean. This scrubbing causes {{wear and tear on}} the wheel tread and often causes brake squeal. Tread brakes on passenger trains have now largely been superseded by disc brakes.|$|E
40|$|Brake {{noise is}} known to be a major {{contributor}} to the total sound emission of railway yards and areas near stations. It has been established that composite <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> reduce rolling noise, but it is not known if this is also the case for braking noise. Therefore, in order to investigate this, noise measurements were conducted on mixed freight trains according to the applicable protocols. Measurements were conducted on trains slowing down from a speed of 30 km/h to standstill and on trains passing-by with brakes applied. Some composite <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> showed a considerable reduction of both braking pass-by levels and peak noise levels. Results are presented. If squeal noise is absent, braking noise of most considered <b>brake</b> <b>blocks</b> show a speed dependency similar to that for rolling noise...|$|R
40|$|Conventional brakes {{require a}} {{powerful}} actuator, leading to large, heavy {{and in most}} cases energy consuming brakes. This paper introduces a fundamen-tally different brake concept called statically balanced brakes (SBBs). SBBs do not require any actuation force to maintain a braking torque and only have to move a small mass to vary that torque. Therefore, their energy consumption is potentially very low. In an SBB, one of the two friction surfaces is connected through springs to a <b>braking</b> <b>block.</b> This <b>braking</b> <b>block</b> is connected through a mechanism to a second set of springs, the other side of which connects to the ground. The total energy in the two sets of springs is constant, which results in a zero-force characteristic at the <b>braking</b> <b>block.</b> The position of this statically balanced <b>braking</b> <b>block</b> determines the displacement of the first set of springs and thus the normal force between the friction surfaces. We categorize mech-anisms {{that can be used in}} SBBs and show two embodiments: one with leaf springs with a range of positions with negative stiffness and one with torsion springs and a non-linear cam mechanism. Results show that the actuation force can be reduced by approximately 95 - 97 % in comparison to regular brakes. This shows that in SBBs, the actuation force can be almost eliminated and thus showing the potential of SBBs to be small, lightweight and energy efficient...|$|R

5000|$|The South Australian {{cars were}} {{allocated}} to the Mount Gambier overnight service, with Finnis and Angas externally rebuilt in 1953 to provide {{a better quality of}} travel. Tambo, Onkaparinga and Dargo were not refurbished, though at some point, Onkaparinga was fitted with steel sheeting over the sides in an attempt to preserve the timber. In 1972 the South Australian Railways sold Onkaparinga to the Marbury School in Aldgate, with bogies. In 1988 it was donated to the Port Dock Station Railway Museum. [...] In 1974 Dargo was condemned and sold without bogies to a private property in Lameroo, South Australia, and was reported to be in good condition and stored undercover. Tambo followed in 1975. On 24 September 1976 Angas caught fire while on the Mount Gambier run, due to a worn <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> generating sparks and heat. There were no injuries and passengers were transferred to an adjacent carriage, but most of the car was damaged and the repair cost was estimated at the time to be [...] "in excess of $30,000". As a result, the car was withdrawn from service; {{at the same time the}} other cars were withdrawn and placed into storage. Finnis and Angas were passed to the Australian Railway Historical Society's South Australian division, operating as SteamRanger; Tambo was planned to go to the Pichi Richi Railway, but after being stored for several years at Peterborough it was transferred to SteamRanger in 1980, then awaiting restoration at their Dry Creek depot.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{comparison}} of the frictional characteristics of three different samples of <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> materials.

40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway tread braking has {{previously}} been developed for use in calculations of wheel and <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> temperatures. Block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel. Heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is accounted for. The thermal model was calibrated using results from both standard brake rig tests and tests when a “rail-wheel” {{was introduced in the}} rig. Furthermore, the model was successfully calibrated using results from field studies. In the present work, the thermal model is utilised to study temperatures and partitioning of heating power during different braking set-ups and braking loads. First, the influences from geometrical changes are studied, with parameters such as wheel design, wheel wear and block wear. Also the effect of <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> configuration is studied. Second, the influence from <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> material is considered. Third, the influences from braking parameters are studied. Gradient braking on mountain descents is simulated but also the related case of brake system malfunctioning. Stop braking is studied. Fourth, the importance of rail chill is investigated with respect to shape and size of the contact patch between wheel and rail. A general result from the present parametric study is that rail chill is important for a useful simulation of wheel temperatures and heat partitioning at drag braking. Rail chill consumes a considerable part of the total heat at drag braking and it becomes increasingly important as the tread temperature rises. For example, {{at the end of a}} brake cycle at 30 kW per wheel for 30 min with composition brake blocks using a 920 mm wheel, 21 % of the total heat enters the rail...|$|E
40|$|Roughness (corrugation, waviness) on {{the tread}} of a rolling railway wheel leads to {{vibrations}} in wheels, bogies and superstructure {{and also in}} rails, sleepers and roadbed. These vibrating components radiate noise to the surroundings. A lowering of the noise levels from tread braked freight cars is of utmost importance {{for the future of}} rail traffic. The thermomechanical interaction between <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> and wheel tread during braking has been found to cause hot spots on the wheel tread. This phenomenon is believed to be a main contributor {{to the development of a}} wavy tread surface. Due to thermal expansion of the rim material, the hot spots will protrude from the wheel tread and be more exposed to wear during the wheel/block contact than the rest of the tread surface. The non-even wear results in roughness on the tread of the wheel after cooling. In the present paper, a theoretical and numerical model of the interaction between wheel rim and <b>brake</b> <b>block</b> has been developed. Simulations with this model demonstrate the principal phenomena occurring at the wheel/block contact. Furthermore, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented...|$|E
