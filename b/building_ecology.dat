40|$|Understanding {{the concept}} of {{ecological}} sustainability and translating it into practice as sustainable development is a key challenge for today&# 039;s built environment professionals. The skill and vision of those who shape our cities and homes is vital to achieving sustainable solutions to the many environmental, economic and social problems we face on a local, national and global scale. Peter Graham offers here a holistic view of ecologically sustainable building by drawing on established areas of knowledge, demonstrating their relevance to the environmentally-conscious building professional and putting the process, product and impact of building into context. Case studies illustrate how sustainable principles have been applied successfully and discussion topics are offered to stimulate thought. <b>Building</b> <b>Ecology</b> will help planners, surveyors, designers and builders to incorporate sustainability into their everyday practice by: · showing which styles of building are ecologically sustainable · providing fundamental knowledge for making decisions using the principles of ecologically sustainable building · explaining a complex subject in a clear, balanced way. <b>Building</b> <b>Ecology</b> sets out the current scientific view of how nature works and how buildings link with and affect nature.

40|$|Integration of IAQ {{concerns}} in so-called sustainable designs {{has suffered from}} a lack of a comprehensive, science-based assessment methodology for building environmental performance. Guidance and rating systems for “green ” buildings fail to address systematically the trade-offs necessary for assessment of the overall performance of a building or its design. This paper presents a framework constructed on the basis of <b>Building</b> <b>Ecology</b> for such an assessment. Using the environmental capacity concept developed and used in the Netherlands in the early 1990 s, environmental performance targets can be established. Specific environmental goals including those for indoor air quality can be articulated and targets established for use with life cycle assessment tools. The overall result is an approach to building design and evaluation of completed buildings that can create better indoor environments as well as reduced impacts on the general environment with appropriate and clearly-articulated emphasis on the local context as well as global environmental concerns...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{commercial building}} {{indoor air quality}} practices and then discusses them {{in the context of}} total building environmental performance. “Green buildings” generally have included some effort to address indoor air quality issues along with an unspecified number of other environmental concerns. Rarely, if ever, is analysis conducted to evaluate trade-offs made among environmental features considered important in “green” buildings even though conflicts occur among design features intended to improve a building’s environmental performance. One “green building ” feature may reduce certain environmental impacts while increasing others. A method is needed to examine the total environmental impact of designs. In order to identify best sustainable indoor air quality practices in commercial buildings, a newly-developed, comprehensive approach to <b>building</b> <b>ecology</b> is presented. This approach, tentatively titled the Systematic Evaluation and Assessment of Building Environmental Performance (SEABEP), uses sustainability criteria as the basis for comprehensive evaluation of the environmental performance of design features...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDesignand {{operation}} of buildings {{in view of}} optimal thermal and visual performance can benefit from deployment of appropriate simulation tools. Specifically, the design and configuration of building-integrated renewable energy systems (solar-thermal collectors and photovoltaic panels) can be effectively supported via reliable computation of incident solar radiation. Toward this end, advanced building energy and lighting simulation programs typically use high-resolution sky models. In this contest, the present contribution addresses the reliability of these models based on long-term high-resolution data collected at the observatory of the Department of Building Physics and <b>Building</b> <b>Ecology</b> at the Vienna University of Technology, Austria. This observatory is equipped with radiometric and photometric sensors to measure global and diffuses horizontal irradiance and illuminance, global vertical irradiance and illuminance of the four cardinal orientations, as well as sky radiance and luminance values for discrete sky patches. To evaluate the performance of two widely used sky models, we compared simulated and measured vertical irradiance values as well as patch radiance values. The statistical appraisal of the comparison points to limits in the predictive accuracy of both models...|$|E
40|$|Integration {{of indoor}} {{environmental}} concerns in sustainable buildings requires a comprehensive, science-based assessment of building environmental performance. Indoor environmental quality must be assessed {{in the context}} of total building performance and the aggregated impacts on the indoor and total environment. This requires articulated targets established {{on the basis of the}} carrying capacity (”ecocapacity”) of the local and global environment and agreed targets for indoor environmental performance. These “sustainable ” targets can be used with total building environmental performance assessment tools in building design and evaluation of completed buildings to create better indoor environments and reduce impacts on the general environment recognizing local context and global environmental concerns. Targets will be based on priorities that vary considerably in developed and less developed countries (Ehrlich and Kennedy 2005). The local context will affect regional and local targets and should be considered in established sustainability targets for resource consumption and pollution emissions. This paper presents an approach to determining sustainability targets based on a <b>Building</b> <b>Ecology</b> framework and an established approach to determine targets for overall global, national, and building sector sustainability.

40|$|Application of {{indigenous}} knowledge {{is an example}} of knowledge-based-ness considered as the main agenda in most current urban and climate planning as well as geographical studies. It is one of the interesting topics in research on the role of climate on human dwelling and immediate environment. Indeed, <b>building</b> <b>ecology</b> emphasizes the ability to combine climate and environmental factors and rendering them to spatial qualities and structural comfort. This paper investigates the application {{of indigenous}} knowledge and the correspondence between traditional texture of Naeen city and its climate. In this regard, the climatic conditions in Naeen were studied in terms of temperature, humidity, wind and tourist comfort index (TCI) of climatourism. The data was collected from Isfahan Meteorology Website over the period 1985 - 2005. Subsequently, the traditional texture of Naeen, construction materials and building styles were studied through considering the special architectural conditions and compatible materials. Eventually, the correspondence between architectural styles and climatic conditions was studied. The results show that traditional architecture based on indigenous knowledge was consistent with climatic conditions. In this regard, using such materials as mud bricks and thatch with suitable heat capacity as well as using wind catchers, high walls around houses, dome construction, southward direction of houses were consistent with east-west wind direction. In addition, concentration of the traditional texture of the city, wall thickness, corridors, long hallways, courtyard ponds and roofed alleys are evidence of the effect of climatic conditions on urban texture in order to provide comfort in different seasons...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNatural {{ventilation}} {{represents a}} potentially sustainable scheme for {{the provision of}} good indoor air quality and free cooling in buildings. However, its application is frequently hindered due to outdoor climatic conditions, air pollution, or noise pollution. The later impediment represents one of the main motivations behind the research presented in this paper, as buildings under noise exposure cannot effectively deploy the natural (window) ventilation option. To address this problem, the potential of building envelope solutions that could offer sufficient sound insulation while facilitating natural ventilation is of critical importance. Specifically, the present contribution focuses on the sound insulation properties of double facades with openings for natural ventilation. Thereby, a generic double-leaf façade was conceived and installed between two adjacent reverberant chambers in the acoustic laboratory of the Department of Building Physics and <b>Building</b> <b>Ecology</b> at the Vienna University of Technology. This experimental modular double-leaf wall allows for various configurations of open elements. Multiple opening combinations were studied, such that the impact of various system parameters (e. g., the size of the opening, location of the openings, the relative displacement of the openings in the two layers) could be assessed both empirically and computationally. Furthermore, various levels of sound absorption in the double wall cavity (realized with absorber panels) were considered and tested. The resulting comprehensive set of parametric configurations was subject of systematic sound transmission measurements. Using the results of the measurements, multivariable analysis and curve-fitting techniques were deployed toward developing empirically-based equations for the prediction of the sound insulation of double-leaf facades with openings for natural ventilation. Furthermore, a simple analytical model was proposed that could be also applied toward predicting the sound transmission of such constructions. The results of empirically-based and analytical models are compared with the measurements results to discuss the potential and limitations of their predictive performance...|$|E
