5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their {{behavior}} {{as a result of}} experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. <b>Brain-derived</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic accomplishment of geraniol (GE 100 mg/kg) on 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -induced mice model of PD. Current investigation proved that pretreat-ment with GE ameliorates the MPTP-induced alterations in behavioral, biochemical, immunohistochemical, and immuno-blotting manifestations in mice. Systematically, the loss of dopaminergic neurons and reduced NTFs mRNA expressions induced by MPTP was ameliorated to a significant extent by pretreatment with GE. We found that GE confers a potent neuroprotective agent against MPTP-induced dopaminergic denervation and may become a potential therapeutic agent for PD and/or its progression...|$|R

It has accounted to alter the release of neurotransmitters by affecting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations which blocks inositol metabolism that results in depletion of cellular inositol and inhibition of phospholipase C-mediated signal transduction (Hardman et al. 2001). Extensive increase of protein kinase C (PKC) activity within the brain elevates the maniac condition and lithium carbonate augment sodium valproate to inhibit the excess accumulation of the enzyme (Yildiz et al. 2008).

5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of <b>brain-derived</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor,</b> a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive deficits are {{observed}} {{in a variety of}} domains in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). These deficits are attributed to neurobiological, functional and structural brain factors, particularly in prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, cortical alterations in each phase (mania/hypomania, euthymia and depression) are also present. A growing basis of evidence supports aerobic exercise as an alternative treatment method for BD symptoms. Its benefits for physical health in healthy subjects and some psychiatric disorders are fairly established; however evidence directly addressed to BD is scant. Lack of methodological consistency, mainly related to exercise, makes it difficult accuracy and extrapolation of the results. Nevertheless, mechanisms related to BD physiopathology, such as hormonal and neurotransmitters alterations and mainly related to <b>brain-derived</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factors</b> (BDNF) can be explored. BDNF, specially, have a large influence on brain ability and its gene expression is highly responsive to aerobic exercise. Moreover, aerobic exercise trough BDNF may induce chronic stress suppression, commonly observed in patients with BD, and reduce deleterious effects caused by allostatic loads.

Recently, it has been noted that extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation, triggered by both glutamate exposure or hypoxic/ischemic conditions, activate a CREB (cAMP response element binding) protein shut-off, which in turn caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. On the other hand, activation of synaptic NMDA receptors activated only the CREB pathway, which activates BDNF (<b>brain-derived</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor),</b> not activating apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|One {{mechanism}} for preserving the dynamic {{range of a}} neuron is synaptic scaling, the homeostatic form of plasticity that restores neuronal activity to its normal 'baseline' levels by changing the postsynaptic response of all the synapses of a neuron {{as a function of}} activity. This means that the same scaling is done to each synapse, to either strengthen or weaken all of a neuron’s connections. Scaling can be multiplicative (multiplying or dividing the strength of each synapse by a constant number) or additive (adding or subtracting the same value from the synaptic weight). Homeostatic mechanisms go beyond the synapse. Modulation of the intrinsic excitability of a neuron is a way to maintain stability despite changing numbers and strengths of synapses. Cultured cortical pyramidal neurons maintain stability through the regulation of ionic conductances. The regulation of ionic conductances is achieved through the controlled release of <b>brain-derived</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> (BDNF). BDNF has also been found to influence synaptic scaling, suggesting that this neurotrophic factor may be responsible for the coordination of synaptic and nonsynaptic mechanisms in homeostatic plasticity.|$|E

In a study carried out by Van Praag et al. [48] rPE induced hippocampic neurogenesis (particularly in the dentate gyrus) which was associated with synaptogenesis and an improvement in the learning capabilities (spatial memory and long-term potentiation) of trained old mice in comparison with control mice (same model and same age), that did not have access to a running wheel. Regular and continuous training of rats (from 5 to 23  months of age) over a period of 18  months, which required them to run on a horizontal treadmill at a speed of 20  m/min for 20  min, twice a day, 5  days a week, also had a neuroprotective effect on the cerebellum [49]. Larsen et al. [49] reported that sedentary-aged rats had 11 % fewer Purkinje cells and 9 % smaller Purkinje cell soma volumes (both two, p[*]=[*] 0.02) than exercised aged rats, and exercised aged rats had the same number of Purkinje cells as young rats (5  months of age).

[...] Since procedural learning has also exhibited consolidation and enhancement under REM sleep, it is proposed that the impairment of procedural learning tasks is due to the lack of BDNF proteins in the cerebellum and brainstem during RSD. [...] In regards to NGF, the basal forebrain (production and distribution of AcH in the brain), more specifically the medial septal area, sends cholinergic (excitatory in hippocampus) and GABAinergic (inhibitory) neurotransmitters through fibres to the hippocampus target cells. [...] These target cells then secrete NGF which plays a key role in the physiological state of the hippocampus and its functions.

Thirty days after transection, 24 rats were randomly assigned to four groups, control and three experimental groups, {{based on the number of}} steps imposed during daily treadmill training: 0 steps, 100 steps, 1000 steps. After 4 weeks, the rats were sacrificed and the spinal cords were processed for immunohistochemistry. BDNF and TrkB receptors were identified using BDNF and TrkB antibodies, respectively. Motor neurons were identified using HSP- 27 antibodies. Pre-synaptic terminals of the motor neurons were identified using the Synaptophysin antibodies. Quantitative analyses were performed using fluorescence and confocal microscopy to examine the expression of BDNF, TrkB and Synaptophysin around motor neurons.

Here we describe a role for the diffusible C. elegans protein LECT- 2, which is homologous to vertebrate leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT 2) /Chondromodulin II. LECT 2 /Chondromodulin II has been implicated {{in a variety of}} pathological conditions [10 - 13], but the developmental functions of LECT 2 have remained elusive. We find that LECT- 2 /Chondromodulin II is required for development of PVD and FLP dendritic arbors and can act as a diffusible cue from a distance to shape dendritic arbors. Expressed in body-wall muscles, LECT- 2 decorates neuronal processes and hypodermal cells in a pattern similar to the cell adhesion molecule SAX- 7 /L 1 CAM. LECT- 2 functions genetically downstream of the MNR- 1 /Menorin-SAX- 7 /L 1 CAM adhesion complex and upstream of the DMA- 1 receptor. LECT- 2 localization is dependent on SAX- 7 /L 1 CAM, but not on MNR- 1 /Menorin or DMA- 1 /LRR-TM, suggesting that LECT- 2 functions as part of the skin-derived MNR- 1 /Menorin-SAX- 7 /L 1 CAM adhesion complex.

The analyzed literature concentrated on a few important topics, such as proven risk factors, evidence of homeostatic abnormalities, and significant associations with the occurrence of SIDS. It was found that there was central nervous system dysfunction on most levels, including: damaged Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, malformations of the human choroid plexus, decreased neuropeptide signaling (both orexin and <b>brain-derived</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factors),</b> malformations of the amino acid neurotransmitters (both excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA), and finally significant reductions in the receptor density and activity of the serotonin system. These irregularities were associated, in most studies, with either the prone sleeping position or known maternal nicotine use during pregnancy. 	In conclusion, the triple-risk model is currently the most accurate description of SIDS, given its reasonable three criteria and present-day research. This is because the studies, and real-life victims, were all concentrated within the critical time period of transition from intra-uterine to extra-uterine life, satisfying the first element of timing. The list of central nervous system dysfunctions found in SIDS cases was compelling enough to fulfill the second factor of inherent vulnerability. Finally, the associations between low oxygen rebreathing and the prone sleep position, or over-heating and tight swaddling displayed a strong relationship with the occurrence of SIDS and satisfied the third and final event, which was the induction of an exogenous stressor. These three factors of the triple-risk model allow for the variations in victim pathology, but still offers a compelling and coherent understanding of the sudden {{infant death syndrome}}...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSynchronization of {{circadian}} rhythms to the 24 -h light/dark (L/D) cycle ă {{is associated}} with daily rearrangements of the neuronal-glial network of ă the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN), the central ă master clock orchestrating biological functions in mammals. These ă anatomical plastic events involve neurons synthesizing vasoactive ă intestinal peptide (VIP), known as major integrators of photic signals ă in the retinorecipient region of the SCN. Using an analog-sensitive ă kinase allele murine model (TrkBF 616 A), we presently show that the ă pharmacological blockade of the tropomyosin-related kinase receptor type ă B (TrkB), the high-affinity receptor of <b>brain-derived</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> ă <b>factor</b> (BDNF), abolished day/night changes in the dendrite enwrapping of ă VIP neurons by astrocytic processes (glial coverage), used as an index ă of SCN plasticity on electron-microscopic sections. Therefore, the ă BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway exerts a permissive role on the ă ultrastructural rearrangements that occur in SCN under L/D alternance, ă an action {{that could be a}} critical determinant of the well-established ă role played by BDNF in the photic regulation of the SCN. In contrast, ă the extent of glial coverage of non-VIP neighboring dendrites was not ă different at daytime and nighttime in TrkBF 616 A mice submitted to TrkB ă inactivation or not receiving any pharmacological treatment. These data ă not only show that BDNF regulates SCN structural plasticity across the ă 24 -h cycle but also reinforce the view that the daily changes in SCN ă architecture subserve the light synchronization process...|$|R
40|$|Although {{evidence}} {{obtained with}} the PC 12 cell line has suggested {{a role for}} the ras oncogene proteins in the signal transduction of nerve growth factor-mediated fiber outgrowth, {{little is known about}} the signal transduction mechanisms involved in the neuronal response to <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factors</b> in nontransformed cells. We report here that the oncogene protein T 24 -ras, when introduced into the cytoplasm of freshly dissociated chick embryonic neurons, promotes the in vitro survival and neurite outgrowth of nerve growth factor-responsive dorsal root ganglion neurons, <b>brain-derived</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> factor-responsive nodose ganglion neurons, and ciliary neuronotrophic factor-responsive ciliary ganglion neurons. The proto-oncogene product c-Ha-ras also promotes neuronal survival, albeit less strongly. No effect could be observed with truncated counterparts of T 24 -ras and c-Ha-ras lacking the 23 C-terminal amino acids including the membrane-anchoring, palmityl-accepting cysteine. These results suggest a generalized involvement of ras or ras-like proteins in the intracellular signal transduction pathway for <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Researches have {{showed that}} {{exercise}} trainings increase the <b>brain-derived</b> <b>neurotrophic</b> (BDNF) and glial cell-derived <b>neurotrophic</b> <b>factor</b> (GDNF) in the brain. In addition, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) increase protein content of BDNF and GDNF in vitro. However, there is insufficient {{information about the}} interactive effects of high intensity exercise training, H 2 O 2, and TNFα on neurotrophins. Hence, in the present study, we investigated the effect of high intensity intermittent training on the content of BDNF, GDNF, H 2 O 2 and TNFα in the brain of albino wistar rats. Materials and methods: Sixteen albino wistar rats divided into control and high intensity intermittent training groups.
