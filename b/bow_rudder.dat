This paper presents an innovative inverter-fed electric linear motor prototype conceived to replace hydrostatic drives with large expected benefits in compactness, maintenance, efficiency and reliability. The linear motor prototype has been designed through special optimization algorithms based on finite element analysis to maximize the force density. The electromagnetic and mechanical structure has been also selected to achieve superior reliability by means of structural simplicity, robustness and redundancy. Along with design criteria, the paper outlines the prototype technology and the construction issues and provides some testing results collected during the experimental performance assessment...|$|R

5000|$|Shortly after {{clearing}} {{the mouth of}} Loch Ryan, the ship turned west towards Larne and exposed her stern to {{the worst of the}} high seas. Huge waves damaged the low stern doors, allowing water to enter the car deck. The crew struggled to close the doors again but they proved to be too badly damaged and water continued to flood in from the waves. The scuppers {{did not seem to be}} allowing the water to drain away. The ship took a list to starboard and at this point Captain Ferguson decided to retreat to the safety of Loch Ryan by going astern and using the <b>bow</b> <b>rudder.</b> This proved to be impossible, because the extreme conditions prevented the deckhands from releasing the securing pin on the <b>bow</b> <b>rudder,</b> and the Captain then made a decision to try to reach Northern Ireland by adopting a course which would keep the stern of the craft sheltered from the worst of the elements. At 09:46 AM, two hours after leaving Stranraer a message was transmitted in Morse code (the Princess Victoria did not have a radio telephone) by radio operator David Broadfoot to the Portpatrick Radio Station: [...] "Hove-to off mouth of Loch Ryan. Vessel not under command. Urgent assistance of tugs required". With a list to starboard exacerbated by shifting cargo, water continued to enter the ship. At 10:32 AM an SOS transmission was made, and the order to abandon was given at 14:00.Possibly the first warship in the area was HMS Launceston Castle, commanded by Lt. Cdr J M Cowling, a frigate which was en route to Derry. Searches were carried out but Launceston Castle was forced to leave when her condensers were contaminated by salt.Upon the upgrade of the assistance message to an SOS, the Portpatrick Lifeboat the Jeannie Spiers was dispatched, as was the destroyer HMS Contest. Contest, commanded by Lt Commander HP Fleming, left Rothesay at 1109hrs but, although she came close to her position at 1330hrs, poor visibility prevented the crew from seeing the sinking ship. The destroyer had been trying to maintain a speed of 31 kn to reach the listing ferry but, after sustaining damage from the seas, Captain Fleming was forced to reduce speed to 16 kn.|$|E
5000|$|Propulsion was by an inclined, three-cylinder {{steam engine}} below the main deck {{with only the}} main bearing tops, upper parts of the valves and {{handling}} levers above the main deck. The engine was unique in using a Walschaert gear, normally used on locomotives, to drive a Corliss gear for the two low-pressure cylinders and the poppet type valves on the high-pressure portion. The speed guarantee of 22 mph was met by the engine's indicated horsepower of [...] at 31 revolutions per minute. The high-pressure cylinder, 66 in in diameter, was centered between the two low-pressure cylinders of 96 in diameter with steam provided by six single ended and three double ended Scotch boilers forward of the engine room delivering steam at 165 pounds per square inch. The single ended boilers were 14 ft inside diameter by 10 ft length and the double ended boilers were 14 ft mean diameter by 20 ft length. The two 32 ft diameter paddle wheels each had eleven steel buckets 14 ft long by 5 ft wide.

In the mist, the destroyer encountered the British destroyer the two destroyers engaged each other until Bernd von Arnims commander requested assistance from Admiral Hipper. Upon arriving on the scene, Admiral Hipper was initially misidentified by Glowworm to be a friendly vessel, which allowed the German ship to close the distance and fire first. Admiral Hipper rained fire on Glowworm, scoring several hits.

50|$|Tarpon got {{underway}} on 25 January for {{her second}} patrol which {{took her to}} the Moluccas. On the 30th, she sighted a convoy; but, since the enemy ships were well escorted, the submarine abandoned the chase. On 1 February, Tarpon fired a spread of four torpedoes at a freighter. One hit. She then fired two more; both hit. Her victim was apparently sinking when the submarine left the scene of the attack, but postwar analysis of Japanese records did not confirm the kill. On 11 February, while investigating a surface contact. Tarpon was illuminated by the enemy's searchlight. She dived and went deep but was severely jolted by four depth charges that knocked out her <b>bow</b> planes, <b>rudder</b> angle indicator, and port annunciator. On the night of 23 February - 24 February, Tarpon ran aground while attempting to navigate Boling Strait, west of Flores Island. Jettisoning ammunition, fresh water, fuel, and torpedoes failed to lighten the ship enough to float her off. A native boat then took an officer ashore on the island of Adunara, later returning with the only white man on the island, a Dutch missionary, Pastor H. von Den Rulst. He informed Wallace the next high tide would occur between 16:00 and 18:00. His warning that Japanese planes had been over the island during each of the past four days caused the crew a bit of uneasiness until flood tide. Then, with three engines backing, she slid off the bottom, returning to Fremantle on 5 March.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{new type}} of {{unmanned}} semi-submersible vehicle with blended-wing body is proposed, which is called BQ- 01 and developed by Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA). Design contents of BQ- 01 include linear design, control surface design, propulsion system design, intake and exhaust system design, and fuel system design. On the premise of blended-wing body hydrodynamic layout, CST method is used to establish the parametric geometric model of the vehicle hull. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software is used to analyze its hydrodynamic performance, including the hull and the mast. <b>Bow</b> and stern <b>rudders</b> of the vehicle are designed based on the CFD analysis. Propulsion system consists of a Cummins diesel engine, a Rolls-Royce waterjet, as well as a clutch and a universal joint and other components. The diesel engine inhales air from the mast to the cabin. A wet exhaust system is used. To reduce BQ- 01 buoyancy changes caused by fuel consumption, a distributed fuel balance supply solution is used. BQ- 01 has undergone two lake tests and a sea test. Tests showed that BQ- 01 had good horizontal mobility and a good sea-keeping capability. Copyright © 2014 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

500|$|Throughout the war, the Allies {{had made}} use {{of a number of}} {{different}} varieties of amphibious vehicle. One of the more commonly used was the Ford GPA, {{a modified version of the}} Ford GPW Jeep (also known as a [...] "Seep"). In India towards the end of the war, Carlin had noticed a GPA in an army vehicle lot. To the mockery of his fellow engineers, he suggested that the vehicle could be used to take him around the world, supposedly remarking: [...] "with a bit of titivation, you could go around the world in one of those things". This idea remained with Carlin after his marriage, and he proposed to his wife that the couple honeymoon by crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a modified GPA. After a considerable amount of trouble, the Carlins finally managed to purchase a 1942 Ford GPA (serial number 1239) from a government auction in Washington, D.C., for US$901. The vehicle had originally been manufactured at Ford's plant in River Rouge, Michigan, one of 12,778 built during the war. He originally tried to convince Ford to sponsor his proposed trip, but the company refused, believing the craft would not make the journey. The vehicle required a number of modifications to make it seaworthy, including the addition of a more boat-like <b>bow,</b> a <b>rudder,</b> a larger cabin, and two extra fuel tanks – one at the bow and one under the [...] "belly" [...] of the craft, at the stern. Inside the cabin, a bunk was installed, and the dash was modified to include aircraft instruments, as well as a two-way radio (including a 19-set transmitter and receiver). In total, the vessel's length was extended by three feet to , and the fuel capacity to 200 gallons (760 L) from the original 12 gallons (45 L). The construction of the under-belly fuel tank allowed it to be jettisoned when empty, reducing further its full weight of three tons (6,720lb or 3,048kg). The vessel was christened Half-Safe, after the slogan of Arrid, a deodorant brand – [...] "Don't be half-safe – use Arrid to be sure".|$|R
