The <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>oscillator</b> was placed both on the forehead and the mastoid. It was concluded that using deeply inserted earphones is the most practical way in which to carry out clinical bone-conduction measurements. Key Words: bone conduction, insert earphone, insertion depth, occlusion effect, supra-aural earphone The occlusion effect (OE) is the lowering of theintensity required to find bone-conduction (BC) thresholds when an ear is occluded, as opposed to when it is uncovered.
