5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Gene flow is the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can therefore {{be a source of}} variation that is new to a population or to a species. Gene flow can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.|$|E

40|$|Ehrlichiosis is a {{group of}} diseases, usually named {{according}} to the host species and the type of white blood cell most often infected. Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Ehrlichia canis and, occasionally, E. chaffeensis. Canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia ewingii. Equine monocytic ehrlichiosis/Potomac horse fever <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Neorickettsia risticii (formerly Ehrlichia risticii).

Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of}} the casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E

Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E

5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} {{injury to the}} spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number of}} them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by helmet-to-helmet collisions as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.|$|E
