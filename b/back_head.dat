25|$|A harness gag encircles the head, with straps {{generally}} {{secured by}} buckles fastened at the <b>back.</b> <b>Head</b> harnesses are {{most commonly used}} to provide points of attachments to secure various kinds of gags, such as ball gags, bit gags, muzzle gags and ring gags; although they also have other uses, such as providing attachment points for other forms of bondage, or may be used simply for their psychological effect. Head harnesses may also function as a gag by themselves, by restricting the ability to open the mouth, or have a mouth cover as an integral part.|$|E
500|$|Aidoo was {{resigned}} by the Tiger-Cats {{prior to}} the 2006 season. In training camp, newcomer Les Mullings competed with Aidoo to become backup running <b>back.</b> <b>Head</b> Coach Greg Marshall praised Aidoo for his performance in training camp, saying [...] "Kojo came into camp in great shape. The best shape I've ever seen him." [...] Aidoo was rewarded with {{a spot on the}} active roster. He played in 16 regular season games, mostly on special teams. He finished the season with a career-high seven special teams tackles in 17 games, along with a single reception and two carries.|$|E
500|$|Maryland {{entered the}} 2010 season with Scott and Meggett sharing {{time as the}} number-one running <b>back.</b> <b>Head</b> coach Friedgen said, [...] "At this point in time, I would say Scott and Meggett are 1A and 1B." [...] In the season opener against Navy, Scott {{recorded}} 58yards on ten carries, which included five touches on the opening drive for 36yards and a five-yard touchdown run. The following week against Division I FCS , Scott, Meggett, and redshirt freshman running back D. J. Adams all averaged over five yards per carry in the 623 rout. Scott amassed eight carries for 42yards and three receptions for 31yards. Maryland's rushing attack struggled in the 3117 loss to West Virginia, and Scott had four carries for six yards and three catches for 26yards. Against Florida International, he gained 103yards and scored two touchdowns on 15carries. Scott scored on a 56-yard run and a nine-yard run in which he broke three arm tackles. Duke held Scott to 26yards in the first half, but in the third quarter, he caught a short pass from quarterback Danny O'Brien {{and ran down the}} sideline for a 71-yard touchdown. O'Brien said he repeatedly checked down through his available receivers and Scott was his final option. Scott finished with 14carries for 50yards.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} part of the incident, 17-year-old James Brissette [...] a family friend [...] was killed, and four other civilians were wounded.

[...] Ezeagwula exclaimed: [...] "Tell me this isn’t real, tell me this isn’t real". Other soldiers came to perform first aid and attempted CPR on Long. Long was dead upon arrival at a hospital. [...] Ezeagwula, who was shot in his <b>back,</b> <b>head,</b> and buttocks, was rushed into surgery at Baptist Hospital in critical condition.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2011, {{businessman}} – and ex-player – Michael Aland {{bought the}} club, with an ambition {{to becoming a}} Premiership side in around 5 years. Soon after, he recruited several highly experienced players and coaches, including Neil <b>Back</b> (<b>Head</b> Coach) and Ben Gollings (Player/Backs Coach). Having been relegated to the National League 3 Midlands previous season, most players from the previous season had left the club. Players who remained with the club included Nick Walton, Ben Nuttall, Callum Tucker, Fraser Tait, Matt Mountford, Neil Davies, Paul Davies and Jack Young. This meant {{that almost all of}} the entire 2011–12 squad had to be either bought or promoted from the youth team. Some of the players brought in had been at the club before, such as Ade Hales and Beau Carney.|$|E

2500|$|Pupa. Suspended by {{the tail}} and a band that encircles it much nearer the head than is usual with Papilio pupae. In form stout, flattened, dilated in the middle, with head and thorax thrown <b>back.</b> <b>Head</b> {{somewhat}} angular and tuberculated; two of the abdominal segments each with a prominent dorsal pair of pointed tubercles. Colour usually light brown, with a strongly contrasting saddle of old gold. (After Davidson & Aitken) - Mr T. A. Sealy (Proc. Ent Soc. 1875 p.9) states- [...] "The pupa possesses the power of making a curious noise like pha-pha!, and makes it very loudly when touched; the noise is accompanied (perhaps produced) by a short contraction of the abdominal segments. I thought {{at first it was}} merely produced by the rubbing of one ring of the pupa-case against the next, but the sound did not resemble a mere frictional sound, it was more like the sound of a rush of air through small holes. I tried to produce it with a dead chrysalis but failed: the pupa sometimes contracted on being touched without making the noise, and appeared unable to make the noise until some time was given to allow it to recover its vigour." [...] Messrs. Davidson and Aitken have also noticed this power in the pupa, but they speak of it [...] "as a husky squeaking noise, produced apparently by friction of the abdominal rings." ...|$|E

6000|$|Frank Houston as he {{read this}} threw himself back {{on the sofa and}} gave way to a soft sigh. He knew he was doing his duty,--just as another man does who goes forth from his {{pleasant}} home to earn his bread and win his fortune in some dry, comfortless climate, far from the delights to which he has been always accustomed. He must do his duty. He could not live always adding a hundred or two of debt to the burden already round his neck. He must do his duty. As he thought of this he praised himself mightily. How beautiful was his far-away cousin, Imogene Docimer, as she would twist her head round so as to show the turn of her neck! How delightful it would be to talk love to Imogene! As to marrying Imogene, who hadn't quite so many hundreds as himself, that he knew to be impossible. As for marriage, he wasn't quite sure that he wanted to marry any one. Marriage, to his thinking, was [...] "a sort of grind," [...] at the best. A man would have {{to get up and go}} to bed with some regularity. His wife might want him to come down in a frock coat to breakfast. His wife would certainly object to his drawing the back heads of other young women. Then he thought of the provocation he had received to draw Gertrude's <b>back</b> <b>head.</b> Gertrude hadn't got any turn of a neck to speak of. Gertrude was a stout, healthy girl; and, having £120,000, was entitled to such a husband as himself. If he waited longer he might be driven to worse before he found the money which was so essentially necessary. He was grateful to Gertrude for not being worse, and was determined to treat her well. But as for love, romance, poetry, art,--all that must for the future be out of the question. Of course, there would now be no difficulty with Sir Thomas, and therefore he must at once make up his mind. He decided that morning, with many soft regrets, that he would go to Glenbogie, and let those dreams of wanderings in the mountains of the Tyrol pass away from him. [...] "Dear, dearest Imogene!" [...] He could have loved Imogene dearly had fates been more propitious. Then he got up and shook himself, made his resolution like a man, ate a large allowance of curried salmon for his breakfast,--and then wrote the following letter. [...] "Duty first!" [...] he said to himself as he sat down to the table like a hero.|$|E
