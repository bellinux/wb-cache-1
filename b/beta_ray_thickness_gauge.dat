5000|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill {{appeared}} in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode [...] "The Ballad of <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill", voiced by Steven Blum. When the Korbinite's homeworld {{was destroyed by}} Surtur's Fire Demons, <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill was specially modified to oversee the Korbinite's survival on the Skuttlebutt with the race under cryogenic hibernation. When Surtur's Fire Demons attack the Skuttlebutt, <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill has the Skuttlebutt take refuge in an asteroid field. His presence was detected by Heimdall as Thor sets out to investigate. When Thor makes {{his way into the}} Skuttlebutt, he is ambushed by <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill (who mistakens Thor for a Fire Demon) and manages to pin him down. <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill successfully lifts Mjolnir and attacks Thor with it. <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill is then teleported to Asgard by Odin (who was trying to teleport Thor back) where <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill mistakens the Asgardians as Fire Demons and attacks Balder, Sif, and the Warriors Three before being subdued by Odin and finally realizes his error due to Odin's genuine concern and love for his son. Thor is teleported back to Asgard by Odin. When <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill reveals his people's plight and demands to wield Mjolnir to fight the Fire Demons, Sif offers to assist him in the battle and Thor offers Mjolnir. Odin denies the offer made by Thor and says he has an idea. After Thor convinces Eitri to help, <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill receives Stormbreaker (which was made from the remaining Uru following Surtur's raid) and uses it to help Thor and Sif fight the Fire Demons in order to keep them from harming the Korbinites. While Sif and the Skuttlebutt's defenses fight the Fire Demons, Thor and <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill fight Enchantress who has been converted into Surtur's mind-controlled pawn. After Thor and <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill defeat Enchantress which causes the Fire Demons to disappear, Surtur speaks through her telling Thor and <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill that Enchantress is now under his control. <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill then leaves with Skuttlebutt in order to find a safe place for the Korbinites to settle down and repopulate, but he promises to aid Thor in his battle with Surtur, the Fire Demon Lord of Muspelheim.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Steel rolling {{occupies}} {{a very important}} position in the iron and steel industry. The thickness of the steel plate is a crucial index of the quality, so the automatic detection system for high-precision thickness of the steel industry has a vital significance. The traditional thickness instruments have X-ray <b>thickness</b> <b>gauge</b> and ultrasonic <b>thickness</b> meter while the X-ray <b>thickness</b> <b>gauge</b> has radiation which is harmful to human body and ultrasonic thickness has a lower precision. For these shortcomings, a high precision <b>thickness</b> <b>gauge</b> by laser sensor was designed. Presented the differential measurement method based on laser displacement sensor. Then using TMS 320 F 2812 as main control chip designed the hardware of the system. Finally, software programming was completed based on the hardware design.
