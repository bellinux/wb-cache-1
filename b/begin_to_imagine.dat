500|$|AllGame's Michael L. House {{enjoyed the}} use of sound bites in civilizations' native languages, which he said was [...] "very {{influential}} in developing an era-enhancing atmosphere". Eurogamer said this feature [...] "gives [...] a personality, rather than the standard 'Acknowledged' grunt of military RTS games", also stating that {{the use of}} female villagers provided a good variety. Game Revolution's review explained that by being set in a more recent epoch of human history, The Age of Kings was able to [...] "add character to an otherwise impersonal style of gameplay". Computer and Video Games approved of The Age of Kings use of shorter, more focused campaigns, compared to its predecessor, while Game Revolution noted that even in slower sections of the campaign, the historical narrative helped maintain player interest. GameSpot said that with the screen full of units, [...] "you can <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> how their historical equivalents once prospered", while GameSpy said The Age of Kings presents [...] "realism rarely seen in the RTS genre". IGN staff argued that while the strengths and weaknesses attributed to different civilizations made the game more realistic, {{the fact that they were}} still mostly the same prevented The Age of Kings from [...] "delivering the same battlefield impact of StarCraft or [...] ".|$|E
500|$|While Polygon Danielle Riendeau {{praised the}} puzzle design, other critics noted {{its lack of}} {{difficulty}} and short length. Riendeau wrote that the puzzles solutions always felt intuitive and never felt frustrating. She found [...] "everything" [...] about the game to be [...] "soothing, almost hypnotic". Edge thought that the game did not present a [...] "genuine" [...] challenge, and that the puzzles did not [...] "find fresh ways to confound and delight" [...] until the final levels. The magazine compared the game to [...] "assembling flat-pack furniture": straightforward in its process, but rewarding in its transformation. Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer wrote that the game was [...] "almost breathtakingly unique". Riendeau said she finished the game in under three hours, and TouchArcade Shaun Musgrave, who could not [...] "even <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> anyone getting stuck on ... the puzzles", put the game's length at [...] "an hour and change". Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer wanted more content. He was also unsatisfied with the game's narrative, which he found [...] "obtuse" [...] and [...] "vague" [...] to a fault. Musgrave of TouchArcade thought that while games that focus on experiences can be shorter, Monument Valley {{did not last long}} enough [...] "for the mechanics to reach their full potential", though the time was [...] "just about right" [...] for the story.|$|E

2500|$|After {{two years}} of study I have succeeded in {{establishing}} {{the basis of this}} new perspective I have talked about so much. It is not the materialist perspective of Gris, nor the romantic perspective of Picasso. It is rather a metaphysical perspective—I take full responsibility for the word.

2500|$|Bunin {{has often}} been spoken of as a [...] "cold" [...] writer. Some of his {{conceptual}} poems of the 1910s refuted this stereotype, tackling philosophical issues like the mission of an artist ("Insensory", 1916) where he showed fiery passion. According to Oleg Mikhaylov, [...] "Bunin wanted to maintain distance between himself and his reader, being frightened by any closeness... But his pride never excluded passions, just served as a panzer— {{it was like a}} flaming torch in an icy shell." [...] On a more personal level, Vera Muromtseva confirmed: [...] "Sure, he wanted to come across as [...] and he succeeded by being a first-class actor... people who didn't know him well enough couldn't <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what depths of soft tenderness his soul was capable of reaching," [...] she wrote in her memoirs.|$|E

On the basis of that sounder education I have sketched in a preceding paper, there is possible such an extension of understanding, such an increase of intelligent co-operations and such a clarification of wills as to dissolve away half the difficulties and conflicts of the present time and to provide for the other half such a power of solution as we, in the heats, entanglements and limitations of our present ignorance, doubt and misinformation can scarcely <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} {{appointed}} chairman of a committee to draught {{an address to the}} Emperor in behalf of the passengers, and as I fully expected, and as they fully intended, I had to write the address myself. I didn't mind it, because I have no modesty and would as soon write to an Emperor as to anybody else--but considering that there were 5 on the committee I thought they might have contributed one paragraph among them, anyway. They wanted me to read it to him, too, but I declined that honor--not because I hadn't cheek enough (and some to spare,) but because our Consul at Odessa was along, and also the Secretary of our Legation at St. Petersburgh, and of course one of those ought to read it. The Emperor accepted the address--it was his business to do it--and so many others have praised it warmly that I <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> it must be a wonderful sort of document and herewith send you the original draught of it to be put into alcohol and preserved forever like a curious reptile.|$|E

Benham, there are days when I splash my bath about without getting into it. There are days when I turn back from a walk because there's a cow in the field.... But, I spare you the viler details.... And it's that makes me hate fine people and try so earnestly to persuade myself that any man is as good as any man, if not a trifle better. Because I know it isn't so...." ...|$|E

6000|$|But Benham {{did come}} to realize this broader {{conflict}} between worker and director, between poor man and possessor, between resentful humanity and enterprise, between unwilling toil and unearned opportunity. It is a far profounder and subtler conflict {{than any other in}} human affairs. [...] "I can foresee a time," [...] he wrote, [...] "when the greater national and racial hatreds may all be so weakened as to be no longer a considerable source of human limitation and misery, when the suspicions of complexion and language and social habit are allayed, and when the element of hatred and aggression may be clean washed out of most religious cults, but I do not <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> a time, because I cannot imagine a method, when there will not be great friction between those who employ, those who direct collective action, and those whose part it is to be the rank and file in industrialism. This, I know, is a limitation upon my confidence due very largely to the restricted nature of my knowledge of this sort of organization. Very probably resentment and suspicion in the mass and self-seeking and dishonesty in the fortunate few are not so deeply seated, so necessary as they seem to be, and if men can be cheerfully obedient and modestly directive in war time, {{there is no reason why}} ultimately they should not be so in the business of peace. But I do not understand the elements of the methods by which this state of affairs can be brought about.|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought and}} went back to his earlier point. [...] "If I am rhetorical, at any rate it's a living feeling behind it. Yes, I {{remember}} all the implications of our aims--very splendid, very remote. But just now it's rather like offering to give a freezing man the sunlit Himalayas from end to end in return for his camp-fire. When you talk of me and my jolly mistress, it isn't fair. That misrepresents everything. I'm not going out of this--for delights. That's the sort of thing men like Snuffles and Keyhole imagine--that excites them! When I think of the things these creatures think! Ugh! But YOU know better? You know that physical passion that burns like a fire--ends clean. I'm going for love, Britten--if I sinned for passion. I'm going, Britten, because when I saw her the other day she HURT me. She hurt me damnably, Britten.... I've been a cold man--I've led a rhetorical life--you hit me with that word!--I put things in a windy way, I know, but what has got hold of me at last is her pain. She's ill. Don't you understand? She's a sick thing--a weak thing. She's no more a goddess than I'm a god.... I'm not in love with her now; I'm RAW with love for her. I feel like a man that's been flayed. I have been flayed.... You don't <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> the sort of helpless solicitude.... She's not going to do things easily; she's ill. Her courage fails.... It's hard to put things when one isn't rhetorical, but it's this, Britten--there are distresses that matter more than all the delights or achievements in the world.... I made her what she is--as I never made Margaret. I've made her--I've broken her.... I'm going with my own woman.

6000|$|... § XII. And observe, you are put to stern {{choice in}} this matter. You must either made {{a tool of}} the creature, or a man of him. You cannot make both. Men were not {{intended}} {{to work with the}} accuracy of tools, to be precise and perfect in all their actions. If you will have that precision out of them, and make their fingers measure degrees like cog-wheels, and their arms strike curves like compasses, you must unhumanize them. All the energy of their spirits must be given to make cogs and compasses of themselves. All their attention and strength must go to the accomplishment of the mean act. The eye of the soul must be bent upon the finger-point, and the soul's force must fill all the invisible nerves that guide it, ten hours a day, that it may not err from its steely precision, and so soul and sight be worn away, and the whole human being be lost at last--a heap of sawdust, so far as its intellectual work in this world is concerned; saved only by its Heart, which cannot go into the form of cogs and compasses, but expands, after the ten hours are over, into fireside humanity. On the other hand, if you will make a man of the working creature, you cannot make a tool. Let him but <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine,</b> to think, to try to do anything worth doing; and the engine-turned precision is lost at once. Out come all his roughness, all his dulness, all his incapability; shame upon shame, failure upon failure, pause after pause: but out comes the whole majesty of him also; and we know the height of it only, when we see the clouds settling upon him. And, whether the clouds be bright or dark, there will be transfiguration behind and within them.|$|E

60|$|Charterson {{struck her}} as looking larger, but then {{whenever}} she saw him he {{struck her as}} looking larger. He enveloped her hand in a large amiable paw {{for a minute and}} asked after the children with gusto. The large teeth beneath his discursive moustache gave him the effect of a perennial smile to which his asymmetrical ears added a touch of waggery. He always betrayed a fatherly feeling towards her as became a man who was married to a handsome wife old enough to be her mother. Even when he asked about the children he did it with something of the amused knowingness of assured seniority, as if indeed he knew all sorts of things about the children that she couldn't as yet even <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine.</b> And though he confined his serious conversation to the two other men, he would ever and again show himself mindful of her and throw her some friendly enquiry, some quizzically puzzling remark. Blenker as usual treated {{her as if she were}} an only very indistinctly visible presence to whom an effusive yet inattentive politeness was due. He was clearly nervous almost to the pitch of jumpiness. He knew he was to be spoken to about the sugar business directly he saw Charterson, and he hated being spoken to about the sugar business. He had his code of honour. Of course one had to make concessions to one's proprietors, but he could not help feeling that if only they would consent to see his really quite obvious gentlemanliness more clearly it would be better for the paper, better for the party, better for them, far better for himself. He wasn't altogether a fool about that sugar; he knew how things lay. They ought to trust him more. His nervousness betrayed itself in many little ways. He crumbled his bread constantly until, thanks to Snagsby's assiduous replacement, he had made quite a pile of crumbs, he dropped his glasses in the soup--a fine occasion for Snagsby's sang-froid--and he forgot not to use a fish knife with the fish as Lady Grove directs and tried when he discovered his error to replace it furtively on the table cloth. Moreover he kept on patting the glasses on his nose--after Snagsby had whisked his soup plate away, rescued, wiped and returned them to him--until that feature glowed modestly at such excesses of attention, and the soup and sauces and things bothered his fine blond moustache unusually. So that Mr. Blenker what with the glasses, the napkin, the food and the things seemed as restless as a young sparrow. Lady Harman did her duties as hostess in the quiet key of her sombre dress, and until the conversation drew her out into unexpected questionings she answered rather than talked, and she did not look at her husband once throughout the meal.|$|E
