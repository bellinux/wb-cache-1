5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet call. It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call resembles the clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when <b>begging</b> for food from a parent or mate, similar to the <b>begging</b> call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana is {{considered}} a gentler form of Shiva's fierce aspect Bhairava and a gentle phase between Bhairava's two gruesome forms, one of which decapitates the god Brahma and the other of which murders the god Vishnu's gatekeeper. Bhikshatana is the form of Bhairava that Shiva assumes to atone for his sin of severing Brahma's fifth head. He wanders the universe {{in the form of}} a naked Kapali mendicant, <b>begging</b> for alms with Brahma's kapala (skullcap) as his <b>begging</b> bowl, until his sin is expiated upon reaching the holy city of Varanasi.|$|E

5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating <b>begging</b> call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with <b>begging</b> that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{recognized}} {{calls for the}} mockingbird: the nest relief call, hew call, chat or chatburst, and the <b>begging</b> call. The hew call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators, conspecific chasing, and various interactions between mates. The differences between chats and chatbursts are frequency of use, as chats are year-round, and chatbursts occur in the fall. Another difference is that chatbursts appear {{to be used in}} territorial defense in the fall, and the chats are used by either sex when disturbed. The nest relief and <b>begging</b> calls are only used by the males.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings (thirty-five and three, respectively) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds. Notable milestones included the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, <b>begging,</b> and preening began {{within the first}} six days of life. Variation in <b>begging</b> and more compact movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, and leaving the nest happened within seventeen days (nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days). Improvements of flight, walking and self-feeding took place within forty days. Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages, {{to the extent of}} one of two siblings living in the same area was likely killed by the other.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Kunduz {{was still}} under Emirate of Bukhara and the {{wandering}} sons of Darab Bi Kataghan decided to attack and retake the city which they did in 1810. The Amir of Kunduz was now Mir Muhammad Murad <b>Beg,</b> one of the brothers. Mir Yar <b>Beg</b> was now worried about the rising popularity and power of Mir Muhammad Murad <b>Beg</b> in the region. Eventually, in 1820 the two would face off at Darah Aim in which Mir Muhammad Murad <b>Beg</b> would be the victor. In 1822 4 brothers under the service of Mir Muhammad Murad <b>Beg</b> rebelled led by Kokan <b>Beg.</b> Mir Muhammad Murad <b>Beg</b> and Kokan <b>Beg</b> often fought with each other over territory inconclusively while battling against rebels in their own respective territories for years. Kokan <b>Beg</b> would be assassinated by his ally in Kashkar (lower Chitral) by being pushed down a precipice. Mir Muhammad Murad <b>Beg</b> taking advantage of this situation took Badakhshan by occupying Fayzabad. But despite invading Badakhshan Mir Muhammad Murad <b>Beg</b> had little to no control over it. In fact Badakhshan was now contested by again by Mir Yar <b>Beg,</b> Sikandar Shah, Shahzada Mahmud, Abdul Ghazi Khan and Shah Suliman <b>Beg</b> who were in exile at Tashkurghan under protection of Mir Wali. Fayzabad had a small population under spiritual preceptor Mian Fazal Azim, Sahibzada of Sirhind. Jirm, Zardeo, Mashad, Daraaim and Fayzabad were successively occupied by these chiefs. Fayzabad fell to Mir Yar <b>Beg</b> who rebuilt his fort and lived in city. The old dynasty thus was restored.|$|R
5|$|Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of creating an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother <b>begging</b> on the street who lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants were able to make more money using their new skills than by <b>begging.</b> In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events she organized for her friends.|$|E

50|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{architectural}} character of the current Old Bazaar occurred during governorship of Ishak <b>Beg</b> and his son Isa Bey. Ishak <b>Beg</b> began construction of Sultan Murad Mosque, which construction was completed in 1436.

After his death his son and successor, Isa <b>Beg,</b> constructed numerous buildings in what is today Old Bazaar. These buildings, constructed between 1445 and 1469, were indispensable for the economic development of the city. Thus, during this time Skopje saw new buildings like Bezisten and Çifte Hamam. After the death of Isa <b>Beg,</b> in accordance with his testament was built Isa <b>Beg</b> Mosque (1475) and later Haji-kasamova mosque (1489-1490) and Mustafa Pasha Mosque (1492).|$|R

40|$|A {{near-infrared}} (NIR; 2. 5 - 4. 5 micron) spectroscopic {{survey of}} SDSS(Sloan Digital Sky Survey) -selected blue early-type galaxies (<b>BEGs)</b> {{has been conducted}} using the AKARI. The NIR spectra of 36 <b>BEGs</b> are secured, which are well balanced in their star-formation(SF) /Seyfert/LINER type composition. For high signal-to-noise ratio, we stack the <b>BEG</b> spectra all and in bins of several properties: color, specific star formation rate and optically-determined spectral type. We estimate the NIR continuum slope and the equivalent width of 3. 29 micron PAH emission. In the comparison between the estimated NIR spectral features of the <b>BEGs</b> and those of model galaxies, the <b>BEGs</b> seem to be old-SSP(Simple Stellar Population) -dominated metal-rich galaxies with moderate dust attenuation. The dust attenuation in the <b>BEGs</b> may originate from recent star formation or AGN activity and the <b>BEGs</b> have a clear feature of PAH emission, the evidence of current SF. <b>BEGs</b> show NIR features {{different from those of}} ULIRGs, from which we do not find any clear relationship between <b>BEGs</b> and ULIRGs. We find that Seyfert <b>BEGs</b> have more active SF than LINER <b>BEGs,</b> {{in spite of the fact}} that Seyferts show stronger AGN activity than LINERs. One possible scenario satisfying both our results and the AGN feedback is that SF, Seyfert and LINER <b>BEGs</b> form an evolutionary sequence: SF - Seyfert - LINER.
