2500|$|The 12th-century heresiographer al-Shahrastani {{describes}} the Majusiya into three sects, the Kayumarthiya, the Zurwaniya and the Zaradushtiya, among which Al-Shahrastani asserts {{that only the}} last of the three were properly followers of Zoroaster. As regards the recognition of a prophet, Zoroaster has said: [...] "They ask you as to how should they recognize a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature; he shall <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> whatever you ask him and he shall perform such things which others cannot perform." [...] (Namah Shat Vakhshur Zartust, [...]5–7. 50–54) When the companions of Muhammad, on invading Persia, came in contact with the Zoroastrian people and learned these teachings, they at once {{came to the conclusion that}} Zoroaster was really a Divinely inspired prophet. Thus they accorded the same treatment to the Zoroastrian people which they did to other [...] "People of the Book".|$|E
40|$|Scientific, {{and more}} {{specifically}} empirical observations, are incapable of deriving a cohesive moral theory based solely on those distinctions. What we find in the ethical world is far more complex than any one series of observations and scientific theories which could establish or break down existing moral theory. Definitions and ethical codes regarding behavior require a more robust and creative approach. The thesis of this paper is, then, no scientific descriptions are descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us how things ought to be. A valid standard form categorical syllogism can be formulated to demonstrate how this conclusion is arrived at by logical necessity. CELARENT EAE- 1 No descriptions of what exists are descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us how things ought to be. All scientific descriptions are descriptions of what exists. Therefore, no scientific descriptions are descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us how things ought to be. The major categorical term of this argument is descriptions that <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us ho...|$|R
