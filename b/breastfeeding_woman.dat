Successful ANRs depend on a stable and long-term relationship, as otherwise {{it is very difficult to}} maintain a steady milk flow. Couples may begin an ANR by transferring regular suckling from a child to a sexual partner (e.g. spouse). Such a relationship may form as an expression of close intimacy and mutual tenderness, and may even exist without sex. Breastfeeding can have a strong stabilizing effect on the partnership.

40|$|Background: Despite {{increased}} awareness of the adverse health effects of vitamin D deficiency, only {{a few studies have}} evaluated the vitamin D status (25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OHD) ]) of <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> and up to now, no information exits for German <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women.</b> Therefore, the aim of {{study was to determine the}} vitamin D status of <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> compared to non-pregnant and non-breastfeeding (NPNB) women. Methods: This cross-sectional study investigated 124 <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> and 124 age and season matched NPNB women from the German "Vitamin and mineral status among German women" study. The study participants were recruited from April 2013 to March 2015 and did not take vitamin D supplements. Serum 25 (OH) D was analyzed by chemiluminescent immunoassay. Results: Vitamin D deficiency (< 25. 0 nmol/L) was prevalent in 26. 6 % of the <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women.</b> The majority of women (49. 2 %) showed 25 (OH) D concentration between 25. 0 and 49. 9 nmol/L. In multiple binary logistic regression analysis, <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> had a 4. 0 -fold higher odds ratio (OR) (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 8, 8. 7) for vitamin D deficiency than NPNB <b>women.</b> For <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women,</b> the risk of vitamin D deficiency was higher in the winter and spring months (OR: 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 1, 6. 3) and increased with lower longitude per one unit (OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 6, 0. 9). Conclusion: <b>Breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> in Germany had a higher risk of deficient vitamin D levels than NPNB women. In further studies, the optimal vitamin D status for <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> should be investigated and also the required vitamin D doses to ensure this vitamin D status.

40|$|The Development of Non-Milk Based Formulated Drinks For Pregnant and <b>Breastfeeding</b> <b>Women.</b> Background: The {{pregnant}} and <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> need a greater nutrition intake compared to normal women. At {{second and third}} trimester of pregnancy, and during <b>breastfeeding,</b> a <b>woman</b> should have additional nutrient for approximately 300 Kcal energy and 17 grams protein per day. Recently, various formula drinks for {{pregnant and}} <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> {{are available in the}} market, however most of these formulas are expensive. Objectives: To develop non-milk based formula drinks for pregnant and <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> which contained adequate amount of additional macro and micro nutrients had good sensory quality and had long self life. Methods: Initially, 13 kinds of drinks were formulated. The drinks contained aproximately 300 Kcal energy and 17 grams protein. They were analyzed for nutrient contain, microbiology and sensory quality in order to vote the best 5 formulas at the laboratory scale. The formulated drinks were packaged and sealed in 150 mL plastic cups. To know the self life of the drinks, storage was carry out in the room, incubator and refrigerator temperature during 12 months. Results: From sensory test, it was concluded that the best five drinks were kweni formula, chocholate formula, ginger formula, guava-orange formula and red bean formula. One cup of 150 ml formulated drink, had 140 - 150 Kcal energy and 8 grams protein. Therefore, to fulfill additional requirements for pregnant and <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women,</b> the drinks should be consumed 2 cups a day. Conclusions: The formula drink developed could provide additional energy, protein, vitamin and mineral needed by pregnant and breast feeding women.

40|$|Research {{has found}} that any support given to a <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>woman</b> will {{positively}} impact on the initiation and duration of her breastfeeding. While {{much of the research}} that examines breastfeeding is focused on the need to improve support for breastfeeding women, there has been a lack of clear understanding on what constitutes support. The research statement for this study was “The meaning of breastfeeding support for six New Zealand women in the first six weeks postpartum. ” Van Manen’s (1990) steps for data analysis guided the interpretation for this study, and a hermeneutic thematic analysis explored the meaning of breastfeeding support for six New Zealand women. Three themes were identified from the data analysis: ‘Being With’, which is more than being physically present, it is an active engagement with the woman. ‘Breastfeeding Culture’, which acknowledges that no woman breastfeeds alone. There are family, friends and others whose beliefs, traditions, and their own interpretation of breastfeeding all impact on the woman’s breastfeeding experience. ‘Breastfeeding Space’ is the third theme, and this describes not only the physical space, but also the emotional space a woman breastfeeds in. When the Breastfeeding Space was comfortable and they felt in control of the space, the women in the study felt supported to breastfeed. A new finding, which was not a theme but rather a thread drawn from the themes, was the notion of a Breastfeeding Triad. The Breastfeeding Triad included a breastfeeding mother, her partner, and their baby. The Breastfeeding Triad was found to be relational, incorporating the authentic presence of ‘Being With’ and adding to it. When family, friends and health professionals support the Breastfeeding Triad, this strengthens the breastfeeding relationship itself. There are several implications for practice from the findings. For those in a position of decision-making within hospitals, the environment needs to be a priority when planning new rooms. It is difficult for women to feel in control of their Breastfeeding Space when they must share a room or bathroom, or when they want their partners to stay but the hospital does not support this. Health professionals could benefit from the findings by acknowledging the Breastfeeding Culture that surrounds a <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>woman.</b> By including her whānau/family and other support people, a link can be made between the <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>woman</b> and those who will be providing ongoing support to her once the health professional is no longer part of her care. For those involved in antenatal and breastfeeding education, partners could be included and given information that is specific to them. These findings could also benefit students by giving them a clearer understanding of what it is that supports New Zealand women to breastfeed in the first six weeks postpartum...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Promoting {{breastfeeding}} is major {{maternal and}} child health goal in India. It is unclear whether mothers receive additional food needed to support healthy breastfeeding. METHODS: Using the latest National Family and Health Survey (2005 - 2006), we applied multilevel linear regression models to document correlates of nutrition for (n = 20, 764) <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women.</b> We then compared consumption of pulses, eggs, meat, fish, dairy, fruit, and vegetables across a sample of breastfeeding, non-breastfeeding/pregnant (NBP), and pregnant women (n = 3, 409) matched within households and five-year age bands. We tested whether <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> had greater advantages in the 18 high-focus states of India's National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). RESULTS: Vegetarianism, caste, and religion were the strongest predictors of breastfeeding women's nutrition. <b>Breastfeeding</b> <b>women</b> had no nutritional advantage compared to NBP women, and were disadvantaged in their consumption of milk (b = - 0. 14) in low-focus states. Pregnant women were similarly disadvantaged in their consumption of milk in low-focus states (b = - 0. 32), but consumed vegetables more frequently (b = 0. 12) than NBP women in high-focus states.
