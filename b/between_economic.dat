Cosmic Balance II, Andromeda Conquest and Reach for the Stars were published in 1983, and are now seen retrospectively as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest was only a simple game of empire expansion, Reach for the Stars introduced the relationship <b>between</b> <b>economic</b> growth, technological progress, and conquest.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} depends on means of production. Literally, those things, like land, {{natural resources and}} technology, necessary {{for the production of}} material goods and the relations of production. In other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together, these compose the mode of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system and superstructure, to the cultural and political system. Marx regarded this mismatch <b>between</b> (<b>economic)</b> base and (social) superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.|$|E

25|$|Disparities {{in housing}} explain {{variations}} in the conversion of income into human capabilities over differing social climates. Put more simply; income does not always translate to desirable outcomes like healthcare, education, and happiness. The quality of one's housing is one factor that determines if such capabilities are readily available to an individual. The economist and philosopher Amartya Sen reasons that a person's available freedoms, or capabilities, are significant indicators {{of the kind of}} life one values or has reason to value. As economic equality varies <b>between</b> <b>economic</b> systems, historical periods, societies so do the housing inequality.|$|E
25|$|The {{free market}} {{viewpoint}} defines economic liberty as {{the freedom to}} produce, trade and consume any goods and services acquired {{without the use of}} force, fraud or theft. This is embodied in the rule of law, property rights and freedom of contract, and characterized by external and internal openness of the markets, the protection of property rights and freedom of economic initiative. There are several indices of economic freedom that attempt to measure free market economic freedom. Empirical studies based on these rankings have found higher living standards, economic growth, income equality, less corruption and less political violence to be correlated with higher scores on the country rankings. It has been argued that the economic freedom indices conflate together unrelated policies and policy outcomes to conceal negative correlations <b>between</b> <b>economic</b> growth and economic freedom in some subcomponents.|$|E

25|$|Acting on {{feedback}} from some fans who had felt Settlers III was too focused on combat, the designers aimed {{for a return}} to the core supply and demand-based gameplay of the first two titles in the series. As a result, the game was designed to strike a balance <b>between</b> <b>economic</b> planning and military conquest, and, in light of this design principal, although the basic gameplay remains relatively unchanged from Settlers III, some of the game mechanics have been altered. For example, {{for the first time in}} the series, the offensive strength of the player's military is tied to the economic value of their settlement; the player has access to each rank of soldier from the beginning of each mission, with the ability to select the rank of every soldier prior to recruitment; the game's single-player campaign focuses on a race that cannot be defeated solely by military means; and specialty units and squad leaders have been added to enhance the tactical aspects of combat, with warships also made available, allowing for combat at sea.|$|E
500|$|Cantillon's Essai {{is written}} using a {{distinctive}} causal methodology, separating Cantillon from his mercantilist predecessors. Essai is peppered {{with the word}} [...] "natural", which {{in the case of}} Cantillon's treatise is meant to imply a cause and effect relationship <b>between</b> <b>economic</b> actions and phenomena. Economist Murray Rothbard credits Cantillon with being one of the first theorists to isolate economic phenomena with simple models, where otherwise uncontrollable variables can be fixed. Cantillon made frequent use of the concept of ceteris paribus throughout Essai in an attempt to neutralise independent variables. Furthermore, he is credited with employing a methodology similar to Carl Menger's methodological individualism, by deducing complex phenomena from simple observations.|$|E
500|$|Historically {{there has}} been a close {{correlation}} <b>between</b> <b>economic</b> growth and environmental degradation: as communities grow, so the environment declines. This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers, economic growth, and environmental indicators. Unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the malignant growth of a cancer because it eats away at the Earth's ecosystem services which are its life-support system. There is concern that, unless resource use is checked, modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through overexploitation of their resource base. While conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources, ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale (rather than continual growth), fair distribution and efficient allocation, in that order. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development states that [...] "business cannot succeed in societies that fail".|$|E
30|$|Water {{flows from}} the {{environment}} to the economy consist of the withdrawals {{of water from the}} environment by the economic units (economic sectors and households). An analysis of those flows provides information on the direct relationships between water resources and the economic units.

Modelling the water transaction <b>between</b> national <b>economic</b> units allows us to determine the intersectoral water relationships which are, in turn, very useful data for integrated water–economic analysis.|$|R

500|$|Two {{additional}} national marches {{were held}} in 1934 and 1936. By this time the country had made a substantial recovery from the worst depression years of 1929–32. Unemployment was significantly down, annual growth was averaging 4%, and {{many parts of the}} country were enjoying a substantial boom in housing and consumer goods. The increasing prosperity was not, however, uniformly spread, and there were sharp contrasts <b>between</b> <b>economic</b> conditions in the south and those in the north-east, South Wales, Scotland and elsewhere, where the rate of recovery was much slower. At the same time, the national mood was changing; external factors such as the rise of fascism in Europe helped to unify the British left, and there were more supportive voices in parliament on behalf of the unemployed. The idea of marching as a means of expressing political or social grievances had by now become an accepted and well-established tactic, and there was a growing awareness of the problems complained of, which counterbalanced their exploitation by the Communists. The historian A. J. P. Taylor considered that the hunger marchers had [...] "displayed the failure of capitalism in a way that mere figures or literary description could not. Middle-class people felt the call of conscience".|$|E
