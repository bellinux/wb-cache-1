She realizes {{that she was}} foolish to reject Emile because of the race of his children's mother. <b>Bloody</b> <b>Mary</b> and Liat come to Nellie asking where Cable is; Mary {{explains}} that Liat refuses to marry anyone but him. Nellie comforts Liat. Cable and Emile's espionage work {{has made it possible}} for a major offensive, Operation Alligator, to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.|$|E
5|$|Protestant writers at {{the time}} took a highly {{negative}} view. By the 17th century, Mary's persecution of Protestants had led to her sobriquet <b>Bloody</b> <b>Mary.</b> John Knox attacked her in his First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women (1558), and she was prominently vilified in Actes and Monuments (1563), by John Foxe. Subsequent editions of Foxe's book remained popular with Protestants throughout the following centuries and helped shape enduring perceptions of Mary as a bloodthirsty tyrant.|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the <b>Bloody</b> <b>Mary</b> cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E

5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a <b>Bloody</b> <b>Mary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{followed}} a similar format: Dr. Cave's tenancy {{was cut short}} in 1551, when King Edward VI granted the abbey to William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, brother of the former Queen Catherine Parr. Much of the abbey stone was then {{used to create a}} new mansion on the site, for the Marquess. The Marquess only held the abbey for two years: after supporting Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, in 1553, on the accession of <b>Bloody</b> <b>Mary,</b> he was arrested and his lands were confiscated. Mary granted the abbey and mansion to her catholic supporter Edward Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings of Loughborough, however he too fell from favour when Mary's sister Elizabeth I came to the throne.|$|E
5|$|After 1555, {{the initial}} {{reconciling}} {{tone of the}} regime began to harden. The medieval heresy laws were restored. The Marian Persecutions of Protestants ensued and 283 Protestants were burnt at the stake for heresy. This resulted in the Queen becoming known as <b>Bloody</b> <b>Mary,</b> due {{to the influence of}} John Foxe, one of the Protestants who fled Marian England. Foxe's Book of Martyrs recorded the executions in such detail that it became Mary's epitaph; Convocation subsequently ordered that Foxe's book should be placed in every cathedral in the land. In fact, while those who were executed after the revolts of 1536, and the St David's Down rebellion of 1549, and the unknown number of monks who died for refusing to submit, may not have been tried for heresy, they certainly exceeded that number by some amount. Even so, the heroism of some of the martyrs was an example to those who witnessed them, so that in some places it was the burnings that set people against the regime.|$|E

25|$|While, as {{with any}} sort of folklore, the details may vary, this {{particular}} tale (<b>Bloody</b> <b>Mary)</b> encouraged young women to walk {{up a flight of}} stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, {{they were supposed to be}} able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant that they were destined to die before they married.|$|E
25|$|Hair of the dog: The {{belief is}} that {{consumption}} of further alcohol after the onset of a hangover will relieve symptoms, based upon {{the theory that the}} hangover represents a form of alcohol withdrawal and that by satiating the body's need for alcohol the symptoms will be relieved. Social drinkers and alcoholics claim that drinking more alcohol gives relief from hangover symptoms, but research shows that the use of alcohol as a hangover cure seems to predict current or future problem drinking and alcohol use disorder, through negative reinforcement and the development of physical dependence. While the practice is popular in tradition and promoted by many sellers of alcoholic beverages, medical opinion holds that the practice merely postpones the symptoms, and courts addiction. Favored choices include Fernet Branca and <b>Bloody</b> <b>Mary.</b>|$|E

"Fo' Dolla'", set {{in part on}} {{the island}} of Bali-ha'i, focuses on the romance between a young Tonkinese woman, Liat, and one of the Americans, Marine Lieutenant Joe Cable, a Princeton {{graduate}} and scion of a wealthy Main Line family. [...] Pressed to marry Liat by her mother, <b>Bloody</b> <b>Mary,</b> Cable reluctantly declines, realizing that the Asian girl would never be accepted by his family or Philadelphia society.
