5|$|After {{conferring with}} the chief {{engineers}} of the Second and Third field armies, Shazly became aware that IAF, despite heavy losses, had destroyed so many <b>bridge</b> <b>sections</b> that the Egyptians had lost the equivalent of three heavy bridges, leaving four bridges in reserve along with the five already laid in the canal. This gave rise to concerns about supply {{in the coming days}} and weeks. Shazly then discussed the possibility of constructing three bridges in the canal using earth and sand. This would make causeways impregnable against air strikes and artillery. The chief engineer of the Third Army, with whom he discussed the idea, was confidant that, given enough bulldozers, the causeways could be constructed in one week.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles taped {{the main}} track, {{consisting}} of guitars, piano and drums, at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. The session {{took place on}} 2 June 1966, the day after Harrison met Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar {{for the first time}} and secured Shankar's agreement to help him master the sitar. The band recorded five takes of the song before Harrison selected the third of these for further work. After reduction to a single track on the four-track master tape, their performance consisted of Harrison on lead guitar, treated with a Leslie effect, McCartney on piano and Ringo Starr on drums, with Lennon adding tambourine. The group then overdubbed vocals, with McCartney and Lennon singing parallel harmony parts beside Harrison's lead vocal. Further overdubs included maracas, the sound of which Pollack likens to a rattlesnake; additional piano, at the end of the <b>bridge</b> <b>sections</b> and over the E79 chord in the verses; and handclaps.|$|E

According to MSNBC, a 28-foot (9m) storm surge came ashore wiping out 90% of the buildings along the Biloxi-Gulfport coastline. A number of streets and bridges were washed away, including the <b>bridge</b> <b>sections</b> of U.S. Highway 90. In particular, the roadway portion of the U.S. Highway 90 bridge between Bay St. Louis and Pass Christian was completely destroyed by the storm; only the support structure was left.|$|E
40|$|From {{economical}} {{point of}} view, a two-plate-girder <b>bridge</b> <b>section</b> has been examined as a <b>bridge</b> <b>section</b> {{for a long}} span suspension bridge. The two-plate-girder <b>bridge</b> <b>section</b> of H or π section inherently has not good aerodynamic performances, {{as shown by the}} accident of the Tacoma Narrows <b>Bridge</b> with H <b>section</b> type <b>bridge</b> girder. On the contrary, in the present paper, it is tried to find the possibility of the aerodynamic performance improvement of the two-plate-girder <b>bridge</b> <b>section</b> of the π section by changing the intervals between the two plate girders. Referring to wind tunnel test results, in the vortex-excited vibration in heaving vibration mode, the on-set wind velocity and the vibration amplitude decrease with interval between two plate girders, and the flutter on-set wind velocity increases. These results show the possibility of aerodynamic performance improvement of the two-plate-girder <b>bridge</b> <b>section...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{aerodynamic}} {{vibration control}} measures {{are used to}} investigate the suppression mechanism of vortex-induced vibration for box girder <b>bridge</b> <b>section</b> using three-dimensional LES turbulence model. Flow around box girder section with different aerodynamic measures is analyzed and effect of these measures on the aerodynamic characteristics of <b>bridge</b> <b>section</b> is evaluated. Forced vibration is simulated {{in order to examine}} the aeroelastic character-istics of <b>bridge</b> <b>section</b> and attention is focused on frequency response component of unsteady lift forces. The response of <b>bridge</b> <b>section</b> with aerodynamic countermeasures is investigated by conducting free vibration simulation, and predicted amplitude of vibration is compared with ex-perimental results. Flow visualization is employed to examine change in flow conditions around <b>bridge</b> <b>section.</b> Further, a method is proposed, based on identification of critical reduced veloc-ity, to efficiently predict maximum amplitude of vibration...|$|R

25|$|In December 1950, after Chinese PLA troops blew up {{a bridge}} at a narrow {{point on the}} {{evacuation}} route between Koto-ri and Hungnam, blocking the withdrawal of U.N. forces, eight U.S. Air Force C-119 Flying Boxcars flown by the 314th Troop Carrier Group. were used to drop portable <b>bridge</b> <b>sections</b> by parachute. The bridge, consisting of eight separate sixteen-foot long, 2,900-pound sections, was dropped one section at a time, using two parachutes on each section. Four of these sections, together with additional wooden extensions were successfully reassembled into a replacement bridge by Marine Corps combat engineers and the US Army 58th Engineer Treadway Bridge Company, enabling U.N. forces to reach Hungnam.|$|E
25|$|On a {{conventional}} suspension <b>bridge,</b> <b>sections</b> of deck are hung {{in place and}} so immediately tension the suspenders. The proper initial length of each suspender is predetermined by engineering calculations and adjustments are required for segment relative positioning and equality of load distribution amongst the several suspenders of the section. On this bridge, the deck sections were already in a fixed relative position (being joined together and resting upon the falsework) and all suspender cables must be brought to specific tensions individually in order to tension the main cable. A jacking saddle on the western end is used to balance the tension among the sections of the single main cable.|$|E

500|$|When {{discussing}} [...] "His Name Is Legs" [...] with BBC Radio 1 DJ Paul Gambaccini in September 1975, Harrison {{said that}} after recording the basic track, he invited Smith to sing the first two lines {{of each of the}} bridges. Smith did these vocal parts in two takes, and improvised dialogue {{through the rest of the}} song each time. In Clayson's description, Smith sang the <b>bridge</b> <b>sections</b> in English [...] "officer-and-gentleman tones" [...] and adopted an American accent for the monologues.|$|E
500|$|During the two <b>bridge</b> <b>sections,</b> Harrison {{incorporates}} the sacred term [...] "Om" [...] within his extended phrase [...] "Oh... my Lord". Author Joshua Greene describes {{this as an}} example of a theme found in several songs on Material World, whereby Harrison [...] "distilled" [...] spiritual concepts into phrases [...] "so elegant they resembled Vedic sutras: short codes that contain volumes of meaning". The use of the word [...] "Om" [...] was a further comment from Harrison on the universality of faith, after his switching in [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] from [...] "hallelujah" [...] refrains to the Hare Krishna mantra. Referring to the second half of the bridges in [...] "Give Me Love", Inglis views the drawn-out [...] "Please …" [...] as [...] "highly symbolic", given the [...] "unresolved conflict" [...] that appears to be at the heart of the composition.|$|E

500|$|The song is in a {{moderate}} rock tempo and in 4/4 time throughout. The musical key over the verses and two middle eight (or <b>bridge)</b> <b>sections</b> is B major, with frequent use of seventh chords.

[...] "On 'Beautiful Girl'," [...] Leng writes, [...] "the main musical hook comes with the first line of the piece, and all the musical themes head back inexorably to that resolution."
