50|$|When Ba Maw's pro-Japanese {{government}} {{was established in}} 1942, Than Tun served as Minister of Land and Agriculture, and he met and married Khin Gyi, sister of Aung San Suu Kyi's mother Khin Kyi. Aung San married Khin Kyi {{about the same time}} shortly after he became Minister of War; the BIA was renamed the Burma Defence Army (BDA). Than Tun could pass on Japanese intelligence to Thakin Soe who had gone underground in the Delta region in order to organise resistance against the Japanese Occupation. Thakins Thein Pe and Tin Shwe were sent to India to make contact with the British colonial government in exile at Simla. At the end of World War II, after the Japanese had been defeated and the British had returned, Than Tun became general secretary of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) formed by the CPB, the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP, later renamed the Socialist Party) and the BDA, now renamed the Burma National Army (BNA) and led by his brother-in-law Aung <b>San.</b> Than <b>Tun,</b> unlike Aung <b>San,</b> was not among the six men who founded the CPB on August 15, 1939; Aung San was its first secretary general, with Thakin Soe in charge of mass organisation.|$|R
5000|$|Thirty Burmese men, {{also known}} as the Thirty Comrades, were {{recruited}} and secretly left Burma to Hainan Island to become the core of the BIA in 1941. They were trained in espionage, command, combat, guerrilla warfare, and political tactics. The men were chosen to be become the core of the Burmese Independence Army. The decision was governed by availability, and by a desire to appease contending factions with the Thakin party. This became an issue in the future due to the disregard of ethnic minorities. Therefore, the center of the BIA became the Thakins, a young nationalistic, Burmese group that mostly did not include other ethnic minorities. [...] This led to the influence of the Burmese Independence Army being mostly made up of young Burmese men without other ethnic minorities. Aung San, Hla <b>San,</b> Hla Pe, <b>Tun</b> Ok, and Aung Than were trained in high command and administration. These same thirty young people supported and influenced the Japanese invasion. They were moved to the outskirts of Siam and began recruiting other Burmese men to form the BIA.|$|R
2500|$|In 1932 {{he managed}} {{to take over the}} {{publication}} of the Kyipwayay (Progress/Growth) magazine after a false start by the chairman U Thein. He had wanted to be a writer and publisher and grabbed the opportunity. The magazine was a success with most of the day's famous writers on board and with an editorial remit of educating young people in self-improvement, health and moral discipline in the struggle for independence and for building a new united Burma. Regular columns such as Maha Swe's Nei Thu Yein's Fearless Doctrine and Theippan Maung Wa's Letter from Maung Than Gyaung attracted a large readership. The Kyipwayay became the vehicle for a new style and content in Burmese literature known as Hkit san (Testing the Age), a movement started most notably by Theippan Maung Wa, Nwe Soe, Zawgyi, Min Thu Wun,Maung Thuta, Maung Htin and Mya Kaytu. He also wrote articles assuming the pen names Kyipwayay Maung Hla and Maung Kan Kaung. A devout Buddhist and [...] non-violent reformist at heart, he made friends with and his home became a favourite haunt of many politicians such as [...] Aung <b>San,</b> Thakin Than <b>Tun,</b> Thakin Zin and Thakin Ba Koe as well as writers such as Maha Swe, Dagon Taya, Zawana, P Moe Nin, Thukha, Maung Htin and Dr Maung Hpyuu, journalists such as Thuriya U Thein Maung, cartoonists U Ba Galay, U Hein Soon and U Ba Gyan, artist U Ohn Lwin and weightlifters Ka-ya bala U Shein, U Zaw Weik and U Ne Win. The Thuriya (Sun) newspaper was where he had started as a budding writer and where he appeared to have learnt the rudiments of journalism and publishing. U Hla was tall, fair and handsome (Hla incidentally means handsome), and known for his friendly smile, gentle soft-spoken manner, even temper, clean living and generosity.|$|R
