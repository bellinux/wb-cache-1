By the late 1890s, dredging technology (also invented in California) had become economical, and {{it is estimated that}} more than 20million ounces (620t) were recovered <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> (worth approximately US$28billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|When the Illinois and Michigan Canal {{opened in}} 1848, the landmass at Wolf Point was {{decreased}} <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> {{to accommodate a}} turning basin for ships. In the autumn {{of the same year}} the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad opened Chicago's first railroad depot at Wolf Point, on the southwestern corner of Kinzie and Canal Streets. By 1857 the site of Wolf Point Tavern was being used as a lumber yard; the Fulton Elevator, one of Chicago's earliest grain elevators, was built just {{to the north of the}} former tavern in 1852. Several blocks to the west of Wolf Point were destroyed in a large fire on September 15, 1859. The Fulton Elevator survived this, and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, but was burned down on September 7, 1873. It was rebuilt in the same year, and another grain elevator, the St Paul Elevator, was added immediately to the south of the original in 1879. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railway company purchased both elevators in 1889 for $400,000 ($ million today), but demolished them in 1906. Currently, the site is occupied by the Riverbend Condominiums at 333 North Canal Street.|$|E

25|$|With {{this growth}} and {{evolving}} economy, the port and town also experienced expansion. Ironically, while originally serving {{both as a}} local tide-water port and an oceangoing port, as the cash crops pushed out the local consumption crops, thereby {{reducing the number of}} farms, and more slaves caused an increase in acreage and corresponding {{decrease in the number of}} plantations, the shippers required larger boats to carry the produce. Simultaneously, the growth in farmland starting increasing silt downriver into the port. Thus, as the port began silting up it was only maintained <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> which required additional costs on the shippers already competing for capital to build larger boats.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} channel {{to the port}} has two sections—the entrance channel within the protection of outer arm and the outer channel beyond the protection of outer arm. The total length of the entrance channel is 7km. The width of channel gradually increased from 244m to 419m at the bent portion, then maintains a constant width of 305m. The depth of the inner and the outer channels are 18.6m and 19.2m, respectively, below chart datum, with a swell allowances of 3m. The entrance is 350m in Bharathi Dock and 125m in Dr. Ambedkar Dock. The draught in the navigational channel is maintained <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> approximately 1 million cubic metres annually.|$|E
25|$|Another recent {{environmental}} issue in Melbourne was the Victorian government project of channel deepening Melbourne Ports <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> Port Phillip Bay—the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project. It {{was subject to}} controversy and strict regulations among fears that beaches and marine wildlife could {{be affected by the}} disturbance of heavy metals and other industrial sediments. Other major pollution problems in Melbourne include levels of bacteria including E. coli in the Yarra River and its tributaries caused by septic systems, as well as litter. Up to 350,000 cigarette butts enter the storm water runoff every day. Several programs are being implemented to minimise beach and river pollution. In February 2010, The Transition Decade, an initiative to transition human society, economics and environment towards sustainability, was launched in Melbourne.|$|E

40|$|Clam-dredging {{results in}} the {{exposure}} of Spisula solida individuals not caught <b>by</b> the <b>dredge.</b> Subsequent survival depends on clam damage, reburial time, and the time needed by predators to reach the impacted area. We analyse these variables and discuss the importance of predation on exposed S. solida caused <b>by</b> <b>dredge</b> fishing. Sampling was performed in July 2000 off the southern coast of Portugal, at Vilamoura, a traditional S. solida sandy fishing ground. We compared the time needed for S. solida individuals to rebury themselves, relative to the abundance of potential predators. Bivalves collected by divers {{were placed on the}} seabed, and the times required for reburial were measured. These were compared with the times needed for reburial of the clams exposed <b>by</b> <b>dredge</b> impact. At each of three dredge tracks, we analysed the number of predators that entered three equal quadrats (0. 0250 m 2) per minute. These results were compared with a non-affected control area. Impact caused <b>by</b> the fishing <b>dredge</b> significantly increases the number of exposed S. solida clams ðp < 0 : 05 Þ and the abundance of potential predatory species ðp < 0 : 05 Þ. The brittle star Ophiura texturata was the most abundant and first species to reach the dredge track (less than 3 min after dredge impact). Other species reaching the dredge track were Pomatochistus spp. (6 min after impact), Diogenes pugilator, and Nassarius reticulatus (both 9 min after impact). Although predators reached the impacted area while S. solida bivalves were still exposed, our results suggest that predation on the non-buried clams in the dredge track is not a major factor for subsequent indirect mortality of S. solida...|$|R
25|$|In the 1800s {{the island}} became {{the site of}} the Boston and Albany Railroad's (B) {{passenger}} depot, shops, freight houses, round house, and coach yard. The island was the site of transfers between trains of the New York Central and the B The island became known as the Boston and Albany Island, or just Boston Island. A ferry transported people to and from the island and downtown Albany at Maiden Lane. The railroad changed the shoreline of the island by building docks for receiving coal and grain and <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> an east-west channel splitting the island in half. In 1871 the Maiden Lane Bridge was built replacing the ferry. When the NY Central and the B merged in 1900 the island's activities became less important, though a new round house and coach yard was built even as many buildings were demolished. In 1903 the channel that separated the island from the mainland was filled in with sand dredged {{from the bottom of the}} Hudson River. Also in 1903 the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad purchased outright the island from the van Rensselaer family for $6,000.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Upper Avon Navigation between Stratford and Evesham {{was owned}} by {{relatives}} of Lord Windsor, {{who had died in}} 1758, and its condition gradually deteriorated. Because of the sinuous course of the upper river, it was never really considered as a through navigation, except for a brief period when William James thought it could become a through route. He bought all of the shares in the Upper Avon company in 1813, and persuaded the Stratford Canal shareholders {{that there should be a}} junction between their canal and the river at Stratford, which was opened on 24 June 1816. In 1822, he spent £6,000 repairing the locks on the upper river, and became bankrupt. The navigation was taken over by seven men, all connected with the Stratford Canal, who turned Lucy's lock at Stratford into a two-rise staircase lock, constructed three new locks, and improved the river <b>by</b> <b>dredging.</b> Most of the subsequent traffic was local, competing with the Lower Avon for the delivery of coal to Evesham. The Upper Avon was leased to the Stratford Canal from 1842, but there was little traffic, and the lease was not renewed in 1847. The arrival of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway at Stratford sealed its fate, and when the company failed to sell the navigation to local landowners for £150, they effectively abandoned it in 1857. John Broughton, who was the railway manager at Stratford, was persuaded to buy the navigation for £300 by local traders, but the venture was short-lived. Broughton was succeeded, and the railway, now called the West Midland Railway, became part of the Great Western Railway. In 1875, the GWR decided it would no longer maintain the river, and an appeal to the Railway Commissioners in 1877 ruled that they were not obliged to do so.|$|E
