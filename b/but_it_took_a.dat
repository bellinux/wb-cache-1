The Confederates had fought six brigades against 13 (somewhat smaller) Federal brigades, and of the 20,444 men engaged, about 30% were casualties. Some of the wounded managed to crawl to Plum Run but could not cross it. The river ran red with their blood. As with the Cornfield at Antietam, this small expanse of agricultural ground would be remembered by veterans as a name of unique significance in the history of warfare.|$|E

25|$|On 2 September, three Lockheed C-130 Hercules {{aircraft}} set {{off from}} Jakarta for Peninsula Malaysia, flying low to avoid detection by radar. The following night, {{two of the}} C-130 managed to reach their objective with their onboard PGT paratroopers, who jumped off and landed around Labis in Johore (about 100 miles north of Singapore). The remaining C-130 crashed into the Malacca Straits while trying to evade interception by an RAF Javelin FAW 9 launched from RAF Tengah. Due to a lightning storm, the drop of 96 paratroopers was widely dispersed. This resulted in them landing close to 1/10 Gurkhas, who were joined by 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (1 RNZIR) stationed near Malacca with 28 (Commonwealth) Brigade.

[...] Two years later the club, which had changed its name to Gillingham F.C. in 1913, secured a bank loan of £1,570 which was used to build a new grandstand, but just a month after it was completed the stand was severely damaged by high winds, which ripped off the roof and twisted most of the ironwork.

500|$|Wilhelm [...] "Deathshead" [...] Strasse, the game's main antagonist, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as an antagonist of Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001) and main antagonist of Wolfenstein (2009). For The New Order, the team achieved closure on his story; {{to do so in}} an effective way, they wanted to find an interesting angle to portray him: his personality is full of enthusiasm, and he appreciates life after his near-death experience in the previous game. When developing the Nazis, Matthies states that the team [...] "didn't want to cartoon-ify them", instead opting to treat them seriously. Gideon Emery, who portrayed Fergus Reid, auditioned {{for his role in the}} game. He described Fergus as [...] "a tough as nails soldier, who gives [...] both support and a pretty hard time in the process". Matthies felt that Fergus is a type of father figure to Blazkowicz, and that he [...] "only gives negative reinforcement". Conversely, he saw Wyatt as a [...] "sort of son surrogate", as Blazkowicz is tasked as being his protector and mentor, and that he gives [...] "positive reinforcement". Max Hass, a seemingly brain-damaged member of the Resistance, was inspired by the character of Garp from John Irving's novel The World According to Garp. Alex Solowitz portrayed Max in the game. [...] "Max was the most challenging character to cast, which seems counter-intuitive because he's a pretty simple guy on paper, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> tremendous actor to pull that off and a long time to find him," [...] Matthies said.|$|E

Her son-in-law, Bob Kleberg, Sr., said [...] "A {{valuation}} of four to five dollars an acre ($1236/km²) on a million acres (4000km²) of raw ranchland was about right, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> long time for the Government to admit it." [...] By 1929, the taxes ($859,000) had been paid up, in installments, but the trustees had to borrow money, so by the market crash of 1929, Henrietta King's estate was in debt $3,000,000.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Roberts pursued Piet Cronje's 7,000-strong force, {{which had}} {{abandoned}} Magersfontein {{to head for}} Bloemfontein. General French's cavalry was ordered {{to assist in the}} pursuit by embarking on an epic [...] drive towards Paardeberg where Cronje was attempting to cross the Modder River. At the Battle of Paardeberg from 18 to 27 February, Roberts then surrounded General Piet Cronje's retreating Boer army. On 17 February, a pincer movement involving both French's cavalry and the main British force attempted to take the entrenched position, but the frontal attacks were uncoordinated and so were easily repulsed by the Boers. Finally, Roberts resorted to bombarding Cronje into submission, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> further ten precious days and with the British troops using the polluted Modder River as water supply, resulted in a typhoid epidemic killing many troops. General Cronje was forced to surrender at Surrender Hill with 4000 men.|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court's {{due process}} {{jurisprudence}} {{over the next}} three decades was inconsistent, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> narrow view of states' police powers in several major labor cases after Lochner. For example, in Coppage v. Kansas (1915), the Court struck down statutes forbidding [...] "yellow-dog contracts." [...] Similarly, in Adkins v. Children's Hospital (1923), the Supreme Court held that minimum wage laws violated the due process clause, but Chief Justice William Howard Taft strongly dissented, suggesting that the Court instead should have overruled Lochner. The doctrine of substantive due process was coupled with a narrow interpretation of congressional power under the commerce clause. Justices James McReynolds, George Sutherland, Willis Van Devanter, and Pierce Butler emerged during the 1920s and 1930s as the foremost defenders of traditional limitations on government power on the Supreme Court, so were collectively dubbed by partisans of the New Deal the [...] "Four Horsemen of Reaction".

Deluxe gave them a budget of $10,000 to record the album, so to keep within the budget they had to record from midnight to dawn, usually after doing one or more performances earlier that night. The album was released in October 1980. It featured [...] "Just Keep Walking" [...] which was their first Australian Top 40 single, with the album peaking in the Top 30 of the Kent Music Report for Australian albums.

It was also revealed the actor voicing Montana, André Sogliuzzo, had been hand-picked by Al Pacino. In July, it was revealed Pacino had turned down the opportunity to lend his likeness to Electronic Arts' Godfather adaptation so he could appear instead in Scarface. It was also explained the reason Pacino himself was not voicing Montana was because he simply didn't sound like Montana anymore. According to Vivendi's Adam Roberts; [...] "He just can't physically do it any more.

Then at a random urine screening, the lab technician told him he tested positive for methamphetamine. McCullough insisted that he was clean and asked to take another test, which he passed. A third test was administered, which he also passed, so McCullough was relieved. At his next court appearance, Judge Williams asked why he failed a drug test. He was surprised, and stated that he passed the second test. The judge told him she was going to use the first test; the second one didn't count. No matter how much he professed his innocence, the judge didn't believe him. The judge refused to bring in the lab technician to testify, but asked McCullough if he would take a polygraph, which he agreed, then she changed her mind and sentenced him to three days in jail for a [...] "bad" [...] test and 14 days for questioning the results of the drug screening.
