5|$|Once granted, {{a coat of}} arms {{becomes the}} {{hereditary}} and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants. However, this can only be so if the inheritor is a legitimate male-line descendent of the person originally granted with the arms. To establish the right to arms by descent, one must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that an ancestor had his arms recorded in the registers of the College. If {{there is a possibility}} of such an inheritance, one must first make contact with an officer-in-waiting at the College, who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search. The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry, which will involve the examination of genealogical records. The first step involve a search of the family name in the College's archives, as coats of arms and family name has no connection, the officer could prove, through this method, that there is in fact no descent. However, if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of the College's archives would then be undertaken to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual.|$|E
25|$|Mirroring the {{historical}} political {{conflicts between the}} freethought and Catholic segments of the population, the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a subsidised religious—mostly Catholic—branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their own teaching and examination methods, but in exchange, they must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that—at least for the Catholic schools—the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do the schools {{have a lot of}} power on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation VSKO. The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't only mean that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. Steiner, Montessori, or Freinet) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.|$|E

500|$|General Secretary Yuri Andropov, on {{the advice}} of Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, but against the advice of the Foreign Ministry, {{initially}} decided not to make any admission of downing the airliner, on the premise that no one would find out or <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> otherwise. Consequently the TASS news agency reported twelve hours after the shootdown only that an unidentified aircraft, flying without lights, had been intercepted by Soviet fighters after it violated Soviet airspace over Sakhalin. The aircraft had allegedly failed to respond to warnings and [...] "continued its flight toward the East Sea". Some commentators believe that the inept manner in which the political events were handled by the Soviet government was affected by the failing health of Andropov, who was permanently hospitalised in late September or early October 1983 (Andropov died the following February).|$|E

2500|$|The issue whether ZFC is {{consistent}} with the existence of an inaccessible cardinal is more subtle. The proof sketched in the previous paragraph that the consistency of ZFC implies the consistency of ZFC + [...] "there is not an inaccessible cardinal" [...] can be formalized in ZFC. However, assuming that ZFC {{is consistent}}, no proof that the consistency of ZFC implies the consistency of ZFC + [...] "there is an inaccessible cardinal" [...] can be formalized in ZFC. This follows from Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, which shows that if ZFC + [...] "there is an inaccessible cardinal" [...] is consistent, then it cannot prove its own consistency. Because ZFC + [...] "there is an inaccessible cardinal" [...] does prove the consistency of ZFC, if ZFC proved that its own consistency implies the consistency of ZFC + [...] "there is an inaccessible cardinal" [...] then this latter theory would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> its own consistency, which is impossible if it is consistent.|$|E
