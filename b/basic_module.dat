2500|$|The online {{public access}} catalog (OPAC) is a <b>basic</b> <b>module,</b> {{part of the}} library’s {{integrated}} library system. Earlier, the OPAC has been limited to searching physical texts, and sometimes digital copies but has only limited special features. Caplan argues {{that they are in}} process of replacement by newer [...] "discovery tools" [...] allowing more customization. Yang and Hofmann suggest that vendors see money in building either separate discovery tools or Next-Generation OPACs to be purchased as an add-on feature. A problem with vocabulary arises here. Yang and Wagner (2010, in Yang and Hofmann, 2011) refer to discovery tools by many names, including [...] "stand-alone OPAC, discovery layer, and next-generation catalog [...] " [...] This contrasts Bair, Boston, and Garrison, who differentiate between next-generation catalogues and web-scale discovery services. [...] Despite any confusion, {{it is clear that the}} OPAC as it currently stands is outdated, and will be replaced by more modern, user-friendly tools.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) wafer stacked {{implementation}} (WSI) {{has been}} proposed as a promising technology for massively parallel computers. A hierarchical 3 D-torus (H 3 DT) network, which is a 3 D-torus network of multiple <b>basic</b> <b>modules</b> in which the <b>basic</b> <b>modules</b> are 3 D-mesh networks, {{has been proposed}} for efficient 3 D-WSI. However, the restricted use of physical links between <b>basic</b> <b>modules</b> in the higher level networks reduces the dynamic communication performance of this network. A torus network has better dynamic communication performance than a mesh network. Therefore, we have modified the H 3 DT network by replacing the 3 D-mesh modules by 3 D-tori, calling it a Modified H 3 DT (MH 3 DT) network. This paper addresses the architectural details of the MH 3 DT network and explores aspects such as degree, diameter, cost, average distance, arc connectivity, bisection width, and wiring complexity. We also present a deadlock-free routing algorithm for the MH 3 DT network using two virtual channels and evaluate the network's dynamic communication performance under the uniform traffic pattern, using the proposed routing algorithm. It is shown that the MH 3 DT network possesses several attractive features including small diameter, small cost, small average distance, better bisection width, and better dynamic communication performance...|$|R
