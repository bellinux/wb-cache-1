60|$|With a long {{sweep of}} the paddle she ran the canoe {{alongside}} a stone beneath a great tree which spread its long branches over the creek and shaded the pool. It was a grand old tree and must have guarded that sylvan spot for centuries. The gnarled and knotted trunk was scarred and seamed with the ravages of time. The upper part was dead. Long limbs extended skyward, gaunt and bare, like the masts of a storm beaten vessel. The lower branches were white and shining, relieved here and there by brown patches of bark which curled up like old parchment as they shelled away from the inner bark. The ground beneath the tree was carpeted with a velvety moss with little plots of grass and clusters of maiden-hair fern growing on it. From under an overhanging rock on the <b>bank</b> a spring <b>of</b> <b>crystal</b> water bubbled forth.|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} powder X-ray diffraction beam lines {{operate at}} many synchrotron radiation sources, exploiting {{the very high}} intensity, vertical collimation and wavelength tunability of the beam. At ESRF in Grenoble, a powder diffraction beam line has operated since May 1996. Originally built on the BM 16 bending magnet source [1], the diffractometer was transferred six years ago to a new location at ID 31, where it is powered by three 11 -mm minimum gap undulators, to give very intense beams in the operational range of 6 keV – 60 keV (wavelength ≈ 2 Å – 0. 2 Å). The diffractometer, shown in Figure 1, {{is equipped with a}} <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> post-sample analyser <b>crystals,</b> Figure 2, to give very high angular resolution as well as accuracy. An analyser crystal, rather than inferring the 2 θ angle of diffraction from the position of a slit or pixel on a PSD, defines a true angle of diffraction, and thereby removes a number of systematic aberrations in the peak positions that affect standard configurations...|$|R
