50|$|The Upper Danube {{ecoregion}} {{alone has}} about 60 fish species and the Lower Danube-Dniester ecoregion has {{about twice as}} many. Among these are an exceptionally high diversity of sturgeon, {{a total of six}} species (beluga, Russian sturgeon, <b>bastard</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> sterlet, starry sturgeon and European sea sturgeon), but these are all threatened and have largely-or entirely {{in the case of the}} European sea sturgeon-disappeared from the river. The huchen, one of the largest species of salmon, is endemic to the Danube basin, but has been introduced elsewhere by humans.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bastard</b> <b>{{sturgeon}},</b> fringebarbel sturgeon, ship sturgeon, spiny sturgeon, or {{thorn sturgeon}} (Acipenser nudiventris) is {{a species of}} fish in the Acipenseridae family. Formerly abundant in the Black, Aral and Caspian seas, its range is now primarily limited to the Ural River (in Russia and Kazakhstan), with a possible relict populations in the Rioni River in Georgia and the Safid Rud in Iran. The healthiest population is one in Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan, well outside its natural range, where they were introduced in the 1960s for commercial purposes. It {{has been reported that}} this fish has the highest relative fecundity for any sturgeon species.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to 20 species of {{amphibians}} and reptiles and a numerous invertebrates, including over 60 species of butterflies. Gornje Podunavlje is a habitat of numerous fish species which find ideal spawning conditions in the oxbows and shallow shoals of the emanated river, including the critically endangered species of <b>bastard</b> <b>sturgeon.</b> The area {{is home to}} some important species such as white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) or black stork (Ciconia nigra), but also to ferruginous duck and Eurasian spoonbill. A total of 248 species of birds live in the reserve, or 71% of all bird species in Serbia (349). Also, it is populated by the rare and endangered mammals like European otter (Lutra lutra) and wild cat (Felis silvestris). Other mammals include European badger and red deer. Half of the species of fish (50 out of 98) and mammals (50 out of 95 or 101, depending on the source) registered in Serbia, {{can be found in}} the reserve. Although suffers a certain pressure from numerous human activities, this area still remains an unspoiled natural environment for the many species which inhabit it.|$|E
