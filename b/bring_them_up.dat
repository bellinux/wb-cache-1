5|$|During the Second World War, the {{division}} comprised the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade, both consisting of parachute infantry, and the 6th Airlanding Brigade, composed of glider infantry. However the 5th Parachute Brigade {{had been sent}} to] India ahead {{of the rest of}} {{the division}}. So when the division was dispatched to the Middle East, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was assigned to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> to strength. In May 1946, after the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded, the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division, replacing the 6thAirlanding Brigade. In August1946, the 5thParachute Brigade returned from the Far East, and joined the division, but was disbanded soon afterwards. The next major manpower development came in 1947, when the 3rdParachute Brigade was disbanded and the 2ndParachute Brigade, while remaining part of the division, was withdrawn to England, then sent to Germany.|$|E
5|$|In March 1993, {{under the}} September 1990 Tripartite MoU between the U.S., Italy, and Spain, eight EAV-8B Plus Matadors were ordered, {{along with a}} twin-seat TAV-8B. Deliveries of the Plus-standard {{aircraft}} started in 1996. On 11 May 2000, Boeing and the NAVAIR finalized a contract to remanufacture Spanish EAV-8Bs to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> to Plus standard. Boeing said the deal required it to remanufacture two EAV-8Bs, with an option for another seven aircraft; other sources say the total was 11 aircraft. The remanufacture allowed the aircraft to carry four AIM-120 AMRAAMs, enhanced the pilot's situational awareness through the installation of new radar and avionics, and provided a new engine. Eventually, five aircraft were modified, the last having been delivered on 5 December 2003.|$|E
5|$|By 4 August, a {{perimeter}} {{was established}} around Pusan {{on the hills}} {{to the north of}} the city and the Naktong River to the west. The Eighth Army, including the 24th Infantry Division, was cornered by the surrounding North Korean army. With UN forces concentrated and North Korean supply lines stretched out, the 24th Infantry Division halted the advance of the North Koreans. The 24th Division was at Naktong, with the 25th Infantry Division to the south, and the 1st Cavalry Division and South Korean forces to the north. The 24th Division was also reinforced by the 2nd Infantry Division, newly arrived in the theater. The 24th was quickly sent to block the North Korean 6th Infantry Division, which attempted to attack the UN forces from the southwest. On 8 August, the North Korean 4th Infantry Division crossed the river and attempted to penetrate the perimeter. After 10 days of fighting, the 24th Infantry Division counterattacked and forced the North Koreans back across the river. By late August 1950, only 184 of the 34th Regiment's original 1,898 men remained. The regiment was dissolved and was replaced within the 24th by the 5th Regimental Combat Team. The 34th Regiment's survivors were added to the ranks of the 19th and 21st regiments in an effort to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> to strength, and the 5th Infantry remained with the 24th Division until the division withdrew from Korea. Elements of the 24th Infantry Division were moved into reserve on 23 August and replaced by the 2nd Infantry Division. A second, larger North Korean attack occurred between 31 August and 19 September, but the 2nd, 24th, and 25th infantry divisions and the 1st Cavalry Division beat the North Koreans back across the river again.|$|E

The road segment from exit 101 (US 50/SH 47) to exit 94 (SH 45/Pueblo Boulevard) is currently the oldest section of I-25 in the state, and has not been upgraded since the 1950s, minus minor alterations and paving. The controversy surrounds the straightening of the highway through the city and the possible removal of several businesses around the downtown area and the historic district.|$|E
25|$|Suffering badly from malaria {{and other}} {{tropical}} diseases, {{the men were}} mainly used to provide work parties instead of undertaking the training that they would require for the fighting that would come. In June, the 53rd was attached to Maroubra Force and the following month it was split up, with two companies—'B' and 'C'—being sent to the area around Kokoda to reinforce the 39th Battalion, while {{the remainder of the}} battalion remained around Port Moresby in preparation to move up the Kokoda Track. That month the battalion received eight officer reinforcements from experienced 2nd AIF units. On 10 August, the 53rd Battalion was ordered to relieve the 39th, which was at the time positioned around Uberi. The two detached companies moved into position and upon their arrival they finally received a number of Bren guns and had a small amount of training with them, but it was not enough to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> to the standard required for combat against the battle-hardened Japanese soldiers that they were about to come up against.|$|E

He was—and he was not. I first learned charity and forgiveness from him; and in the light of it pierced even the 'liberal' darkness out of which I came, knowing more [...] about 'Bloody Mary' than the Mother of Jesus—who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the Romanists." ...|$|E

[...] This uncompromising declaration was modified in a later interview in which he said, [...] "the plays are all being restaged ... Gilbert's words will be unaltered, though {{there will be some}} freshness in the method of rendering them. [...] Artists must have scope for their individuality, and new singers cannot be tied down to imitate slavishly those who made successes in the old days." ...|$|E
500|$|The other 149 AMX-30Es were reconstructed {{to improve}} their mobility. [...] The {{reconstruction}} consisted of {{the replacement of the}} original French transmission with the American Allison CD-850-6A. [...] Furthermore, several parts of the tank, such as the brakes, were renovated in order to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> to their original standards. [...] The CD-850-6A was an automatic transmission, with a triple differential providing two forward velocities and one reverse velocity. [...] However, the new transmission resulted in a new problem. [...] The excessive heat produced by the transmission reduced the vehicle's range. [...] The reconstruction of the 149 AMX-30Es began in 1988, and these were designated AMX-30EM1s. [...] In the early 1990s Spain received a large number of M60 Patton tanks, replacing its fleet of M47s and M48s, as well as its AMX-30EM1s.|$|E
500|$|Three new BT49D chassis {{were built}} for the 1982 season, {{featuring}} a still lighter chassis and one-piece bodywork. By this stage, the cars had to be ballasted to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> to the minimum weight limit of [...] specified in the rules. The BT49D used the carbon-carbon brakes as standard {{and was one of}} several DFV-powered cars to be fitted with large water tanks, ostensibly for [...] "water-cooled brakes". In practice, the water was dumped early in the race, allowing the cars to race as much as [...] under the weight limit; the regulations stated coolant could be topped {{up at the end of}} the race before the weight was checked. In the view of the DFV teams, this practice met the letter of the regulations and equalised their performance with that of the more powerful turbocharged cars. The 60mm ground clearance rule was removed for the 1982 season, but the fixed skirts and very stiff suspension remained.|$|E
