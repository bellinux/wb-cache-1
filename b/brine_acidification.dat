40|$|Of all the {{strategies}} to reduce carbon emissions, carbon dioxide (CO₂) geological sequestration is an immediately available option for removing {{large amounts of}} the gas from the atmosphere. However, {{our understanding of the}} transition behavior between Forchheimer and Darcy flow through porous media during CO₂ injection is currently very limited. In addition, the kinetic mass transfer of SO₂ and CO₂ from CO₂ stream to the saline and the fully coupling between the changes of porosity and permeability and multiphase flow are two significant dimensions to investigate the <b>brine</b> <b>acidification</b> and the induced porosity and permeability changes due to SO₂ co-injection with CO₂. Therefore, this dissertation develops a multiphase flow, contaminant transport and geochemical model which includes the kinetic mass transfer of SO₂ into deep saline aquifers and obtains the critical Forchheimer number for both water and CO₂ by using the experimental data in the literature. The critical Forchheimer numbers and the multiphase flow model are first applied to analyze the application problem involving the injection of CO₂ into deep saline aquifers. The results show that the Forchheimer effect would result in higher displacement efficiency with a magnitude of more than 50 % in the Forchheimer regime than that for Darcy flow, which could increase the storage capacity for the same injection rate and volume of a site. Another merit for the incorporation of Forchheimer effect is that more CO₂ would be accumulated in {{the lower half of the}} domain and lower pressure would be imposed on the lower boundary of the cap-rock. However, as a price for the advantages mentioned above, the injection pressure required in Forchheimer flow would be higher than that for Darcy flow. The fluid flow and contaminant transport and geochemical model is then applied to analyze the <b>brine</b> <b>acidification</b> and induced porosity and permeability changes due to SO₂ co-injection. The results show that the co-injection of SO₂ with CO₂ would lead to a substantially acid zone near the injecting well and it is important to include the kinetic dissolution of SO₂ from the CO₂ stream to the water phase into the simulation models, otherwise considerable errors would be introduced for the equilibrium assumption. This study provides a useful tool for future analysis and comprehension of multiphase Darcy-Forchheimer flow and <b>brine</b> <b>acidification</b> of CO₂ injection into deep saline aquifers. Results from this dissertation have practical use for scientists and engineers concerned with the description of flow behavior, and transport and fate of SO₂ during SO₂ co-injection with CO₂ in deep saline aquifers.

40|$|Reservoir {{injectivity}} {{and storage}} capacity {{are the main}} constraints for geologic CO 2 sequestration, subject to safety and economic considerations. <b>Brine</b> <b>acidification</b> following CO 2 dissolution leads to fluid-rock interactions that alter porosity and permeability, thereby affecting reservoir storage capacity and injectivity. Thus, we determined how efficiently CO 2 -enriched brines could dissolve calcite in sandstone cores and how this affects the petrophysical properties. During computerized tomography monitored flow-through reactor experiments, calcite dissolved at a rate largely determined by the rate of acid supply, even at high flow velocities which would be typical near an injection well. The porosity increase {{was accompanied by a}} significant increase in rock permeability, larger than that predicted using classical porosity-permeability models. This chemically driven petrophysical change might be optimized using injection parameters to maximize injectivity and storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to improve our ability to predict CO 2 -SO 2 geologic storage. SO 2 is an impurity of industrial CO 2 gas streams which is expected to intensify <b>brine</b> <b>acidification</b> resulting in enhanced mineral reaction. Short-term H 2 SO 4 -brine-rock experiments were combined with reaction path modelling to identify reactions and evaluate the pH and temperature dependency of reaction rates. In addition, available reactive surface area was investigated to enhance our ability to upscale to reservoir scale. Kinetically controlled reaction path models that included CO 2, SO 2 and O 2 were generated and then run at reservoir conditions for 100 y. The models predicted a rapid buffering of the SO 2 induced acidification. Compared to pure CO 2 storage the CO 2 -SO 2 -O 2 reservoir models resulted in enhanced carbonate reaction extents and a greater porosity increase, which have significant ramifications for the safety of the seal and the storage capacity of the storage formation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLaboratory {{experiments}} {{showed that}} low viscosity scCO 2 {{displacement of the}} brine into Mt Simon Sandstone and Eau Clair formation cores (FutureGen 2. 0 Geologic Sequestration site, Jacksonville, Illinois, USA) was slow by advection, as scCO 2 travels predominantly in larger pores, leaving significant brine in smaller pores. As the scCO 2 displaces the brine in larger pores and carbonate partitions into the <b>brine,</b> the resulting <b>acidification</b> (pH 3 to 4) causes short-term mineral dissolution, ion desorption, and iron oxide particulate movement. Major aqueous biogeochemical changes observed over 1. 2 years from core/brine/scCO 2 interactions includes: a) significant increase in Mg 2 +, K+, and SO 4 concentrations (10 s to 100 s of mmol/L), b) dissolution of the hematite coating on the quartz grains, c) significant precipitation of NaCl and KCl, and d) some anaerobic microbial growth. Electron microprobe analysis showed the formation of some NaCl and KCl, but precipitates were too small a volume to significantly change permeability. Anaerobic microbial growth correlated with scCO 2 (23. 5 x in 1300 h), was also too small to influence permeability. Iron oxide particulate movement was observed {{as a result of}} scCO 2 injection (acidification), but results could not conclusively correlate with formation permeability change. The electrical resistivity change of the rock core from 100 % brine to 100 % scCO 2 was in the expected range (3 x to 5 x), with most of the change observed between 70 % to 100 % scCO 2. Field scale conditions simulated using these laboratory-measured electrical resistivity changes indicated insufficient resolution was likely at the field site using surface electrodes due to the depth of injection (1200 m). Overall, injection of scCO 2 into the brine-filled Mt Simon sandstone cores resulted in small geochemical and microbial changes over the short-term (< 1. 5 years) with some iron oxide particulate movement...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of pH (pH 5, 6, 7 and 8) on the {{hatching}} percentage, survival and reproduction of Artemia strains in Bohai Bay salt ponds. Strains included parthenogenetic Artemia from Bohai Bay (BHB), Artemia franciscana from San Francisco Bay, and A. franciscana artificially produced in salt ponds in Vietnam. The latter was included as a potential inoculum for biological management of salt ponds. The hatching percentage of cysts after 24 h and the survival rate of the tested Artemia strains were significantly reduced when exposed to a culture medium at pH 5 for 18 d (P < 0. 05). The tolerance of Artemia to 48 h acid exposure varied with developmental stage, increasing in the following order: juvenile, nauplii, pre-adult, with maximum tolerance in adults. All strains of Artemia tested could not reproduce at pH 5. At pH levels from pH 6 - 8, a higher pH generally resulted in a shorter brood interval and enhanced ovoviviparity. Hence, we suggest that <b>brine</b> <b>acidification</b> has {{a negative impact on}} Artemia populations in the Bohai Bay saltworks. Inoculation of Artemia with either local parthenogenetic Artemia or exotic A. franciscana should be feasible at pH 7 - 8...|$|E
40|$|Reservoir and cap-rock core samples with {{variable}} lithology 2 ̆ 7 s {{representative of}} siliciclastic reservoirs used for CO storage have been characterized and reacted at reservoir conditions with an impure CO stream and low salinity brine. Cores from a target CO storage site in Queensland, Australia were tested. Mineralogical {{controls on the}} resulting changes to porosity and water chemistry have been identified. The tested siliciclastic reservoir core samples can be grouped generally into three responses to impure CO-brine reaction, dependent on mineralogy. The mineralogically clean quartzose reservoir cores had high porosities, with negligible change after reaction, in resolvable porosity or mineralogy, calculated using X-ray micro computed tomography and QEMSCAN. However, strong <b>brine</b> <b>acidification</b> and {{a high concentration of}} dissolved sulphate were generated in experiments owing to minimal mineral buffering. Also, the movement of kaolin has the potential to block pore throats and reduce permeability. The reaction of the impure CO-brine with calcite-cemented cap-rock core samples caused the largest porosity changes after reaction through calcite dissolution; to the extent that one sample developed a connection of open pores that extended into the core sub-plug. This has the potential to both favor injectivity but also affect CO migration. The dissolution of calcite caused the buffering of acidity resulting in no significant observable silicate dissolution. Clay-rich cap-rock core samples with minor amounts of carbonate minerals had only small changes after reaction. Created porosity appeared mainly disconnected. Changes were instead associated with decreases in density from Fe-leaching of chlorite or dissolution of minor amounts of carbonates and plagioclase. The interbedded sandstone and shale core also developed increased porosity parallel to bedding through dissolution of carbonates and reactive silicates in the sandy layers. Tight interbedded cap-rocks could be expected to act as baffles to fluids preventing vertical fluid migration. Concentrations of dissolved elements including Ca, Fe, Mn, and Ni increased during reactions of several core samples, with Mn, Mg, Co, and Zn correlated with Ca from cap-rock cores. Precipitation of gypsum, Fe-oxides and clays on seal core samples sequestered dissolved elements including Fe through co-precipitation or adsorption. A conceptual model of impure CO-water-rock interactions for a siliciclastic reservoir is discussed...|$|E
