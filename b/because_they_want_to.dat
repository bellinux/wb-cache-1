Instead of {{forcing her to}} give them up to ShadowClan, she instead helps Sasha by giving her some prey, and warns her to leave as soon as possible.

5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
25|$|Rastafari {{is not a}} {{homogeneous}} movement and has no single administrative structure, nor any single leader. Centralised and hierarchical structures are avoided by Rastas <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> avoid replicating the formal structures of Babylon. Rastas also tend to avoid hierarchic and bureaucratic structures because of the ultra-individualistic ethos that the religion promotes with its ideas about inner divinity.|$|E

25|$|Increased {{participation}} {{of women in}} the workforce is associated with decreased fertility. A cross-country panel study found this fertility factor effect to be strongest among women aged 20–39, but with a less strong but persistent effect among older women as well. International United Nations data suggests that women who work because of economic necessity have higher fertility than those who work <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|E
25|$|In {{the study}} of certain social forms of initiation, such as hazing in college fraternities and sororities, {{laboratory}} experiments in psychology suggest that severe initiations produce cognitive dissonance. Dissonance is then thought to produce feelings of strong group attraction among initiates after the experience, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> justify the effort used. Rewards during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity. As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce conformity among new members. Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of affiliation.|$|E

Anybody who is not proud of his race {{is not a man}} at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian {{community}} as racist <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.|$|E

25|$|Producers {{organize}} and strive for Fair Trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or simply <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be paid {{more for their}} labor efforts and products. Farmers {{are more likely to}} identify with organic farming than Fair Trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods. Fair Trade farmers {{are also more likely to}} attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.|$|E
500|$|Lawson {{has become}} renowned for her flirtatious manner of presenting, {{although}} she argues [...] "It's {{not meant to}} be flirtatious. ... I don't have the talent to adopt a different persona. It's intimate, not flirtatious". The perceived overt sexuality of her presentation style has led to Lawson being called the [...] "queen of food porn". Many commentators have alluded to Lawson's attractiveness, and she was once named as one of the world's most beautiful women. She has been referred to as [...] "stunningly beautiful, warm, honest, likeable and amazingly normal", as well as being described as having [...] "flawless skin, perfect white teeth, a voluptuous body, ample height and lots of lush, brown hair". Nigella Lawson has been voted, Sexiest Celebrity Chef. [...] The media have also noted Lawson's ability to engage with both male and female viewers; The Guardian wrote, [...] "Men love her <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be with her. Women love her <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be her". [...] The chef Gary Rhodes said that viewers were attracted to her smile rather than her cooking. Despite often being labelled as a domestic goddess, she insists that she exhibits very few of the qualities associated with the title.|$|E
500|$|First Aristotle, then Cicero and Laertius each {{alluded to}} a {{connection}} between the conatus and other emotions. In their view, the former induces the latter. They maintained that humans do not wish to do something because they think it [...] "good", but rather they think it [...] "good" [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it. In other words, the cause of human desire is the natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with the principles of the conatus.|$|E

The Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Episcopal Church in the Philippines {{did not join}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go to {{all parts of the}} archipelago.

[...] "Religious freedom resulted from an alliance of unlikely partners," [...] writes the historian Frank Lambert in his book The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America. [...] "New Light evangelicals such as Isaac Bachus and John Leland joined forces with Deists and skeptics such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson to fight for a complete {{separation of church and}} state." ...|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} in 1995 Lawrence Gordon Clark stated that the stories [...] "focus on suggestion. The aim, they say, is to chill rather than shock. Partly because television is not best suited to carrying off big-screen pyrotechnics, but mainly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> keep faith {{with the notion of}} a ghost story in its literary rather than cinematic tradition." [...] Helen Wheatley notes that the best adaptations maintain the stories' [...] "sense of decorum and restraint, ... withholding the full revelation of the supernatural until the very last moment, and centring on the suggestion of a ghostly presence rather than the horror of visceral excess and abjection." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord Royal Highness is not enraged at SpongeBob and Patrick for popping the bubble, {{telling him}} that the one they popped was just a prop for the tourists. He then shows them the real oldest living bubble, which Patrick then takes a picture of, causing it to pop. Angered, Lord Royal Highness summons the Atlantean Royal Guards to attack, but the gang manage to escape. Just when they escape outside, Plankton comes in and tries to destroy them with the tank he found, but much to his dismay, it showers the group with ice cream. Lord Royal Highness captures Plankton, and says that [...] "a talking speck" [...] would be a fantastic {{replacement}} for the bubble. SpongeBob and friends go home, but Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are all sad <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> stay in Atlantis, even though SpongeBob does not.|$|E
500|$|Dixon {{took part}} in series 5 of [...] TV show Strictly Come Dancing in 2007, partnered with {{professional}} dancer Matthew Cutler. Dixon was at first hesitant to join, fearing that snobbery within the music industry would damage her career. In a later interview, she said, [...] "there's always this preconceived idea that people do reality TV shows <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> kick-start their careers whereas I was actually worried that it would affect it." [...] They had been the favourite from the third week, receiving the most points from the judges on numerous occasions. Dixon herself gained high appraisal from the judges, even being likened to a [...] "young Josephine Baker" [...] by Bruno Tonioli. They received 4.5 million votes in the final, beating actor Matt Di Angelo and professional dancer Flavia Cacace to win the glitter disco ball. Dixon is currently the most successful contestant to ever take part in Strictly Come Dancing, with an average point score of 36.5/40, the highest average score from any contestant to ever {{take part in the}} show.|$|E

According to Thiessen, the Hub and its parent company Hasbro had [...] "approved the season two before we were done with season one; {{they knew they had}} {{something}} good on their hands." [...] He explained, [...] "they saw [...] of the show early on, which is [...] rare because usually a season will be one and aired before a network will renew it <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know what the numbers are, but they, I guess, a bit of a risk on their behalf, but I'm glad they did." [...] The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 movie [...] According to Thiessen, the joke was an [...] "afterthought"; originally, {{there was going to be}} a more elaborate ending, but due to time constraints, a new finale was created. During the animation stage, one of the directors noted that the scene was [...] "kind of like the ending to A New Hope" [...] and so, the decision was made to create [...] "scene for scene" [...] parody of the original.|$|E
500|$|Biko {{rejected}} the apartheid government's division of South Africa's population into tribal and ethnic groups, instead dividing the population into two categories: {{the white and}} the black. He defined blackness as a [...] "mental attitude" [...] rather than a [...] "matter of pigmentation", referring to [...] "blacks" [...] as [...] "those who are by law or tradition politically, economically and socially discriminated against as a group in the South African society" [...] and who identify [...] "themselves as a unit in the struggle towards the realization of their aspirations". In this way, he and the Black Consciousness Movement used [...] "black" [...] in reference not only to Bantu-speaking Africans but also to Coloureds and Indians, which together made up almost 90% of South Africa's population in the 1970s. Biko was not a Marxist and {{believed that it was}} oppression based on race, rather than class, which would be the main political motivation for change in South Africa. He argued that those on the [...] "white left" [...] often promoted a class-based analysis as a [...] "defence mechanism... primarily <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> detach us from anything relating to race. In case it has a rebound effect on them because they are white".|$|E

Some of them include Victoria Beckham, Amy Poehler and David Hasselhoff. Others accept to guest appear because they are fans of the show themselves. Actor Johnny Depp, who appeared as Jack Kahuna Laguna in the sixth-season episode [...] "SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One," [...] accepted the guest role on the show because he and his children are fans. Hillenburg described the process, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was hard to get}} people. Most of the people that allow themselves to be on have kids who like the show. Often, they're kids are fans. They're doing it <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> please the family."
