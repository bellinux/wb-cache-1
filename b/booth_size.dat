40|$|Trade {{shows are}} a multi-billion dollar {{business}} in the US and the UK, but {{little is known about}} the determinants of trade show effectiveness. In this paper, we build a model that explains differences in trade show effectiveness across industries, across companies and across two countries. We focus on the differences in trade show effectiveness measured in a similar way across similar samples of 171 US and 135 UK firm-show experiences between 1980 and 1991. While the similarities outweigh the differences, we find evidence that trade shows are viewed differently by exhibitors and attendees in these two countries. We are able to make substantial generalizations about the effect of various show selection (go-not go) variables (<b>booth</b> <b>size,</b> personnel, etc.) on observed performance. We discuss the implications of our research for developing benchmarks for trade show performance and for better global management of the business marketing communications mix.

40|$|Trade {{shows are}} a multibillion-dollar {{business}} in the United States and the United Kingdom, but {{little is known about}} the determinants of trade show effectiveness. The authors build a model that captures differences in trade show effectiveness across industries, companies, and two countries. They focus on the differences in trade show effec-tiveness measured in a similar way across similar samples of 221 U. S. and 135 UK firm-show experiences between 1982 and 1993, Although the variables explain different amounts of variance in these two countries and some vari-ables tend to have different relative effects, the similarities outweigh the differences. The authors are able to gen-eralize about the effect of various show selection (go/not go) variables as well as tactical variables (e,g,, <b>booth</b> <b>size,</b> personnel) on observed performance. They conclude by discussing the implications of their research for develop-ing benchmarks for trade show performance. Trade shows are an important component of the mar-keting mix for many industrial products, constitutinga multibillion-dollar business both in the United States and Europe, They account for about 10 % of the busi-ness marketing communications budget of U,S, firms and more than 20 % of the budget for many European firms {Business Marketing 1996; Sandier 1994), According to the Trade Show Bureau (1994), the number of trade shows i...|$|E

The show started in the early 1960s, and now has over 200 <b>booths</b> varying in <b>size</b> and style on any Sunday of the year.

40|$|To {{participate}} in an exhibition, booth that attracts attention is required. Without exception, for wedding photographers who participated in a wedding exhibition. The problem is, building materials, furnitures, and construction service, requires big amount of cost. These costs can be saved if the materials can be used repeatedly and the construction can be done independently. During this time, materials used in booth constructions were using processed wood products, that are rigid and heavy. As another alternative, cardboard can be utilized more by processing the material into an exhibition booth. The design method stages are to analyze the needs of users and booth design, before the design stage begins. The design concept adopted is Showing Off Life Simply And Naturally, which is manifested {{in the form of}} 3 themed booth designs which are Curve, penstARgon, and Home.

Customers must pay a {{comparatively}} steep admission price ($20-$50, depending on the time of day) and no alcoholic beverages are served, although a snack bar is located on the premises. The O'Farrell's main showroom is New York Live!, a continuous striptease show where one performer dances on stage while the others offer lap dances by asking customers, [...] "Want some company?" [...] The dancers then actually sit on the men's laps (a practice that is illegal in some other states) and insist on substantial tips ($20 is common). There are several themed rooms, such as the Ultra Room, a peep show-type room where patrons stand in private booths watching women perform with various props such as dildoes; the Green Door Room (named for the Mitchells' classic hardcore film Behind the Green Door and its sequel; it served as the principal set of the latter), the darkened Kopenhagen Lounge, where the customers use flashlights to watch the performances, and private <b>booths</b> of varying <b>sizes</b> (although not all dancers make themselves available for private sessions with customers) and onstage lesbian simulated-sex performances.|$|R

This condition can cause dissatisfaction to the toll road users in obtaining services. If the booth service that operates is just a little can causes a longer waiting time to get service, but if there are more booth services that can be operated, it can cut the waiting time. It is need to be specified the appropriate queue system model to the conditions of service in Tembalang toll gate. So it can be determined the number of booth service is working optimally. Based on the data analysis obtained from the Arena software, the queue system model that can describe the conditions of service at Tembalang toll gates with data total- time, time-total, and time-time the direction of Srondol-Jatingaleh at the regular toll booth is (Norm/G/ 2) :(GD/∞/∞), (G/Norm/ 2) : (GD/∞/∞), (G/G/ 2) : (GD/∞/∞) and at the automatic toll booth is (G/Tria/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞), (Tria/G/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞), (G/G/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞) while with the direction of Jatingaleh-Srondol at the regular toll booth is (Norm/G/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞), (G/Norm/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞), (G/G/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞) and (G/Tria/ 2) : (GD/∞/∞), (Tria/G/ 2) : (GD/∞/∞), (G/G/ 2) : (GD/∞/∞) at automatic toll booth.
