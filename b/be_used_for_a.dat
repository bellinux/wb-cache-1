5|$|As {{the first}} Category5 landfalling {{hurricane}} in 15years, {{and due to}} its widespread impact, the name Dean was officially retired on May 13, 2008 by the World Meteorological Organization during its annual meeting in Orlando, Florida, and will not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> future Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced by Dorian on List V of the Atlantic hurricane naming lists, which {{was used in the}} 2013 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its effects}} in the United States, the name Charley was retired from the {{rotating}} lists of tropical cyclone names {{in the spring of}} 2005 by the World Meteorological Organization.

5|$|Less than a {{month after}} Pauline, Hurricane Rick struck the same general region, which brought {{additional}} rainfall and hampered relief efforts. Compared to Pauline, however, damage was minimal. Because of the high death tolls and the extent of damage in Mexico, The name Pauline was retired in the spring of 1998 by the World Meteorological Organization and will never again <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Pacific hurricane. It was replaced by Patricia in the 2003 season.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease {{to the level of}} placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid is an {{antibiotic}} {{used for the}} treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria that cause disease, including streptococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The main uses are infections of the skin and pneumonia although it may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of other infections including drug resistant tuberculosis. It is used either by injection into a vein or by mouth. Linezolid {{is a member of the}} oxazolidinone class of medications.|$|E
5|$|The name Joan was {{retired in}} 1989 and {{replaced}} by Joyce on the list for the 1994 season. The name will never again <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> North Atlantic hurricane. Because {{the impact of the}} Miriam portion of the tropical cyclone was minimal, the name Miriam was not retired in the Pacific and is still on the list of names for that basin, and was most recently used in the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|The name Keith was {{retired in}} the spring of 2001 and will never again <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> North Atlantic hurricane.

However, since the name Kirk was not used during the course of 2006, it was then first used during the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
50|$|Although most Southern-style conjure {{bags are}} made of red flannel material, most {{seasoned}} conjurers use color-symbolism. This practice embodies itself {{in the practice of}} hoodoo, where green flannel <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> money mojo, white flannel <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> baby-blessing mojo, red flannel <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> love mojo, and so on.

5|$|The {{strength}} and docility of the dromedary make it popular as a domesticated animal. According to Richard Bulliet, they can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{wide variety of}} purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, trading and {{as a source of}} milk, meat, wool and leather. The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.|$|E
5|$|These {{forces were}} {{supported}} by the Ninth Air Force, which had pin-pointed 75% of the pillboxes along the frontlines and planned an opening bombardment including 360 bombers and 72 fighters; fresh aircraft would <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second aerial wave, which included the use of napalm. With the Germans having few anti-aircraft batteries and severely limited support from the Luftwaffe, Allied dominance of the sky over Aachen was near total.|$|E
5|$|Adding a {{multiple}} of any row to another row, or {{a multiple}} of any column to another column, {{does not change the}} determinant. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, that is, determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E

5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, British {{broadcaster}} Channel 4 commissioned shipwreck hunter David Mearns and his company, Blue Water Recoveries, {{to locate}} the wreck of Hood, and if possible, produce underwater footage of both the battlecruiser and her attacker, Bismarck. This was to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major event documentary to be aired on the 60th anniversary of the ships' battle. This {{was the first time}} anyone had attempted to locate Hoods resting place. Mearns had spent the previous six years privately researching the fate of Hood with the goal of finding the battlecruiser, and had acquired the support of the Royal Navy, the HMS Hood Association and other veterans groups, and the last living survivor, Ted Briggs.|$|E

A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land should <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.|$|E
