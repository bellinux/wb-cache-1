Thirty patients were examined by two neurology doctors, at least one of whom was a consultant. The doctorsâ fi ndings were recorded on a standardised pro forma. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using the kappa (Îº) statistic, which is chance corrected.

Almost perfect agreement was seen for cerebellar signs and inspection (a combination of speed of movement, muscle <b>bulk,</b> <b>wasting</b> and tremor); substantial agreement for strength, gait and coordination; moderate agreement for tone and refl exes; and only fair agreement for sensation. The inter-rater agreement is therefore better for observable neurological signs than for elicitable signs, which may be explained by the additional skill and cooperation required to elicit rather than just observe clinical signs. These fi ndings have implications for clinical practice, particularly in telemedicine, and highlight the need for standardisation of the neurological examination...|$|R

For disposal, {{accounting of the}} nuclear material must be done. We were recently tasked with measuring sixteen 55 -gallon drums, each containing about 150 to 250 grams of HEU. The lower two-thirds of the drums consisted mostly of paper, plastics, and other combustibles. The HEU in this <b>bulk</b> <b>waste</b> had been previously assayed using a segmented gamma scanner (SGS) and ranged from 1 to 20 grams per drum. The drums were later re-opened and specific packages of HEU waste solids, mostly polyethylene bottles filled with uranium oxide and/or fluoride, were placed {{on top of the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>waste.</b> The number of bottles ranged from one to seven with an additional {sup 235 }U mass between 150 to 230 grams per drum. Although many of these additional mass values were based on results from an old chemical analysis, they are expected to be reasonably accurate. We counted the drums on the SGS and shuffler instruments. The results were biased low on the SGS which was calibrated for normal combustible waste (not bottles embedded in waste) and biased high on the shuffler calibrated for small cans of oxide. The biases were caused by the differences among the calibration standards and the drums. This paper is a study of the nature of these biases, providing corrections and comparing the resulting performance characteristics of the instruments. This effort was greatly enhanced by having photographic as well as real-time radiographic information on many of the drums contents. A new software tool, recently developed at Los Alamos to calculate shuffler count rates accurately and generate bias correction factors, was applied to these drums.

40|$|The use of {{encapsulation}} technology {{to produce a}} compliant waste form is an outgrowth from existing polymer industry technology and applications. During the past 12 years, the Department of Energy (DOE) has been researching {{the use of this}} technology to treat mixed wastes (i. e., containing hazardous and radioactive wastes). The two primary encapsulation techniques are microencapsulation and macroencapsulation. Microencapsulation is the thorough mixing of a binding agent with a powdered waste, such as incinerator ash. Macroencapsulation coats the surface of <b>bulk</b> <b>wastes,</b> such as lead debris. Cement, modified cement, and polyethylene are the binding agents which have been researched the most.

However, recent research conducted by DOE laboratories have shown that polyethylene is more durable and cost effective than cements. The compressive strength, leachability, resistance to chemical degradation, etc., of polyethylene is significantly greater than that of cement and modified cement. Because higher waste loads can be used with polyethylene encapsulant, the total cost of polyethylene encapsulation is significantly less costly than cement treatment. The only research lacking in the assessment of polyethylene encapsulation treatment for mixed wastes is pilot and full-scale testing with actual waste materials. To date, only simulated wastes have been tested. The Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site had planned to conduct pilot studies using actual wastes during 1996. This experiment should provide similar results to the previous tests that used simulated wastes.
