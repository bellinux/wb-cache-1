25|$|Despite his notoriety, and {{considering}} {{the importance of}} his reign, Commodus' years in power are not well chronicled. The principal surviving literary sources are Dio Cassius (a contemporary and sometimes first-hand observer, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reign, only transmitted in fragments and abbreviations), Herodian and the Historia Augusta (untrustworthy for its character as a work of literature rather than history, with elements of fiction embedded within its biographies; in the case of Commodus, it may well be embroidering upon what the author found in reasonably good contemporary sources).|$|E
25|$|Tillemont and Le Beau {{regard the}} revolt of Illus {{as an attempt}} to re-establish paganism; <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> view there seems no foundation. We do not know that Illus was a pagan, though Pamprepius was one: {{it is more likely that}} Illus was a man of no fixed {{religious}} principles, and that his revolt originated either in ambition, or in a conviction that his only prospect of safety from the intrigues of his enemies and the suspicions of Zeno was the dethronement of the emperor. It is remarkable that Edward Gibbon does not mention the name of Illus, and scarcely notices his revolt.|$|E

25|$|Eric Ashton {{was again}} {{captain of the}} 1962 Lions side and Colin Hutton was coach. The British Lions won the opening two Tests 31–12 and then 17–10, {{the first time in}} 34 years that they had won the first two matches on Australian soil. The first Test was played before more than 70,000 spectators. The third Test was staged at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday 14 July 1962. A {{controversial}} last-minute Australian try and the subsequent touchline conversion resulted in a 17–18 defeat; <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> the 62 Lions would have been the first team to achieve a whitewash of the Australians.|$|E
25|$|Vijaya's {{ministers and}} other {{followers}} established several new villages. For example, Upatissa established Upatissagama {{on the bank}} of Gambhira river, north of Anuradhagama. His followers decided to formally consecrate him as a king, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> he needed a queen of Aryan (noble) descent. Vijaya's ministers, therefore, sent emissaries with precious gifts to the city of Madhura, which was ruled by a Pandu king. (Madhura is identified with Madurai, a city in South India; Pandu is identified with the Pandyas). The king agreed to send his daughter as Vijaya's bride. He also requested other families to offer their daughters as brides for Vijaya's followers. Several families volunteered, and were adequately compensated by king with gifts. The Pandu king sent to Lanka his own daughter, other women (including a hundred maidens of noble descent), craftsmen, a thousand families of 18 guilds, elephants, horses, waggons, and other gifts. This group landed in Lanka, at a port known as Mahatittha.|$|E
25|$|The {{first meeting}} of the new company took place on 19 April 1790, and Jessop was asked to prepare {{drawings}} which would {{form the basis for}} tenders. The directors also decided to advertise for a surveyor, and on 7 June they appointed James Smith from Reading. They expected the navigation to be finished by October 1791, and so Smith's contract only ran until then. At the same meeting they appointed Mr Baynes of Stowmarket to handle legal matters, and Dyson and Pinkerton as contractors. Both were members of civil engineering families, whose careers had developed since the 1760s, and who had collaborated on a number of schemes, making them the first civil engineering contractors. John Dyson Sr had worked with James Pinkerton on the Adlingfleet Drainage scheme, the Driffield Navigation and the Laneham Drainage scheme, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> project, he worked with George Pinkerton, thought to be one of James' younger sons.|$|E

25|$|If {{the ball}} strikes {{any part of}} the batsman's person (not {{necessarily}} the leg), and, in the umpire's judgement, the ball would have hit the batsman's stumps <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> interception, then the batsman is out. The point of impact must be within line with the batsman's stumps and the bowler's stumps if the batsman is playing a stroke. The batsman can be given out if the ball strikes him outside the off stump, if the ball would have hit the stumps and if the batsman is playing no stroke. The ball must not pitch outside the line of leg stump. Also, the ball cannot have made contact with the bat or glove that is touching the bat before hitting the batsman. If the ball hits the batsman either on the full or immediately after bouncing, the umpire is required to assume that the ball is travelling straight on, ignoring any spin, swing or other hard to predict movement that may have changed the direction of the ball if it had not hit the batsman.|$|E
25|$|Paine {{was arrested}} in France on December 28, 1793. Joel Barlow was {{unsuccessful}} in securing Paine’s release by circulating a petition among American residents in Paris. Sixteen American citizens were allowed to plead for Paine’s release to the Convention, yet President Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier of the Committee of General Security refused to acknowledge Paine’s American citizenship, stating he was an Englishman and a citizen of a country at war with France. Paine himself protested and claimed {{that he was a}} citizen of the U.S., which was an ally of Revolutionary France, rather than of Great Britain, which was by that time at war with France. However, Gouverneur Morris, the American minister to France, did not press his claim, and Paine later wrote that Morris had connived at his imprisonment. Paine narrowly escaped execution. A chalk mark was supposed to be left by the gaoler on the door of a cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine's case, the mark had accidentally been made on the inside of his door rather than the outside; this was {{due to the fact that}} the door of Paine's cell had been left open whilst the gaoler was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> quirk of fate, Paine would have been executed the following morning. He kept his head and survived the few vital days needed to be spared by the fall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794).|$|E
500|$|A hole in {{the center}} of the larger piece {{dispersed}} the mass and increased the surface area, allowing more fission neutrons to escape, thus preventing a premature chain reaction. <b>But,</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> larger, hollow piece to have minimal contact with the tamper, it must be the projectile, since only the projectile's back end was in contact with the tamper prior to detonation. The rest of the tungsten carbide surrounded the sub-critical mass target cylinder (called the [...] "insert" [...] by the designers) with air space between it and the insert.

500|$|Howe mostly used a Gibson ES-175 semi-{{acoustic}} {{guitar and}} a Martin 00-18 acoustic for recording, {{though he did}} attempt to play {{a variety of styles}} with the two instruments. Kaye's main instruments were the Hammond organ and piano, including a solo on [...] "A Venture". Kaye had previously played the Hammond M-100, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> album used the B-3, a move which he saw as [...] "a turning point". He was not interested in playing synthesizers, which had started to appear on the market. This proved to be a problem with {{the other members of the}} band, and Kaye thought his style conflicted too much with Howe's. He left the group during rehearsals for the follow-up album in mid-1971, to be replaced by Rick Wakeman.|$|E
500|$|During a {{subsequent}} NPR talk show, Savage {{said that he}} has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment.

Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, [...] "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball." [...] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a [...] "foaming lunatic... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" [...] At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.|$|E
500|$|The third game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Keiichi Okabe, who also created the score for Nier, a spin-off {{game of the}} series. While writing the music, Okabe felt he needed to match Sano's work on Drakengard, rather than copy it, and so {{felt that there was}} no need to [...] "rehash" [...] the original music despite the potential merits. He commented that the musical creation was [...] "a tough production, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> game, there's part of it I'm doing that I've never experienced before." [...] At director Taro Yoko's request, Okabe worked on separating the style of the music from that of Nier: he did this by including both soft, gentle tunes similar to Nier and more intense tracks. The two styles were also inspired by the game's world theme of [...] "the sense of contrast". One musical piece, [...] "Exhausted 3", is a re-orchestration of Drakengards theme song, intended by Okabe as a nod to earlier installments while staying true to Yoko's wishes.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} {{process for}} the album began in November 2008 and lasted around three months, helmed by Joe Barresi. Isis' previous full-lengths since Celestial had been produced by Matt Bayles, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> record, {{it was decided that}} a change was needed. Although the professional parting of ways was peaceable, working with Bayles had become, in the words of Harris, [...] "routine" [...] and [...] "old hat". Barresi was selected thanks to his work with bands such as Tool, Queens of the Stone Age and Melvins, and upon the album's completion, Harris felt that Barresi [...] "brought out some aspects of the band that even we didn't fully understand." [...] Harris' drums and keyboardist Bryant Clifford Meyer's Hammond B3 lines were tracked over three and a half days at Sound City in Van Nuys; the same studio in which the seminal Nirvana record Nevermind was tracked. This marked the first time a specialist drum tech was utilised by the band; Jerry Johnson, a veteran of projects with Def Leppard and Linkin Park, was recruited.|$|E
500|$|In the Official Centenary History it {{was noted}} that [...] "it is too perhaps too much to expect, even from the stoical {{discipline}} of old Blues, a unanimous acquiescence in a verdict of [...] "dead-heat," [...] for no conclusion could be more unsatisfactory to the competitors themselves." [...] Oxford firmly believed that they had won the race by feet, but following a subsequent meeting in a law court with representatives of both universities and the umpire Chitty, the official result was declared as [...] "Dead Heat". [...] Punch declared [...] "Oxford won, Cambridge too." [...] W. W. Rouse Ball, a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, writing in A History of The First Trinity Boat Club suggested that the broken oar was the deciding factor: [...] "... <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> Oxford would have won." [...] A correspondent writing in The Sydney Mail said both teams should [...] "consider themselves lucky" [...] that they did not lose, and speculated that the race would be looked back as [...] "the great gooseberry" [...] year.|$|E
500|$|According to Morrell, Wasp {{reached the}} South Sandwich Islands on February 28. His {{presence}} there is corroborated by his {{descriptions of the}} harbour on Thule Island, confirmed by the early 20th century expeditions. In {{the next phase of}} the voyage Morrell records that he took Wasp southwards and, the sea being remarkably clear of ice, reached a latitude of 70°14'S before turning north on March 14 as fuel for the ship's stoves was running out. This journey, if Morrell's account is true, made him the first American sea-captain to penetrate the Antarctic Circle. He believed, he says, that <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> deficiency he could have [...] "made a glorious advance directly to the South Pole, or to 85° without the least doubt". Some credence to his claimed southern latitude is provided by James Weddell's voyage on a similar track, a month earlier, which reached 74°15'S before retreating. The words used by Weddell to express his belief that the South Pole lay in open water are replicated by Morrell, whose account was written nine years after the event. Thus it is suggested by geographer Paul Simpson-Housley that Morrell may have plagiarised Weddell's experiences, since Weddell's account had been published in 1827.|$|E
