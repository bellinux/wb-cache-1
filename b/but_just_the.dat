25|$|Wakefield {{had learned}} from Barrett the {{complicated}} nature of land ownership in the Port Nicholson area because of past wars and expulsions and from late October Wakefield was informed of—but dismissed—rumours that Māori had sold land that {{did not belong to}} them. Problems with some of their purchases were emerging, however. Ngāti Toa chief Te Rauparaha boarded the Tory near Kapiti to tell Wakefield that in its October agreement Ngāti Toa intended the company to have not millions of acres {{at the top of the}} South Island, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> two small areas of Whakatu and Taitapu. And in December, a week after arriving at Hokianga to inspect the land bought from the 1825 New Zealand Company, Wakefield was told by Ngāpuhi chiefs that the only land the New Zealand Land Company could claim in the north was about a square mile at Hokianga. Further, there was nothing at all for them at either Kaipara or Manukau Harbour. There was a prize for him, however, with his purchase on 13 December of the Wairau Valley in the north of the South Island. Wakefield bought the land for ₤100 from the widow of whaling Captain John Blenkinsopp, who had claimed to have earlier bought it off Ngāti Toa chief Te Rauparaha. That sale would lead to the 1843 Wairau Affray in which 22 English settlers and four Māori would be killed.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. He favorably compared the episode to the sixth season episode [...] "The Rain King" [...] and noted that [...] "'The Rain King' [...] was quite simply one of the joys of season six. So it hardly {{came as a surprise}} to me that I enjoyed Bell's 'The Goldberg Variation" [...] entry for [...] It was cute, light-hearted, and a little kooky, with a happy ending to boot." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of Season Seven and wrote, [...] "Since 'The X-Files’ roots are in horror, feel-good episodes are few and far between, and something to be treasured when they appear. The Goldberg Variation is the perfect feel-good X-Files episode; not too soppy, not too harsh, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> right mix of ludicrous gangster deaths and saving the cute kid." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode a [...] "charmer" [...] and praised Willie Garson's characterization of Harry Weems. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, writing, [...] "'The Goldberg Variation' is a clever, witty standout from the recent middling run of X-Files episodes." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and called it a [...] "fun" [...] entry that shows off the series' [...] "emotional palette". He felt that the episode successfully managed to convey a [...] "clever and whimsical" [...] feel, but that the conceit of a [...] "good man" [...] as the monster of the episode does not make it particularly scary. All-in-all, he felt that it [...] "all works out in the end".|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E

Nobel Prize winner in literature Gabriel García Márquez expressed his disdain over its elimination by saying: [...] "The 'Ñ' is not an archaeological piece of junk, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> opposite: a cultural leap of a Romance language that left the others behind in expressing with only one letter a sound that other languages continue to express with two." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{tensions}} between Reed and Cale growing, Reed gave an ultimatum to Morrison and Tucker, declaring that unless Cale was fired, he would quit the band. Morrison and Tucker reluctantly {{went along with}} the scheme. In September 1968, Cale played his final gig with the Velvets at the Boston Tea Party and according to Tucker, [...] "When John left, it was really sad. I felt really bad. And of course, this was gonna really influence the music, 'cause, John's a lunatic (laughs). I think we became a little more normal, which was fine, it was good music, good songs, it was never the same though. It was good stuff, a lot of good songs, <b>but,</b> <b>just,</b> <b>the</b> lunacy factor was... gone." [...] After his dismissal from the band, Cale was replaced by Doug Yule, a singer, bassist and organist.|$|E
2500|$|Dominance & {{submission}} {{of power is}} an entirely different experience, and is not always psychologically associated with physical pain. Many BDSM activities might not involve any kind of pain or humiliation, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> exchange of power and control. During the activities, the practitioners may feel endorphins comparable to the so-called [...] "runner's high" [...] or to the afterglow of orgasm. The corresponding trance-like mental state {{is also known as}} [...] "subspace" [...] for the submissive, or [...] "topspace" [...] for the dominant. Some use the term [...] "body stress" [...] to describe this physiological sensation. This experience of algolagnia is important, but is not the only motivation for many BDSM practitioners. The philosopher Edmund Burke defines this sensation of pleasure derived from pain by the word sublime. [...] Research has shown that couples engaging in consensual BDSM tend to show hormonal changes that indicate decreases in stress and increases in emotional bonding.|$|E

2500|$|Because of anti-communist {{sentiment}} at {{the start}} of the Cold War, the Republic of China was recognized as the sole legitimate government of China by the United Nations and most Western nations. On 9 January 1950, the Israeli government extended recognition to the People's Republic of China. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505, passed on 1 February 1952 considered the Chinese communists to be rebels against the Republic of China. However, the 1970s saw a switch in diplomatic recognitions from the ROC to the PRC. On 25 October 1971, Resolution 2758 was passed by the UN General Assembly, which [...] "decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it." [...] It should be noted that the Resolution 2758 merely dealt with the issue of Chinese representative in UN without any reference to the legal status of Taiwan. Multiple attempts by the Republic of China to rejoin the UN, no longer to represent all of China <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> people of the territories it governs, have not made it past committee, largely due to diplomatic maneuvering by the PRC, which claims Resolution 2758 has settled the matter.

2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{factor in}} the change of the band's sound was due to Wilson's meeting of Israeli rock singer Aviv Geffen. The two met when Geffen, a fan of Wilson's music, invited Porcupine Tree on a tour in 2000 {{in support of the}} band's {{previous}} album, Lightbulb Sun. Touring together lead to a separate musical collaboration named Blackfield. Geffen, not being a fan of metal music, kept that project in more of a pop rock genre, sounding more like prior Porcupine Tree albums Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. This gave Wilson an outlet for that side of his music, allowing him to concentrate on more metal sounds with Porcupine Tree without abandoning the prior genre altogether either. Rounding out the changes was the departure of drummer Chris Maitland, with the replacement being Gavin Harrison, who joined in early 2002. Maitland was unable to make a larger commitment with being signed to a major record label, and the band found Harrison's style more fitting to a more metal-sounding album. Wilson summarized the band's changes at the time as: In Absentia was all written before Gavin came on; even the drum parts were kind of programmed. But it’s one of those times sometimes in life when everything comes together. I’d written these songs and I was very much more interested at that time—having worked with Opeth—in the idea of combining a more kind of brutal or metal aspect back again into the fabric of the music. At the same time Gavin came along and Gavin was a very different drummer to our previous drummer, Chris Maitland. He was much more of a powerhouse and he was much more technical. He had more of a contemporary edge to his sound so {{it was just one of}} those really lucky things that he just came in and he played those songs and just blew everyone away and everything just kind of came together. And of course it was the first record we made for our new label and we got signed to a big American label for the first time [...] Gavin was the final piece of that equation in a way—he just totally raised the bar in terms of not just the drumming <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> musicianship right throughout the band. Everyone was listening to Gavin and saying, “Fuck, wow. We really need to step up our game.” ...|$|E
