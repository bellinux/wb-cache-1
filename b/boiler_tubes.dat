Another inspection train was run on 26 June 1901, starting from Reedness Junction and visiting, according to the Crowle Advertiser, Creyke Siding, Garthorpe and Crowle. The train consisted of two first-class carriages and an open truck. A dinner was held at the Darby and Joan Hotel in Crowle, before the party returned to Reedness. Although Creyke siding was mentioned, this term was normally applied to a siding serving Creyke's peat works on the North Eastern Railway main line to the south of Marshland Junction.|$|E

In mid-March, Wilhelm II and his wife, Augusta Victoria, came aboard {{the ship and}} waited {{in the mouth of}} the Elbe for Wilhelm's brother Prince Heinrich, who was {{returning}} from the United States. The I Squadron then went on a short cruise in the western Baltic before embarking on a major cruise around the British Isles, which lasted from 25 April to 28 May. Individual and squadron maneuvers took place from June to August, interrupted only by a cruise to Norway in July. During these maneuvers, three of Kaiser Wilhelm IIs <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> burst, but the damage was repaired by the start of the autumn maneuvers in August. These exercises began in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade. Kaiser Wilhelm II took no active part in the exercises; she instead served as an observation ship for the commander of the fleet, as well as her namesake, Kaiser Wilhelm II. The regular winter cruise followed during 1–12 December.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This mini-dissertation {{investigates the}} impact that Long Term Overheating and Creep (LTOC) has on coal fired power {{stations}} and the availability implications thereof. The need for the investigation arose from a single coal fired power station, with multiple boilers with a total generating capacity of greater than 400 MW, of which LTOC is the dominant <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure mechanism. For {{the purposes of the}} mini-dissertation, the power station was simply titled Power Station X. A summary is provided of the various <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure mechanisms as well as a brief description of availability. The mini-dissertation makes use of case studies in researching the matter of LTOC. It was seen that LTOC is a global matter, which is typically seen in ageing power stations. The major discussion points arising from the mini-dissertation is that of a <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure management program as well as correctly understanding the causes of <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failures. With an adequate and correctly functioning <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure management program one can reduce and manage the occurrence of <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failures. The second major discussion point arising from the mini-dissertation is that of correctly understanding the contributing factors to <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failures. A lot of emphasis has been placed on the actual mechanisms and identification of failures, however the contributing factors and root cause has not been thoroughly investigated. Additionally one also has to identify the various areas prone to creep and the necessary remedial and mitigating actions for the removal and or replacement of such components, while keeping in mind the financial implication thereof. The mini-dissertation concludes with possible areas of future research as well as possible remedial actions that can be taken. M. Ing. (Engineering Management...|$|R

40|$|Fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> is a {{one type}} of boiler. It is {{developed}} as {{the second of the}} three major historical types of boilers which are low-pressure tank, fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> and high-pressure water <b>tube</b> <b>boiler.</b> Sometimes fired <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> is called as a smoke <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> or shell <b>boiler.</b> A fired <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> is use for production of steam. The efficiency of steam production {{is directly related to the}} temperature, residence time of water flow and the water turbulence inside the fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler.</b> With the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this study presents the effort performed in modelling work on the water turbulence using design of fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> without baffles and fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> with baffles. The prediction of water flow inside the boiler based on k-s turbulence model is used since it is widely applied in industries and education sectors.

FLUENT is the software that used as a solver and post-processing in CFD. The comparison of the water flow and the thermal characteristics between fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> without baffles and fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> will also be discussed...|$|R
5|$|In late 1889, Wacht {{joined a}} {{squadron}} of four old ironclads, , , and that cruised the Mediterranean Sea along with Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht Hohenzollern and the protected cruiser , which carried Prince Heinrich. The squadron visited numerous ports in the Mediterranean, including state visits to Italy and the Ottoman Empire. Wilhelm II also stopped in Greece, where he attended the wedding of his sister Sophie to the Greek crown prince Constantine. The squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April 1890, when it returned to Germany. Wacht, meanwhile, was forced to remain in Trieste for six months due to a serious problem with her <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes,</b> which required lengthy repairs. The ship led the torpedo boat flotilla in the Maneuver Squadron in 1893. In early 1894, Wacht {{was assigned to the}} II Division of the Maneuver Squadron as the divisional dispatch vessel.

5|$|On 20 January 1902 the {{air chamber}} of another torpedo exploded, killing one sailor and {{wounding}} three. In September she transported the Minister of the Navy to Bizerte. Jauréguiberry {{was transferred to}} the Northern Squadron in 1904 and arrived at Brest on 25 March. She was lightly damaged when she touched a rock while entering Brest in fog on 18 July and in another incident her steering compartment was flooded when a torpedo air flask burst between her screws during a torpedo-launching exercise on 18 May 1905. While visiting Portsmouth on 14 August Jauréguiberry ran aground for a short time in the outer harbour. She returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1907 where she was assigned to the Reserve Division, and the following year was reassigned to the Third Division. In 1909 the 3rd and 4th Divisions were reformed into the 2nd Independent Squadron and transferred to the Atlantic in 1910. Beginning on 29 September 1910 her <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> were renewed at Cherbourg.

She resumed cruising for the summer and autumn, but her 1967–68 Christmas cruise was cancelled to allow her builders to complete the work. The refit added new fire-resistant bulkheads, doors and ceilings. At the same time the opportunity was taken to replace her <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Roach also {{founded a}} number of other firms to meet the {{material}} needs of his shipyard. He established the nearby Chester Pipe and Tube Company, from which he could source the large amount of iron piping and quality <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> required for his ships. With the purchase of a patent for an asbestos compound, he founded the Chalmers-Spence Company to provide pipe insulation. He also secured exclusive patent rights in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware for the Hirsch propeller, a European design which lessened vibration, and he founded the Hirsch Propeller Company to manufacture it. The end result of these efforts was a network of companies that made the Roach shipyard largely independent of third-party suppliers, enabling Roach to minimize costs and undercut his competitors.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the first}} <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{particularly}} the du Temple with its sharp corners, could not be cleaned of scale internally. Tubes were later cleaned internally by attempting to pass a hinged rod through, with a brush at the end. For the curved tube designs, often {{only part of the}} tube could be reached. Another method was to pass a chain down the tube from above, pulling a brush behind it, although this was unworkable for boilers like the Thornycroft where the tubes first travelled horizontally or upwards. The eventual method was to use 'bullet' brushes that were fired from one drum into the other by use of compressed air. Sets of brushes were used, one for each tube, and they were carefully numbered and counted afterwards to ensure that none had been left behind, blocking a tube.|$|E
25|$|The boilers are {{inclined}} on the locomotives, {{to ensure that}} the <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> and the firebox remain submerged when on the gradient, a standard practice on mountain railways – the locomotive always runs chimney-first up the mountain. The water gauges (gauge glasses) are mounted half at the centre on the locomotive so that the water level does not change with the gradient. One result of the boiler's angle is that the firehole door is at waist height, requiring the fireman to lift the coal some distance. The boiler is not superheated. Water is carried in tanks that run the full length of the boiler, but not all this water is for use in the boiler. The tanks are in fact divided into two sections, the smaller front section holding water that is used for cooling when the engine is running downhill. The drive to the wheels is through a series of levers that allow the pistons to have a longer stroke than the cranks. This is another common feature in mountain railways.|$|E
25|$|The CEGB {{took over}} project management, imposed light {{penalties}} {{in order not}} to cripple Fairey and International Combustion, and appointed British Nuclear Design and Construction (BNDC) as main contractor. In 1971, problems with corrosion of mild steel components in the first generation Magnox reactors gave the designers cause for concern. The Dungeness B restraint couplings - mechanical linkages that held the graphite core in place whilst allowing it to expand and contract in response to temperature changes - were made of mild steel and could be subject to the same corrosion. It was decided to replace them with components made from a new material. In 1972, problems were found with the galvanised wire that was used to attach thermocouples to stainless steel <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> During heat treatment of the tubes at temperatures up to 1,050°C, the galvanising zinc diffused into the tubes and made them brittle. The cost had by then risen to £170million. By 1975, the CEGB was reporting that the power station would not be completed until 1977 and that its cost had risen to £280 million. By 1979 the cost had risen further to £410 million. Reactor 1 first generated power on 3 April 1983, some 13 years behind schedule and at a cost of £685 million, four times the initial estimate in inflation-adjusted terms.|$|E

25|$|When the {{locomotive}} is running under power, a draught {{on the fire}} is created by the exhaust steam directed up the chimney by the blastpipe. Without draught, the fire will quickly die down and steam pressure will fall. When {{the locomotive}} is stopped, or coasting with the regulator closed, there is no exhaust steam to create a draught, so the draught is maintained {{by means of a}} blower. This is a ring placed either {{around the base of the}} chimney, or around the blast pipe orifice, containing several small steam nozzles directed up the chimney. These nozzles are fed with steam directly from the boiler, controlled by the blower valve. When the regulator is open, the blower valve is closed; when the driver intends to close the regulator, he will first open the blower valve. It is important that the blower be opened before the regulator is closed, since without draught on the fire, there may be backdraught – where atmospheric air blows down the chimney, causing the flow of hot gases through the <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> to be reversed, with the fire itself being blown through the firehole onto the footplate, with serious consequences for the crew. The risk of backdraught is higher when the locomotive enters a tunnel because of the pressure shock. The blower is also used to create draught when steam is being raised at the start of the locomotive's duty, at any time when the driver needs to increase the draught on the fire, and to clear smoke from the driver's line of vision.|$|E

50|$|Package boilers are {{commonly}} called water or fire <b>tube</b> <b>Boilers.</b> Water <b>tube</b> <b>boilers</b> use convection heating, which draws {{the heat from}} the fire source, and passes against the generating <b>tubes</b> of the <b>boiler,</b> causing water inside those tubes to boil off into steam. The fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> arrangement utilizes conduction heating which transfers heat from physical contact. Fire <b>tube</b> <b>boilers</b> are not commonly used due to their method of conduction heating because pipes in direct contact with fire and cold water could damage the pipes. The package boiler is usually a two or three-pass fire-tube boiler with an internal furnace tube. This is similar to the much earlier Scotch boiler.|$|R

40|$|Repeated <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> leak {{trips in}} coal fired power plants can {{increase}} operating cost significantly. An {{early detection and}} diagnosis of boiler trips is essential for continuous safe operations in the plant. In this study two artificial intelligent monitoring systems specialized in <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> leak trips have been proposed. The first intelligent warning system (IWS- 1) represents the use of pure artificial neural network system whereas the second intelligent warning system (IWS- 2) represents merging of genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks as a hybrid intelligent system. The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) methodology was also adopted in IWS- 1 and compared with traditional training algorithms. Genetic algorithm (GA) was adopted in IWS- 2 to optimize the ANN topology and the boiler parameters. An integrated data preparation framework was established for 3 real cases of <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> leak trip based on a thermal power plant in Malaysia. Both the IWSs were developed using MATLAB coding for training and validation. The hybrid IWS- 2 performed better than IWS- 1.
