5|$|Natural predators of <b>black</b> <b>bean</b> aphids {{include both}} adults and larvae of ladybirds and lacewings and the larvae of hoverflies. Certain species of tiny {{parasitic}} wasps {{lay their eggs}} inside aphids and the developing wasp larvae devour their hosts from inside. Members of the wasp genera Diaeretiella and Lysiphlebus behave in this way and may provide a measure of control of the aphids.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>bean</b> aphid {{may have}} {{originated}} in Europe and Asia {{but it is}} now one of the most widely distributed species of aphids. It is found throughout temperate areas of Western Europe, Asia and North America and in the cooler parts of Africa, the Middle East and South America. In the warmer parts of its range, apterous individuals can survive the winter and they may continue to reproduce asexually all year round.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>bean</b> aphid {{is a major}} pest {{of sugar}} beet, bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} of the plants. Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. The plants are stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>black</b> turtle <b>bean</b> is a small, shiny {{variety of}} common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), {{especially}} popular in Latin American cuisine, {{though it can}} also be found in Cajun and Creole cuisines of south Louisiana. <b>Black</b> <b>beans</b> (and all common beans) are native to the Americas, but have been introduced around the world. They are also used in Punjabi cuisine and are referred to as <b>black</b> <b>beans.</b> They are used interchangeably with vigna mungo in countries such as the USA [...] They are often called simply <b>black</b> <b>beans</b> (frijoles negros, zaragoza, judía negra, poroto negro, caraota o habichuela negra in Spanish, and feijão preto in Portuguese), although this can cause confusion with other <b>black</b> <b>beans.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>bean</b> aphid {{has both}} sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts {{at different times}} of year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by winged females in the autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through parthenogenesis. The lifespan of a parthenogenetic female is about 50 days and during this period, each can produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually winged forms. These migrate to their secondary host plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>bean</b> aphid is a small, soft-bodied insect {{that has}} {{specialised}} {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts which are used to suck the juice from plants. This aphid is usually seen in large numbers and is a tiny, plump insect about two millimetres long with a small head and bulbous abdomen. The body is blackish or dark green in colour. Many adults are devoid of wings, a state known as aptery. Winged forms, known as alates, are longer and more slender than aptates and have shiny black heads and thoraxes. The membranous wings of the alates are held angled over the body. The antennae are less {{than two-thirds of the}} length of the body and both they and the legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips. The tibiae of the hind legs are swollen in egg-laying females. Near the rear of the abdomen are a pair of slender, elongated tubes known as cornicles or siphunculi. Their function is the production of a defensive waxy secretion. They are twice as long as the finger-like tail and both are brownish-black.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} the whole {{population}} of Florence—men, women, and children—in reference to the years 1336 to 1338, {{was estimated to be}} 90,000 due to the amount of bread needed daily. Villani recorded an exact figure of 94,000 residents (which he says was very reliable data that included even the poor) in April 1347, a year before the Black Death. A <b>black</b> <b>bean</b> was deposited for every male child baptized and a white bean deposited for every female child baptized in the Florence Baptistry—from these baptisms the average annual birth rate was figured at 5,500 to 6,000. Villani pointed out that the newborn males often outnumbered the newborn females by 300 to 500 on each count. He noted that in his day the adult, male citizen population of the city was about 25,000 (those between the age of fifteen and seventy who could bear arms); 1,500 of these were noble and upper class citizens. Giovanni Villani stated that at all times there were about 1,500 foreigners, transients, and soldiers in the city.|$|E

5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>bean</b> aphid (Aphis fabae) is a {{small black}} insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E
