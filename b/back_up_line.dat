5|$|The Blonde Bear {{was one of}} the world's {{greatest}} football players, {{who never}} missed an open field block.

5000|$|In 1949, Grantland Rice chose him as {{the center}} for his All-Time All-American team. At the time, Rice said: [...] "Schulz was 6 feet 4 and he weighed 245 pounds. He was {{as fast as a}} good halfback. I have never seen a center who was his equal at <b>backing</b> <b>up</b> a <b>line</b> and then {{protecting}} both flanks. He was a terrific tackler".|$|R
5000|$|In {{an article}} in Collier's magazine, famed sports writer Grantland Rice said of Bernard: [...] "His height, weight and {{physical}} power combined with a keen football intelligence, made him an ideal man <b>backing</b> <b>up</b> the <b>line.</b> He was quick at diagnosing plays {{and went to the}} right spot. He was one of football's best defenders against the forward pass and adept at intercepting passes." ...|$|R

On this mountain, we found a new species related to the {{highland}} Sumatran species by its leaf shape, stem shape and inflorescence, but its upper pitchers are slightly similar to N. alata from the Philippines. We gave the name N. dempoensis after the mountain from which it originated.|$|R

500|$|The {{reflection}} from a short-circuited {{line can}} be described in similar terms to that from an open-circuited line.

Only when he died in 1657 did the title come <b>back</b> <b>up</b> the <b>line</b> to make Walter the 3rd Baronet. Sir Walter went on to found the Sir Walter St John's school at Battersea.|$|R

50|$|At {{about the}} same time as Andretti's {{retirement}} from the race, Depailler spun and dropped from third to seventh, and after 20 laps, Regazzoni led by 13 seconds over Lauda, Jody Scheckter and Tom Pryce in the Shadow. Depailler, furious over his mistake, was storming <b>back</b> <b>up</b> the <b>line</b> as he got by Jean-Pierre Jarier and Ronnie Peterson within six laps. When Pryce broke a driveshaft on lap 33 and Scheckter had a front wishbone snap on lap 34, Depailler was back in third place, behind the two Ferraris.|$|R
50|$|The {{timetable}} {{system had}} several disadvantages. The first {{was that there}} was no positive confirmation that the track ahead was clear; only that it should be clear. This system did not allow for breakdowns and other such problems. The timetable was set up {{in such a way that}} there should be sufficient time between trains for the crew of a broken-down or delayed train to walk <b>back</b> <b>up</b> the <b>line</b> far enough to set up warning flags, fusees and explosive devices known as torpedoes, which alerted a train crew to an occupied track ahead.|$|R

[...] If any of 'em gets by me, I'll move back into the line and stay there".

50|$|A {{variation}} of the pro set places the backs offset toward one side (either strong or weak). This look is almost universally used with one fullback one halfback. The <b>backs</b> <b>line</b> <b>up</b> closer {{to the line of}} scrimmage than in a standard pro set, about 3 yards deep. The fullback <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> directly behind the quarterback, in the spot he would normally <b>line</b> <b>up</b> in the I-Formation. The halfback then <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> behind either the left or right tackle.|$|R
5000|$|Halfback: The Halfback ("HB"), also {{referred}} to as a [...] "tailback" [...] ("TB") or more generically as a running <b>back,</b> <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> behind the quarterback and in many cases behind the fullback.

[...] She also played a cleaner game as far as holding and getting offside too." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2015 Robinson {{continued}} {{to be a part of}} the Saints' running <b>back</b> <b>line</b> <b>up.</b> In the Week 8 victory over the New York Giants, Khiry's season came to an end when he suffered a tibia fracture and was placed on injured reserve. He ended the season with 56 carries for 180 yards and four touchdowns.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} with 56 to go. Austin Dillon, restarting on {{the outside}} line, spun his tires and <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> the cars <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> {{on the outside}}. Clint Bowyer tagged the wall in Turn 1 and made contact with Erik Jones. With 47 to go, Bowyer suffered a left-front tire blowout and slammed the wall in Turn 1, bringing out the fifth caution. Newman, who was running fourth, {{was sent to the}} tail end of the field on the restart for a crew member being over the wall too soon when he pitted.|$|R
50|$|For the 1957-1958 races, {{the grid}} was <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> and exited single-file from the newly {{constructed}} pit lane. The two laps allowed {{the field to}} properly form up, however, in practice {{it turned out to}} be difficult and both races saw incidents at the start. In 1959, the field went <b>back</b> to <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> the grid on the mainstretch, and continues to do so to this day.|$|R
50|$|In the dance, {{the first}} lady (just widowed) sets off, dances with the new Duke and then turns his younger brother before coming <b>back</b> to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> between the new Duke and his wife.

50|$|The Metz fortifications contributed some {{of their}} long 100mm guns to replace the short 100mm guns at Thionville when France {{upgraded}} the Thionville sector to <b>back</b> <b>up</b> the Maginot <b>Line</b> fortifications in the area. Fort Jeanne d'Arc was the headquarters for the French 3rd Army in 1940. During the Battle of France the Metz area was bypassed and encircled by German forces, with the Maginot and earlier fortifications seeing little action before the Armistice of 1940.|$|R
