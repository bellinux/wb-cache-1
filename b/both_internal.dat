5|$|In {{addition}} to the acute effects, radiation exposure (<b>both</b> <b>internal</b> and external) carries a long-term risk of death from cancer of 5–10% per Sv. The general population is exposed to small amounts of polonium as a radon daughter in indoor air; the isotopes 214Po and 218Po are thought to cause {{the majority of the}} estimated 15,000–22,000 lung cancer deaths in the US every year that have been attributed to indoor radon. Tobacco smoking causes additional exposure to polonium.|$|E
5|$|The index gauges global peace {{using three}} broad themes: {{the level of}} safety and {{security}} in society, the extent of domestic and international conflict {{and the degree of}} militarization. Factors are <b>both</b> <b>internal</b> such as levels of violence and crime within the country and external such as military expenditure and wars. It has been criticised by Riane Eisler for not including indicators specifically relating to violence against women and children.|$|E

5|$|Administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP {{is taught}} in schools in over 140 countries, {{in one of three}} languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, {{students}} must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using <b>both</b> <b>internal</b> and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E
5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>internal</b> and {{external}} signals {{can lead to}} the induction of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases, but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process. The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis. During apoptosis, proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{difficulties}} were {{exacerbated by}} prolonged problems in English agriculture, {{part of a}} wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the Great Famine. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains the following spring that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting {{in a string of}} bad harvests. Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices. Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage <b>both</b> <b>internal</b> trade and the importation of grain, but with little success. The requisitioning of provisions for the royal court during the famine years only added to tensions.|$|E

5|$|Lipids are {{the most}} diverse group of biochemicals. Their main {{structural}} uses are as part of biological membranes <b>both</b> <b>internal</b> and external, such as the cell membrane, or {{as a source of}} energy. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.|$|E
5|$|The African {{art museum}} took a {{scholarly}} direction {{over the next}} twenty years, with less social programming. It collected traditional and contemporary works of historical importance. Exhibitions include works <b>both</b> <b>internal</b> and borrowed, and have ranged from solo artist to broad, survey shows. The museum hosts two to three temporary exhibitions and ten special events annually. Reviewers criticized the National Mall building's architecture, particularly its lack of natural light. The museum is scheduled for remodeling {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's upcoming South Mall project.|$|E
5|$|The Turkish Armed Forces {{consists}} of the Land Forces, the Naval Forces and the Air Force. The Gendarmerie and the Coast Guard operate as parts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in peacetime, although they are subordinated to the Army and Navy Commands respectively in wartime, during which they have <b>both</b> <b>internal</b> law enforcement and military functions. The Chief of the General Staff is appointed by the President and is responsible to the Prime Minister. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Parliament for matters of national security and the adequate preparation {{of the armed forces}} to defend the country. However, the authority to declare war and to deploy the Turkish Armed Forces to foreign countries or to allow foreign armed forces to be stationed in Turkey rests solely with the Parliament.|$|E
