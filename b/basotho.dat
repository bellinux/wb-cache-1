5|$|In 1870 Spruyt {{returned}} to the Orange Free State and to private law practice. He established himself in Ladybrand, a territory conquered by the Orange Free State in the last <b>Basotho</b> War of 1867. His insolvency kept following him, however, and as late as 1871 some of his possessions, including a building complex in Rustenburg, were publicly sold for a minute sum of money.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} {{had led to}} an {{economic}} collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus {{to the east and}} war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the <b>Basotho.</b> Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The <b>Basotho</b> were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. On one leg he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right.|$|E
5|$|In late 1859 Pretorius {{was invited}} to stand for President in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly {{as a means to}} {{overcome}} the <b>Basotho.</b> The Transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad, but nevertheless he readily did so and won. The Transvaal volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems surrounding this by granting Pretorius half a year's leave, hoping a solution might come about during this time, and the President duly left for Bloemfontein, appointing Johannes Hermanus Grobler to be Acting President in his absence. Pretorius was sworn in as President of the Free State on 8 February 1860; he sent a deputation to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day.|$|E
5|$|In Johannesburg in the 1950s, {{crime was}} a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was {{the nucleus of}} all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English, known as tsotsitaal. Some of the more {{well-known}} gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians, the Americans, the Gestapo, the Berliners and the Vultures. The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw {{as some kind of}} hero, for taking on the whites of Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of <b>Basotho</b> migrant workers who banded together {{in the absence of any}} effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. The primary goal of this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis and from other gangs of migrant workers, and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment.|$|E
5|$|The Boers and {{the local}} Tswana and <b>Basotho</b> chiefdoms were in near-constant conflict, mainly over land. Kruger was elected field cornet of his {{district}} in 1852, and in August that year he {{took part in the}} Battle of Dimawe, a raid against the Tswana chief Sechele I. The Boer commando was headed by Pretorius, but in practice he did not take much part as he was suffering from dropsy. Kruger narrowly escaped death twice—first a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head but only knocked him out, then later a Tswana bullet swiped across his chest, tearing his jacket without wounding him. The commando wrecked David Livingstone's mission station at Kolobeng, destroying his medicines and books. Livingstone was away at the time. Kruger's version of the story was that the Boers found an armoury and a workshop for repairing firearms in Livingstone's house and, interpreting this as a breach of Britain's promise at the Sand River not to arm tribal chiefs, confiscated them. Whatever the truth, Livingstone wrote about the Boers in strongly condemnatory terms thereafter, depicting them as mindless barbarians.|$|E
25|$|Basutoland, {{home of the}} <b>Basotho</b> people, {{had been}} under the nominal control of the Cape Colony since 1872. However the Cape {{government}} had allowed the <b>Basotho</b> leadership to keep much of their traditional authority and independence. As allies and trading partners of the Cape, the <b>Basotho</b> were also well-equipped with firearms.|$|E
25|$|Another Boer {{invasion}} in 1867 was more {{dangerous for the}} <b>Basotho.</b> The Europeans had upgraded their rifles, obtained more powerful artillery, and augmented their numbers with white volunteers from across South Africa. Once again they converged on Thaba Boisu, liquidating local strongholds on the way. A first assault against the fortress ended in failure. A second drove the <b>Basotho</b> back from their advanced defence lines, but also became bogged down. A third also stalled when a Boer leader was shot dead. The conflict dragged on for 6 months as the Boers ravaged <b>Basotho</b> territory, seizing cattle, people and burning crops to bring their opponents to heel. In early 1868 however Moshoeshoe persuaded the British to intervene and placed his kingdom under crown protection. This ended the Boer siege although a subsequent treaty transferred yet more <b>Basotho</b> land to their enemies.|$|E
25|$|A {{succession}} of wars followed from 1858 to 1868 between the <b>Basotho</b> kingdom and the Boer republic of Orange Free State. In the battles that followed, the Orange Free State {{tried unsuccessfully to}} capture Moshoeshoe's mountain stronghold at Thaba Bosiu, while the Sotho conducted raids in Free State territories. Both sides adopted scorched-earth tactics, with large swathes of pasturage and cropland being destroyed. Faced with starvation, Moshoeshoe signed a peace treaty on 15 October 1858, though crucial boundary issues remained unresolved. War broke out again in 1865. After an unsuccessful appeal for aid from the British Empire, Moshoeshoe signed the 1866 treaty of Thaba Bosiu, with the <b>Basotho</b> ceding substantial territory to the Orange Free State. On 12 March 1868, the British parliament declared the <b>Basotho</b> Kingdom a British protectorate {{and part of the}} British Empire. Open hostilities ceased between the Orange Free State and the <b>Basotho.</b> The country was subsequently named Basutoland and is presently named Lesotho.|$|E
25|$|Rise of the <b>Basotho</b> system. Several tribal kingdoms {{such as the}} Tlokoa, Pedi and <b>Basotho</b> took up {{horse and}} gun, despite {{collaboration}} between the Boers and the British to prevent such transfers, particularly of firearms. The <b>Basotho,</b> a small tribal grouping threatened by the Zulu, Ndebele, {{as well as the}} Europeans, adapted to both weapons systems, and carried out a complex mix of warfare and diplomacy to fend off their enemies. They became avid horsemen, and in time, developed the tough, durable breed, that was {{to be known as the}} Basuto pony. The <b>Basotho</b> equipped their mounted fighters with guns, although the traditional spear, battle-axe, and knobkerrie (club) continued in use. Most of the firearms were low quality flintlocks, and ammunition and gunpowder were usually in short supply. Marksmanship according to contemporary European observers was not as good as that of the Boers. The tribal warriors also relied heavily on fortifications in their mountainous country, the most famous of which was Thaba Boisu, fortress capital of their king Moshoeshoe.|$|E
25|$|Facing a British ban against {{arms sales}} to Africans in the 1850s, the <b>Basotho</b> desperately tried to {{manufacture}} their own cartridges and gunpowder with assistance from European deserters. The results were poor and of little value when a Boer invasion from the Orange Free State threatened in 1858. The Boer force was armed with modern breech-loading rifles and several pieces of artillery, and their firepower took a heavy toll against the tribal warriors. The <b>Basotho</b> however withdrew to their mountain strongholds, particularly Thaba Boisiu, and a siege commenced. Counterattacks from the fortress saw some success, with one foray killing 30 enemy troops, and the siege became a stalemate. Eventually the Boers were forced to withdraw when the <b>Basotho</b> dispatched horsemen to raid homesteads and fields behind their lines.|$|E
25|$|End of the {{regional}} balance of power. While other African groups adapted to horses and guns, the <b>Basotho</b> state successfully maintained a measure of independence from the many enemies that sought to destroy it. The <b>Basotho</b> case again demonstrates the complexity of African military systems, often conceived mainly in terms of hordes of attacking, spear-wielding infantry. A fuller picture must include the cavalry tradition, both {{in the south and}} in western Africa, and must take into account the alternative, tactical defensive style of peoples like the Shona and <b>Basotho.</b> The case of the <b>Basotho,</b> Zulu, Xhosa and others also shows that indigenous militaries could learn and adapt, and could achieve credible performances even in the 19th century. Some historians note that a rough balance of power prevailed in the region, with native military systems generally holding their own against settler forces and local colonial levies. The heavier intervention of British power however choked off the free market in firearms, and/or deployed regular imperial troops with modern repeating rifles, artillery and machine guns. Such imperial troops in turn, were also to crush Boer power during the Boer War, circa 1899–1902.|$|E
25|$|The Sotho {{musician}} Tshwatlano Makala was {{the first}} traditional musician to achieve widespread commercial success. He helped {{to set the stage}} for the subsequent rise of Letsema Mat'sela's band, <b>Basotho</b> Dihoba, which used styles from his native Lesotho to develop a genre called mohobelo.|$|E
25|$|From the 1830s onwards, {{numbers of}} white {{settlers}} from the Cape Colony crossed the Orange River and started {{arriving in the}} fertile southern part of territory known as the Lower Caledon Valley, which was occupied by <b>Basotho</b> cattle herders {{under the authority of}} the <b>Basotho</b> founding monarch Moshoeshoe I. In 1845, a treaty was signed between the British colonialists and Moshoeshoe, which recognised white settlement in the area. No firm boundaries were drawn between the area of white settlement and Moshoeshoe's kingdom, which led to border clashes. Moshoeshoe was under the impression he was loaning grazing land to the settlers in accordance with African precepts of occupation rather than ownership, while the settlers believed they had been granted permanent land rights. Afrikaner settlers in particular were loathe to live under Moshoesoe's authority and among Africans.|$|E
25|$|When Rhodes {{became a}} member of the Cape Parliament, the chief goal of the {{assembly}} was to help decide the future of Basutoland. The ministry of Sir Gordon Sprigg was trying to restore order after the 1880 rebellion known as the Gun War. The Sprigg ministry had precipitated the revolt by applying its policy of disarming all native Africans to those of the <b>Basotho</b> nation.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} war led to British defeats {{such as that}} at Qalabani, {{and ended}} in 1881 with a stalemate and a treaty that favoured the <b>Basotho.</b> The rebellion is a primary reason why Lesotho is now an independent country and not part of surrounding South Africa. At {{the same time as}} the Basuto Gun War broke out, unrest flared up once again among the Xhosa of the Transkei.|$|E
25|$|Battles against English and Boer forces. The <b>Basotho</b> {{clashed with}} several enemies to {{maintain}} their fragile independence. In the 1840s they fought against the Tlokwa, who were also mounted, and against the Zulu-influenced Nedebele, who were primarily infantry. In 1851, a British colonial force invaded Sotho country and was soundly defeated {{at the battle of}} Kononyaba (or Viervoet). Against the British, who deployed an artillery piece, the spear and battle-axe proved more useful than guns when the Sotho hemmed in the invaders on a mountaintop. Victory was gained by close hand-to-hand fighting. This incident provided a significant check to British power in the area. The following year another British force tried its luck, and was also defeated. This encounter saw the widespread deployment of Sotho cavalry. At one point in the battle, some 6,000 <b>Basotho</b> horsemen mounted a charge against the British formation. They were repulsed by rifle and artillery fire. Nevertheless, the tribal regiments controlled the field {{at the end of the}} day, and the British withdrew.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{economy of}} the <b>Basotho</b> in Lesotho is based on rearing cattle. They practise a seasonal migration between valley and high plateaus of the Maloti (basalt mountains of Lesotho). Pressure on pasture land has increased due to increases in population, as well as construction of large storage dams in these mountains to provide water to South Africa's arid industrial heartland. Growing pressure on pastures is contributing to degradation of sensitive grasslands and could contribute to sedimentation in man-made lakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} Boer {{republic of}} Orange Free State evolved from colonial Britain's Orange River Sovereignty, {{enforced by the}} presence of British troops, which lasted from 1848 to 1854 in the territory between the Orange and Vaal rivers, named Transorange. Britain, due to the military burden imposed on it by the Crimean War in Europe, then withdrew its troops from the territory in 1854, when the territory along with other areas in the region was claimed by the Boers as an independent Boer republic, which they named the Orange Free State. In March 1858, after land disputes, cattle rustling and a series of raids and counter-raids, the Orange Free State declared war on the <b>Basotho</b> kingdom, which it failed to defeat. A succession of wars were conducted between the Boers and the <b>Basotho</b> for the next 10 years. The name Orange Free State was again changed to the Orange River Colony, created by Britain after the latter occupied it in 1900 and then annexed it in 1902 during the Second Boer War. The colony, with an estimated population of less than 400,000 in 1904 ceased to exist in 1910, when it was absorbed into the Union of South Africa as the Orange Free State Province.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous {{military}} organization also encompasses Africa’s substantial cavalry or mounted tradition, {{from the}} armored chevaliers of Western Africa, {{to the desert}} horsemen of North Africa, to the mounted fighters of the <b>Basotho</b> in their southern redoubts. On {{the waters of the}} continent, naval activities must be accounted for, not simply canoe transport, but fighting vessels, ports, and troop landings covered by poisoned arrows, bullets and cannonballs. Different styles of warfare and modes of organization are also demonstrated by indigenous systems, from the patient tactical defensive of the <b>Basotho,</b> the elaborate armies of Ashanti, the sweeping offensive horns of the Zulu impi, and the protracted guerrilla styles and archery of forest peoples like the Lobi, or the San (Bushmen) further south. As regards styles of organization, different approaches over different eras can be seen. Among the Kongo kingdoms of the 18th century for example, a mixture of unit types was deployed – heavy infantry with strong shields for example, backed by lighter contingents armed with bows and spears. Special units of elite troops and bodyguards were also maintained. Like the reorganized Roman legions of old however, the later Zulu system dispensed with such distinctions in favor of one streamlined combat organization and method. Such standardized methods were to be copied by other tribes, and were to dominate or influence large parts of southern Africa and beyond during the 19th century. Such complexity again illustrates that African military systems cannot be conceived of in static, one-dimensional terms.|$|E
25|$|Maitland went to India {{and became}} {{commander}} in chief of the Madras Army in 1836 serving for two years. In 1843 he was appointed Colonel of the 17th (Leicestershire) Regiment and in 1844 Governor of the Cape Colony, but was removed during the Xhosa War. He is still highly respected in the Kingdom of Lesotho for his judgment on the border issue between the Orange River Afrikaners and the <b>Basotho</b> of King Moshoeshoe I, which, had it been implemented, would have secured the economic future of the kingdom. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 6 April 1852.|$|E
25|$|Whether by {{or against}} the wish of the home government, the limits of British {{authority}} continued to extend. The <b>Basotho,</b> who dwelt in the upper valleys of the Orange River, had subsisted under a semi-protectorate of the British government from 1843 to 1854; but having been {{left to their own}} resources on the abandonment of the Orange sovereignty, they fell into a long exhaustive warfare with the Boers of the Orange Free State. On the urgent petition of their chief Moshesh, they were proclaimed British subjects in 1868, and their territory became part of the Cape Colony in 1871 (see Basutoland). In the same year, the southeastern part of Bechuanaland was annexed to Britain under the title of Griqualand West. This annexation was a consequence of the discovery there of rich diamond mines, an event which was destined to have far-reaching results.|$|E
500|$|Clarke's tenure {{marked a}} {{difference}} in policy: {{instead of trying to}} divide and rule and undermine the power of the hereditary chiefs, he granted considerable authority to them. He applied a similar approach to that of his previous work in Basutoland. His view was that the native people were [...] "better able to manage their own affairs than we can do it for them, though they need our help in international matters and in matters between white and black." [...] He gave special judicial functions to Hlubi of the <b>Basotho,</b> Mehlokazulu of the Ngobese and Mpiyakhe of the Mdlalose, enabling them to try certain cases referred to them by Resident Magistrates. In 1895, according to Harriette Colenso, the Zulu people approved of direct rule with Clarke as Resident Commissioner. However, when Clarke was appointed Resident Commissioner in Rhodesia in 1898, Charles Saunders replaced him and he bowed to pressure from settlers and officials to minimise Dinuzulu's influence over the Zulu people, especially during the Second Boer War.|$|E
500|$|With Pretorius's approval, Kruger met Boshoff under a white flag. Kruger {{made clear}} that he {{personally}} disapproved of Pretorius's actions and the situation as a whole, but defended his President when the Free Staters began to speak harshly of him. A commission of 12 men from each republic, including Kruger, reached a compromise whereby Pretorius would drop his claim on the Free State, and a treaty was concluded on 2 June 1857. Over the next year Kruger helped to negotiate a peace agreement between the Free State and Moshoeshoe I of the <b>Basotho,</b> and persuaded Schoeman {{to take part in}} successful talks regarding constitutional revisions, after which Zoutpansberg accepted the central government with Schoeman as Commandant-General. On 28 June 1858 Schoeman appointed Kruger Assistant Commandant-General of the South African Republic. [...] "All in all", Kruger's biographer TRH Davenport comments, [...] "he had shown a loyalty to authority in political disputes, devotion to duty as an officer, and a real capacity for power play." ...|$|E
2500|$|The British, who at {{that time}} {{controlled}} the area between the Orange and Vaal Rivers called the Orange River Sovereignty, [...] decided a discernible boundary was necessary and [...] proclaimed a line named the Warden Line, dividing the area between British and <b>Basotho</b> territories. This led to conflict between the <b>Basotho</b> and the British, who were defeated by Moshoeshoe's warriors {{at the battle of}} Viervoet in 1851.|$|E
2500|$|Frere pushed [...] "The Peace Protection Act" [...] (1879), {{during the}} Xhosa Wars, and decreed {{that all those}} of African descent had to be disarmed. The Basuto Gun War (1880) followed, as the Basothos rebelled at {{what they saw as}} a racist and high-handed ruling. Premier John Gordon Sprigg's unpopular attempt to enforce this {{disarmament}} of the <b>Basotho</b> was aggravated by his setting aside of <b>Basotho</b> land for white settlement.|$|E
2500|$|... "Land of the Basotho" [...] or [...] "of the Sesotho-speakers". <b>Basotho</b> {{itself is}} formed from the plural prefix ba- and Sotho of {{uncertain}} etymology, although possibly {{related to the}} word motho ("human being").|$|E
2500|$|As {{punishment}} to the <b>Basotho,</b> {{the governor and}} commander-in-chief of the Cape Colony, Sir George Cathcart, deployed troops to the Mohokare River; Moshoeshoe was ordered to pay a fine. When he did not pay the fine in full, a battle broke out on the Berea Plateau in 1852, where the British suffered heavy losses. [...] In 1854, the British handed over the territory to the Boers through {{the signing of the}} Sand River Convention. This territory and others in the region then became the Republic of the Orange Free State.|$|E
2500|$|Froude {{responded by}} openly allying with a radical white {{opposition}} party, the “Eastern Cape Separatists”, promising a baronetcy to its leader Paterson {{if he would}} overthrow the Cape’s elected government. In a public speech on 25 July 1876, challenging the Cape Government, he declared, [...] "We want you to manage your natives {{as they do in}} Canada and Australia". He also promised to create a separate white Eastern Cape, and to impose a forced labour system onto the Cape’s African population along “Transvaal lines” while confiscating Xhosa and <b>Basotho</b> land for redistribution to white farmers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{duration}} of the Basutoland Campaign was from 13 September 1880 to 27 April 1881. Following {{the end of the}} Zulu wars [...] from 1877 to 1879, Cape of Good Hope Governor Henry Bartle Frere and Prime Minister Gordon Sprigg attempted to disarm the <b>Basotho</b> and ordered them to hand in their firearms. Some chiefs reluctantly complied, but were almost immediately attacked by chiefs who had refused to comply, such as Lerothodi and Moletsane. In September 1880 they also attacked white administrators and, as a result, troops were mobilised and the Basuto Gun War broke out. Various encounters ensued until February 1881, when an armistice was arranged. Peace was eventually concluded in May 1881. Veterans of this campaign were awarded the Basutoland Clasp.|$|E
2500|$|The 'gun war' – {{defeat of}} colonial forces. The <b>Basotho</b> {{continued}} to use their horse-gun system under the new colonial regime to maintain their independence. In the 1880s, their territory was annexed by Cape Colony and a punitive expedition of 800 white troops and 1500 African allies was dispatched to crush the opposition of one Moorosi, a dissenting Sotho chieftain. Moorosi gathered some 300 gunmen in a strong mountaintop position and fought off the colonial forces for over 8 months. After three major assaults, and continuous shelling by artillery, the position was overrun, Moroosi was killed and his lands seized. As the struggle with Moorosi raged, colonial authorities reserved part of Basutoland for white settlement and demanded that all natives surrender their firearms. This demand was rejected and another British expedition was dispatched to liquidate resistance, sparking the so-called [...] "Gun War." [...] The Sotho horsemen however used a flexible mix of tactics: defensive positions on fortified hills, attacks against administrative centers of the colonial regime, and frequent use of guerrilla strikes and ambushes against lumbering colonial columns, most notably a column of British lancers at Qalabani. The combination of mobility, firepower, ambushes, and hit and run strikes was sufficient to stalemate or defeat the Basotho's enemies for almost a year. Stymied, the colonial army, and the disarmanent demand was withdrawn.|$|E
2500|$|Tutu {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to serve a seven-year term as dean, however after seven months he was nominated as a candidate in an election for the position of Bishop of Lesotho. Although Tutu stipulated {{that he did not want}} the position, he was elected to the position regardless in March 1976, at which he reluctantly accepted it. This decision upset some of his congregation, who felt that he had used their parish as a stepping stone for his personal career advancement. In July, Bill Burnett consecrated Tutu as a bishop at St Mary's Cathedral. In August, Tutu was enthroned as the Bishop of Lesotho in a ceremony at Maseru's Cathedral of St Mary and St James; thousands attended, including King Moshoeshoe II and Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan. In this position, he travelled around the diocese, often visiting parishes in the mountains. He learned the Sesotho language and developed a deep affection for the country. He appointed Philip Mokuku as the first dean of the diocese and places great emphasis on further education for the <b>Basotho</b> clergy. He befriended the royal family although his relationship with Jonathan's right-wing government, of which he disapproved, was strained. In September 1977 he returned to South Africa after being invited to speak at the Eastern Cape funeral of Black Consciousness activist Steve Biko, who had been killed by police while in their custody. At the funeral, Tutu stated that Black Consciousness was [...] "a movement by which God, through Steve, sought to awaken in the black person a sense of his intrinsic value and worth as a child of God".|$|E
50|$|By {{the latter}} part of the 19th century, Moshoeshoe {{established}} the nation of the <b>Basotho,</b> in Basutoland. He was popularly known as Morena e Moholo/morena oa <b>Basotho</b> (Great King/King of the <b>Basotho).</b>|$|E
