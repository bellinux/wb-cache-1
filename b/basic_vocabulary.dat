40|$|Vocabulary {{knowledge}} of preschool {{children is a}} key factor in predicting literacy success in elementary school (Hammer, Farkas, 2 ̆ 6 Maczuga, 2010). However, few deliberate attempts to teach <b>basic</b> concept <b>vocabulary</b> have been studied (Bowers 2 ̆ 6 Schwarz, 2013; Wilson, 2004). The purpose of this research is to determine if large group explicit instruction with interactive activities of specific <b>basic</b> concept <b>vocabulary</b> will increase preschool children 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of basic concept terms when measured by a standardized basic concept assessment. This research will also assess the validity of a basic concept-curriculum based measure (BC-CBM) as an efficient tool to monitor a child 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of <b>basic</b> concept <b>vocabulary</b> over time. There were 30 preschool children (M age= 53. 8 months) who participated in this experiment. Results demonstrated the standardized assessment and BC-BM raw scores improved through intervention.

In order to ease the application of formal methods and tools to the Semantic Web, we developed an integrated tools environment to support systematic development of OWL ontologies and then transformation, reasoning assistance and querying of the...|$|R

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the Old English {{period the}} English {{language}} underwent a third foreign influence, namely the Scandinavian influence of Old Norse. In addition to a great many place names, these consist mainly of items of <b>basic</b> <b>vocabulary,</b> and words concerned with particular administrative aspects of the Danelaw (that is, the area of land under Viking control, which included extensive holdings all along the eastern coast of England and Scotland). The Scandinavians spoke Old Norse, a language related to Old English in that both derived from the same ancestral Proto-Germanic language. It is very common for the intermixing of speakers of different dialects, such as those that occur during times of political unrest, to result in a mixed language, and one theory holds that exactly such a mixture of Old Norse and Old English is thought to have accelerated the decline of case endings in Old English. The influence of Old Norse on the lexicon of the English language has been profound: responsible for such <b>basic</b> <b>vocabulary</b> items as , , the pronoun [...] and hundreds of other words.|$|E

40|$|According to {{linguistic}} research, the mainland-Japanese dialects and the Ryukyu dialects {{have the}} same origin {{even though they have}} very different forms now. One factor which supports the thesis that they {{have the same}} origin is that a systematic law of phonetic correspondence exists betweon them. In order to investigate the phonetic law more objectively, we propose a word transformation system which synthesizes words of the Ryukyu-Shuri dialect from those of the Tokyo dialect (standard Japanese). In the system, the phonetic law is embodied in the IFTHEN rules of the OPS 5. Using this system, we transformed nouns of the Tokyo dialect into words of the Ryukyu-Shuri dialect. It was found that 49 % of the generated <b>basic</b> <b>vocabularies</b> agree with real nouns of the Ryukyu-Shuri dialect. Because the phonetic law can be prescribed in an explicit form in the system, we can study the phonetic law more objectively by this system than by the manual research of traditional dialectology...|$|R
