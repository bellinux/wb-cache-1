25|$|In image processing, {{processed}} {{images of}} faces {{can be seen}} as vectors whose components are the brightnesses of each pixel. The dimension of this vector space is the number of pixels. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix associated with a large set of normalized pictures of faces are called eigenfaces; {{this is an example of}} principal component analysis. They are very useful for expressing any face image as a linear combination of some of them. In the facial recognition branch of <b>biometrics,</b> eigenfaces provide a means of applying data compression to faces for identification purposes. Research related to eigen vision systems determining hand gestures has also been made.|$|E

In some cases a secure USB drive may use a hardware-based encryption mechanism that uses a hardware module instead of software for strongly encrypting data. IEEE 1667 is an attempt to create a generic authentication platform for USB drives. It is supported in Windows 7 and Windows Vista (Service Pack 2 with a hotfix).|$|E
25|$|Understanding of mutationism is {{clouded by}} the mid-20th century {{portrayal}} of the early mutationists by supporters of the modern synthesis as opponents of Darwinian evolution and rivals of the <b>biometrics</b> school who argued that selection operated on continuous variation. In this portrayal, mutationism was defeated by a synthesis of genetics and natural selection that supposedly started later, around 1918, with work by the mathematician Ronald Fisher. However, the alignment of Mendelian genetics and natural selection began as early as 1902 with a paper by Udny Yule, and built up with theoretical and experimental work in Europe and America. Despite the controversy, the early mutationists had by 1918 already accepted natural selection and explained continuous variation {{as the result of}} multiple genes acting on the same characteristic, such as height.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} {{technology}} writers, including Adrian Kingsley-Hughes and Kevin Roose of New York {{believed that the}} fingerprint scanning functionality of the iPhone 5S could help spur {{the adoption of the}} technology as an alternative to passwords by mainstream users (especially in [...] "bring your own device" [...] scenarios), as fingerprint-based authentication systems have only enjoyed wider usage in enterprise environments. However, citing research by <b>biometrics</b> engineer Geppy Parziale, Roose suggested that the CMOS-based sensor could become inaccurate and wear out over time unless Apple had designed the sensor to prevent this from occurring. Brent Kennedy, a researcher of the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, recommended that users not immediately rely on the technology, citing the uncertainty over whether the system could properly reject a spoofed fingerprint.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the iPhone 5S, the German Chaos Computer Club {{announced}} on September 21, 2013 that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using [...] "easy everyday means". The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image to make a latex model thumb which was then pressed against the sensor to gain access. The spokesman for the group stated, [...] "We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint <b>biometrics.</b> It is plain stupid to use something that you can't change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token." [...] However, in 2013, 39% of American smartphone users used no security measures at all to protect their smartphone. Others have also tried Chaos Computer Club's method, but concluded that it is not an easy process in either time or effort, given that the user has to use a high resolution photocopy of a complete fingerprint, special chemicals and expensive equipment, and because the spoofing process takes some time to achieve.|$|E

Glenn returned to space on the Space Shuttle on October 29, 1998, as a Payload Specialist on Discovery. According to The New York Times, Glenn [...] "won his seat on the Shuttle flight by lobbying NASA for two years to fly as a human guinea pig for geriatric studies"; this was cited as the main reason for his participation in the mission. Shortly before the flight, researchers disqualified Glenn from one of the flight's two major human experiments (on the effect of melatonin) due to undisclosed medical reasons; he participated in experiments on sleep monitoring and protein use.|$|E

2500|$|Serious {{concerns}} about the security implications of using conventional biometric templates in schools have been raised {{by a number of}} leading IT security experts, one of whom has voiced the opinion that [...] "it is absolutely premature to begin using 'conventional biometrics' in schools". The vendors of biometric systems claim that their products bring benefits to schools such as improved reading skills, decreased wait times in lunch lines and increased revenues. They do not cite independent research to support this view. One education specialist wrote in 2007: [...] "I {{have not been able to}} find a single piece of published research which suggests that the use of <b>biometrics</b> in schools promotes healthy eating or improves reading skills amongst children... There is absolutely no evidence for such claims". The Ottawa Police in Canada have advised parents who fear their children may be kidnapped, to fingerprint their children.|$|E
2500|$|Karl Pearson was {{important}} in {{the founding of the}} school of <b>biometrics,</b> which was a competing theory to describe evolution and population inheritance {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. His series of eighteen papers, [...] "Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution" [...] established him as the founder of the biometrical school for inheritance. In fact, Pearson devoted much time during 1893 to 1904 to developing statistical techniques for biometry. These techniques, which are widely used today for statistical analysis, include the chi-squared test, standard deviation, and correlation and regression coefficients. Pearson's Law of Ancestral Heredity stated that germ plasm consisted of heritable elements inherited from the parents as well as from more distant ancestors, the proportion of which varied for different traits. Karl Pearson was a follower of Galton, and although the two differed in some respects, Pearson used a substantial amount of Francis Galton's statistical concepts in his formulation of the biometrical school for inheritance, such as the law of regression. The biometric school, unlike the Mendelians, focused not on providing a mechanism for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance that was not causal in nature. While Galton proposed a discontinuous theory of evolution, in which species would have to change via large jumps rather than small changes that built up over time, Pearson pointed out flaws in Galton's argument and actually used Galton's ideas to further a continuous theory of evolution, whereas the Mendelian's favored a discontinuous theory of evolution. While Galton focused primarily on the application of statistical methods to the study of heredity, Pearson and his colleague Weldon expanded statistical reasoning to the fields of inheritance, variation, correlation, and natural and sexual selection.|$|E
60|$|To {{all these}} blunders and ignorances doctors {{are no less}} subject {{than the rest of}} us. They are not trained in the use of evidence, nor in <b>biometrics,</b> nor in the {{psychology}} of human credulity, nor in the incidence of economic pressure. Further, they must believe, on the whole, what their patients believe, just as they must wear the sort of hat their patients wear. The doctor may lay down the law despotically enough to the patient at points where the patient's mind is simply blank; but when the patient has a prejudice the doctor must either keep it in countenance or lose his patient. If people are persuaded that night air is dangerous to health and that fresh air makes them catch cold it will not be possible for a doctor to make his living in private practice if he prescribes ventilation. We have to go back no further than the days of The Pickwick Papers to find ourselves in a world where people slept in four-post beds with curtains drawn closely round to exclude as much air as possible. Had Mr. Pickwick's doctor told him that he would be much healthier if he slept on a camp bed by an open window, Mr. Pickwick would have regarded him as a crank and called in another doctor. Had he gone on to forbid Mr. Pickwick to drink brandy and water whenever he felt chilly, and assured him that if he were deprived of meat or salt for a whole year, he would not only not die, but would be none the worse, Mr. Pickwick would have fled from his presence as from that of a dangerous madman. And in these matters the doctor cannot cheat his patient. If he has no faith in drugs or vaccination, and the patient has, he can cheat him with colored water and pass his lancet through the flame of a spirit lamp before scratching his arm. But he cannot make him change his daily habits without knowing it.|$|E
