5|$|A 2004 {{statement}} by the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society (for children) uses slightly different cutoffs, where mild DKA is defined by pH7.20–7.30 (<b>bicarbonate</b> 10–15mmol/l), moderate DKA by pH7.1–7.2 (<b>bicarbonate</b> 5–10) and severe DKA by pH<7.1 (<b>bicarbonate</b> below 5).|$|E
5|$|Lactic {{acidosis}} {{is initially}} treated with sodium <b>bicarbonate,</b> although high doses are not recommended, as this may increase intracellular acidosis. Acidosis {{that does not}} respond to administration of sodium <b>bicarbonate</b> may require further management with standard hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration.|$|E
5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali <b>bicarbonate.</b> This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, <b>bicarbonate</b> stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} <b>bicarbonates</b> include NH4HCO3,Ca(HCO3)3,KHCO3, andNaHCO3.|$|R

5000|$|Nervousness {{in concert}} {{situations}} {{can also lead}} to xerostomia, but more importantly nervousness can cause rapid breathing. This increases carbon dioxide (CO2 [...] ) flow out of the body and causes respiratory alkalosis. The decrease in CO2 affects the amount of <b>bicarbonates</b> available. Salivary <b>bicarbonates</b> are synthesized from CO2. The less CO2 available, the fewer <b>bicarbonates</b> can be synthesized; therefore, the pH drops. Under this condition it is wise to use salival flow stimulants. Continually changing the pH environment the reed encounters damages the reed. If the pH level inside the mouth can be kept at rehearsal level, the life of the reed will increase.|$|R

5|$|Kidneys: renal tubular {{acidosis}} (Type 2), {{a disorder}} of <b>bicarbonate</b> handling by the proximal tubules leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), a weakening of bones (due to calcium and phosphate loss), and occasionally aminoaciduria (loss of essential amino acids needed for protein synthesis).|$|E
5|$|Ordinary white {{powdered}} {{zinc oxide}} {{can be produced}} in the laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium <b>bicarbonate</b> with a zinc anode. Zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas are produced. The zinc hydroxide upon heating decomposes to zinc oxide.|$|E

5|$|This {{equation}} {{suggests that}} the best solvent for the uranium carbonate processing {{is a mixture of}} carbonate with <b>bicarbonate.</b> At high pH, this results in precipitation of diuranate, which is treated with hydrogen in the presence of nickel yielding an insoluble uranium tetracarbonate.|$|E
5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into <b>bicarbonate</b> and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, <b>bicarbonate</b> and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and <b>bicarbonate</b> are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E
5|$|Early {{treatment}} {{increases the}} chance of a good outcome. Treatment consists of stabilizing the person, followed by the use of an antidote. The preferred antidote is fomepizole with ethanol used if this is not available. Hemodialysis may also be used in those where there is organ damage or a high degree of acidosis. Other treatments may include sodium <b>bicarbonate,</b> thiamine, and magnesium.|$|E

5|$|Gastric acid acts as {{a barrier}} against {{microorganisms}} to prevent infections and {{is important for the}} digestion of food. Its low pH denatures proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as pepsin. The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin by self-cleavage. After leaving the stomach, the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the duodenum by sodium <b>bicarbonate.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} stages, {{electrolyte}} levels are often abnormal and require correction. High potassium levels can be life-threatening, {{and respond to}} increased urine production and renal replacement therapy (see below). Temporary measures include the administration of calcium to protect against cardiac complications, insulin or salbutamol to redistribute potassium into cells, and infusions of <b>bicarbonate</b> solution.|$|E
5|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin, {{has been}} shown to improve the {{ventilatory}} response, but this has been poorly studied and is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Similarly, the drug acetazolamide can reduce <b>bicarbonate</b> levels, and thereby augment to normal ventilatory response, but this has been researched insufficiently to recommend wide application.|$|E
50|$|The excess {{soda ash}} after precipitating the calcium and {{magnesium}} salts is in carbonates & <b>bicarbonates</b> of sodium which imparts high pH or alkalinity to soil water.|$|R
50|$|The {{man-made}} {{cause is}} {{the application of}} softened water in irrigation (surface or ground water) containing relatively high proportion of sodium <b>bicarbonates</b> and less calcium and magnesium.|$|R
30|$|The {{waters of}} the estuary are very anchors. The pH is about 8, due to the buffer system {{developed}} by carbonates and <b>bicarbonates</b> {{that are important in}} this environment.|$|R
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium <b>bicarbonate</b> and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The stomach {{itself is}} {{protected}} from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick mucus layer, and by secretin induced buffering with sodium <b>bicarbonate.</b> Heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail. Drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in the stomach, and antacids are used to neutralize existing acid.|$|E
5|$|Water is {{the main}} {{ingredient}} of beer, accounting for 93% of its weight. Though water itself is, ideally, flavorless, its level of dissolved minerals, specifically, <b>bicarbonate</b> ion, does influence beer's finished taste. Due to the mineral properties of each region's water, specific areas were originally the sole producers of certain types of beer, each identifiable by regional characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} (CIN) {{can contribute}} to acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm surgery. We evaluated the incidence of AKI together with the evolution of early biomarkers of renal injury in patients receiving <b>bicarbonates</b> or NaCl 0. 9 %. Methods. This study involved endovascular aortic aneurysm surgery patients. Group A (n= 17) received <b>bicarbonates</b> 3 [*]mL/kg/h for 1 [*]h before the procedure and then 1 [*]mL/kg/h until 6 [*]h after surgery, whereas group B (n= 17) received NaCl 0. 9 % using the same protocol. Biomarkers of renal injury from urine (interleukin- 18 (IL- 18), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM- 1)) and blood (NGAL, cystatin C) were measured at baseline and 3, 24, and 48 [*]h postoperatively. Results. AKI occurred in 1 patient (2. 9 %), in the <b>bicarbonates</b> group. IL- 18, NAG, NGAL, and KIM- 1 significantly rose in both groups after the surgery. There was a greater rise in NGAL and IL- 18 after 3 [*]h in the <b>bicarbonates</b> versus NaCl 0. 9 % group: 1115 % versus 240 % increase (P= 0. 03) and 338 % increase versus 1. 4 % decrease (P= 0. 01). Conclusions. Despite significant elevation in biomarkers of renal injury, we demonstrated a low rate of AKI following endovascular aortic surgery...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  1, body {{temperatures}} decreased very rapidly after TLV initiation {{as compared to}} LPV. This {{was associated with a}} decreased heart rate, as well as improved systemic arterial pressure. Mean arterial pressure achieved 74 [*]±[*] 9 versus 56 [*]±[*] 8  mmHg {{at the end of the}} procedure period in the TLV vs. LPV groups (p[*]<[*] 0.05), respectively. As shown in Table  2, the drop in <b>bicarbonates</b> arterial levels was also significantly attenuated by hypothermia in the TLV group as compared to LPV. <b>Bicarbonates</b> arterial levels achieved 31 [*]±[*] 2 versus 24 [*]±[*] 2  mmol/l in TLV versus LPV at the end of the protocol (p[*]=[*] 0.007).|$|R
50|$|Normally, saliva is {{slightly}} acidic {{and has a}} pH less than 7, but it can vary between 6 and 8. The pH inside the mouth depends on the salival flow rate because the higher the flow rate of saliva the more salival <b>bicarbonates</b> are present. <b>Bicarbonates</b> in the saliva raise the pH inside the mouth. When there is no or low saliva flow, also known as xerostomia, the pH inside the mouth is around 6. When salival flow rate is high the pH is about 8. During a concert, if a musician is suffering from xerostomia, also known as dry mouth, the saliva pH {{is expected to be}} acidic.|$|R
5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of <b>bicarbonate</b> to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that <b>bicarbonate</b> has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E
5|$|A United States Geological Survey {{report in}} the 1960s {{measured}} the concentration of <b>bicarbonate</b> in Mud Creek to range from 41 to 109 milligrams per liter, {{but there were no}} carbonates in the water. The creek's nitrate concentration ranged from 3.3 to 6.3 milligrams per liter for filtered water and the concentration of sulfates ranged from 23 to 29 milligrams per liter, again for filtered water. The concentration of chlorides in the creek's filtered waters ranged from 7 to 23 milligrams per liter. The calcium and magnesium concentrations in filtered water were 20 to 44 and 4.4 to 6 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium <b>bicarbonate</b> washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of CO 2 and CO {{was investigated}} on a pure γ-Al 2 O 3 support material {{that has been}} used in Pd and Ru catalysts for the reduction of CO 2. The adsorption of CO 2 resulted in the formation of carbonates, <b>bicarbonates</b> and linearly adsorbed CO 2 species. The amount {{and the nature of the}} adsorbed species were dependent on the annealing temperature of the alumina support. On γ-Al 2 O 3 annealed at 473 K mostly <b>bicarbonates</b> formed, while no adsorbed CO 2 was seen on this highly hydroxylated surface. With increasing calcination temperature the amount of both surface carbonates and linearly adsorbed CO 2 increased, but still the most abundant surface species were <b>bicarbonates.</b> Surface carbonates and adsorbed CO 2 can readily be removed from the alumina surface, while <b>bicarbonates</b> are stable to elevated temperatures. The interaction of CO with γ-Al 2 O 3 is much weaker than that of CO 2. At room temperature CO adsorbs only on Lewis acid sites, and can be readily removed by evacuation. At 100 K CO can probe different defect sites on the alumina surface. Under no conditions we have observed the formation of any carbonates or <b>bicarbonates</b> upon the interaction of CO with the pure alumina support. In co-adsorption experiments CO competes for adsorption sites with the linearly adsorbed CO 2 on the 773 K-annealed γ-Al 2 O 3 surface, but it does not result in the desorption of CO 2, rather in the increased production of weakly held carbonates. After the removal of adsorbed CO, CO 2 moves back to its original adsorption sites, i. e., Lewis acidic Al 3 + centers. The exposure of a CO 2 -saturated γ-Al 2 O 3 to H 2 O did not affect any of the adsorbed surface species. The findings of this study will be used to rationalize the results of our ongoing in situ and in operando studies on the reduction of CO 2 on supported Pd and Ru catalysts. close 0...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} study {{was carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of different land uses on the water quality of Ruo River. Water sampling was done both in the upper and the middle sections of the river. The water samples were analysed for pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), sulphates, chloride, <b>bicarbonates,</b> nitrates, phosphates, fluoride, sodium, potassium, cadmium and Escherichia coli using standard methods. Land uses in the area significantly affected the concentration of EC, TDS, sulphates, potassium and sodium (p ≤ 0. 05) while pH, dissolved oxygen, chloride, <b>bicarbonates,</b> nitrates, phosphates and E-coli did not significantly fluctuate with land use changes in the area (p ≥ 0. 05). The effect of seasons was significant on pH, dissolved oxygen, phosphates, chloride, <b>bicarbonates</b> and sodium (p ≤ 0. 05) but not on electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, sulphates, nitrates, lead, potassium and e coli in Ruo River. The research recommends an integrated water resources management approach where all users and relevant stakeholders should take an active role in the conservation of Ruo River catchment in order to avoid further degradation of the catchment through different land uses...|$|R
