[...] While in Dayton, Donahue also hosted Conversation Piece, a phone-in afternoon talk show from 1963 to 1967 on WHIO radio. In Dayton, Donahue interviewed presidential candidate John F.

In Chicago and New York City, Donahue interviewed Elton John, heavyweight boxing champions Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, and author and political activist Noam Chomsky.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a system that}} is being developed for the recognition of the handwritten legal amount in Brazilian <b>bank</b> <b>checks.</b> Our strategy used to approach the handwritten legal amount recognition problem puts on evidence the key-words: "mil", "reais/real", "centavos/centavo" which are almost always present in each amount. The recognizer, based on Hidden Markov Models, does a global word analysis, therefore, it doesn't carry out an explicit segmentation of words into characters or pseudo-characters. In this context, each word image is transformed into a sequence of observations using pre-processing and feature extraction stages. Our system, when tested on our database simulating Brazilian <b>bank</b> <b>checks,</b> shows the viability of our approach...|$|R

50|$|Before the Civil War (1861 to 1865), silver coins {{were legal}} tender {{only up to}} the sum of $5. Before 1853, when U.S. silver coins were reduced in weight 7%, coins had exactly their value in metal (from 1830 to 1852). Two silver 50 cent coins had exactly $1 worth of silver. A gold U.S. dollar of 1849 had $1 worth of gold. With the flood of gold {{coming out of the}} California mines in the early 1850s, the price of silver rose (gold went down). Thus, 50 cent coins of 1840 to 1852 were worth 53 cents if melted down. The {{government}} could increase the value of the gold coins (expensive) or reduce the size of all U.S. silver coins. With the reduction of 1853, a 50-cent coin now had only 48 cents of silver. This is the reason for the $5 limit of silver coins as legal tender; paying somebody $100 in the new silver coins would be giving them $96 worth of silver.
