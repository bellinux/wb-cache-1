The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the teat end health and <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance of two experimental heptanoic acid based teat dips vs the commercial product Remain Gold ® using a split udder design during the winter season under best management winter milking practices. The experimental heptanoic acid teat dips KX- 6185 and KX- 6186 showed similar teat end health and teat <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> to Remain Gold under winter conditions. Marked changes in teat end scores were measured over time and over periods as short as days. On the other hand, product treatment comparisons frequently showed parallel trends in score averages. This illustrates the importance of a split udder design to evaluate <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance. The split udder design minimizes the risk of experimental bias due to cow and environmental factors. Most reported teat skin studies rely on comparing teat dips in separate cow groups with little consideration to group balancing even though factors such as hyperkeratosis is known to be affected by cow age and lactation stage. This study illustrates the high risk of traditional design skin toleration studies inaccurately attributing effects to teat dips...|$|R

50|$|At highest {{concentrations}} (50-70%) {{applied for}} 3 to 8 minutes {{under the supervision}} of a physician, glycolic acid promotes slitting between the cells and can be used to treat acne or photo-damaged skin (e.g. due to mottled dyspigmentation, melasma). The benefit of such short-contact application (chemical peels) depends on the pH of the solution (the more acidic the product, or the lower the pH, the more pronounced the results), the concentration of GA (higher concentrations produce more vigorous response), the length of application and prior <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> such as prior use of topical vitamin A products. Although single application of 50-70% GA will produce beneficial results, multiple treatments every 2 to 4 weeks are required for optimal results.

The comprehensive and thoroughly up-to-date handbook presents the sources, identification, analysis, biosynthesis, biotechnology and applications of important polysaccharides likes starches, cellulose, chitin, gum and microbial polysaccharides. Polysaccharides can exhibit complex structure and various functional activities. These bio macromolecules can therefore serve as raw materials for various different materials, e. g. rayon, cellulose acetate, celluloid and nitrocellulose; and they find multiple applications, for instance as surgical threads (chitin), as sources of energy, dietary fibers, as blood flow adjuvants, in cosmetics, emulsion stabilizers, film formers, binders, viscosity increasing agents or <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> agenta, as food additives in gums, chewing gum bases and as vaccines. Polysaccharides form the basis for useful products, like xanthan gum, dextran, welan gum, gellan gum, diutan gum and pullulan. Some of the polysaccharide-derived products have interesting and useful properties and show biological activities, such as immunomodulatory, antibacterial, anti-mutagenic, radioprotective, anti-oxidative, anti-ulcer, antidepressant, anti-septicaemic or anti-inflammatory activities.

With our method, users can construct the skeleton in a short time, and bring a static model both dynamic and alive. The primary steps of our method are finding skeleton joints, connecting the joints to form the animation skeleton, and <b>binding</b> <b>skin</b> vertices to the joints. Initially, a repulsive force field is constructed inside a given model, {{and a set of}} points with local minimal force magnitude are found based on the force field. Then, a modified thinning algorithm for volume data is applied, so that the thinning process will stop at those already found local minimum points. Referring to the topological information, we define the skeleton joints and connect them to form the skeleton. After construct-ing the skeleton, we anchoring skin vertices to the skele-ton joints according to the distances between vertices and joints. In order to compute the repulsive force, hundreds of rays are sampled from a position inside the model, and the computation of the intersection points takes most of the time. Therefore, an octree structure is used to accelerate the joints finding process.

To examine this issue more directly, we analyzed the S. aureus <b>binding</b> characteristics of <b>skin</b> in mice undergoing different T helper type 1 cell versus T helper type 2 cell inflammatory responses using a novel in vitro bacterial binding assay. BALB/C female mice were first sensitized to ovalbumin with alum or ovalbumin with complete Freund's adjuvant to induce T helper type 2 or T helper type 1 responses, respectively. Mice were then challenged intradermally with either saline (control) or ovalbumin. Forty-eight hours later, skin specimens were obtained from the challenge sites, and the number of S. aureus <b>binding</b> to each <b>skin</b> section was quantitated. Bacterial binding was found to be significantly greater at skin sites of BALB/C mice that had been ovalbumin/alum sensitized compared with ovalbumin/complete Freund's adjuvant sensitized (p[*]≤[*] 0. 01). When compared to the ovalbumin sensitized/challenged skin of wild type BALB/C mice or interferon-γ gene knockout mice, interleukin- 4, but not interferon-γ, gene knockout mice had significantly less S. aureus binding at their ovalbumin sensitized/challenged skin sites. Mutant S. aureus strains that lacked either fibronectin- or fibrinogen-binding protein expression showed significantly reduced S. aureus binding compared with the parent wild type strain (p <  0. 005). Moreover, preincubation of the wild type bacteria with fibronectin or fibrinogen, but not collagen, resulted in significantly less <b>skin</b> <b>binding</b> of S. aureus (p <  0. 01). Incubation of skin with interleukin- 4, and less so with interferon-γ, led to more binding of wild type S. aureus but not of an S. aureus mutant deficient in fibronectin binding protein expression. After interleukin- 4 incubation, but not interferon-γ, epidermal immunoreactivity for fibronectin was observed in murine skin explants.

The effect of variables relevant to cleansing such as solution pH, temperature, and contact time on surfactant binding has been determined. The binding of laurate, oleate, and SDS is significantly higher than that of SLI. The extent of binding correlates with their expected irritation potential measured by the zein solubilization technique {{as well as with the}} published results of irritation to skin of cleansing bars based on these surfactants. The reasons for the increased binding of surfactants above their CMC are examined. It is also shown that SLI <b>binding</b> to <b>skin</b> is dependent on the solution pH, exhibiting a minimum in binding in the pH 7 to 9 region...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} review article it is {{suggested}} that fear is a central emotional state that can be activated by external threat cues. The subcortical defensive system cannot only be activated by intrinsically aversive events but shows also strong plasticity enabling previously innocuous stimuli to get access to the fear system after they were paired with painful outcomes. On the other hand, aversive conditioning does not only result in the acquisition of a defensive disposition, the organism also learns on a pure cognitive level that one stimulus predicts the occurrence of another stimulus. It is suggested here that potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex is a rather specific measure for fear acquisition, while skin conductance discrimination indexes contingency learning. It is shown that the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle does not require cortical processing of the conditioned stimulus. Moreover, data indicate that conditioned startle potentiation is abolished in patients with unilateral lesions of the amygdala. Finally, conditioned startle potentiation can be obtained without contingency awareness, which on the other hand is necessary for <b>skin</b> conductance <b>conditioning</b> to occur. It is suggested that the learning of stimulus relations is mediated by the hippocampus and that conditioned startle potentiation is also mediated by the hippocampus in trace conditioning...|$|R
