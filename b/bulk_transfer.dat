40|$|Abstractâ€”The Internet is {{witnessing}} {{explosive growth}} in traffic, {{in large part}} due to <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers.</b> Delivering such traffic is expensive for ISPs because they pay other ISPs based on peak utilization. To limit costs, many ISPs are deploying ad-hoc traffic shaping policies that specifically target bulk flows. However, there is relatively little understanding today {{about the effectiveness of}} different shaping policies at reducing peak loads and what impact these policies have on the performance of <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers.</b> In this paper, we compare several traffic shaping policies with respect to (1) the achieved reduction in peak network traffic and (2) the resulting performance loss for <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers.</b> We identified a practical policy that achieves peak traffic reductions of up to 50 % with only limited performance loss for <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers.</b> However, we found that the same policy leads to large performance losses for <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers</b> when deployed by multiple ISPs along a networking path. Our analysis revealed that this is caused by certain TCP characteristics and differences in local peak utilization times. I...|$|R

The BECN mechanism has previously been used in non-IP networks, {{but there has been}} limited experimental investigation into the application of the BECN scheme as congestion control mechanism in IP networks. In this paper, we consider an enhanced algorithm for BECN which uses Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Source Quenches for backward congestion notification in IP networks and undertake comparative performance evaluation of Random Early Detection (RED), Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) and our enhanced BECN mechanism using both longlived TCP <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers</b> and short-lived webtraffic workloads. Our results show that for webtraffic workloads, BECN offers only slight improvement in transfer delay while average goodput for <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers</b> is no worse than that of ECN. For paths that have a high bandwidth delay product our results show that not only can BECN offer significant improvement in average goodput for <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers</b> over the ECN mechanism, but packet drops and transfer delay for short-lived webtraffic connections are also comparatively reduced. Additional observations show that on such paths TCP (NewReno) with RED can offer higher goodput for <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers</b> compared to ECN...|$|R

40|$|Tor is {{vulnerable}} to network congestion and performance problems due to <b>bulk</b> data <b>transfers.</b> A large fraction of the available network capacity is consumed by {{a small percentage of}} Tor users, resulting in severe service degradation for the majority. Bulk users continuously drain relays of excess bandwidth, creating new network bottlenecks and exacerbating the effects of existing ones. While this problem may currently be attributed to rational users utilizing the network, it may also be exploited by a relatively low-resource adversary using similar techniques to contribute to a network denial of service (DoS) attack. Degraded service discourages the use of Tor, affecting both Torâ€™s client diversity and anonymity. Equipped with mechanisms from communication networks, we design and implement three Tor-specific algorithms that throttle <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers</b> to reduce network congestion and increase network responsiveness. Unlike existing techniques, our algorithms adapt to network dynamics using only information local to a relay. We experiment with full-network deployments of our algorithms under a range of light to heavy network loads. We find that throttling results in significant improvements to web client performance while mitigating the negative effects of <b>bulk</b> <b>transfers.</b> We also analyze how throttling affects anonymity and compare the security of our algorithms under adversarial attack. We find that throttling reduces information leakage compared to unthrottled Tor while improving anonymity against realistic adversaries. ...|$|R

50|$|A bulk sale, {{sometimes}} called a <b>bulk</b> <b>transfer,</b> {{is when a}} business sells all or nearly all of its inventory to a single buyer and such a sale {{is not part of}} the ordinary course of business. This type of action is often used in an attempt to dodge creditors who intend to seize such business's inventory; in order to protect the purchaser from claims made by creditors of the seller, the seller must usually complete an affidavit outlining its secured and unsecured creditors, which must usually be filed with a government department, such as a court office. Such procedures are outlined in the bulk sales act of most jurisdictions. If the buyer does not complete the registration process for a bulk sale, creditors of the seller may obtain a declaration that the sale was invalid against the creditors and the creditors may take possession of the goods or obtain judgment for any proceeds the buyer received from a subsequent sale.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a set of}} feasible extensions for the low power, low delay ORW routing protocol. It introduces the capability of handling multiple concurrent bulk transfers including various application scenarios, e. g., cross traffic. The extensions added to the ORW protocol include a collision avoidance method applied beside thealready existing, well functioning collision detection technique. This collision avoidance method reduced the overuse of the ORW protocolâ€™s collision detection method from a per packet basis to a per <b>bulk</b> <b>transfer</b> basis. This reduction {{in the frequency of}} collisions allowed a significant improvement in all the metrics in general, but especially in the transmission time and power consumption. Using the collision avoidance extension a <b>bulk</b> <b>transfer</b> was performed in a fraction of the time that would needed for a <b>bulk</b> <b>transfer</b> using the ORW base protocol, while the power consumed during this fraction of time was less accordingly. The second extensionâ€™s purpose was to stabilize the EDC routing metric used by the ORW protocol to estimate the duty-cycles needed for a packet to reach the sink from the given node. This extension was relevant in certain scenarios with high intra-path interference stemming from the high number of hops in the paths between the source and the sink nodes. The third, and last, extension forbade the duty-cycling during a <b>bulk</b> <b>transfer</b> for the nodes that were involved in the given <b>bulk</b> <b>transfer.</b> This extension aimed to mitigate the performance degradation that occurred at the case when a given node terminated its duty-cycle notwithstanding that an other node was sending packets to this given node. By applying these extensions it was possible to reach an almost 500 % increase in the throughput with less than 25 % of the power consumption during a <b>bulk</b> <b>transfer</b> on the Indriya testbed...|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{steady-state}} {{performance of}} a <b>bulk</b> <b>transfer</b> TCP flow (i. e., a flow with {{a large amount of}} data to send, such as FTP transfers) may be characterized by the send rate, which is the amount of data sent by the sender in unit time. In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady-state send rate as a function of loss rate and round trip time (RTT) for a <b>bulk</b> <b>transfer</b> TCP flow. Unlike the models in [7]â€“[9], and [12], our model captures not only the behavior of the fast retransmit mechanism but also the effect of the time-out mechanism. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more time-out events than fast retransmit events. Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP send rate and is accurate over a wider range of loss rates. We also present a simple extension of our model to compute the throughput of a <b>bulk</b> <b>transfer</b> TCP flow, which is defined as the amount of data received by the receiver in unit time.
