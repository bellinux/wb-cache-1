To save costs, the endurance requirements were relaxed, allowing the new aircraft to retain the four JT3D (US Military designation TF33) engines. IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer receiving the designation 4PI, and the software is written in JOVIAL.

25|$|One of the astronauts' tasks was publicity; {{they gave}} {{interviews}} {{to the press}} and visited project manufacturing facilities to speak with those who worked on Project Mercury. To make their travels easier, they requested and got jet fighters for personal use. The press was especially fond of John Glenn, who was considered the best speaker of the seven. They sold their personal stories to Life magazine which portrayed them as patriotic, God-fearing family men. Life was also allowed to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> with the families while the astronauts were in space. During the project, Grissom, Carpenter, Cooper, Schirra and Slayton stayed with their families at or near Langley Air Force Base; Glenn lived at the base and visited his family in Washington DC on weekends.

25|$|Israel is {{emerging}} as a popular destination for medical tourists. In 2006, 15,000 foreigners travelled to the country for medical procedures, bringing in $40 million of revenue. The advantages of Israel for health tourism include good natural resources; stable, comfortable climate all year round; a progressive medical systems, and scenic locations which have a calming effect on patients. Medical tourists choose Israel for several reasons. Some come from European nations such as Romania where certain procedures are not available. Others come to Israel, most commonly from the United States, because they can receive quality health care {{at a fraction of}} the cost it would <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> for both surgeries and in-vitro fertilization treatments. Other medical tourists come to Israel to visit the Dead Sea, a world-famous therapeutic resort.

500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance began with Gaga lying on the floor, on a set that was described as an ornate mansion. Gaga staggered across the stage and pirouetted behind a dancer in a lily-white wheelchair. She {{made her way to}} a white grand piano which she played by placing one foot up on the keyboard. Once again, she staggered across the stage, with theatrical blood dripping from her ribcage. She collapsed on the stage wailing in agony as one of the dancers gently lifted her. Gaga then hung liflessly with one hand rising above her dancers and blood smeared on her face with a golden halo being projected on the screen behind her. The ending climax of the performance pays homage to a similar-sounding ending climax in [...] "A Day In The Life" [...] by The Beatles. She later commented that the performance was for her fans: [...] "I wanted to say something honest and real and not just give a performance where I was jacking off on stage the whole time about my record," [...] It was really for my fans, who I knew would <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> cheering and swooning."

500|$|... "The Party Song" [...] was {{inspired}} by when Hoppus attended a [...] "jock-infested" [...] party at San Diego State University and met some students who thought highly of themselves. Disinterested in the party, he felt he would much rather <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> which {{found its way into}} the song's lyrics. [...] "Mutt" [...] was written by DeLonge for his friend Benji Weatherly and his appearance in the Taylor Steele surf video The Show. An early version of [...] "Mutt", with Scott Raynor behind the drum kit, was recorded with producer Mark Trombino and appears on the film's 1998 soundtrack. The title of [...] "Wendy Clear" [...] comes from Hoppus' boat, named [...] "Wendy," [...] and how boaters end transmissions by letting other boaters know the channel is open for use, or [...] "clear". Hoppus wrote the song while on tour with MxPx about having a crush on [...] "someone that you are not supposed to like." [...] Lastly, [...] "Anthem," [...] the final song on Enema of the State, is about being trapped in the suburbs, longing for freedom and the age of 21. It is based on when DeLonge was in high school and told his peers that his band would be playing at a friend's house. The party was later busted by the police and a [...] "giant fight broke out." [...] Hoppus felt it a perfect summary of the album's themes: [...] "lots of youthful angst, energy, and suburban unrest." ...|$|E
