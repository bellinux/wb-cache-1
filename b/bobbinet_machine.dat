50|$|The lace curtain machine, is a lace {{machine that}} {{was invented by}} John Livesey in Nottingham in 1846. It was an {{adaptation}} of John Heathcoat's <b>bobbinet</b> <b>machine.</b> It made the miles of curtaining which screened Victorian and later windows.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bobbinet</b> <b>machines</b> {{were invented}} in 1808 by John Heathcoat. He studied the hand {{movements}} of a Northamptonshire manual lace maker and reproduced {{them in the}} roller-locker machine. The 1809 version of this machine (patent no.3216) {{became known as the}} Old Loughborough, it was 18 in wide and was designed for use with cotton.|$|R
5000|$|The {{forerunner of}} the <b>Bobbinet</b> <b>machines</b> was the 1589 {{stocking}} frame, a weaving frame {{fitted with a}} bar of bearded needles that passed back and forth, {{to and from the}} operator. There was no warp. The beards were simultaneously depressed by a presser bar catching the weft and holding it back a course making a row of loops. After Strutt had modified the machine in 1759 to do ribbing, Hammond in 1764 used a tickler stick to transfer the loops 2 or 3 gaits sideways, and mechanic lace making was born. [...] There was no carriage, no comb and the operations continued to be done in sequence by the operator.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bobbinet</b> <b>machine,</b> {{invented by}} John Heathcoat in Loughborough, Leicestershire, in 1808, makes a perfect copy of Lille or East Midlands net (fond simple, a six-sided net with four sides twisted, two crossed). The machine uses flat round bobbins in {{carriages}} {{to pass through}} and round vertical threads.|$|E
5000|$|The highpoint of lacemaking {{was from}} the late 17th century through the 18th century. However, the {{invention}} of the <b>bobbinet</b> <b>machine</b> in nearby Nottingham meant that machine-made lace could be made far cheaper. The patterns of the hand-made lace changed to simpler styles to compete, and this became the modern Bedfordshire lace.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bobbinet</b> <b>machine</b> is a plain-net lacemaking machine invented and {{patented}} by John Heathcoat in 1808 (patent no. 3151), {{and with a}} slight modification it was patented again in 1809 (patent no. 3216). This machine {{was known as the}} Old Loughborough. Heathcoat continued to improve his machine. There were many breaches of his patent. The 'Circular' was an improvement, designed in 1824, by William Morley (patent no.4921). As it gained ascendency, its distinctive name was dropped; it became the bobbinet and Heathcoats machíne the Old Loughborough.|$|E
5000|$|Bobbinet tulle or genuine tulle is a {{specific}} type of tulle which has been made in the United Kingdom since the invention of the <b>bobbinet</b> <b>machine</b> [...] Heathcoat coined the term [...] "bobbin net", or bobbinet as it is spelled today, to distinguish this machine-made tulle from the handmade [...] "pillow lace". Pillow lace, called so because of the pillow used to produce handmade bobbin lace. Machines based on his original designs are still in operation today producing fabrics in Perry Street, Chard, Somerset, UK.|$|E
50|$|The Old Loughborough {{became the}} {{standard}} lacemaking machine, particularly the 1820 form {{known as the}} Circular producing two-twist plain net. The smooth, unpatterned tulle produced on these machines was {{on a par with}} real, handmade lace net. Heathcoat’s <b>bobbinet</b> <b>machine</b> is so ingeniously designed that the ones used today have suffered little alteration. However during the next 30 years inventors were patenting improvements to their machines. The ones that stand out are the Pusher machine, the Levers machine (now spelled Leavers) and the Nottingham lace curtain machine. Each of these developed into separate machines. Others were the Traverse Warp machine and the Straight Bolt machine.|$|E
