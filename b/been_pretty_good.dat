2500|$|Underwood {{has been}} highly {{acclaimed}} for her vocal talents. David Wild of Rolling Stone has praised her voice, saying that [...] "she can hit any note". Her vocal range {{has been described}} as [...] "enormous", with critics highlighting her ability to hold notes {{for an extended period of}} time. Billboard describes her vocal ability as [...] "freakish". Concert critics have pointed out that [...] "she’ll let loose with an improbably long note that runs through more octaves than you knew existed". When asked if it ever becomes difficult to belt at such high intensity during her 90–120 minute live shows, Underwood responded, [...] "I'm too proud to drop keys. I won't do it. Maybe the older I get, I'll write some songs in lower keys so it'll be easier. I've always <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> as far as stamina onstage. Being able to work out and stay physically strong is important... So far, it's worked for me. I'm just blessed at being able to be loud for long periods of time." [...] Fellow country music singer Randy Travis paid high praises to Underwood's voice when asked about her cover of his 1988 hit song [...] "I Told You So", saying that [...] "her voice is so much better suited to the song. I have a baritone voice, and her soprano voice really fits well with the range of the song. Her ability to get into the upper register of her voice and just hold those high notes is great." [...] Her voice has also been praised as [...] "versatile". She has indeed performed live versions of gospel songs like [...] "How Great Thou Art", in which Yahoo! critics noticed her ability to move an audience with a [...] "powerful performance", and Rock songs like Guns N' Roses' [...] "Paradise City", with Rolling Stone critics saying it was a [...] "standout performance", adding that [...] "when the song reached its crescendo, the singer went right over the edge with it, twirling like a tornado and tossing in more than a few banshee wails" [...] and even saying [...] "if the original members of Guns N' Roses ever wanted to reunite without Axl Rose, they might be wise to ask Carrie Underwood to fill his bandana".|$|E

I don't say this to praise myself: it's my trade; it's what I'm paid for, and trained for, and brought up to.

6000|$|Such {{being the}} case, {{we are in}} a {{position}} to form a safe judgment of the limits within which the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth must have been confined. Ecclesiastical authority would have us believe that the words which are given at the end of the first Gospel, [...] "Go ye, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost," [...] are part of the last commands of Jesus, issued at the moment of his parting with the eleven. If so, Peter and John must have heard these words; they are too plain to be misunderstood; and the occasion is too solemn for them ever to be forgotten. Yet the [...] "Acts" [...] tell us that Peter needed a vision to enable him so much as to baptize Cornelius; and Paul, in the Galatians, knows nothing of words which would have completely borne him out as against those who, though they heard, must be supposed to have either forgotten or ignored them. On the other hand, Peter and John, who are supposed to have heard the [...] "Sermon on the Mount," [...] know nothing of the saying that Jesus had not come to destroy the Law, but that every jot and tittle of the Law must be fulfilled, which surely would have <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> evidence for their view of the question. {440} ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it does nominally," [...] {{the other}} said. [...] "All {{the country as}} far as that was {{declared}} to be forfeited; but in point of fact the Kaffirs remained in possession of their lands on condition that they declared their allegiance to the Crown, and that each chief was made responsible for any cattle or other robberies, the spoor of which could be traced to his kraal. Of course they agreed to this, as, in fact, they would agree to anything, resolving, naturally, to break the conditions as soon as it suited them. Local magistrates and commissioners are scattered about among them, and {{there have been a lot}} of schools and missionary stations started. They say that they are having great success. Well, we shall see about that. In the last war the so-called Christian natives were among the first to turn against us, and I expect it will be the same here, for it's just the laziest and worst of the natives who pretend to become Christians. They get patches of land given them, and help in building their huts, and all sorts of privileges. By about half-a-day's work each week they can raise enough food to live upon, and all that is really required of them is to attend services on a Sunday. The business exactly suits them, but as a rule there are a great many more Hottentots than Kaffirs among the converts. I can give you a specimen of the sort of men they are. Not long since a gentleman was coming down with a waggon and a lot of bullocks from King Williamstown. The drivers all took it into their head to desert one day--it's a way these fellows have, one of them thinks he will go, and then the whole lot go, and a settler wakes up in the morning and finds that there isn't a single hand left on his place, and he has perhaps four or five hundred cows to be milked, and twice as many oxen and horses to look after. Well, this happened within a mile or so of the missionary station, so the gentleman rode over there and asked if some of the men would go with him down to Beaufort, a couple of days' march. Nobody would go; he raised his offers, and at last offered five times the usual rate of pay, but not one of the lazy brutes would move, and he had at last to drive the whole lot down himself, with the aid of a native or two he picked up on the way. However, there has <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> order along the frontier for the last two years, partly due to the chiefs having to pay for all cattle traced to their kraals, partly to the fact that we have got four hundred Kaffir police--and an uncommon smart lot of fellows they are--scattered all along the frontier, instead of being, like us, kept principally in towns. You see, we are considered more as a military body. Of course, we have a much easier time of it than if we were knocking about in small parties among the border settlements; but there is a lot more excitement in that sort of life, and I hope that if there is trouble they will send us out to protect the settlements." ...|$|E
