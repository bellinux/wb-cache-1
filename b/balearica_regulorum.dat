5000|$|Some the {{prominent}} bird species {{reported by the}} website of University of Michigan Museum of Zoology are; common swift (Apus apus), kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), grey crowned crane (<b>Balearica</b> <b>regulorum),</b> pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius), South African galago (Galago moholi), Nycteris grandis, martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus), Swynnertonia swynnertoni and black-rumped buttonquail (Turnix nanus). One-third of the world’s eagle species are reported from the Matobo National Park. Buff-spotted flufftail and stripe-cheeked bulbuls are seen across the country. The bateleur eagle is {{the only member of}} the genus Terathopius and probably the origin of the [...] "Zimbabwe Bird", the national emblem of Zimbabwe.|$|E
50|$|Liuwa plain {{supports}} globally important {{populations of}} storks, cranes and other water birds. The vulnerable crowned crane (<b>Balearica</b> <b>regulorum)</b> and wattled crane (Grus carunculatus) are abundant, sometimes forming flocks numbering several hundred. Wattled cranes {{are the most}} wetland dependent of Africa's cranes and are therefore considered an excellent flagship species for wetland conservation. Globally, Liuwa {{is considered to be}} the fourth most important breeding site for wattled cranes. The arrival of the annual floods marks the arrival of a wealth of water birds and the spectacle of massive migrating flocks is not uncommon in Liuwa. These water birds include the vulnerable slaty egret (Egretta vinaceigula) and the whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybrida) for which Liuwa provides the only breeding area in Zambia.|$|E
50|$|Various upland birds {{recorded}} as prey include the 177 g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), the 350 g rock pigeon (Columba livia), the 84 g laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the 169 g Senegal coucal (Centropus senegalensis), the 49 g scaly-throated honeyguide (Indicator variegatus) and {{several species of}} hornbill, {{ranging in size from}} the 139 g northern red-billed hornbill (Tockus erythrorhynchus) to the 1235 g silvery-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes brevis). Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (Corvus capensis) and pied crow (Corvus albus) are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as ostriches (Struthio camelus) and grey crowned cranes (<b>Balearica</b> <b>regulorum).</b> The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E
40|$|Captive cranes {{can break}} eggs through {{deliberate}} destruction, clumsy parental behavior, or accidentally because of thin shells. We {{report on the}} frequency of egg breakage by pairs of captive cranes at the International Crane Foundation (ICF). Among the 15 species of cranes and 1 hybrid female, all except a grey-crowned crane (<b>Balearica</b> <b>regulorum)</b> have broken eggs at ICF. Some pairs broke 1 / 3 {{or more of their}} eggs despite efforts by aviculturists to retrieve them before breakage. We compared the proportion of broken eggs among 7 species where we have data from 3 ̆e 5 individual females and more than 150 eggs per species. The total percentage of broken eggs varied by species with Siberian cranes (Grus leucogeranus) having the lowest rate (3 ̆c 1...|$|E
40|$|The International Crane Foundation (ICF) / Endangered Wildlife Trust's (EWT) African Crane Conservation Programme has {{recorded}} 26 403 crane sightings in its database from 1978 to 2014. This sightings collection is currently ongoing and records are continuously {{added to the}} database by the EWT field staff, ICF/EWT Partnership staff, various partner organizations and private individuals. The dataset has two peak collection periods: 1994 - 1996 and 2008 - 2012. The dataset collection spans five African countries: Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda and Zambia; 98 % of {{the data were collected}} in South Africa. Georeferencing of the dataset was verified before publication of the data. The dataset contains data on three African crane species: Blue Crane Anthropoides paradiseus, Grey Crowned Crane <b>Balearica</b> <b>regulorum</b> and Wattled Crane Bugeranus carunculatus. The Blue and Wattled Cranes are classified by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Vulnerable and the Grey Crowned Crane as Endangered. This is the single most comprehensive dataset published on African Crane species that adds new information about the distribution of these three threatened species. We hope this will further aid conservation authorities to monitor and protect these species. The dataset continues to grow and especially to expand in geographic coverage into new countries in Africa and new sites within countries. The dataset can be freely accessed through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility data portal...|$|E
40|$|Complaints of {{crop damage}} by cranes on planted maize in the North Eastern Cape, South Africa, have been {{increasing}} since the mid- 1990 ‘s, {{and in some}} instances severe losses have been reported. Crop damage by the Grey Crowned Crane <b>Balearica</b> <b>regulorum</b> regulorum near the town of Maclear (31 º 04 ´S 28 º 22 ´E), has been quantified over two growing seasons, and assessed relative to losses caused by foraging Cape Crows Corvus capensis and other feeding damage assumed to be caused by insects. Twelve fields were selected based on previous patterns of crop depredation. Maize seed in seven of the fields was treated with the chemical ‗Gaucho‘ and five fields were planted with untreated maize. In order to determine the source of losses, twenty quadrats (4 m x 4 m) randomly distributed within each field were visited on average every second day, for a period of up to twenty eight days. Results indicate that seed treatments do act as a deterrent to feeding by both cranes and crows, however crane damage is generally insignificant compared to other sources of damage. My study also reviewed past sightings data of the Grey Crowned Crane in an effort to determine if the conversion of former grassland to plantations in this region may have increased foraging activity in maize fields. The data did not allow for clear-cut conclusions regarding changes in distribution or population trends. Conclusions provide direct input into the management of agricultural areas by enabling landowners to take steps to mitigate crop damage. These mitigation measures may either involve the application of seed treatments, or the planting of low risk crops in high risk areas. Future studies should consider the ppossible detrimental effects of chemical seed treatments on crane biology. ...|$|E
