5|$|In 1405, <b>Balša</b> III, {{supported}} by Jelena, launched a ten-year war against Venice. At {{the beginning of}} the war, <b>Balša</b> managed to capture the whole Scutari region except for the Scutari fortress. The Venetians offered a 2,000-ducat reward for anyone able to kill both <b>Balša</b> and Jelena. When the Venetians in return captured Bar, Ulcinj and Budva, three of the most important ports of Zeta, <b>Balša</b> and Jelena fled from Ulcinj to Drivast Castle.|$|E
5|$|Jelena went to {{live with}} her husband at his court in Blagaj in Herzegovina while <b>Balša</b> {{remained}} as the only governor of Zeta. In his second marriage, concluded in 1412 or at the beginning of 1413, <b>Balša</b> III married Bolja, a daughter of Koja Zaharia who was a Lord of Sati and Dagnum in Albania. In 1413 <b>Balša</b> issued a charter to the church dedicated to Saint Nicholas he built in Praskvica Monastery together with his mother Jelena.|$|E
5|$|Jelena {{was born}} in 1365 or 1366 as the third {{daughter}} of Princess Milica of Serbia and Lazar of Serbia. Her mother belonged to the Nemanjić dynasty, while her father was {{the founder of the}} Lazarević dynasty. He created Moravian Serbia, the largest and most powerful state to emerge from the ruins of the Serbian Empire. Hence, Jelena {{was a member of the}} highest Serbian aristocracy. She {{was born in}} Prilepac and spent her childhood in Kruševac, where she lived until she married her first husband, Đurađ II Balšić, in 1386. She had one child with him, a son named <b>Balša</b> III who was born in 1387. <b>Balša</b> III had three children, a son whose name is not known and two daughters, Jelena and Teodora. His son died at a very young age in 1415. In 1424, Balša's daughter Jelena married Stjepan Vukčić Kosača and became the mother of Queen Catherine of Bosnia and Vladislav Hercegović.|$|E
5|$|Jelena {{was firmly}} {{opposed to the}} pro-Venetian policy of Đurađ II and his sale of Scutari and other towns to the Venetians. She {{did not like the}} Venetians because they {{obstructed}} the contacts between the Zetan Orthodox Metropolitanate and the Patriarchate of Peć, cut off Orthodox monasteries around Lake Skadar from the incomes that they were legally entitled to, and engaged in an aggressive trading policy, which significantly reduced Zeta's earnings. Even before the First Scutari War, she was in a dispute with the Venetians over the jurisdiction of the Zetan Orthodox Metropolitanate over the Orthodox churches around the river Bojana and the Church of St. Peter in Scutari. The reign of 16-year-old <b>Balša</b> III began in April 1403 when Đurađ II died of the injuries suffered in November 1402 at the Battle of Tripolje. In this battle Đurađ II supported Stefan Lazarević in an attempt to protect the throne of Serbian Despotate from Đurađ Branković. Jelena had a significant influence on the way <b>Balša</b> III governed Zeta. Because he was a minor when he inherited the throne, she actually governed Zeta as his regent. In a dispute between the Venetians and the Zetan Metropolitan bishop appointed by the Patriarchate of Peć, <b>Balša</b> III followed her instructions and protected the ancient rights of the Serbian church.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Kotor earned Tvrtko the enmity of George I of Zeta's brother and successor, <b>Balša</b> II, who also desired the city. Nothing {{is known about}} Balša's {{military}} conflict with Tvrtko except that the latter asked Venice, whose trading opportunities were threatened by the clashes, to mediate with the Lord of Zeta. The mediation was thwarted by Balša's death in a 1385 battle with the invading Ottoman Turks. Balša's nephew and successor, George II, maintained Zeta's hostility toward Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|Catherine was the {{daughter}} of Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, {{one of the most powerful}} figures amongst Bosnian nobility, Grand Duke of Bosnia and the ruler of Zachlumia and Travunia. His domain later came to be known as Herzegovina, after the German title of herzog he adopted in relation to the Duchy of St. Sava. Catherine's mother was Jelena, daughter of Zeta's lord <b>Balša</b> III and the first of Stjepan's three wives. Catherine was the couple's first child but the precise date of her birth is not known; both 1424 and late August 1425 have been suggested by her biographers. It can be surmised that the place of her birth was either the Sokol Fortress, an old seat of the House of Kosača, or the feudal town of Blagaj, Stjepan's favourite residence.|$|E
5|$|John's first {{marriage}} probably dates to {{after his arrival}} in Serbia, though the identity of his first wife, if any, is unknown. If the next ruler of Valona, Alexander Komnenos Asen, was his son, {{then he would have}} been born circa 1346–1348, as he was already an adult in 1363–1366. This would place John's potential {{first marriage}} a few years before Alexander's estimated birth. Around 1350–1355, John married Anna Palaiologina, a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini, the despot of Epirus. This marriage to an Epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised John's position in the region. Besides Alexander, another very likely child of John Komnenos Asen was a certain Komnena, the wife of <b>Balša</b> II who had succeeded Alexander as ruler of Valona in early 1372.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove his}} innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get {{in contact with}} the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian {{television}} show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of <b>balsa</b> wood in her mouth and looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1478, Catherine {{made her}} last will, {{recorded}} by a Dalmatian priest, {{in the presence}} of seven witnesses, six of whom were Franciscans of Ara Coeli. She expressed a wish to be buried before the main altar of Ara Coeli. Considering herself entitled to dispose of the Bosnian crown, she named Pope Sixtus IV and his successors guardians of the kingdom, obligating them to enthrone her son should he convert back to Christianity or else her daughter should she reconvert. Most of her personal belongings were inherited by her courtiers. Her chapel inventory was left to Saint Jerome's Church for the Slavic Nation, while the saint's relics were to be passed to Saint Mary's Church in Jajce. She decreed that, if her son never returned to the Christian faith, King Thomas's silver sword left in Dubrovnik for safekeeping should be handed to her nephew by Vladislav, <b>Balša</b> Hercegović. The Queen died five days after composing the will, which was immediately taken to the Pope along with her husband's sword and spurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light <b>balsa</b> wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E
5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples {{sold his}} {{rights to the}} Kingdom of Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice and retreated from the Balkans in 1409, many local nobles allied {{themselves}} with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and accepted Ostoja as the King of Bosnia. This seriously weakened the position of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a Grand Duke of Bosnia, whose niece Katarina was a second wife of Sandalj Hranić, a Grand Duke of Hum. In such circumstances Sandalj decided to ally with emperor Sigismund in mid 1411 and to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazarević. In December 1411 Sandalj divorced his wife Katarina and married Stefan's sister Jelena {{at the end of}} the same year. Jelena married Sandalj because she wanted to strengthen the position of her son. With this marriage Sandalj, the most dangerous enemy of <b>Balša</b> III, became his stepfather and protector. Although it spoiled Sandalj's relations with Hrvoje, it also strengthened traditionally close relations with the Lazarević family. Although Jelena was in her forties, Sandalj hoped they would have children and in 1413 deposited some money at a transactional account with the city of Dubrovnik for the child they would eventually have.|$|E
5|$|John Herschel Glenn Jr. {{was born}} on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a {{plumbing}} firm, and Clara Teresa , a teacher. His parents had married shortly before his father, {{a member of the}} American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own plumbing company, the Glenn Plumbing Company. He was only a toddler when he met Anna Margaret (Annie) Castor, who would later become his wife. The two {{would not be able to}} recall a time when they did not know each other. He took his first flight in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from <b>balsa</b> wood kits. Along with his adopted sister Jean, he attended New Concord Elementary School. He washed cars and sold rhubarb to earn money to buy a bicycle, after which he took a job delivering The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. He was a member of the Ohio Rangers, an organisation similar to the Cub Scouts; Annie was a girl scout. His boyhood home in New Concord has been restored as a historic house museum and education center.|$|E
25|$|<b>Balsa</b> {{became a}} big town, in fact {{much bigger than}} Tavira, that grew, prospered and decayed in {{parallel}} with the Roman Empire. When the Moors conquered Iberia, in the 8th Century, <b>Balsa</b> was already extinct as a town.|$|E
25|$|In 1372 Himarë, {{together}} with Vlora, Kanina and Berat region was given as a dowry to <b>Balša</b> II {{due to his}} marriage with the daughter of John Komnenos Asen. After the death of <b>Balša</b> II, his widow and his daughter (who married Mrkša Žarković) managed to keep the possession of the region up to 1417 when the Ottomans captured Vlora.|$|E
25|$|Under Roman rule, Tavira was a {{secondary}} passing {{place on the}} important road between <b>Balsa</b> and Baesuris (today Castro Marim).|$|E
25|$|Almost {{any type}} of fabric can be embroidered, given the proper stabilizer. Base {{materials}} include paper, fabric, and lightweight <b>balsa</b> wood.|$|E
25|$|Gropa married Anne (Kyranna), the {{daughter}} of Andrea II Muzaka. His brother-in-law was <b>Balša</b> II Balšić. Gropa's son-in-law was Ostoja Rajaković, a lord in Ohrid and relative to Marko.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{also featured}} a 120 degree V-tail arrangement and retractable landing gear. The construction was mostly of wood, with sandwiched layers of <b>balsa</b> and hardwoods, including tulipwood stringers covered with doped fabric.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of conventional}} configuration, {{with the exception}} of a pylon mounted pusher propeller, and is constructed from <b>balsa,</b> plywood and aluminium alloy. Originally covered with silver-doped Nylon the aircraft now sports a transparent plastic skin on the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Model glider {{aircraft}} are flying or non-flying models of existing or imaginary gliders, often scaled-down versions of full size planes, using lightweight {{materials such as}} polystyrene, <b>balsa</b> wood, foam and fibreglass. Designs range from simple glider aircraft, to accurate scale models, some {{of which can be}} very large.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{relationship}} between the properties of wood and {{the properties of the}} particular tree that yielded it. The density of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its strength (mechanical properties). For example, mahogany is a medium-dense hardwood that is excellent for fine furniture crafting, whereas <b>balsa</b> is light, making it useful for model building. One of the densest woods is black ironwood.|$|E
25|$|Terrain {{is a very}} {{important}} part of play. Though Games Workshop makes terrain kits available, many hobbyists prefer to make their own elaborate and unique set pieces. Common household items and hobby materials such as <b>balsa</b> wood, cardboard, and polystyrene can be transformed into ruins from the Second Age, woodland terrain, or the rocky wild of Middle-earth with the addition of plasticard, putty, and a bit of patience and skill.|$|E
25|$|In 1385 {{the city}} of Durrës was {{captured}} by <b>Balša</b> II. Topia called for Ottoman help and Balša's forces were defeated in the Battle of Savra. Topia recaptured {{the city of}} Durrës the same year and held it {{until his death in}} 1388. Afterwards, the city of Durrës was inherited by his son Gjergj, Lord of Durrës. In 1392 Gjergj surrendered the city of Durrës and his domains to the Republic of Venice.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to {{classify}} wood as either softwood or hardwood. The wood from conifers (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from dicotyledons (usually broad-leaved trees, (e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known <b>balsa</b> (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. yew) are harder than many hardwoods.|$|E
25|$|Boron and Graphite rods {{came around}} in the 1960s and 1970s when the United States and United Kingdom {{invested}} considerable research into developing the new technologies. Hewitt and Howald {{were the first to}} come up with a way to lay the fibers into the shape of a fishing rod by wrapping them around a piece of <b>balsa</b> wood. However, by 1977, boron fibre technology had been muscled out by the cheaper material graphite and was no longer competitive in the market.|$|E
25|$|In November they {{demonstrated}} the RP-3, which used welded steel tubing {{in place of}} glue-and-screwed <b>balsa</b> wood for the framework, and added the new feature of a parachute that could be activated when the flight was over, making landings a simple push-button task. Continued testing was carried out at March Field, east of Los Angeles. These early tests were not very successful, {{but a series of}} improvements were quickly worked into the design. However, at this point the Whittier estate withdrew further funding.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of types differing in the {{construction}} of their wings, aerodynamic efficiency, location of the pilot, controls and intended purpose. Most exploit meteorological phenomena to maintain or gain height. Gliders are principally used for the air sports of gliding, hang gliding and paragliding. However some spacecraft have been designed to descend as gliders and in the past military gliders have been used in warfare. Some simple and familiar types of glider are toys such as the paper plane and <b>balsa</b> wood glider.|$|E
25|$|The J/24 is {{no longer}} {{considered}} the most modern sailboat in its class, {{but it is still}} a very popular sailboat among keelboat racers. While some of the world's best J/24 sailors have the latest version J/24, a well-prepared 1977 model, built to the same shape and weight with rigid end-grained <b>balsa</b> core construction can still win sailing the class world championship even after 30,000+ miles of trailering. This {{is one of the many}} advantages of One-Design sailing that the J/24 is benefitting from.|$|E
25|$|Voris {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California but was raised in Aptos, and later Santa Cruz (where he {{attended}} high school). He briefly considered {{a career as a}} mortician, but instead decided to enroll in Salinas Junior College, receiving his associate degree there in 1939. As a youngster, Voris (whose hobby was building model airplanes out of <b>balsa</b> wood and tissue paper) was thrilled by the exploits of Eddie Rickenbacker and other World War I aces, and would spend hours watching the big planes come into Mines Field (Los Angeles Airport).|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} wooden sailboat, the hull is {{constructed}} of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often {{referred to as}} ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a keel. In fiberglass or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent, or be of a monocoque arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, <b>balsa</b> wood, impregnated paper honeycomb or other material.|$|E
25|$|The Curtiss-Wright CW-27 was {{designed}} by Curtiss-Wright's chief designer George A. Page, Jr. as a high-wing, twin-engine, cargo transport aircraft, utilizing plywood construction with a tricycle undercarriage. Though the British de Havilland Mosquito had successfully employed a ply construction using a <b>balsa</b> wood core and birch hardwood exterior, Curtiss-Wright engineers, using research provided by Forest Products Laboratory, rejected this approach, insisting instead on a ply construction of dense mahogany, which greatly increased the plane's weight. At Curtiss' request, Army Materiel Command laid in large supplies of mahogany, {{and a number of}} furniture manufacturers, including the Baldwin Piano Company, were subcontracted to build components for the aircraft, which would be assembled at Curtiss-Wright's new defense plant in Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|Since 2001, {{expanded}} polypropylene (EPP) foams {{have been}} gaining in popularity and in application as a structural material in hobbyist radio control model aircraft. Unlike expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) which is friable and breaks easily on impact, EPP foam {{is able to}} absorb kinetic impacts very well without breaking, retains its original shape, and exhibits memory form characteristics which allow it to return to its original shape in {{a short amount of}} time. In consequence, a radio-control model whose wings and fuselage are constructed from EPP foam is extremely resilient, and able to absorb impacts that would result in complete destruction of models made from lighter traditional materials, such as <b>balsa</b> or even EPS foams.|$|E
25|$|The de Havilland Albatross {{airliner}} of 1936 had a fuselage {{of wooden}} sandwich construction: wafers of birch plywood were spaced apart by a <b>balsa</b> sheet. This same construction achieved fame with its wartime {{use in the}} Mosquito fast bomber. As well as being a construction of light weight and high performance, it also avoided the use of aluminium, a strategic material during wartime, and could use the skills of woodworkers, rather than those of specialised aircraft metalworkers. When Germany attempted to copy this aircraft as the Moskito it was a failure, primarily for materials reasons. The original phenolic Tego film adhesive was only produced by a factory that was destroyed by bombing. Its replacement led directly to catastrophic failures and loss of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The hull is of {{conventional}} glassfibre construction, {{with a strong}} layup conforming to Lloyd's standards. The two tonnes of lead ballast is encapsulated in the hull, obviating the need for keel bolts. The hull is joined to the deck by a large bulwark, topped with a teak caprail. Unusually, the deck has no <b>balsa</b> core, instead using solid glassfibre construction. Although this makes for greater longevity of the hull {{as there is no}} core to rot or delaminate, a slight 'flex' can sometimes be felt. The mast is keel stepped, and is supported by double lower shrouds for greater redundancy. The standing rigging terminates at U-bolts in the deck. Although this type of chainplate is sometimes criticised, there is no recorded instance of a dismasting, and Rogers claims reinforcing this system would have no impact on safety. It has the benefit of simplicity and low cost.|$|E
25|$|Fly tying {{material}} {{can be anything}} used to construct a fly on a hook. Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, <b>balsa</b> and wire. Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also {{a wide array of}} synthetic materials. Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and saddle hackle, so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. Synthetics such as rubber legs, plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer. Whereas lead wire was the traditional method of weighting flies, today's weighting materials include glass, brass and tungsten beads and cones as well as lead. Silicone, epoxy, kevlar thread and other modern materials are regularly incorporated in artificial fly patterns.|$|E
500|$|Jelena Balšić ( [...] ; 1365/1366– 1443), {{also known}} as Jelena Lazarević, was a medieval Serbian noblewoman, {{daughter}} of Lazar of Serbia. She {{had a very strong}} personality and significantly influenced the way her husbands, first Đurađ II Balšić and second Sandalj Hranić, and her son <b>Balša</b> III governed their realms. Jelena encouraged them to resist Venetian encroachment on territory belonging to Zeta, the medieval Serbian state ruled by Đurađ II and then by <b>Balša</b> III after Đurađ II's death. She is {{also known as}} a writer in epistolary literature, particularly her correspondence with Nikon of Jerusalem, a monk in the Gorica monastery on Lake Skadar (Montenegro). Her three epistles are part of the Gorički zbornik (Cyrillic: Горички зборник), a medieval manuscript collection.|$|E
