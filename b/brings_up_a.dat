At some points, the player can use Apollo's [...] "perceive" [...] mechanic to watch for visual cues in a witness as they are talking, such as a twitching eye, that indicate that they are lying. The player can also sometimes use Phoenix's [...] "psyche-lock" [...] mechanic to see locks on the hearts of witnesses who are hiding something.|$|E

After they attack, SpongeBob uses his bubble blowing to trap the gang in a giant bubble that flies them out of town.

As he is arresting Brian, one of the police {{officers}} states {{that he will not}} release him since he is a [...] "family guy". In their campaign, Brian and Stewie perform their musical number, '"A Bag o' Weed", to the tune of [...] "Me Ol' Bamboo" [...] as featured in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. During the song, a picture of Woody Harrelson is shown. Harrelson also wanted marijuana legalized. Towards the end of the musical number Shaggy from the television show Scooby Doo can be seen among the crowd, referencing a number of jokes about his stoned-like demeanor. After cannabis is legalized, its effects include phenomenal ratings for Doctor Who. Peter then tries to remember something but ends up remembering the names of celebrities whom he does not like. While helping out with Carter's smear campaign, Peter comes up with an advertisement that involves Adolf Hitler claiming that the Holocaust was started by smoking cannabis. The campaign is then dropped after Carter informs Peter that Fox News holds Hitler's image rights and they cannot smear it. He later tries to film a new advertisement which informs that unlike the events of the film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, he made it there earlier since he was not stoned. He then says Neil Patrick Harris was cast on How I Met Your Mother based on his work in that film, and <b>brings</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> point that confuses him: since Josh Radnor is already an adult, why is the narrator of the show voiced by Bob Saget? Carter later tells Brian that he will release his novel with an Oprah's Book Club induction.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{handheld}} {{versions of}} the game feature updated graphics, the gameplay and game mechanics are identical to the original, with the storyline including the full twenty-one single-player missions from the original release (three Roman missions, three Viking missions, three Mayan missions, and a twelve mission Dark Tribe campaign). The main change to the game involves the HUD, which was redesigned so as to accommodate touchscreen controls. For example, rather than the building menu always present onscreen, it is accessed by pressing an icon which opens the [...] "Build Menu". From within this menu, the player then has access to various submenus, such as [...] "Basic Buildings", [...] "Food Buildings" [...] and [...] "Military Buildings." [...] Similarly, to access the menu to control specialist settlers, the player touches another icon, which is only available if the player has any such settlers available. Pressing down on any icon for two seconds <b>brings</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> brief help screen for that icon, and pausing the game allows the player to access a full help menu, replacing the [...] "Extended tool tips" [...] which appeared on-screen in the original.|$|E

Typing in the typing field automatically scrolls the list of keywords to the closest match.

2500|$|In her {{overview}} of Thomas' life and works, Bridget Brereton <b>brings</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{number of important}} criticisms of Froudacity. First she notes that [...] "Thomas' essential charity and lack of prejudice led him to play down the depth of race prejudice and ill-feeling West Indian society .... Gordon Rohlehr is surely right {{to point out the}} unreality of Thomas' fairly placid picture of post-Emancipation Trinidad". She asks the pertinent question: Did Thomas intentionally lie as matter of political convenience for the Reform movement? It is impossible to judge Thomas' thoughts, but it is a reasonable explanation for why Thomas would make such an outlandish statement. Brereton continues to note that like many of his contemporaries Thomas did not believe in universal suffrage, but instead he believed that property qualifications should be necessary for voting. In the 19th century universal suffrage was not as great an issue as it grew to be, but it still shows that Thomas believed in the rule of the elite, not in true democratic rule. Finally, Brereton notes that [...] "Thomas does not show that he understood the links between Christianity and slavery and imperialism in the Caribbean". Thomas might have understood the ties and ignored discussing them for political expediency, or as a devout Christian he might simply have dismissed the idea that religion could do harm.|$|E

2500|$|For Marx, {{the history}} of the Paris Commune caused him to {{reassess}} the significance of some of his own earlier writings. [...] In a later preface to the Communist Manifesto, Marx would write that [...] "no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed at the end of Section II. That passage would, in many respects, be very differently worded today." [...] It is the earlier passage that sought to show the process of worker seizure of state power. Following the publication of [...] "The Civil War in France", [...] "One thing especially was proved by the Commune, viz., that 'the working class cannot simply lay hold of ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes.'" [...] His writing of this passage also <b>brings</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> rift between Marxist-Leninists and Social-Democrats, who both interpret his writing differently. Libertarian Marxist currents would later draw from this work by emphasizing the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state to mediate or aid its liberation. Vladimir Lenin writes that, [...] "Marx's idea is that the working class must break up, smash the 'readymade state machinery', and not confine itself merely to laying hold of it." [...] In contrast, Social-Democrats believe that Marx's writing of this means he believes the revolution in Paris was a failure, and that a revolution is not necessary {{to meet the needs of}} the dictatorship of the proletariat.|$|E

Sackville has strutted into obscurity; and even Lyly, though his writings were once the delight of a court, and apparently perpetuated by a proverb, is now scarcely known even by name. A whole crowd of authors who wrote and wrangled at the time, have likewise gone down with all their writings and their controversies.

Meanwhile, every one is waiting for his reply, and, as the silence is getting more and more awkward, our well-read friend has to stammer out some half-answer at last, not nearly so clear or so satisfactory as an ordinary schoolboy would have given.
