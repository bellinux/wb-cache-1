5|$|As the Russians withdrew, the French {{immediately}} despatched garrisons to the Ionian Islands, rapidly amassing over 7,400 French and Neapolitan {{troops on}} Corfu alone. This effectively turned the Adriatic into a sheltered French sea {{from which they}} could <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> despatch raiders against British convoys, colonies and Royal Navy blockade squadrons, which had controlled the Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar two years earlier. To facilitate this, the French Navy placed significant orders at the Venetian naval yards, intending to build forces in the region with locally produced and crewed vessels.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Monroe and Fox {{had come}} to an {{agreement}} about a new seven-year contract. It was clear that MMP {{would not be able to}} finance films alone, and the studio was eager to have Monroe working again. The contract required her to make four movies for Fox during the seven years. The studio would pay her $100,000 for each movie, and granted her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers. She would also <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> make one film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, a Thrud {{comic strip}} {{was a regular}} and popular feature in the roleplay and wargame {{magazine}} White Dwarf with Thrud's grotesque and comic antics forming a memorable part of the magazine's golden age. In 2002, continued interest in the character from role-playing enthusiasts {{and a desire to}} <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> experiment with a new artistic style prompted Critchlow to self-publish a series of award-winning full-length Thrud the Barbarian comics.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> do so, within broad limits.|$|E

Jack said that he took the photos, that they belonged to him {{and that he should}} <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> pass them on to whoever he pleases. A judge in Sanford, Florida, temporarily banned Jack from distributing photographs of Runnels ahead of a hearing.|$|E
5|$|The Queen, {{pregnant}} again, {{was aware}} of the dangers if she failed to give birth to a son. With Catherine dead, Henry would <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> marry without any taint of illegality. At this time Henry began paying court to Jane Seymour. He gave her a locket with a miniature portrait of himself inside and Jane, in the presence of Anne, began opening and shutting it. Anne responded by ripping off the locket with such force her fingers bled.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} told CanWest News Service that {{he hoped}} the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, sexual slang and its media use. Anderson questioned whether the word should be used on NYPD Blue, and how parents should discuss its use with their children.

5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick {{in order to have a}} chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E
5|$|As a young woman, Razafindrahety {{married an}} Andriana (nobleman) named Ratrimo (Ratrimoarivony). Her husband died {{several years later}} on May 8, 1883, aged 22, leaving Razafindrahety a {{premature}} widow. According to rumor, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony may have arranged to have Ratrimo poisoned for political reasons. The Aristocratic Revolution of 1863, which had been orchestrated by Rainilaiarivony's older brother, Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, had replaced the absolute rule of the Andriana with a constitutional monarchy in which power was shared between an Andriana monarch and a Hova (freeman) prime minister. This arrangement was to be cemented by a political marriage between {{the prime minister and}} a ruling queen effectively selected by him. As Queen Ranavalona II neared death and the search for her successor began, Rainilaiarivony may have had Ratrimo deliberately poisoned so that Razafindrahety, the most eligible successor, would <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> marry the prime minister and succeed to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1523 Anne was {{secretly}} betrothed to Henry Percy, {{son of the}} 5th Earl of Northumberland, but the betrothal was broken by Cardinal Wolsey in January 1524 and Anne was sent back home to Hever Castle. In February/March 1526, Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne. She resisted his attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, which her sister Mary had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine so he would <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> marry Anne. When {{it became clear that}} Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage, the breaking of the Catholic Church's power in England began. In 1532, Henry granted Anne the Marquessate of Pembroke.|$|E

5|$|For {{some time}} Monteux had {{felt that he}} should leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he {{believed}} that a conductor should not remain in one post for too long, and he wished to <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO {{at the end of}} the 1952 season. He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost all the members of the SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, which {{included}} among its provisions {{the creation of}} treaty ports in which Christian missionaries would <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> preach. Xiamen (then known as Amoy) {{was one of these}} treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start preaching to the local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of Gulangyu, created reference works and religious tracts, including a bible translation. Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien Sprachraum, most notably Taiwan. The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{planned to}} rapidly seize European colonies in Asia {{to create a}} large {{defensive}} perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific; the Japanese would then <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war. To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American {{military presence in the}} Philippines from the outset. On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific. These included an attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, landings in Thailand and Malaya and the battle of Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|Krips {{left the}} LSO in 1954, and the {{following}} year tensions between the orchestral principals and the rank-and-file players erupted into an irreconcilable dispute. The principals argued {{that the future of}} the LSO lay in profitable session work for film companies, rather than in the overcrowded field of London concerts. They also wished to <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> accept such engagements individually, absenting themselves from concerts if there were a clash of dates. The LSO's board, which reflected the majority opinion of the players, refused to accommodate the principals, most of whom resigned en masse, to form the Sinfonia of London, a session ensemble that flourished from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, and then faded away. For fifteen years after the split the LSO did little film work, recording only six soundtracks between 1956 and 1971, compared with more than 70 films between 1940 and 1955.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November, Grayson reiterated {{his desire}} to keep Kisnorbo but stated {{that he had to}} prove his fitness before being offered a new deal at Leeds. Kisnorbo got an {{infection}} on his Achilles tendon injury, and stepped up his rehab by going to the USA for treatment. Kisnorbo returned to Leeds' training ground Thorp Arch during mid January. However, on 11 March 2011, it was confirmed that he would not play again in the 2010–11 season. As Kisnorbo's contract was set to expire in June 2011, he had to prove his fitness to the coaching staff at Leeds in the hope of earning a new contract, or <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> join another club. In March 2011, Kisnorbo returned to full training with Leeds after his long spell out injured.|$|E
5|$|Only {{recently}} {{promoted to}} {{general manager of}} the New Jersey system, Stanley had been reluctant to take the position in London and took it for one year only, provided he would <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> return to America {{at the end of the}} year. He told the company's senior managers that the company was almost bankrupt and got resignation letters from each of them post-dated by six months. Through better integration of the separate companies within the group and by improving advertising and public relations, he was quickly able to turn the fortunes of the company around, while the company's chairman, Sir Edgar Speyer, renegotiated the debt repayments. In 1908, Stanley joined the company's board and, in 1910, he became the managing director.|$|E
