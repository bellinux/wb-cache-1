5|$|The Joker forces Batman {{into a game}} of {{hide and}} seek, giving him one hour to escape Arkham before his adversaries are sent to hunt him down. Although Batman {{initially}} refuses, he accepts the challenge after the Joker shoots a prison guard {{in the head and}} then threatens to kill Adams. However, unbeknownst to Batman, the Joker shortens the time from one hour to ten minutes after being pressured by the other inmates. Batman subsequently encounters Clayface, Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, and Maxie Zeus, among other villains. During a struggle with Killer Croc, Batman is thrown out of a window, grabbing onto the statue of the angel Michael. Clutching the statue's bronze spear, Batman climbs <b>back</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> impales Croc before throwing him out the window, sustaining a severe wound from the spear in the process.|$|E

500|$|Years later, Lorelei {{remembered that}} she had been waving to the crowd when she was grabbed by two of the bodyguards who had {{accompanied}} the Jeep and placed her back in the vehicle. [...] The party was unable to return to home plate because of the rowdy fans, so the Jeep was driven out of the stadium and through the surrounding streets, to the delight of the many Cohos outside the stadium who recognized the occupants. [...] They were driven {{to the front of the}} stadium, ushered <b>back</b> <b>inside,</b> <b>and</b> taken up to the press room where they had spent most of the first game.|$|E

Kristen approaches Mulder with a knife but instead stabs The Father, who is hiding in the bedroom. The Son attacks Mulder but is subdued. Mulder and Kristen try to escape using a car parked in the garage, but the Unholy Spirit jumps onto the car hood and attacks them. Kristen drives into her, impaling her on a wooden peg on the wall. Kristen tricks Mulder into running outside of the house while she goes <b>back</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> pours gasoline around herself and The Son.

Firefighters and police find four bodies in the wreckage while Mulder stares at Scully's cross necklace.|$|E
500|$|When Leslie {{notes to}} the camera crew {{that they seem to}} be getting along just like when they made love five years earlier, she realizes he was drunk then too. When the bar closes, the two decide to keep {{drinking}} alongside the pit outside Ann's house, which Leslie plans to turn into a park. When Leslie asks whether he thinks the park will ever be made, a pragmatic Mark says it will be a difficult process with a lot of red tape, but she remains optimistic. During a fight, Andy admits to Ann that he postponed having the casts removed, but explains it was because, [...] "I really, really like it when you serve me food." [...] Ann throws him out, and Andy sees Mark kiss Leslie. Leslie stops his advances because she does not want to move forward when he is drunk. As Mark starts to leave, he falls into the pit. An amused Andy tells Ann, who rushes out to help him while Andy goes <b>back</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> watches television.|$|E
500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went <b>back</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E

Gordon regains consciousness {{under a pile of}} rubble and is found by Alyx and Dog. Their proximity to the Citadel, coupled with its imminent explosion, which would level much of City 17, requires them to go <b>back</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> stabilize the core, stalling the structure's destruction long enough for both themselves and much of the human population to escape. Gordon and Alyx succeed in doing so, but learn that the local Combine forces are attempting to send a distress message for off-world assistance, using the Citadel's destruction to power the transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Opas in {{defending}} Ryan {{put a lot}} of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; [...] "I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired." [...] In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; [...] "Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot." [...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran <b>back</b> <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot." [...] Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered my gun again." ...|$|E

The noise of a man's heavy footsteps comes from the deck outside and there is a loud knock on the door. CHRIS starts, makes a move as if to get up and go to the door, then thinks better of it and sits still. The knock is repeated--then as no answer comes, the door is flung open and MAT BURKE appears. CHRIS scowls at the intruder and his hand instinctively goes back to the sheath knife on his hip. BURKE is dressed up--wears a cheap blue suit, a striped cotton shirt with a black tie, and black shoes newly shined. His face is beaming with good humor.] ...|$|E
