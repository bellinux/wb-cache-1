Applying it, it's possible to improve the journal bearings and avoid possible failures. This analysis consists on studying {{the effects of the}} variation of the journal bearings main parameters (radial clearance, journal bearing diameter and journal bearing length) on the journal bearings operating conditions (minimum film thickness, maximum pressure and power loss). The analysis also includes the comparison and selection of the different metallic materials {{that can be used in}} these journal bearings, as well as the selection of the lubrication system groove suitable for the journal bearings used in this kind of application. This sensibility analysis shows that: increasing the radial clearance, the minimum film thickness increases, the maximum pressure remains approximately the same and the power loss decreases; increasing the journal bearing length, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases; increasing the journal bearing diameter, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} demands in hydropower and other industries today stems from the emphasis on preserving the environment. Usage of mineral and synthetic oils in sliding bearings of hydropower plants raises concerns about the environmental impact of these lubricants in case of spillage into downstream water. These concerns have led to attempts in using water as lubricant and the concept of oil-free systems in hydropower generation. Realization of this concept however poses many challenges including the choice of bearing materials and this necessitated research pertaining to the tribological behaviour of polymers in lubricated conditions. In this work, several studies have been carried out in order to obtain an insight into polymers’ tribological performance and associated mechanisms in the presence of lubricants. Extensive tribological studies on several unfilled polymers in water lubricated contacts demonstrated the superior wear resistance of UHMWPE. It was also found that the frictional behaviour of the unfilled polymers was influenced by their water contact angle and relative energy difference with regard to water. Studies on the effect of counter surface roughness characteristics on tribological behaviour of polymeric materials revealed their significant influence on friction and wear behaviour of polymer-metal contacts. Using a small scale journal bearing configuration, it was found that dynamic friction of polymer bearings can be significantly reduced using a shaft of reduced surface roughness. However, depending on the bearing material, this can adversely affect the material’s breakaway frictional response and thereby increase the torque required for machine start-up; a critical issue in applications such as pumped storage hydropower plants. Further studies using a pin on plate configuration revealed that variations in surface roughness characteristics of the metallic counter surfaces can significantly alter the wear resistance of the polymeric materials which cannot modify the topography of the counter surfaces in a tribological contact. Investigations regarding the influence of incorporation of various micro/nano carbon based fillers/reinforcements in the polymer matrix revealed their great potential for enhancing the friction and wear behaviour of the polymer composites. However these effects {{have been found to be}} strongly influenced by presence/absence of other reinforcements in the polymer matrix and/or by alterations in the operating conditions. Application of polymers as bearing lining materials also exhibits the potential of enhancing the performance of oil lubricated bearings. Therefore a part of this work was aimed at investigating the tribological characteristics of several polytetrafluoroethylene based materials at the onset of sliding (breakaway) at various pressures and temperatures. The results of this study showed dramatic reduction in breakaway friction using PTFE based materials in comparison to the conventional <b>Babbitt</b> (white <b>metal)</b> bearing lining material utilized in oil-lubricated sliding bearings of hydropower plants.

The shaft is coated with soot as a release agent, {{the ends of the}} bearing are packed with clay, and molten metal poured into the cavity around the shaft, initially half filling the pillow block.

5000|$|The {{original}} Babbitt alloy {{was invented}} in 1839 by Isaac Babbitt in Taunton, Massachusetts, USA. He disclosed one of his alloy recipes but kept others as trade secrets. Other formulations were later developed. Like other terms whose eponymous origin is long since deemphasized (such as diesel engine or eustachian tube), the term <b>babbitt</b> <b>metal</b> is frequently styled in lowercase. It is preferred over the term [...] "white metal", because the latter term may refer to various bearing alloys, lead- or tin-based alloys, or zinc die-casting metal.Babbitt metal is most commonly used as a thin surface layer in a complex, multi-metal structure, but its original use was as a cast-in-place bulk bearing material. <b>Babbitt</b> <b>metal</b> is characterized by its resistance to galling. <b>Babbitt</b> <b>metal</b> is soft and easily damaged, which suggests {{that it might be}} unsuitable for a bearing surface. However, its structure is made up of small hard crystals dispersed in a softer metal, which makes it a metal matrix composite. As the bearing wears, the softer metal erodes somewhat, which creates paths for lubricant between the hard high spots that provide the actual bearing surface. When tin is used as the softer metal, friction causes the tin to melt and function as a lubricant, which protects the bearing from wear when other lubricants are absent.|$|E

The early English machines (as opposed to the American versions), such as Edwards, Kendrick, Brown, Boggs, and Ranalah, etc., had cast iron frames. These wheels, made during the 19th Century, had <b>Babbitt</b> <b>metal</b> plain bearings, making them difficult to push and pull the metal through when operated at high pressures. Later, when ball bearings came into use, the machines became more suitable for hard and thick material, such as 1/8” steel.

Steel frames made of solid flame-cut plate, or frames built-up of cut-and-welded plates, are common designs.

Many methods of controlling this instability have been proposed but existing hydroelectric power plants in many cases already been enlisted to fill the regulating power needs of industry and the population. Filling this regulating power role necessitates that a machine changes load state more often and experiences an increase in starts and stops. Likewise, the push for a less environmentally intrusive society has raised the importance of utilizing equipment with reduced impact. This situation has created a host of opportunities to improve existing power plants and upgrade designs of new power plants to allow for reduced impact, better reliability, and increased efficiency. As {{one of the most}} critical and failure prone components of the power plant, the bearings hold great potential for improvements that together can reduce impact while increasing efficiency and reliability. To accomplish these opportunities, this work investigates the potential of new, environmentally adapted, lubricants to improve power plant efficiency. It then continues by developing guidelines for power plant operators when considering changing lubricants. Finally, the potential of polymer faced bearings to improve plant reliability at start up is investigated. A journal bearing test machine was constructed to investigate a number of new synthetic lubricants and polymer bearing materials. These tests found that a significant reduction in power loss could be accomplished without significantly affecting the bearing's minimum film thickness by changing from a traditional mineral oil based lubricant to a high viscosity index lubricant of much lower base viscosity grade. Further experimental work led to the development of practical guidance for power plant operators contemplating a lubricant change. This technique focuses on the importance of maintaining equivalent viscosity in the minimum film thickness region after a lubricant change. Efficiency improvements can then be calculated by comparing the viscosity in the bulk of the bearing to that with the original lubricant.

Investigations in the full scale with the Porjus U 9 unit provided valuable insight into the dynamics of a full scale machine as well as needed data for the improvement of multi-physics models of bearings. Insights from the Porjus U 9 experiments clarify many of the design challenges for large journal bearings. The results from this work demonstrate that significant performance improvement of journal bearings is possible through the use of new lubricants, materials, and adjustments in operational methods.
