50|$|In {{high power}} {{distance}} regions, {{people in the}} higher positions hold great amounts of power with little challenge. The hierarchy and authority empower employers and supervisors <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>rights</b> of resource allocation, rewards and punishment, which in turn reinforce their status, as well as enable them to lead and guide their subordinates autocratically. The hierarchical differentiation between the top and the bottom gradually creates an invisible gap in the workplace, where the subordinates tend to build greater sensitivity and cautiousness when communicating with their supervisors.|$|R
50|$|Labor force {{participation}} {{for women}} in Qatar is roughly 51%, which {{is higher than the}} world average, and is the highest rate in the Arab world. However, both Qatari and non-Qatar women are affected by a wage gap, in which they are paid 25 to 50 percent less than men. In addition, Qatar greatly partakes in social allowances for men which include amenities such as housing, and travel allotments, that female employees are less likely to receive. Experts say women are moving forward <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

40|$|The law {{and finance}} {{literature}} highlights {{the role of}} investor rights in financial development, firm corporate governance, and financing patterns. For a panel of 35 countries, we investigate how bankruptcy use relates to countries' creditor rights and judicial efficiency. Bankruptcies are higher in countries <b>with</b> <b>more</b> creditor <b>rights,</b> except for a "no automatic stay on assets" provision. Higher judicial efficiency is associated <b>with</b> <b>more</b> bankruptcies and appears as a substitute <b>with</b> <b>more</b> creditor <b>rights.</b> Although only a first step, our findings suggest creditor rights are complex, balancing prioritization of claims, ex ante risk-taking incentives, and an efficient resolution of distressed firms.

40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} {{diffusion of}} labor standards from origin to host countries by investigating whether better labor standards of MNCs’ origin countries are correlated with higher wages {{of workers in}} host countries in Africa. MNCs originating from countries <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>rights</b> of association and collective bargain and those coming from countries with unions that have strong wage bargaining power are found to pay significantly higher wages to their workers in host countries. These findings highlight that, although domestic policies and institutions may be important determinants of labor-related standards, they do not operate in isolation from external influences coming from origin countries...|$|R
