50|$|The {{nominate}} <b>blue-headed</b> <b>wagtail</b> {{and yellow}} wagtail form a narrow hybrid zone in northern France. Birds from this zone vary in appearance, but one type, which resembles nominate <b>blue-headed</b> <b>wagtail</b> (except that the blue tones {{to the head}} are paler and more mauve and {{the white of the}} head is more extensive, particularly on the throat, ear-coverts, and supercilium) is colloquially referred to as Channel wagtail.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{species are}} poly- or paraphyletic {{in the present}} taxonomical {{arrangement}} and either subspecies need to be reassigned and/or species split up. The <b>blue-headed</b> <b>wagtail</b> (AKA yellow wagtail and many other names), especially, {{has always been a}} taxonomical nightmare with over a dozen currently accepted subspecies and many more invalid ones. The two remaining [...] "monochrome" [...] species, Mekong and African pied wagtail may be closely related, or a most striking example of convergent evolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationships}} {{of this species}} are not well resolved; {{it belongs to the}} non-African clade of wagtails, these are confusing in their external morphology, and mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data are not able to robustly resolve their relationships. While the present species is probably most closely related to citrine <b>wagtails</b> and some <b>blue-headed</b> <b>wagtails,</b> the exact nature of this relationship is unclear.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} of west Penwith being almost {{isolated from the}} rest of Cornwall has fewer resident species than the latter and those resident are generally in smaller numbers. However the only colonies of kittiwakes in the county {{are to be found in}} west Penwith and the only breeding records of <b>blue-headed</b> and yellow <b>wagtails</b> are also from there.|$|R
50|$|Stuart Baker in {{his second}} edition of The Fauna of British India {{considered}} this as a subspecies of the white wagtail, calling it Motacilla lugubris maderaspatensis. This was however criticized by C B Ticehurst, who noted that it was much larger, never had the white forehead of the white wagtail, was non-migratory and lacked a spring moult. This species is now considered to form a superspecies with Japanese wagtail, Mekong wagtail and the more distant African pied wagtail. Similarities in pre-copulatory behaviour with the Japanese wagtail have been noted. Its song much resembles that of the recently described Mekong wagtail. mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data {{has not been able}} to robustly resolve the relationships of these birds, especially in respect to the <b>blue-headed</b> <b>wagtail</b> and its relatives.|$|E
50|$|Sykes' {{collections}} of animals {{resulted in the}} publications of catalogues of birds and mammals from the Deccan region, {{many of which were}} published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society. His discoveries included fifty-six birds new to science, including the Indian pond heron. Sykes also studied the fish of the area, and wrote papers on the quails and hemipodes of India. His list of birds of the Deccan contained almost 236 species. He was an authority on the natural history of the Deccan region and he corresponded with many other naturalists. He used his influence during his position at the East India Company and Charles Darwin wrote to him to influence decisions in favour of including Edward Blyth on an expedition to China. Sykes's lark (Galerida deva) of peninsular India is named after him. In addition, a race of <b>blue-headed</b> <b>wagtail</b> (Motacilla flava beema) was given the common name Sykes's wagtail in British Birds (1907). In 1856 the citizens of Bombay presented Sykes with a medal for his advocacy in favour of a native system of education. He wrote extensively on Buddhism and its antiquity and believed that it was the original religion followed in India. He also wrote on the Taiping Rebellion holding the British Government guilty of unjustifiable aggression towards China. He also held the British responsible for precipitating the 1857 rebellion by being insensitive to local customs, citing the earlier case of the Vellore mutiny. In a commentary to the British media which had suggested that the mutineers were using greased cartridges, one of the immediate causes of the uprising, against the British he pointed out that they were all using 'Brown Bess' and conventional musket ammunition. He was one of the founding members of the Asiatic Society of Bombay.|$|E
