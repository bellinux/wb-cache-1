40|$|Burn-in is {{a widely}} used {{engineering}} method which is adopted to eliminate defective items before they are shipped to customers or put into the field operation. In the studies of burn-in, the assumption of bathtub shaped failure rate function is usually employed and optimal burn-in procedures are investigated. In this paper, however, {{we assume that the}} population is composed of two ordered subpopulations and optimal burn-in procedures are studied in this context. Two types of risks are defined and an optimal <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedure,</b> which minimizes the weighted risks is studied. The joint optimal solutions for the optimal <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedure,</b> which minimizes the mean number of repairs during the field operation, are also investigated. ...|$|E
40|$|A system {{subject to}} a point process of shocks is considered. Shocks occur in {{accordance}} with a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Different criterions of system failures are discussed in a homogeneous case. Two natural settings are analyzed. Heterogeneity is modeled by an unobserved univariate random variable (frailty). It is shown that reliability (safety) analysis for a heterogeneous case can differ dramatically from that for a homogeneous setting. A shock <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedure</b> for a heterogeneous population is described. The corresponding bounds for the failure rates are obtained. ...|$|E

Its vertex detector, the VErtex LOcator (VELO), will {{operate in a}} harsh radiation environment with limited access due to its proximity to the LHC beam. To ensure the long term operation and performance, every module was required to pass a set of quality assurance tests. These were specifically developed for the VELO modules {{to take into account}} their operational environment and assembly steps. Each VELO module was rigorously inspected, tested and thermally cycled in the Glasgow module <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedures.</b> This paper provides details of the <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedures</b> and summarises the main results that were found. Some of the major results presented in this paper are: the full characterisation of the leakage currents; identification of bad channels; and signal to noise measurements. A few minor problems were identified through visual inspections of the modules and the feedback into the production process proved critical. As a result of the electrical and thermal tests, one module out of the 45 that were tested was rejected due to its thermal performance.

40|$|This article {{describes}} how CMOS IC technology scaling impacts semiconductor burn-in and burn-in procedures. Burn-in is a quality improvement procedure {{challenged by the}} high leakage currents that are rapidly increasing with IC technology scaling. These currents are expected to increase even more under the new burn-in environments leading to higher junction temperatures, possible thermal runaway, and yield loss of good parts during burn-in. The paper discusses the effect of junction temperature on device reliability, aging, and <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedure</b> optimization. The effect of device thermal runaway and the requirements it forces on commercial burn-in ovens, device package, and device cooling are also described...|$|E

40|$|This thesis brings {{statistical}} analyses techniques {{to bear on}} data derived from an extensive database of satellite launches and on-orbit anomalies and failures. The data collected is analyzed from two different perspectives and addresses, in two separate studies, two research objectives. The first study proposes to identify trends and cyclical patterns in the space industry, and to forecast the volume of launches {{for the next few}} years. Satellites have been rightfully described as the lifeblood of the entire space industry and the number of satellites ordered or launched per year is an important defining metric of the industry's level of activity. The structure of the space industry, its financial health and its workforce retention and development is dependent on the volume of satellites contracted. As such, trends and variability in this volume have significant strategic impact on the space industry. Over the past 40 + years, hundreds of satellites have been launched every year. Thus, an important data set is available for time series analysis and identification of trends and cycles in the various markets of the space industry. For the purpose of this first study, we collected data for over 6, 000 satellites launched since 1960 on a yearly basis. We separated the satellites into three broad segments: 1) defense and intelligence satellites, 2) science satellites, and 3) commercial satellites. Several techniques are available for the analysis of time series data, both in the time domain and in the frequency domain. In this first study, we conducted spectral analysis of the time series {{for each of the three}} satellite populations and identified cycles contained in the data. In addition, once harmonic models were derived and fitted to the data, we built forecasting models of satellite launch volumes in the different market segments for the next few years. The potential implications of the results are discussed as a number of strategic matters for the space industry are contingent on the predictions or forecast of the volume of satellites contracted (the example of the U. S. auto industry is a solemn reminder of such possible strategic issues). The second study uses the previously collected launch data, confined to Earth-orbiting satellites launched between 1990 and 2008, and expanded with the failure information and retirement of each satellite to conduct a comparative analysis of satellite reliability in GEO, LEO, and MEO orbits. Reliability has long been recognized as an essential consideration in the design of space systems. However, there is limited statistical analysis of satellite reliability based on actual flight data. The objective of this second study is to conduct nonparametric satellite reliability analysis, with orbit type as a covariate, and to explore appropriate parametric fits (Weibull, lognormal, and mixture distributions). The results indicate for example that differences exist between the failure behaviors of satellites in different orbits, or that satellite infant mortality exists or dominates more clearly in a particular orbit type. The findings can be useful to satellite manufacturers as they would provide an empirical basis for reviewing and adjusting satellite testing and <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedures.</b> M. S.

40|$|The conductivity, {{temperature}} {{behavior and}} thermal cycling stability of resistive materials, based on multi-walled carbon nanotube networks {{with and without}} polymer or epoxy matrixes, has been investigated. Pure carbon nanotube networks and polyethylene/CNT based composites require a prolonged <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedure</b> for the stabilization of the electrical characteristics while, {{in the case of}} epoxy/carbon nanotube compounds, a low resistivity, perfect ohmic behavior and an excellent long-term stability has been achieved for temperatures up to 160 °C for samples with a rather low carbon nanotube concentration. It has been demonstrated, that the epoxy matrix based carbon nanotube network resistors can be used as electrical heating elements and temperature sensors.

40|$|A highly {{accelerated}} lifetime test (HALT), is {{a stress}} testing methodology for accelerating product reliability that is universally {{conducted during the}} engineering development process. In conducting a HALT for circuit components, a <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedure</b> is executed, where the circuit/device is heated to a high temperature {{for a number of}} days until finally cooled back to room temperature in order for voltage, current or parameter variations to be compared. When such changes to voltage, cur- rent, or parameters are permanent, no amount of further burn-ins, cool downs or temperature cycling can return the parameter of interest back to its original value it held prior to the burn-in. This is called lifetime-drift and is a problem that circuit simulators do not model. The inability to simulate life-time drift leads to production delays, increasing costs and decreased reliability. In this thesis, I investigated the physics, created a circuit simulation model and implemented an easy-to-use utility for detecting and measuring lifetime drift in 0. 18 m BiCMOS high sheet resistance (RPH) polysilicon resistors. The circuit model was made using Cadence-Spectre and Verilog-A. The lifetime drift utility was written using Ocean scripting language. by Anartya Mandal. Thesis: M.

40|$|In {{the present}} chapter {{a variety of}} {{different}} electrically connected low density and high density multi-walled carbon nanotube networks will be presented, which have in common the use of the same type of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. In a first step the interconnection between single nanotubes has been investigated by means of SEM imaging and a shoestring-knot type connection has been found in the case of low-density CNT networks deposited on top of thermally oxidized silicon, that have been successively contacted by focused ion beam deposition of platinum contacts. In a second step, electrical contacts in a micro-gap configuration have been deposited first on the thermally oxidized silicon wafer and this micro-gap has been successively bridged by a high-density carbon nanotube network, deposited using the di-electrophoresis technique. In this case - after an initial <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedure</b> - a stable and at room-temperature linear current-voltage characteristics with a negative temperature coefficient of the resistance has been obtained. The measured temperature-dependence of the resistance is dominated by the interconnection resistance between the single nanotubes within a percolation path. Subsequently we investigated three different types of heterojunctions between crystalline silicon as base layers and spin-coating deposited organic thin film emitters with and without incorporated carbon nanotubes. In a first case the realization of inorganic/organic heterojunction solar cells with semiconducting PEDOT:PSS emitters has been demonstrated. Then we demonstrated, how a heterojunction between crystalline silicon and an oxadiazole based electron conducting polymer enables to produce a very simple electronic memory with reproducible bistabilities for applied bias voltages below 0. 6 V and finally we compared the diode properties of heterodiodes, where the organic emitter layer is formed by the multi-walled carbon nanotubes embedded into an isolating PMMA matrix. The Schottky type character of these type of heterodiodes becomes more and more pronounced, when the nanotube concentration in the PMMA layer increases. In a last set of experiments, we used the CNT networks in order to produce a strongly conducting tissue with fungal cells. The CNT’s have been added in vivo to the fungal cells and enabled them to form a mechanically stable tissue. The resulting bio-nanocomposite {{has been found to be}} stable even at elevated temperatures and in a the range between room temperature and 100 °C a linear increase of the conductivity with increasing temperature has been found with a temperature coefficient similar to that of the CNT network, deposited by di-electrophoresis into a micro-gap between aluminum contacts, as reported before...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{electronic}} parts at cryogenic temperatures (less than 100 C) for extreme environments {{is not well}} controlled or developed from a product quality and reliability point of view. This {{is in contrast to}} the very rigorous and well-documented procedures to qualify electronic parts for mission use in the 55 to 125 C temperature range. A similarly rigorous methodology for screening and evaluating electronic parts needs to be developed so that mission planners can expect the same level of high reliability performance for parts operated at cryogenic temperatures. A formal methodology for screening and qualifying electronic parts at cryogenic temperatures has been proposed. The methodology focuses on the base physics of failure of the devices at cryogenic temperatures. All electronic part reliability is based on the bathtub curve, high amounts of initial failures (infant mortals), a long period of normal use (random failures), and then an increasing number of failures (end of life). Unique to this is the development of custom screening procedures to eliminate early failures at cold temperatures. The ability to screen out defects will specifically impact reliability at cold temperatures. Cryogenic reliability is limited by electron trap creation in the oxide and defect sites at conductor interfaces. Non-uniform conduction processes due to process marginalities will be magnified at cryogenic temperatures. Carrier mobilities change by orders of magnitude at cryogenic temperatures, significantly enhancing the effects of electric field. Marginal contacts, impurities in oxides, and defects in conductor/conductor interfaces can all be magnified at low temperatures. The novelty is the use of an ultra-low temperature, short-duration quenching process for defect screening. The quenching process is designed to identify those defects that will precisely (and negatively) affect long-term, cryogenic part operation. This quenching process occurs at a temperature that is at least 25 C colder than the coldest expected operating temperature. This quenching process is the opposite of the standard <b>burn-in</b> <b>procedure.</b> Normal burn-in raises the temperature (and voltage) to activate quickly any possible manufacturing defects remaining in the device that were not already rejected at a functional test step. The proposed inverse burn-in or quenching process is custom-tailored to the electronic device being used. The doping profiles, materials, minimum dimensions, interfaces, and thermal expansion coefficients are all taken into account in determining the ramp rate, dwell time, and temperature...|$|E
