2500|$|Taste {{is a form}} of chemoreception {{which occurs}} in the {{specialised}} taste receptors in the mouth. To date, there are five different types of taste receptors known: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Each receptor has a different manner of sensory transduction: that is, of detecting the presence of a certain compound and starting an action potential which alerts the brain. It is a matter of debate whether each taste cell is tuned to one specific tastant or to several; Smith and Margolskee claim that [...] "gustatory neurons typically respond to more than one kind of stimulus, lthough each neuron responds most strongly to one tastant". Researchers believe that the brain interprets complex tastes by examining patterns from a large set of neuron responses. This enables the body to make [...] "keep or spit out" [...] decisions when {{there is more than one}} tastant present. [...] "No single neuron type alone is capable of discriminating among stimuli or different qualities, because a given cell can respond the same way to disparate stimuli." [...] As well, serotonin is thought to act as an intermediary hormone which communicates with taste cells within a taste bud, mediating the signals being sent to the <b>brain.</b> <b>Receptor</b> molecules are found on the top of microvilli of the taste cells.|$|E

5000|$|Early work {{developing}} sentic cycles in the 1970s {{had convinced}} Clynes also {{that it is}} easy with it for most people to proceed from experiencing one emotion to another quite rapidly. After three or four minutes of one emotion, a person tended to be being satiated with the current emotion. The ready switching to the next emotion with quite fresh experience pointed {{to the existence of}} specific receptors in the brain, he suggested, that become satiated with particular neurohormones; this was later confirmed by the identification of a number of such receptors.This finding links well with the historic tendency of composers to vary emotions every 4 minutes or so in their compositions. The human need for variety is based on <b>brain</b> <b>receptor</b> properties. As anyone who has seen more than three Charlie Chaplin movies in a row can testify, laughter, too, palls after prolonged exposure, {{and it seems to be}} for the same reason.Clynes also studied laughter, [...] "nature's arrow from appearance to reality". [...] In (nonderisive) laughter, according to Clynes, a small element of disorder is suddenly understood to be only apparently disordered, within an actual, larger, order. He then predicted the existence of soundless laughter, in which the sound production is replaced by tactile pressure at the same temporal pattern. In studies at UCSD the mean repetitions of the “ha's” was found to be approximately 5.18 per second. Clynes further hypothesized that couples with unmatched speeds of laughter might not be as readily compatible as those whose laughter was harmoniously coordinated.|$|E

The present study was designed to compare the accumulation of radioactivity by brain and uterus following 3 H-estradiol treatment in estrous, diestrous, and ovariectomized rats. Uterus exhibited high levels of radioactivity in diestrus, but not in estrus or the ovariectomized condition. The accumulation of hormone by brain did not fluctuate with the various levels of endogenous hormone stimulation, but rather showed a pattern of uptake similar to muscle, a nontarget tissue.

40|$|Studies on {{the effect}} of {{scopolamine}} on memory are abundant but so far only regulation of the muscarinic receptor (M 1) has been reported. We hypothesized that levels of other cholinergic brain receptors as the nicotinic receptors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, known to be involved in memory formation, would be modified by scopolamine administration. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were used for the experiments and divided into four groups. Two groups were given scopolamine 1 mg/kg i. p. (the first group was trained and the second group untrained) in the multiple T-maze (MTM), a paradigm for evaluation of spatial memory. Likewise, vehicle-treated mice were trained or untrained thus serving as controls. Hippocampal levels of M 1, nicotinic receptor alpha 4 (Nic 4) and 7 (Nic 7) and subunit NR 1 containing complexes were determined by immunoblotting on blue native gel electrophoresis. Vehicle-treated trained mice learned the task and showed memory retrieval on day 8, while scopolamine-treatment led to significant impairment of performance in the MTM. At the day of retrieval, hippocampal levels for M 1, Nic 7 and NR 1 were higher in the scopolamine treated groups than in vehicle-treated groups.

40|$|International audienceThe {{functional}} {{interactions between}} the Immune (IS) and the Central Nervous Systems (CNS) are clearly indicated by the fact these systems are sharing mediators and receptors. Interleukins and more specifically Interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) {{have been shown to}} be powerful regulators of both system activity which suggested IL- 1 receptors in the CNS. IL- 1 receptors, similar to type I lymphocyte receptors, have been characterized in murine nervous structures (dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and frontal cortex), in vascular structures (vessels, choroid plexus) and in a neuroendocrine structure (anterior pituitary). Stimulation of the immune system and of IL- 1 synthesis by bacterial product (intra peritoneal injection of LPS) induced a marked decrease of IL- 1 receptor levels in the CNS. Under the same conditions pituitary receptors were unaffected indicating the autonomy of brain functioning. This decrease is in relation with an increase in local IL- 1 synthesis as indicated by the increase of IL- 1 mRNA in the brain tissue. During viral infection (rabies virus) very similar results are observed. <b>Brain</b> <b>receptors</b> are decreasing in the brain at day 4 post infection while IL- 1 concentration is increasing in the <b>brain</b> tissue.
