The <b>base</b> <b>floor</b> also includes the county judge's courtroom, a vault for storage of county records, restrooms, and storage space. On the east side of the building, two flights of stairs lead to the second floor. The first flight consists of two separate stairways that combine around the base of a wider central flight ending at the second floor facing the entrance to the main courtroom. A second stairway is located south of the west end of the building's main central corridor and is used to provide access to offices and other facilities behind the upper courtroom and as use as a secondary fire escape. An elevator on the southeast side of the building also adjoins the two main floors.|$|E

Previous efforts to establish EUI indicators using subsystem average, data envelopment analysis (DEA), and regression technique are also studied. We propose that hotel energy benchmarking <b>based</b> on <b>floor</b> area is useful from the top-down management perspective.

Compared with the general energy benchmarking in the building sector, we find that the hotel sector lags behind in the adoption of computer modeling for benchmarking.

40|$|Sorption isotherms (moisture {{content as}} a {{function}} of relative humidity (RH) at equilibrium) are an important tool in designing buildings to limit moisture related problems. Normally only a single sorption curve is used so that each moisture content uniquely corresponds to one RH. Sometimes two curves are used, one curve for absorption and one for desorption, as {{it is well known that}} sorption has a strong hysteresis for most materials. However, in most situations, materials do not simply follow either absorption or desorption, but will follow scanning curves within the hystersis envelope. In this paper we discuss data on sorption hysteresis and scanning for a cement <b>based</b> <b>flooring</b> material. These data show that the RH-increase will be many times higher when the flooring material absorbs moisture from, e. g., water based adhesives, than would have been predicted by a model without scanning. Implications for expressing critical moisture levels are discussed...|$|R
