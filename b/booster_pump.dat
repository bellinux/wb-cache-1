5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine cowling by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E

25|$|A crash {{investigation}} revealed {{water in}} the fuel tank <b>booster</b> <b>pump.</b> Because water is more dense than fuel it can settle {{to the bottom of}} the tank, into the pump inlets; when it freezes it blocks inlets and deprives the engine of fuel.

25|$|The Sea Fury was {{powered by}} the newly {{developed}} Bristol Centaurus piston engine, which drove a five-bladed propeller. Many of the engine's subsystems, such as the fully automated cooling system, cockpit gauges, and fuel <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> were electrical, powered by an engine-driven generator supplemented by two independent batteries. The hydraulic system, necessary to operate the retractable undercarriage, tail hook, and flaps, was pressurised to 1,800 psi by an engine-driven pump. If this failed a hand pump in the cockpit could also power these systems, a pneumatic pump was also driven by the engine for the brakes. Internal fuel was stored {{in a total of}} five self-sealing fuel tanks, two within the fuselage {{directly in front of the}} cockpit and three housed within the wings.|$|E
25|$|Preparing the Vampire for {{take-off}} {{would only}} require pilots to perform six vital actions: setting the trim to neutral, opening {{the high and}} low-pressure fuel cocks, activating the <b>booster</b> <b>pump,</b> setting the flaps, and retracting the air brakes. If laden with external fuel tanks or bombs, pilots would have to retract the undercarriage quite quickly upon leaving the ground, else increasing airflow as the aircraft picked up speed would prevent the undercarriage doors from closing. Landing procedure was similarly free of complexity: disengaging the wheel brakes, lowering the undercarriage, setting the flaps to fully down, and effecting the air brakes. Typically, power-on landings were conducted due to the slow response of the engine to throttle changes, while the wheel brakes had to be applied carefully {{in order to avoid}} locking the wheels; there was no anti-lock braking system present.|$|E

25|$|During the war years, the C-46 {{was noted}} for an {{abnormal}} number of unexplained airborne explosions (31 between May 1943 and May 1945) that were initially attributed to various causes. In particular, the fuel system, which was quickly designed, then modified for the new, thirstier Pratt & Whitney engines, was criticized. The {{cause of the}} explosions was eventually traced to pooled gasoline from small leaks in the tanks and fuel system, combined with a spark, usually originating from open-contact electrical components. Though many service aircraft suffered small fuel leaks in use, the C-46's wings were unvented; if a leak occurred, the gasoline had nowhere to drain, but rather pooled at the wing root. Any spark or fire could set off an explosion. After the war, all C-46 aircraft received a wing vent modification to vent pooled gasoline, and an explosion-proof fuel <b>booster</b> <b>pump</b> was installed with shielded electrical selector switches {{in lieu of the}} open-contact type used originally.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum <b>booster</b> <b>pump,</b> plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|E

40|$|<b>Booster</b> <b>pumping</b> plants, {{equipped}} {{with a group of}} pump units operating in parallel, are typical objects of the city water supply system. Improving its power efficiency is a very urgent topical objective, because its power consumption is a significant part in the structure of power consumption of water utilities. The aim of the present study is to identify opportunities of improving the power efficiency of pumping stations due to the automatic control of the pump group. The paper presents results of the study of the instantaneous efficiency changes of <b>booster</b> <b>pumping</b> stations under the conditions of variable water consumption. The basic reasons of the reducing pumping plant efficiency are reported in the article. Among them, there is a sharp decline in the effectiveness of the regulated pump units, when they functioning for the hydraulic network with a significant static component of the pressure. The main factors affecting the duration of the adjustable pumping unit in inefficient area are determined. The method of controlling a group of pumping units, taking into account the instantaneous efficiency of each of them was suggested. The approbation of this method at the local <b>booster</b> <b>pumping</b> stations was fulfilled. The effects of disabling the controlled pump unit which is in the ineffective area, on the overall efficiency of the pumping station and on alteration of its output pressure immediately after the pump is switched off are studied. It was shown that the timely shutdown of an inefficiently controlled pump unit can reduce the power consumption of the pumping plant by 8 – 10 % as compared to the traditional control methods. The range of variation of the instantaneous efficiency of the pumping station can serve as a criterion of correct selection of pumping equipment as well it can be the rationale of the necessity for its replacement. </p...|$|R
50|$|Pressure drops over {{multi-stage}} separation {{can result}} in a drastic decline in flux performance in the latter stages of the process. This can be improved using <b>booster</b> <b>pumps</b> to increase the TMP in the final stages. This will incur a greater capital and energy cost which will be offset by the improved productivity of the process. With a multi-stage operation, retentate streams from each stage are recycled through the previous stage to improve their separation efficiency.|$|R
5|$|Fuel {{was carried}} in 14 bag tanks, {{four in the}} centre {{fuselage}} above and {{to the rear of}} the nosewheel bay and five in each outer wing. The tanks were split into four groups of almost equal capacity, each normally feeding its respective engine though cross-feeding was possible. The centre of gravity was automatically maintained by electric timers which sequenced the <b>booster</b> <b>pumps</b> on the tanks. B.2 aircraft could be fitted with one or two additional fuel tanks in the bomb-bay.|$|R

2500|$|The plane {{suddenly}} {{shook and}} its airspeed dropped precipitously. The left wing dropped {{and the plane}} began {{to turn to the}} left. Flight Engineer Forbes noted that the fuel flow meter was not indicating any flow to the No. 4 engine. Captain Claude quickly applied full throttle and ordered Forbes to apply the <b>booster</b> <b>pump,</b> which increases the fuel flow to the engines in emergencies. The captain applied full right aileron in an attempt to raise the dropping left wing, and ordered First Officer Lewis to raise the flaps and landing gear, intending to circle the airport and attempt another landing (known as a go-around). Lewis raised the landing gear but did not raise the flaps, stating later that he “was afraid” to raise them because he assumed that the airplane would immediately stall if he complied. [...] Lewis noticed that the No. 4 engine’s fuel pressure was zero and its RPM was dropping, and he feathered the prop, hoping that the resulting reduction in drag would help the airplane accelerate and climb. However, with the flaps down and only two of the four engines working, the DC-6 did not accelerate; it continued to drop, headed on a path crossing Runway 36 approximately 40 degrees to the left. The captain raised the airplane's nose in a futile attempt to climb, but the airliner stalled instead, striking the runway tail-first.|$|E
