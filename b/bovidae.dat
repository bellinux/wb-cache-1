5|$|The <b>Bovidae</b> are the {{biological}} family of cloven-hoofed, ruminant mammals that includes bison, African buffalo, water buffalo, antelopes, sheep, goats, muskoxen, and domestic cattle. A {{member of this}} family is called a bovid. With 143 extant species and 300 known extinct species, the family <b>Bovidae</b> consists of eight major subfamilies apart from the disputed Peleinae and Pantholopinae. The family evolved 20 million years ago, in the early Miocene.|$|E
5|$|The family <b>Bovidae</b> {{is placed}} in the order Artiodactyla (which {{includes}} the even-toed ungulates). It includes 143 extant species, accounting for nearly 55% of the ungulates, and 300 known extinct species.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{supported}} monophyly {{in the family}} <b>Bovidae</b> (a group of organisms comprises an ancestral species and all their descendants). The number of subfamilies in <b>Bovidae</b> is disputed, with suggestions {{of as many as}} ten and as few as two subfamilies. However, molecular, morphological and fossil evidence indicates the existence of eight distinct subfamilies : Aepycerotinae (consisting of just the impala), Alcelaphinae (bontebok, hartebeest, wildebeest and relatives), Antilopinae (several antelopes, gazelles, and relatives), Bovinae (cattle, buffaloes, bison and other antelopes), Caprinae (goats, sheep, ibex, serows and relatives), Cephalophinae (duikers), Hippotraginae (addax, oryx and relatives) and Reduncinae (reedbuck and kob antelopes). In addition, three extinct subfamilies are known: Hypsodontinae (mid-Miocene), Oiocerinae (Turolian) and the subfamily Tethytraginae, which contains Tethytragus (mid-Miocene).|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum, London {{divided the}} eight major subfamilies of <b>Bovidae</b> into two major clades {{on the basis}} of their {{evolutionary}} history: the Boodontia, which comprised only the Bovinae, and the Aegodontia, which consisted of the rest of the subfamilies. Boodonts have somewhat primitive teeth, resembling those of oxen, whereas aegodonts have more advanced teeth like those of goats.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} is {{the sole}} living member of the genus Antilope and is classified under the family <b>Bovidae.</b> The species was described and given its binomial name by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758. Antilope also includes fossil species, such as A. subtorta, A. planicornis, and A. intermedius.|$|E
5|$|The {{common eland}} was first {{described}} in 1766 by the German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas. It {{belongs to the}} order Artiodactyla, family <b>Bovidae</b> and subfamily Bovinae. Common elands are sometimes {{considered part of the}} genus Tragelaphus on the basis of molecular phylogenetics, but are usually categorized as Taurotragus, along with the giant eland (T. derbianus).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Bovidae</b> family {{ancestors}} of the common eland evolved approximately 20 million years ago in Africa; fossils are found throughout Africa and France but the best record appears in sub-Saharan Africa. The first members of the tribe Tragelaphini appear 6 million years in the past during the late Miocene. An extinct ancestor of the common eland (Taurotragus arkelli) appears in the Pleistocene in northern Tanzania and the first T. oryx fossil appears in the Holocene in Algeria.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} {{is the sole}} member of the genus Tetracerus, and is placed under the family <b>Bovidae.</b> The species was first described by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1816. The {{four-horned antelope}} has only one other relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus). The Boselaphini have the horns with a keel {{on the front and}} lack rings as found in other antelope groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} diversities of bovids {{occur in}} Africa. The maximum concentration of species {{is in the}} savannas of eastern Africa. Other bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. <b>Bovidae</b> includes {{three of the five}} domesticated mammals whose use has spread outside their original ranges, namely cattle, sheep, and goats. Dairy products such as milk, butter, and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle. Bovids also provide leather, meat, and wool.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} nilgai is Boselaphus tragocamelus. The nilgai is the sole member of the genus Boselaphus {{and placed in the}} family <b>Bovidae.</b> The species was described and given its binomial name by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. He based his description on a 1745 account of a male nilgai by British physician James Parsons in the 43rd volume of Philosophical Transactions (now known as the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society). The nilgai has one other relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the four-horned antelope (the sole member of Tetracerus).|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} royal antelope is Neotragus pygmaeus. It {{is placed in the}} genus Neotragus and the family <b>Bovidae.</b> It was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae (1758). German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas recognised two species â€“ Tragulus pygmaeus and Antilope pygmaea. However, both of them were found to have the same type, the royal antelope. Hence these were treated as synonyms for N. pygmaeus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bovidae</b> have {{featured}} in stories {{since at least}} the time of Aesop's fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Fables by Aesop include The Crow and the Sheep, The Frog and the Ox, and The Wolf and the Lamb. The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that might end with a snake's head, was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. The sheep, synonymous with the goat in Chinese mythology, is the eighth animal of the Chinese zodiac, and a symbol of filial piety.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} (Connochaetes taurinus), {{also called}} the common wildebeest, white-bearded wildebeest or brindled gnu, is a large antelope {{and one of the}} two species of wildebeest. It is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family <b>Bovidae</b> and has a close taxonomic relationship with the black wildebeest. The blue wildebeest is known to have five subspecies. This broad-shouldered antelope has a muscular, front-heavy appearance, with a distinctive robust muzzle. Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown, and begin to take on their adult colouration at the age of two months. The adults' hues range from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or even grayish brown. Both sexes possess a pair of large curved horns.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} of bovids {{has contributed}} in shifting {{the dependence of}} human beings from hunting and gathering to agriculture. The <b>Bovidae</b> include {{three of the five}} domesticated mammals whose use has spread outside their original ranges, namely cattle, sheep, and goats; all are from Eurasia, and are now found across the world. The other two species are the horse and pig. Other large bovids that have been domesticated but which remain within the ranges of their wild ancestors are the water buffalo (from the Indian water buffalo), domestic yak (from the wild yak), zebu (from the Indian aurochs), gayal (from the gaur) and Bali cattle (from the banteng).|$|E
5|$|The present genera of Alcelaphinae {{appeared}} in the Pliocene. The extinct Alcelaphine genus Paramularius, {{that was the same}} in size as the hartebeest, is believed to have come into being in the Pliocene, but became extinct in the middle Pleistocene. Several genera of Hippotraginae are known since the Pliocene and Pleistocene. This subfamily appears to have diverged from the Alcelaphinae {{in the latter part of}} early Miocene. The Bovinae are believed to have diverged from the rest of the <b>Bovidae</b> in the early Miocene. The Boselaphini became extinct in Africa in the early Pliocene; their latest fossils were excavated in Langebaanweg (South Africa) and Lothagam (Kenya).|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} addax is Addax nasomaculatus. This antelope was first described by French zoologist and anatomist Henri Blainville in 1816. It {{is placed in the}} monotypic genus Addax and family <b>Bovidae.</b> Henri Blainville observed syntypes in Bullock's Pantherion and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. English naturalist Richard Lydekker stated their type locality to be probably Senegambia, though he did not have anything to support the claim. Finally, from a discussion in 1898, it became more probable that British hunters or collectors obtained the addax from the part of Sahara in Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the <b>Bovidae,</b> where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E
5|$|The wildebeests, {{also called}} gnus, are a genus of antelopes, {{scientific}} name Connochaetes. They {{belong to the}} family <b>Bovidae,</b> which includes antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep and other even-toed horned ungulates. Connochaetes includes two species, both native to Africa: the black wildebeest, or white-tailed gnu (C. gnou); and the blue wildebeest, or brindled gnu (C. taurinus). Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago, resulting in a northern and a southern species. The blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species, while the black wildebeest changed more in order to adapt to its open grassland habitat in the south. The most obvious way of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring {{and in the way}} their horns are oriented.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} hartebeest is Alcelaphus buselaphus. First described by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766, it is classified in the genus Alcelaphus {{and placed in the}} family <b>Bovidae.</b> In 1979, palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba supported Sigmoceros as a separate genus for Lichtenstein's hartebeest, a kind of hartebeest, as she assumed it was related to Connochaetes (wildebeest). She had analysed the skull characters of living and extinct species of antelope to make a cladogram, and argued that a wide skull linked Lichtenstein's hartebeest with Connochaetes. However, this finding was not replicated by Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum, who classified it as an independent species of Alcelaphus. Zoologists such as Jonathan Kingdon and Theodor Haltenorth considered it to be a subspecies of A. buselaphus. Vrba dissolved the new genus in 1997 after reconsideration. An MtDNA analysis could find no evidence to support a separate genus for Lichtenstein's hartebeest. It also showed the tribe Alcelaphini to be monophyletic, and discovered close affinity between the Alcelaphus and the sassabies (genus Damaliscus)â€”both genetically and morphologically.|$|E
25|$|The bovids (family <b>Bovidae)</b> {{comprise}} some 140 {{species of}} ruminants in {{which at least}} the males bear unbranched, hollow horns covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most species of bovids have means of spacing themselves across their habitat; territorial behavior is the most consistent type of spacing behavior.|$|E
500|$|The {{springbok}} is {{the sole}} member of the genus Antidorcas and {{is placed in the}} family <b>Bovidae.</b> [...] It was first described by the German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1780. Zimmermann assigned the genus Antilope (blackbuck) to the springbok. In 1845, Swedish zoologist Carl Jakob Sundevall placed the springbok in Antidorcas, a genus of its own.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} bohor reedbuck is Redunca redunca. The animal is placed under the genus Redunca and in the family <b>Bovidae.</b> It was first described by German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas in 1767. The three species of Redunca, including the bohor reedbuck, are the least derived [...] members of the tribe Reduncini (except the genus Pelea). The order of size in the genus Redunca is an evidence supporting the descent of the reduncines from a small ancestor.|$|E
500|$|The bohor reedbuck (Redunca redunca) is an {{antelope}} {{native to}} central Africa. The animal is {{placed under the}} genus Redunca and in the family <b>Bovidae.</b> It was first described by German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas in 1767. The bohor reedbuck has five subspecies. The head-and-body length of this medium-sized antelope is typically between [...] Males reach approximately [...] at the shoulder, while females reach [...] Males typically weigh [...] and females [...] This sturdily built antelope has a yellow to grayish brown coat. Only the males possess horns which measure about [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The {{common eland}} (Taurotragus oryx), {{also known as}} the {{southern}} eland or eland antelope, is a savannah and plains antelope found in East and Southern Africa. It is a species of the family <b>Bovidae</b> and genus Taurotragus. It was first described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. An adult male is around 1.6metres (5') tall at the shoulder (females are 20centimetres (8") shorter) and can weigh up to [...] with an average of , [...] for females). It is the second largest antelope in the world, being slightly smaller on average than the giant eland.|$|E
500|$|The {{lesser kudu}} (Tragelaphus imberbis) is a forest {{antelope}} found in East Africa. It {{is placed in}} the genus Tragelaphus and family <b>Bovidae.</b> It was first described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1869. The head-and-body length is typically [...] Males reach about [...] at the shoulder, while females reach [...] Males typically weigh [...] and females [...] The females and juveniles have a reddish-brown coat, while the males become yellowish grey or darker after the age of two years. Horns are present only on males. The spiral horns are [...] long, and have two to two-and-a-half twists.|$|E
500|$|The black {{wildebeest}} or white-tailed gnu (Connochaetes gnou) {{is one of}} the two {{closely related}} wildebeest species. It {{is a member of the}} genus Connochaetes [...] and family <b>Bovidae.</b> It was first described in 1780 by Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann. The black wildebeest is typically between [...] in head-and-body length, and the average weight is [...] Males stand up to approximately [...] at the shoulder, while the height of the females is [...] The black wildebeest is characterised by its white, long, horse-like tail. It also has a dark brown to black coat and long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} lesser kudu is Tragelaphus imberbis. The animal is classified under the genus Tragelaphus in family <b>Bovidae.</b> It was first described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1869. The generic name, Tragelaphus, derives from Greek word tragos, meaning a male goat, and elaphos, which means a deer, while the specific name imberbis comes from the Latin term meaning unbearded, referring to this kudu's lack of mane. The vernacular name kudu (or koodoo) could have originated either from the Afrikaans koedoe or the Khoikhoi kudu. The term [...] "lesser" [...] denotes the smaller size of this antelope {{as compared to the}} greater kudu.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} oribi is Ourebia ourebi. The sole member of its genus, the oribi is placed under the family <b>Bovidae.</b> The species was first described by the German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1782. The oribi was formerly included in the tribe Neotragini, that comprised {{a variety of other}} dwarf antelopes, including Dorcatragus (beira), Madoqua (dik dik), Neotragus, Oreotragus (klipspringer) and Raphicerus. In 1963, German mammalogist Theodor Haltenorth separated the oribi and Raphicerus into a new tribe, Raphicerini; later on, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon assigned the oribi to Ourebini, a tribe of its own. The common name [...] "oribi" [...] (...) comes from the Afrikaans name for the animal, oorbietjie.|$|E
500|$|The wildebeest, or {{the genus}} Connochaetes, is {{placed under the}} family <b>Bovidae</b> and {{subfamily}} Alcelaphinae, where its closest relatives are the hartebeest (Alcelaphus spp.), the hirola (Beatragus hunteri) and species in the genus Damaliscus, such as the topi, the tsessebe, the blesbok and the bontebok. The name Connochaetes was given by German zoologist Hinrich Lichtenstein in 1812. Wildebeest were first discovered about 1700 by Dutch settlers {{on their way to}} the interior of South Africa. Due to their resemblance to wild cattle, these people called them [...] "wild ox" [...] or [...] "wildebeest". The blue wildebeest was first known to westerners in the northern part of South Africa a century later, in the 1800s.|$|E
500|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{was first}} described by English naturalist William John Burchell in 1823 {{and he gave}} it the scientific name Connochaetes taurinus. It shares the genus Connochaetes with the black wildebeest (C. gnou), and {{is placed in the}} family <b>Bovidae,</b> ruminant animals with cloven hooves. The generic name Connochaetes derives from the Greek words ÎºÏŒÎ½Î½Î¿Ï‚, kÃ³nnos, [...] "beard", and Ï‡Î±Î¯Ï„Î·, khaÃ­tÄ“, [...] "flowing hair", [...] "mane". The specific name taurinus originates from the Greek word tauros, which means a bull or bullock. The common name [...] "blue wildebeest" [...] refers to the conspicuous, silvery-blue sheen of the coat, while the alternative name [...] "gnu" [...] originates from the name for these animals used by the Khokloi people, a native pastoralist people of southwestern Africa.|$|E
500|$|The impala is {{the sole}} member of the genus Aepyceros and belongs to the family <b>Bovidae.</b> It was first {{described}} by German zoologist Martin Hinrich Carl Lichtenstein in 1812. In 1984, palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba opined that the impala is a sister taxon to the alcelaphines, given its resemblance to the hartebeest. A 1999 phylogenetic study by Alexandre Hassanin (of the National Centre for Scientific Research, Paris) and colleagues, based on mitochondrial and nuclear analyses, showed that the impala forms a clade with the suni (Neotragus moschatus). This clade is sister to another formed by the bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis) and the klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus). An rRNA and Î²-spectrin nuclear sequence analysis in 2003 also supported an association between Aepyceros and Nesotragus. The following cladogram {{is based on the}} 1999 study: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} black wildebeest is Connochaetes gnou. The animal {{is placed in the}} genus Connochaetes and family <b>Bovidae</b> and was first described by the German zoologist, Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1780. He based his description on an article written by natural philosopher Jean-Nicolas-SÃ©bastien Allamand in 1776. The generic name Connochaetes derives from the Greek words ÎºÏŒÎ½Î½Î¿Ï‚, kÃ³nnos, [...] "beard", and Ï‡Î±Î¯Ï„Î·, khaÃ­tÄ“, [...] "flowing hair", [...] "mane". The specific name [...] "gnou" [...] originates from the Khoikhoi name for these animals, gnou. The common name [...] "gnu" [...] is also said to have originated from the Hottentot name T'gnu, which refers to the repeated calls of [...] "ge-nu" [...] by the bull in the mating season.

2500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} bongo is Tragelaphus eurycerus, and {{it belongs to the}} genus Tragelaphus and family <b>Bovidae.</b> It was first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1837. The generic name Tragelaphus is composed of two Greek words: tragos, meaning a male goat; and elaphos, meaning deer. The specific name eurycerus originated from the fusion of eurus (broad, widespread) and keras (an animal's horn). The common name [...] "bongo" [...] originated probably from the Kele language of Gabon. The first known use of the name [...] "bongo" [...] dates back to 1861.|$|E
