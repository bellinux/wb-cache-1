The study consisted of two parts; a survey of 90 dairy farms in Khartoum State and an experiment carried out on 16 lactating dairy cows in the Judiciary farm. These cows {{were divided into two}} groups: A and B (8 cows in each group). Group A was distributed in eight pens and given <b>balanced</b> <b>ration,</b> whereas group B was fed as practiced in the farm.

Introduction: Never {{before in the}} history of our country has either the demand for pork been so great or were there so many hogs raised as at the present time. Corn is and always will be " King of the feed yard: Swine cannot subsist upon dry fodder as do the ruminants, and as corn is the most abundant and convenient grain to feed, it has, in the past, been almost the only grain fed to hogs. With the advance of Agricultural Science, the study of feeds for live stock has radically changed the feeding methods in the great stock producing regions. The necessity of foods richer in protein than corn, to form with corn a <b>balanced</b> <b>ration,</b> has increased the demand for the various mill by-products beyond the supply. Not only is the <b>balanced</b> <b>ration</b> more economical but more healthful. In the past each great corn year has been followed by wide spread ravages of hog cholera.

Though clover and alfalfa is the cheapest of feeds in their season, some other protein feed must be provided for the winter months.

40|$|This NebGuide {{provides}} {{tips on how}} {{to determine}} feeds you should analyze and nutrients to measure. It tells how to interpret the results of feed analysis. Why Test Feeds? Nutrient concentration can vary considerably in feeds, especially forages. Protein in alfalfa hay can range from 10 to 25 {{percent or more of the}} dry matter; grass hay will contain between four and 18 percent protein. Use feed tests to target specific feeds to different livestock. Feed high quality forage to the most productive livestock or when nutrient needs are highest. Feed lower quality forage to animals with lower nutrient needs. Feed tests can help establish the dollar value of a forage, in the cash market or in personal use inventories. Use these tests to establish the value of your forage and to help determine what forages to feed, buy, or sell. Forage tests are useful to evaluate production practices like fertilization, time of harvest, method of harvest, etc., that may influence forage quality. Management skills can improve by learning how changes in production practices affect the quality of your forages. Livestock are most productive when fed a <b>ration</b> <b>balanced</b> according to their nutrient needs. Unfortunately, many <b>rations</b> are <b>balanced</b> using average values for each feedstuff. These so-called 2 ̆ 2 book values 2 ̆ 2 often result in over- or under-feeding certain nutrients.
