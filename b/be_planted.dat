5|$|Cacti {{may also}} <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> {{outdoors}} in regions with suitable climates. Concern for water conservation in arid regions {{has led to}} the promotion of gardens requiring less watering (xeriscaping). For example, in California, the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication of a book on plants and landscapes for summer-dry climates. Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{developed}} a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an antecedent period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in southwest Asia, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Current models indicate that wild stands that had been harvested previously started to <b>be</b> <b>planted,</b> but were not immediately domesticated.|$|E
5|$|Bell alleged in his 2003 {{lawsuit that}} the {{government}} employees had actually planted an illegal GPS tracking device in his car months before the one ostensibly allowed by the October 2000 warrant, at least as early as Bell's April 2000 release from prison. The information from that prior device could not be used, however, {{because there was no}} warrant allowing it to <b>be</b> <b>planted.</b> Bell also alleged that federal government employees had also illegally planted a GPS tracking transmitter in a vehicle he drove in June 1998, one which the government never disclosed. Bell further stated that his defense lawyers colluded to keep Bell from being able to demand disclosure of all such secretly planted devices.|$|E

5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> at any time of year.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Glynne's {{focus was}} on cereal diseases, {{especially}} soil-borne varieties. She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or flattening of wheat close to harvest was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains of cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains of cereal should <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E
5|$|For potted flowers a lower {{temperature}} {{is used for}} precooling (5°C for 15 weeks), followed by 16°C–18°C in a greenhouse. For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), bulbs are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20°C after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9°C in September for 17–18 (cut flowers) or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks. The bulbs can then <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> in cold frames, and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements.|$|E

5|$|Known to Māori as tī kōuka, {{the tree}} {{was used as a}} source of food, {{particularly}} in the South Island, where it was cultivated in areas where other crops would not grow. It provided durable fibre for textiles, anchor ropes, fishing lines, baskets, waterproof rain capes and cloaks, and sandals. Hardy and fast growing, C.australis is widely planted in New Zealand gardens, parks and streets, and numerous cultivars are available. The tree can also be found in large numbers in island restoration projects such as Tiritiri Matangi Island, where it was among the first seedling trees to <b>be</b> <b>planted.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{radiation}} doses {{received in}} these two accidents are not known with any semblance of accuracy. A {{large part of the}} dose was due to neutron radiation, which could not be measured by dosimetry equipment of the day. The available equipment, film badges, were not worn by personnel during the accident, and badges that were supposed to <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> under tables in case of disasters like these were not found. Disaster badges hung on the walls did provide some useful data about gamma radiation.|$|E

5|$|Boletus edulis {{grows in}} some areas where it is not {{believed}} to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and silver birch in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where {{it is likely to}} have been introduced, probably on the roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and {{is believed to have been}} introduced with the import of pine trees. It also grows in pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less than ideal climate of the wine region. While the grape is permitted to <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in the wine market. The grape is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine. It {{can be in the}} eastern Mediterranean wine regions of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon.|$|E

5|$|Narcissi are now {{popular as}} {{ornamental}} plants for gardens, parks and as cut flowers, providing colour {{from the end}} of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions. They {{are one of the most}} popular spring flowers and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops, being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers, though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production. Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers. They are normally sold as dry bulbs to <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> in late summer and autumn. They are one of the most economically important ornamental plants. Plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double, triple, or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments. Many of the breeding programs have concentrated on the corona (trumpet or cup), in terms of its length, shape, and colour, and the surrounding perianth or even as in varieties derived from N. poeticus a very reduced form.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E
