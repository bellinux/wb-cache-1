5|$|It {{was moved}} to its current {{location}} on St George's Street {{at the edge of}} the village, although the date when this was done is unclear. The site where the cross now stands was levelled in 1776 by workmen, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion that the cross was moved. An alternative local tradition is that it was moved in 1825, although a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} section of the Jubilee line was planned in the 1970s, {{the second phase of the}} project was {{intended}} to continue the line eastwards from the terminus at Charing Cross to the City of London, Woolwich and Thamesmead. Westminster station would not have <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> planned route, but the need to provide transport infrastructure for the redevelopment of the London Docklands in east and south-east London led to a redirection of the route to run via Westminster to connect Waterloo and London Bridge stations with the new developments. For the Jubilee Line Extension, the buildings around the station were demolished and the sub-surface station was completely reconstructed together with the erection of a parliamentary office building, Portcullis House, which sits above the station. Both projects were designed by Michael Hopkins & Partners.|$|E

Carabott found that as the series progressed and the mystery around the character was lessened, Rousseau was unable to deliver the same impact she made in her first appearance. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club commended Mira Furlan's performance, writing, [...] " [...] an unreliable historian of the island in the best way.

500|$|Nearby was {{an older}} cross known as the Butter Cross which was {{constructed}} in the late 14th or early 15th century and once stood in the High Street, possibly {{at the southern end}} of the high street, and was moved to its current location on the edge of the village possibly in 1825, however a drawing by J.

The site where the cross now stands was leveled in 1776 by workman, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion that the cross was moved.

The chancel was built between 1556 and 1558 for Lady Katheryn Bulkeley, who had formerly been the Abbess of Godstow. The south porch is dated 1634, {{but this was the}} date it was repaired rather than the date of its building. The church was rebuilt and restored between 1859 and 1862, and there was a further restoration by J.Medland Taylor in 1878–80. [...] In the 20th century, a cloakroom was added.|$|E
2500|$|Golden Green is a hamlet within Hadlow parish. A mill {{may have}} <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> site since Domesday. This Grade II listed mill {{is the only}} mill on the Bourne to retain most of its milling machinery. The {{internal}} waterwheel is of iron, and is breast shot. It is [...] diameter and [...] wide. on a cast iron axle. The pit wheel is [...] diameter and has 120 cogs, driving a [...] diameter wallower with 35 teeth on a [...] diameter wooden upright shaft. The Great Spur Wheel is [...] diameter and has 92 cogs. The date 1848 is on a plinth {{at the bottom of}} the Upright shaft, and may indicate the date of the existing waterwheel and machinery. The crown wheel was used latterly to drive the electricity generator, with one of the stone nuts being adapted as the driven gear. The mill had two pairs of millstones and last ground corn c.1920. The sack hoist does not survive. In the early-mid 20th century, the mill was used to generate electricity, but the apparatus has now been removed. The mill was also known as Bourneside Mill and Victoria Mill (Victoria Road is downstream of the mill). The outbuildings around the mill have been converted into holiday cottages.|$|E
2500|$|Greg Shipperd {{publicly}} {{suggested that}} Ponting could be selected as a reserve wicket-keeper {{for the upcoming}} West Indies tour, despite not keeping-wicket for Tasmania. However, he had kept wicket in pre-season matches and during centre wicket practice. In any case Ponting was selected as a specialist batsman. [...] "...It was like all my birthdays had come at once. I had some reservations about making my Test debut against arguably the best fast bowling attack in the world", Ponting later said. The West Indies had been cricket's powerhouse for close to two decades and teams included many feared fast bowlers. Before the tour, Australian captain Mark Taylor thought the last Test batting vacancy was possibly between Ponting and Justin Langer. [...] "Ricky Ponting is more the stroke player while Justin is the tough man. It depends on what we need at the time but you can probably say Ricky has his neck in front because he's <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> tour [...] ", Taylor said. Rod Marsh believed Ponting's attitude and fearless approach could tear the West Indies apart. Nevertheless, Ponting {{did not expect to}} be selected. Steve Waugh noted that Ponting would [...] "not be intimidated by the West Indians' inevitable waist-to-chin length." [...] During the series, Ponting said the current crop of bowlers were not [...] "of the same high class" [...] that opposition teams had come to expect from the West Indies.|$|E
