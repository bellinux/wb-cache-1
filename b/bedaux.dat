25|$|<b>Bedaux</b> became {{associated}} {{with one of}} Taylor's circle, Harrington Emerson, whose consultancy, Emerson Consulting, <b>Bedaux</b> emulated in sectors additional to engineering. In 1916 he established a consulting firm in Cleveland, the Chas. E. <b>Bedaux</b> Company.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bedaux</b> also mimicked Frank Gilbreth by {{introducing}} a motion study Kodascope package which he propagated with an early <b>Bedaux</b> client, Kodak.|$|E
50|$|Mark A. <b>Bedau</b> is an American philosopher {{who works}} in the field of {{artificial}} life. He is the son of the late philosopher Hugo Adam <b>Bedau.</b>|$|R

25|$|The fiasco {{prompted}} {{many employers}} using the <b>Bedaux</b> System, and those derived from it, {{to change its}} terminology to more neutral and administrative language. This goes some way to explain why historical research into the enduring influence of the <b>Bedaux</b> System and its <b>Bedaux</b> Unit has been reported as difficult to undertake.|$|E
25|$|From then on, {{commentators}} conceptually linked <b>Bedaux</b> and his B {{system with}} fascism, and Taylor's remaining supporters, {{particularly those in}} the Taylor Society, distanced themselves from <b>Bedaux.</b>|$|E
25|$|Charles Eugène <b>Bedaux</b> (10 October 1886 – 18 February 1944) was a French-born American millionaire {{who made}} his fortune {{developing}} and implementing the work measurement aspect of scientific management, notably the <b>Bedaux</b> System. Considered {{one of the most}} eccentric millionaires of the early twentieth century, <b>Bedaux</b> was friends with British royalty and Nazis alike, and was a management consultant, big game hunter and explorer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bedau</b> {{notes that}} weak {{emergence}} {{is not a}} universal metaphysical solvent, as weak emergence leads {{to the conclusion that}} matter itself contains elements of awareness to it. However, <b>Bedau</b> concludes that adopting this view would provide a precise notion that emergence is involved in consciousness, and second, the notion of weak emergence is metaphysically benign.|$|R
50|$|Mark <b>Bedau</b> and Norman Packard {{developed}} a statistical method of classifying evolutionary systems and in 1997, <b>Bedau</b> et al. applied these statistics to Evita, an Artificial life model similar to Tierra and Avida, but with limited organism interaction and no parasitism, {{and concluded that}} Tierra-like systems do not exhibit the open-ended evolutionary signatures of naturally evolving systems.|$|R

25|$|On 3 June 1937, Charles and Fern <b>Bedaux</b> {{hosted the}} wedding of Wallis Warfield and Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor at the château. <b>Bedaux</b> then {{arranged}} the couple's honeymoon to the Third Reich, where they publicly met the Führer, Adolf Hitler.|$|E
25|$|On 13 January 1943 <b>Bedaux</b> was in Algeria {{allegedly}} {{supervising the}} construction of a German pipeline when he and his son were arrested by the Americans. He was kept in custody without charge for a year. <b>Bedaux</b> was eventually flown to the US, and, awaiting charges of trading with the enemy and treason, committed suicide using an overdose of barbiturates while in FBI custody in Miami, Florida. His death featured prominently in the contemporary media, particularly an influential New Yorker biographical trilogy by Janet Flanner. Here, Flanner attacked the <b>Bedaux</b> System and <b>Bedaux</b> Unit as, despite Bedaux's verbose claims to originality, she argued that they did not differ 'much from the old Frederick Winslow Taylor shop-management system of the nineties'.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Bedaux</b> {{consultancy}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} of its kind and within a decade its success allowed for the creation of a string of consultancy firms across the United States, Europe, and eventually throughout Africa, India, Australia and the Orient administered by the parent company, <b>Bedaux</b> Internationale.|$|E

25|$|Of Bedaux's {{business}} empire, <b>Bedaux</b> Britain {{was particularly}} lucrative. Here, the <b>Bedaux</b> Unit {{was so successful}} that it was copied by industrial firms such as Rowntree's of York (a corporate member of the Taylor Society), Mander Brothers of Wolverhampton, and influential consultancies including Urwick, Orr & Partners.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Bedaux</b> Canadian Sub-Arctic Expedition was {{the grand}} title <b>Bedaux</b> {{gave to the}} {{expedition}} he formed to cross the wilderness of Northern British Columbia, Canada in 1934. Mostly, the expedition was a publicity stunt, {{but it was also}} formed to test out the new Citroën half-track cars that were being developed by Bedaux's friend André Citroën.|$|E
25|$|Swannell {{was sent}} by the Canadian {{government}} to map {{the route of the}} ill-conceived <b>Bedaux</b> Expedition of 1934. The expedition was intended to run 2,400 kilometers from Edmonton, Alberta to Telegraph Creek, British Columbia and was led by American, Charles <b>Bedaux,</b> who was acquainted with car manufacturer, Andre Citroen, who designed the Kégresse track equipped half-track trucks <b>Bedaux</b> used on his journey. Aside from Beduax and Swannell were fellow mapmaker, Ernest Lemarque, three women: Bedaux's wife, an Italian countess, and a maid, several cameramen, a group of cowboys from Alberta, and the man who would direct the film High Noon, filmmaker, Floyd Crosby. Of the five Citroens, two slid off of cliffs, one was sent downriver and the last two were abandoned. The expedition continued on horseback, but in late September, with winter fast approaching and the horses beginning to die of disease and starvation, <b>Bedaux</b> called a halt to the trip just short of their destination.|$|E
