2500|$|With {{the advent}} of shaped projectiles, such as the First Strike, and the {{resulting}} development of magazine fed markers, a considerable increase in range, accuracy and MILSIM realism was gained. [...] Functionally speaking, magazine-fed markers are no {{different than any other}} paintball marker, with one exception. [...] Instead of paintballs being gravity fed from a bulky hopper, which sits above the marker, shaped projectiles (or paintballs) are fed from a spring-loaded magazine {{from the bottom of the}} marker. [...] The caliber of both the gravity fed and magazine fed markers are the same (.68 caliber) and the velocities are also generally the same. [...] The increased range and accuracy of the shaped projectile comes from the higher <b>ballistic</b> <b>coefficient</b> that the shaped projectile has, and the gyroscopic spin imparted onto the projectile from a rifled barrel and fins on the projectile itself. [...] Magazine fed markers and shaped projectiles have allowed marker designs to more closely approximate the styling and functionality of actual (real steel) firearms, which intern has given paintball a better avenue to compete with Airsoft in the MilSiM environment.|$|E
