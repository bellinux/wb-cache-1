40|$|Abstract Background Glomerulonephritis in dogs {{has been}} {{associated}} with B. burgdorferi infections. In <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Dogs</b> with glomerulonephritis antibodies against B. burgdorferi have been found in most dogs, raising the question if the breed is predisposed to infections with B. burgdorferi. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi sensu lato in a well defined population of <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Dogs</b> and to compare this prevalence with data from dogs of other breeds. Results 160 <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Dogs</b> and 62 control dogs (large breed dogs with long hair) were included. All dogs were considered healthy according to a questionnaire filled out by the owner, complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinalysis and urine culture. <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Dogs</b> and control dogs were kept in similar environments. Seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi was assessed by ELISA and Western blot and was 58 % in <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Dogs</b> compared to 15 % in control dogs. This difference was significant. Neither antibodies against leptospires nor vaccination or hair coat color influenced the results. Conclusion The cause of the considerably higher prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Dogs</b> and it's consequences are not known. A breed predisposition can be suspected. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} suggests that low serum concentrations of the third component of complement (C 3) are associated with both the susceptibility to infectious agents such as Borrelia burgdorferi {{and the development of}} glomerular disease. We hypothesized that low levels of C 3 are associated with the coincident occurrence of B. burgdorferi infection and glomerulonephritis in <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs.</b> Objectives: The aims of this study were to evaluate the serum concentration of C 3 in <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> with and without antibodies against B. burgdorferi and to compare this concentration with that of healthy control dogs. Methods: Eighty-three clinically healthy <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> and 46 control dogs were included. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were determined using an ELISA with a whole cell sonicate as antigen. Results were confirmed using Western blot. C 3 was measured using a single radial immunodiffusion test. Results were reported as the percentage concentration of C 3 compared with that in pooled preserved canine serum (100 % C 3 concentration). Results: Median C 3 concentration was 128. 5 % in <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> with antibodies against B. burgdorferi, 133. 5 % in B. burgdorferi-negative <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs,</b> 87. 8 % in positive control dogs, and 102. 2 % in negative control <b>dogs.</b> Within <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> and control groups, C 3 was lower in dogs with antibodies against B. burgdorferi compared with those without. Percentage concentration of C 3 was higher in healthy <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> compared with control dogs. Conclusion: Low C 3 concentration is not an explanation for the high prevalence of B. burgdorferi infections and glomerular disease in <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs...</b>|$|R

25|$|The breed is {{strikingly similar}} to the English Mastiff, with which it shares a common {{ancestor}} known as the Alpine Mastiff. The modern St. Bernard breed is radically different than the original dogs kept at the St. Bernard hospice, most notably by being much larger in size and build. Since the late 1800s, the St. Bernard breed has been ever refined and improved using many different large Molosser breeds, including the Newfoundland, Great Pyrenees, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Dog,</b> Great Dane, English Mastiff, and possibly the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Ovcharka. Other breeds such as the Rottweiler, Boxer, and English Bulldog {{may have contributed to}} the St. Bernard's bloodline as well. It is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after World War II, which may explain why all of them played a part in the creation of the St. Bernard as seen today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Data on the {{long-term}} outcome of B. burgdorferi infections in adult dogs are sparse. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate whether <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> with serological evidence of natural B. burgdorferi infection more often develop signs such as lameness, azotemia or proteinuria during a follow-up period of 2. 5 to 3. 0 years. Seropositive <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> were compared to seronegative <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> and to seropositive and seronegative control dogs of other breeds. Dogs included in a previous study on the prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> were re-evaluated. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were determined using an ELISA with a whole-cell sonicate as antigen and results were confirmed using a Western blot assay. Results Fifty-three <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> and 30 control dogs were re-evaluated. Re-evaluation was performed between 2. 5 and 3. 0 years (median 2. 7 years) after the first assessment. The age of the dogs at the second evaluation ranged from 3 to 11 years (median 6 years). There were no significant differences with regard to poor general condition or lameness between the first and the second evaluation. At the first evaluation 22 (42 %) of the <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> and 11 (37 %) of the control dogs were considered positive for antibodies against B. burgdorferi. At the second evaluation 25 (47 %) of the <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> and 12 (40 %) of the control dogs were considered positive; 69 % of the dogs showed the same serological result at both examinations and 31 % were seroconverted or seroreverted. During the first examination, azotemia was diagnosed in 6 <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs</b> and during the second examination in 11 <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>dogs.</b> No control dogs had azotemia in this study. In seropositive dogs there was no increase in lameness or signs of renal disease over time. Conclusion It may be concluded that antibodies against B. burgdorferi determined by whole cell ELISA and confirmed by Western blot were neither associated with the development of lameness nor with signs of renal disease like azotemia or proteinuria in dogs observed over a period of 2. 5 to 3. 0 years. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Diseases {{attributed}} to the popular sire effect include copper toxicosis in Bedlington Terriers, rage syndrome in English Springer Spaniels, and histiocytic sarcoma in <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Dogs.</b> Pedigree analysis of <b>Bernese</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Dogs</b> in France showed that only 5.5% of males and 13.2% of females are used for reproduction each generation, with 0.78% of males and 3% of females producing more than 50% of the next generation.
