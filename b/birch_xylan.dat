40|$|Cationized <b>birch</b> <b>xylan</b> was {{prepared}} {{and its use}} as a papermaking chemical was evaluated. The focus was on studying the effects of cationized <b>birch</b> <b>xylan</b> on the wet and dry strength of fine paper. The results of the laboratory experiments show that the addition of 3 percent of cationized <b>birch</b> <b>xylan</b> to birch kraft pulp improved the initial wet strength of the web by 30 percent compared to base stock at a solids content of 55 %. Furthermore, the tensile stiffness of the wet web increased by approximately a third and the dry tensile strength improved by 26 %, while the dry elastic modulus was not changed. The improvements in the strength properties were clear {{when compared to the}} base stock, but not as high as achieved with conventionally used cationized starch. The difference between the xylan and starch is most likely due to the shorter polymer chain length of the cationized xylan...|$|E

For a better selection of xylanases, it is necessary to understand how they work in breadmaking. At the same activity, the xylanases have different effect on dough rheology.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of xylan on pulp fibers {{improves the}} strength properties of paper. However, the optical properties are decreased significantly. The objective {{of our research}} was to bleach hardwood kraft pulp with adsorbed <b>birch</b> <b>xylan</b> by hydrogen peroxide and study the effect of bleaching parameters on paper properties. The bleaching parameters studied included bleaching temperature, time, initial pH as well as MgSO 4 dosage. The optical properties (whiteness, brightness, opacity) and physical properties (tensile index, tearing index, bulk) of handsheets made from the pulp bleached with different process variables were measured. The results showed that better optical properties were obtained with higher bleaching temperature, longer bleaching time, and more MgSO 4 dosage. Bleaching from an initial pH of 11 provided the highest brightness value. On the other hand, strength properties were improved with decreasing of the bleaching temperature, and increasing the initial pH and MgSO 4 dosage. The relationship between strength properties and bleaching time varied depending on bleaching temperature. According to the results, both good mechanical properties and optical properties could be achieved when the operating parameters were controlled properly. Therefore hydrogen peroxide bleaching was {{proved to be a}} suitable method for bleaching hardwood kraft pulp with adsorption of <b>birch</b> <b>xylan...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fibrobacter succinogenes {{produces}} an α-glucuronidase which cleaves 4 -O-methyl-α-d-glucuronic acid from birch wood 4 -O-methyl-α-d-glucuronoxylan. Very {{low levels of}} α-glucuronidase activity were detected in extracellular enzyme preparations of F. succinogenes on <b>birch</b> wood <b>xylan</b> substrate. The release of 4 -O-methyl-α-d-glucuronic acid was enhanced when the <b>birch</b> wood <b>xylan</b> substrate was predigested by either a purified Schizophyllum commune xylanase or a cloned F. succinogenes S 85 xylanase. These {{data suggest that the}} α-glucuronidase is unable to cleave 4 -O-methyl-α-d-glucuronic acid from intact xylan but can act on unique low-molecular-weight glucuronoxylan fragments created by the cloned F. succinogenes xylanase. The cloned xylanase presumably must account for a small proportion of the indigenous xylanase activity of F. succinogenes cultures, since this xylanase source does not support high glucuronidase activity. The α-glucuronidase and associated hemicellulolytic enzymes exhibited higher activities in culture fluid from cells grown on ball-milled barley straw than in that of cellulose-grown cells. The profile of xylanases separated by isoelectric focusing (zymogram) of culture filtrate from cells grown on barley straw was more complex than that of culture filtrates from cells grown on cellulose. These data demonstrate that F. succinogenes {{produces an}} α-glucuronidase with an exacting substrate specificity which enables extensive cleavage of glucuronic acid residues from xylan as a consequence of synergistic xylanase action...|$|R

The bacterial isolate was screened for cellulase and xylanase production on carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) and <b>birch</b> wood <b>xylan</b> as substrates, respectively. One bacterial isolate showing the highest halo zone diameter (isolate PLY 1) was selected for detailed studies. The analysis of the 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene nucleotide sequence of PLY 1 revealed it to have 98 % similarity to Micrococcus luteus strain Fse 9 and the sequence was deposited in the GenBank as Micrococcus luteus strain SAMRC-UFH 3 with accession number KU 171371. Cellulase production was achieved {{in the presence of}} CMC (1 % w/v) under an incubation temperature of 25 °C (198 U/mL), pH 5 (173 U/mL), agitation speed 50 rpm (173 U/mL) and incubation period of 96 h (102 U/mL). Xylanase was produced maximally when <b>birch</b> wood <b>xylan</b> (1 % w/v) was used as the substrate at 25 °C (1007 U/mL), pH 10 (2487 U/mL), 200 rpm (1814 U/mL), and under an incubation period of 84 h (1296 U/mL).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the presence and position of xylan in the fiber wall are of importance for the degree of damage introduced into fibers during mechanical action in the cook. Kraft pulps from spruce with different amounts of xylan have been produced in the laboratory, either by adding <b>birch</b> <b>xylan</b> in different positions in the cook or by redistribution of spruce xylan. At the end of the cook, fiber damages were introduced by subjecting the fibers to shear and compression forces. The extra <b>birch</b> <b>xylan</b> had adsorbed on the fiber surfaces, the outer fiber walls (presumably S 1 /primary wall) as well as on the fiber cell lumen wall. Xylan penetration into the fiber wall was very low. A large variation in coverage of surface xylan within the fibers and between fibers was noted. No significant difference between pulps produced in the different ways or between the pulps produced with or without mechanical treatment could however be observed. The extra xylan added resulted as expected in an improved tensile strength development for these pulps. No direct indications were seen that the extra xylan added during the cook resulted in a lower amount of introduced damaged areas. But some positive tendencies could be noted for the pulps produced with extra xylan added including: a lower kink/mm and lower amount of cleavage/fiber measured by the HCL method; and the zero-span level and tear-tensile relationship were not inferior compared to the reference despite the higher xylan content. The removal and subsequent re-introduction of xylan into the cook seemed to negatively influence the strength properties, i. e. the tear-tensile relationship was inferior compared to the reference pulp. The redistribution procedure may have drained the fiber wall of xylan negatively influencing the strength propertie...|$|E
40|$|Hemicelluloses are, {{together}} with cellulose and pectins, the polysaccharide constituents {{in the cell}} walls of higher plants. Xylans {{are the most common}} hemicelluloses, and are considered to be the second most abundant biopolymer in the plant kingdom. Xylans have an inherent affinity to cellulose and will thus adsorb on cellulose surfaces; a propensity providing great opportunities for modification of cellulose fibres. The molecular structure of xylan is proposed to affect the solubility and the level of cellulose interaction. This thesis investigates the influence of xylan composition on solution properties in aqueous systems, and its effect on cellulose fibre adsorption. In addition, the effects of xylan adsorption on softwood pulp properties and the possibility of utilising xylans from agricultural residues, i. e. barley husks, in cellulose fibre modification are studied. Lignin has been shown to have a great influence on the self-assembly behaviour of <b>birch</b> <b>xylan.</b> It is proposed that the agglomeration starts with the nucleation of lignin polymer molecules that are complexed with water-soluble lignin-containing xylan molecules via secondary bonds. As lignin affects the solubility of xylan, it most probably also influences the driving force for xylan accumulation and adsorption on cellulose surfaces. Xylans isolated from barley husks have been shown to interact with cellulose. Temperature and initial concentration of xylan {{has been shown to be}} important parameters in controlling the level of adsorption on cellulose fibres, but the adsorption appears to be largely dependent on xylan molecular structure. Arabinoxylans with a low degree of substitution have an enhanced capacity to interact with each other and with other polysaccharides; a feature that explains the observed propensity of low substituted xylan to form agglomerated structures and adsorb on cellulose surfaces. Furthermore, barley husk xylan has shown great potential as a dry strengthening agent for bleached once-dried softwood pulp. Adsorption of <b>birch</b> <b>xylan</b> on never-dried bleached softwood kraft pulp has been shown to improve tensile strength and beatability, but tensile strength at a given °SR, density and light scattering coefficient is more or less unaffected. The effects are more pronounced for once-dried pulp than for never-dried pulp. It is hypothesised that adsorbed xylan has a stabilising effect on cellulose fibrils, preventing aggregation upon drying, and thus reducing the effect of hornification...|$|E

40|$|A model {{describing}} the sorption kinetics for black liquor <b>birch</b> <b>xylan</b> onto unbleached softwood kraft fibers at industrially relevant process conditions has been developed. The experimental {{results support the}} suggestion that xylan sorption is a physical process.

The effects of changes in process conditions like temperature, NaOH concentration and ion strength are included in the model. The model fits the experimental data quite well for sorption temperatures between 87 and 127 degrees C. Other mechanisms affect the observed sorption at higher sorption temperatures. Consequently, more data is needed to produce a model for sorption at elevated temperatures. Deviations from the experimental data at temperatures up to 127 degrees C are proposed to be a result of competing mechanisms not accounted for in our model. These can, for instance, be the transportation of xylan from the surface into the cell wall, the degradation of xylan in solution, the removal of substituents from the xylan backbone, or a decrease in NaOH concentration in the solution...|$|E
40|$|<b>Birch</b> <b>xylan</b> (4 -O-methylglucuronoxylan) {{isolated}} from a kraft cooking liquor was delignified and grafted with polylactide of predictable branch length. This graft copolymerization resulted in very high total yields, greater than 90 %, and {{with less than}} 10 % polylactide homopolymer byproducts. Mild reaction conditions (40 °C, 5 to 120 minutes) were used, which was believed to limit transesterification reactions and thus {{make it possible to}} reach good predictability of the polylactide branch length. The thermal properties of the polylactide-grafted xylan depended on the branch length. Short branches resulted in fully amorphous materials with a glass transition temperature of about 48 to 55 °C, whereas long polylactide branches resulted in semi-crystalline materials with melting points of about 130 °C. Using mixtures of L-lactide and D/L-lactide in the monomer feed further altered the thermal properties. The degradation temperatures of the polylactide-grafted xylans were higher than that of the unmodified xylan, with degradation temperatures of about 300 °C and 250 °C, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} if extra xylan added during oxygen delignification of kraft spruce fibers could contribute to reduce the effect of fiber damage introduced during the cook. Two pulps were produced, one with and one without mechanical treatment at the end of the cook. The pulp produced without mechanical treatment was oxygen delignified with xylan added in the oxygen stage. The pulp produced with mechanical treatment was oxygen delignified both with and without xylan added. Results did not indicate that xylan added in the oxygen stage could repair the already introduced fiber damage. Added xylan had a fiber straightening effect as seen earlier when xylan was added in the cook. Xylan added in the oxygen stage resulted in improved tensile strength development. However, the negative effect from introduced mechanical treatment still influenced the strength properties more than could be compensated by the added xylan. SEM-images could not identify any differences between the investigated pulps.

The homogeneity of the final preparation was demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and agarose gel electrofocusing. The molecular mass and isoelectric point of the xylanase were 46 kDa and 5. 4, respectively. Xylanase V had a maximum activity at a pH of 6. 8 and at a temperature between 30 and 37 °C.

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of acidolysis on final bleached brightness for kraft and soda-AQ (SAQ) hardwood pulps. The increase in final brightness due to acidolysis at 110 °C was twice as high for a eucalyptus SAQ pulp as compared to the kraft pulp. An oxygen delignified maple C-SAQ pulp (carbonate pre-treated SAQ) was acidolyzed at 120 °C and pH 2. 6 for 30 min. When 1. 60 % ClO 2 + 0. 25 % H 2 O 2 on pulp was used in DEPD final bleaching of the control sample a brightness of 91. 5 % was achieved.

Analyses of the maple pulp after the acidolysis showed no major change in lignin content, brightness, or pulp yield. The minor changes suggest that a facile reaction such as benzyl ether cleavage was responsible for the improved bleachability. Preliminary research involving a lignin model compound and commercial <b>birch</b> <b>xylan</b> showed that lignin-carbohydrate condensation products were generated under SAQ cooking conditions.

The detailed structures of the polysaccharide components from wood that dissolve during mechanical pulping were determined. The structures of polysaccharide components linked to residual lignin in chemical pulp were also determined. Methylation analysis as linkage analysis was further developed and verified for this purpose using the procedure methylation, methanolysis, silylation and GC/MS analysis. Water-soluble arabinogalactans obtained from spruce and pine heartwood were analyzed using methylation analysis, NMR spectroscopy and carbohydrate composition analysis. The arabinogalactans isolated were acidic and had a backbone of β-(1 → 3) -linked D-galactopyranose units, highly branched at C 6. Water-soluble galactoglucomannans were extracted from spruce wood and TMP. Based on both methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopic analysis, the main C 6 -branched unit was D-mannopyranose. Some C 6 -branched D-glucopyranose units were also detected by methylation analysis. The polysaccharides that dissolved during oxygen delignification of pine kraft pulp comprised mainly xylan, together with galactans, 1, 3 -linked glucan, arabinan and glucomannan. This indicated that the glucose units present in the dissolved polysaccharides did not originate from cellulose but from a 1, 3 -linked glucan. This was a new and unexpected finding indicating that the content of dissolved glucose {{is not related to}} the degree of cellulose degradation. Polysaccharides in the corresponding filtrates from birch kraft pulp also contained mainly xylan. An indication was found for the presence of bonds between lignin and position C 3 of the backbone units in <b>birch</b> <b>xylan.</b> Residual lignin-carbohydrate complexes (RLCCs) isolated from spruce and pine kraft pulps contained oligosaccharides representing the main polysaccharides in softwood. In addition, 1, 4 -linked and 1, 3 / 6 -linked galactans were present in considerable amounts, together with smaller amounts of 1, 3 -linked glucan and 1, 5 -linked arabinan, and possibly also xyloglucan. 1, 4 -linked galactan was enriched in the RLCC of spruce fiber surface material. Towards the inner part of the fiber, 1, 3 / 6 -linked galactan became the major lignin-bound galactan structure. Some differences related to the alkaline cooking method used were detected in the carbohydrate component of pine pulp RLCCs. Oxygen delignification removed 1, 3 / 6 -linked galactan from the inner parts of fiber in preference to 1, 4 -linked galactan. reviewe...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: There {{is growing}} {{interest}} to utilise xylan as speciality biopolymers in similar ways as {{high molecular weight}} polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose. The need to utilise xylan as alternative to cellulose and starch has increased because the cellulose and starch have many other competing uses. Unlike cellulose and starch, xylans are heteropolymers with higher degree of substitution and are of lower molecular mass and therefore, do not readily become insoluble to form hydrogels and biofilms. Consequently, xylans do not suit applications of starch and cellulose as speciality biodegradable additives and coatings in the food, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper and textile and many other industries. This {{study was conducted to}} develop an enzyme technology, based on recombinant α-L-arabinofuranosidase and purified α-D-glucuronidase with polymeric xylan substrate specificity, for controlled reduction of the solubility of water soluble polymeric xylan, leading to formation of insoluble nanohydrogels. Although xylan is available in abundance, a large proportion of it is currently wasted in lignocellulose process waste streams with little prospects for recovery and addition of value. Lignocellulosic materials including Eucalyptus grandis, Pinus patula, Bambusa balcooa (bamboo) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L) bagasse (bagasse) found in South Africa were investigated as sources of water soluble xylan for enzyme modification. Two mild alkali-low temperature methods (alkali charge of 10 and were water soluble, which suited the required properties of xylans for customised enzyme modification. The selective removal of the arabinose, MeGlcA and acetyl groups to create linear regions of xylose units in xylans that causes intra and inter-polymer bonding is considered to be the key process for reducing the solubility of water soluble xylans. The α-L-arabinofuranosidase of Aspergillus niger (AbfB) and α-D-glucuronidase of Schizophyllum commune (AguA) are special enzymes so far identified with the ability to selectively remove arabinose and MeGlcA side chains respectively, from water soluble xylans. Large scale application of the AbfB and AguA for reducing solubility of the water soluble xylans would require their extracellular production in large quantities and free of contamination from the xylan main chain degrading enzymes including the endo- 1, 4 -β -xylanase. Selective production of the AbfB free of xylanase activity was achieved in recombinant A. niger D 15 [abfB] strain under the transcriptional control of the glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (gpdP) and glucoamylase terminator (glaAT). The recombinant AbfB was secreted extracellulary in 125 mL shake flasks and 10 L bioreactor fermentation cultures with volumetric activities of up to 10. 0 and 8. 0 nkat mL- 1 respectively, against para-nitrophenol arabinofuranoside (pNPA). The secretion of the recombinant AbfB was growth associated and therefore, increased up to 2. 5 times with addition of concentrate corn steep liquor (CCSL) as an additional source of nitrogen in the 2 x minimal standard cultivation media. The biomass specific activity of the recombinant AbfB against the pNPA substrate was approximately 366 nkat g- 1 (dry weight basis). The recombinant AbfB displayed a single pure species band on 10 % SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue and had an estimated molecular mass of 67 kDa. In addition, the recombinant AbfB showed optimal activity at 40 - 55 ºC and pH 3. 0 - 5. 0 and was stable under cultivation, storage and operating conditions at temperatures between 30 - 60 ºC and pH 3. 0 - 6. 0. Furthermore, the recombinant AbfB showed broad substrate specificity selectively removing arabinose side groups from low viscosity wheat and oat spelt arabinoxylans, larchwood arabinogalactan, debranched arabinan and arabiglucuronoxylans extracted from bagasse, bamboo and P. patula found in South Africa,. The recombinant AbfB was able to precipitate xylans extracted from bagasse, bamboo and oat spelt but not from P. patula. Over 95 % of the activity of the recombinant AbfB against the pNPA was recyclable after selective hydrolysis of the xylan at 40 ºC for 16 h. On the other hand, the purified AguA enzyme could only precipitate the birch glucuronoxylan but not the glucuronoxylan extracted from E. grandis and arabinoglucuronoxylans extracted from bagasse, bamboo and P. patula. The synergetic action of the recombinant AbfB and the purified AguA increased the removal of the arabinose side chains from bagasse xylan by 22 % and from bamboo xylan by 33 %, whereas, the removal of the MeGlcA side chains from bagasse xylan increased by only 5 % and that from bamboo xylan decreased by 13 %. The selective removal of the arabinose side chains from oat spelt, bagasse and bamboo xylans by the recombinant AbfB had higher apparent viscosity relative the corresponding untreated xylans. However, the apparent viscosity of both the treated and untreated xylans reduced with increased shear rate. The viscosity had an overall negative correlation with arabinose side chain removal reaching a minimum of 2. 03 mPa. s for hydrolysis of oat spelt xylan that was performed for 9. 0 h at a temperature of 45. 8 ºC with recombinant AbfB xylan specific dosage of 400. 0 nkat g- 1 substrate. The alteration of the viscosity of the xylans by the selective removal of the side chains is of special interest in the production of speciality emulsifying, thickening and antifoaming agents. The optimal values for hydrolysis time, enzyme dosage and temperature for maximum degree of removal of arabinose side chains from oat spelt xylan by the recombinant AbfB and of the removal of MeGlcA side chains from <b>birch</b> <b>xylan</b> by the purified AguA were determined by the Box-Benhken response surface method (RSM). The experimental region covered the xylan specific dosage for the recombinant AbfB between 18. 0 and 540. 0 nkatg- 1 substrate and for the purified AguA xylan between 2. 0 and 18. 0 μkatg- 1 substrate at temperatures between 30 and 50 ºC and hydrolysis time between 1 and 16 h. The temperature, enzyme xylan specific dosage and hydrolysis time had significant effect (p 0. 9. The effects of in situ selective removal of arabinose and MeGlcA side chains by AbfB and AguA respectively, from water soluble xylans, on their precipitation and adsorption onto cotton lint were investigated. The cotton lint was treated with xylans extracted from bagasse, bamboo, P. patula and E. grandis using the Hoije method {{in the presence of the}} recombinant AbfB, AguA and the cocktail of the two enzymes. The effects of in situ selective hydrolysis of model xylans including birch, oat spelt and H 2 O 2 bleached bagasse and E. grandis xylan gel by the enzymes on their adsorption onto cotton lint were used for reference purposes. The purified AguA increased the adsorption of arabinoglucuronoxylans extracted from bagasse bamboo and P. Patula using the Hoije method onto cotton lint the most compared to the effect of the recombinant AbfB and the cocktail of the recombinant AbfB and purified AguA. The purified AguA increased the adsorption of the xylans extracted from bagasse and E. grandis xylans by 334 and 29 % respectively, but decreased that of E. grandis xylan gel and H 2 O 2 bleached bagasse xylan by 31 and 6 % respectively. Similarly, the presence of the recombinant AbfB increased the adsorption of the bamboo, P. Patula and oat spelt xylans by 31, 44 and 900 % respectively, but decreased the adsorption of the xylan extracted from bagasse and the H 2 O 2 bleached bagasse xylan by 13 and 30 % respectively. Furthermore, different xylan-cellulose interactions and water adsorption capacities of the cotton lint were observed with the in situ modification and adsorption of the xylans extracted from bagasse, bamboo, E. grandis and P. patula in the presence of the recombinant AbfB and purified AguA. Therefore, the enzyme aided adsorption of xylans could be used to alter or improve functional properties of cellulosic materials. The performance of enzymatically formed xylan nanohydrogels as encapsulation matrices for slow delivery of bioactive agents was evaluated. Insoluble xylan nanohydrogels formed by selective removal of arabinose side chains from water soluble oat spelt xylan by the recombinant AbfB were characterized for particle size distribution, surface charge (zeta potential), morphology stability and ability to encapsulate and slowly release the HRP. The enzymatically formed oat spelt xylan hydrogels were spherical in shape with particle sizes ranging from 18 nm to > 10 000 nm. The xylan nanohydrogels exhibited a negative zeta potential of up to - 19 mV and displayed self assembling behaviour when formed at xylan concentrations of higher than 1. 5 % (w/v) and hydrolysis time beyond 17 h. The xylan concentration significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced both the particle size and zeta potential of the oat spelt xylan nanohydrogels whereas the recombinant AbfB hydrolysis time was significant (P < 0. 05) on the zeta potential. The oat spelt xylan nanohydrogels successfully encapsulated the HRP enzyme both during and after formation of the oat spelt xylan nanohydrogels and the release of the encapsulated HRP in active form, was sustained for a period of 180 min. Therefore, the xylan side chain removing enzymes have a role in preparation of biodegradable nanoencapsulation devices. Overall, the AbfB and AguA have presented a novel tool for functionalising water soluble xylans to be used as speciality additives, coating and implantation or encapsulation matrices, with reduced impact on the environment. This will advance processing and expand the product spectrum of lignocellulosic materials. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Daar is ‘n toenemende belangstelling om spesialiteit biopolimere uit xilaan ontwikkel, en op soortgelyke wyse as hoë molekulêre massa polisakkariede soos stysel en sellulose te benut. Die behoefte om xilaan biodegradeerbare polimere as ‘n alternatief tot sellulose en stysel te gebruik neem toe omdat laasgenoemde baie ander kompeterende gebruike het. Anders as sellulose en stysel is uit xilaan heteropolimere met ‘n hoë graad van substitusie in die hoofketling met sygroepe en lae molekulêre massas, en raak daarom nie geredelik onoplosbaar om hidrojel en biofilms te vorm nie. Gevolglik is xilaan nie geskik vir toepassings van stysel en sellulose as spesialiteit biodegradeerbare bymiddels en bedekkings in die voedsel-, farmaseutiese-, pulp en papier-, tekstiel-, en vele ander industrieë nie. Hierdie studie is uitgevoer om ‘n ensiemtegnologie te ontwikkel gebaseer op rekombinante α-L-arabinofuranosidase en gesuiwerde α-D-glukuronidase met polimeriese xilaan substraat spesifisiteit, vir beheerde vermindering van die oplosbaarheid van wateroplosbare polimeriese xilaan wat lei tot die vorming van onoplosbare nanohidrojels. Alhoewel xilaan volop beskikbaar is, word ‘n groot deel daarvan tans vermors in afvalstrome uit lignosellulose prosessering, primêr verpulping, met min vooruitsigte vir herwinning en toevoeging van waarde. Lignosellulose materiaal wat in Suid-Afrika geproduseer word, insluitend Eucalyptus grandis (E. grandis), Pinus patula (P. patula), Bambusa balcooa (bamboes) en suikerriet (Saccharum officinarum L) (bagasse), is ondersoek as bronne van wateroplosbare xilaan vir ensiem modifikasie. Twee gematigde, lae temperatuur alkali-metodes (‘nalkali lading van 10 gehad en was wateroplosbaar, wat die vereiste eienskappe van die xilaan vir doelgemaakte ensiem modifikasies bevredig het. Die selektiewe verwydering van die arabinose, MeGlcA, en asetiel-groepe om xilose eenhede sonder substitusie in polimeriese xilaan te vorm, wat intra- en inter-polimeer binding veroorsaak, word beskou as die belangrikste proses vir die vermindering van die oplosbaarheid van wateroplosbare xilaan. Die α-L-arabinofuranosidase van Aspergillus niger (AbfB) en α-D-glukuronidase van Schizophyllum commune (AguA) is spsialiteutsensieme wat tot dusver is met die vermoë om selektief die arabinose en MeGlcA sykettings, onderskeidelik, vanaf wateroplosbare xilaan te verwyder. Grootskaalse toepassing van die AbfB en AguA ensieme, vir die vermindering van die oplosbaarheid van wateroplosbare xilaan, sal ekstrasellulêre produksie deur mikrobes in groot hoeveelhede en vry van kontaminasie van die xilaan hoofketting degraderende ensieme insluitend die endo- 1, 4 [...] xilanase vereis. Selektiewe produksie van die AbfB vry van xilanase aktiwiteit is verkry deur kultivering van rekombinante A. niger D 15 [abfB], met transkipsie van die abfB-geen beheer deur die gliseraldehied- 3 -fosfaat dehidrogenase promotor (gpdp) en glukoamilase termineerder (glaAT). Die rekombinante AbfB ensiem is ekstrasellulêr geproduseer in 125 mL skudflesse en ‘n 10 L bioreaktor fermentasiekulture met volumetriese aktiwiteite van tot 10. 0 en 8. 0 nkat mL- 1, onderskeidelik, teen para-nitrofenol arabinofuranosied (pNPA). Die uitskeiding van die rekombinante AbfB was groei geassosieerd en het daarom tot 2. 5 keer toegeneem met die byvoeging van gekonsentreerde mielieweekvloeistof as ‘n addisionele bron van stikstof in die 2 x minimale standaard kwekingsmedium. Die biomassa spesifieke aktiwiteit van die rekombinante AbfB teen die pNPA substraat was ongeveer 366 nkat g- 1 (droë massa basis). Die rekombinante AbfB het ‘n enkele suiwer spesie band getoon op 10 % SDS-PAGE gevlek met Coomassie blou en het ‘n beraamde molekulêre massa van 67 kDa gehad. Die rekombinante AbfB het verder optimale aktiwiteit by 40 - 55 °C en pH 3. 0 - 5. 0 getoon en was stabiel onder kweking-, storing-, en bedryfstoestande by temperature tussen 30 - 60 °C en pH 3. 0 - 6. 0. Die rekombinante AbfB het ook wye substraatspesifisiteit getoon om arabinose sy-groepe selektief te verwyder vanaf lae viskositeit koring-en hawerbiopolimere, lariks arabinogalaktaan, onvertakte arabinaan, en arabinoglukuronoxilaan biopolimere, geëkstraheer vanaf bagasse, bamboes en P. patula wat in Suid-Afrika aangetief word. Die rekombinante AbfB kon xilaan, ge-ekshaheer vanaf bagasse, bamboes en hawer onoplosbaar maak, maar die xilaan geëkstraheer vanaf P. patula nie. Meer as 95 % van die aktiwiteit van die rekombinante AbfB teen die pNPA kon hersirkuleer word na selektiewe hidrolise van die xilaan by 40 °C vir 16 h. Aan die ander kant kon die gesuiwerde AguA-ensiem slegs berkehout glukuronoxilaan onoplosbaar maak, maar nie glukuronoxilaan wat vanaf E. grandis geëkstraheer is of arabinoglukuronoxilaan wat vanaf bagasse, bamboes en P. patula geëkstraheer is nie. Die sinergistiese aksie van die rekombinante AbfB en die gesuiwerde AguA het die verwydering van die arabinose sykettings vanaf bagassexilaan met 22 % vermeerder en met 33 % in die geval van bamboesxilaan. Die verwydering van MeGlcA sykettings vanaf bagassexilaan is met slegs 5 % vermeerder, terwyl dit met 13 % verminder het in die geval van bamboesxilaan. Die selektiewe verwydering van die arabinose sykettings vanaf xilaan van hawer, bagasse, en bamboes deur die rekombinante AbfB het hoër skynbare viskositeit gehad relatief tot die ooreenstemmende onbehandelde xilaan. Die skynbare viskositeit van beide die behandelde en onbehandelde xilaan het egter verminder met toenemende skuiftempo. Die viskositeit het ‘n algehele negatiewe korrelasie met arabinose syketting verwydering gehad en het ‘n minimum van 2. 03 mPa. s bereik vir hidrolise van hawerxilaan wat uitgevoer is vir 9. 0 h by ‘n temperatuur van 45. 8 °C met rekombinante AbfB xilaan met ‘n spesifieke dosering van 400. 0 nkat g- 1 substraat. Die wysiging van die viskositeit van die xilaan deur die selektiewe verwydering van die sykettings is van besondere belang in die produksie van spesialiteit emulsifisering, verdikking- en skuimweermiddels. Die optimale waardes vir hidrolisetyd, ensiemdosering en temperatuur vir maksimum graad van arabinose syketting verwydering vanaf hawerxilaan met die rekombinante AbfB, en van MeGlcA syketting verwydering vanaf berkehout xilaan met die gesuiwerde AguA, is vasgestel deur middel van die Box-Benhken responsie oppervlak metode. Die eksperimentele gebied het die xilaanspesifieke dosering met die rekombinante AbfB tussen 18. 0 en 540. 0 nkat g- 1 substraat en vir die gesuiwerde AguA xilaan tussen 2. 0 en 18. 0 μkat g- 1 substraat by temperature tussen 30 en 50 °C en hidrolisetye tussen 1 en 16 h gedek. Die temperatuur, ensiem xilaan spesifieke dosering en hidrolise tyd het elk ‘n beduidende invloed (p 0. 9 gepas het.

Die katoenlint is behandel met xilaan ge-ekstraheer vanuit bagasse, bamboes, P. patula, en E. grandis deur gebruik te maak van die Hoije metode in die teenwoordigheid van die rekombinante AbfB, AguA, en ‘n mengsel van die twee ensieme.

On {{the basis of these}} tests, the four strains were initially identified as belonging to the genus Bacillus. Bacillus strains were capable of growing in xylan medium at pH 7. 0 and produced 55 IU (μ mol xylose min� 1 ml� 1) of xylanase when cultivated in neutral medium at pH 7. 0. Maximal enzyme activity was obtained by cultivation in oat spelt xylan, but high enzyme production was also obtained on wheat bran. With cultivation at pH 7. 0 and assays performed in phosphate buffer, maximal activity was observed at pH 7. 0; with phosphate buffer, maximal activity was between pH 6 and 7. The xylanase temperature optimum at pH 7. 0 was 50 �C. The enzyme could hydrolyze the oat spelt <b>xylan</b> and <b>birch</b> wood <b>xylan</b> effectively but did not hydrolyze cellulose, carboxymethyl-cellulose and starch.

40|$|Two genes {{concerned}} with xylan degradation {{were found to}} be closely linked in the ruminal anaerobe Prevotella ruminicola B(1) 4, being separated by an intergenic region of 75 nucleotides. xynA is shown to encode a family F endoxylanase of 369 amino acids, including a putative amino-terminal signal peptide. xynB encodes an enzyme of 319 amino acids, with no obvious signal peptide, that shows 68 % amino acid identity with the xsa product of Bacteroides ovatus and 31 % amino acid identity with a beta-xylosidase from Clostridium stercorarium; together, these three enzymes define a new family of beta-(1, 4) -glycosidases. The activity of the cloned P. ruminicola xynB gene product, but not that of the xynA gene product, shows considerable sensitivity to oxygen. Studied under anaerobic conditions, the XynB enzyme was found to act as an exoxylanase, releasing xylose from substrates including xylobiose, xylopentaose, and <b>birch</b> wood <b>xylan,</b> but was relatively inactive against oat spelt xylan. A high degree of synergy (up to 10 -fold stimulation) was found with respect to the release of reducing sugars from oat spelt xylan when XynB was combined with the XynA endoxylanase from P. ruminicola B(1) 4 or with endoxylanases from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17.

[8] investigated the condition that acetyl group in bracatinga (Mimosa scabrella) does not migrate, where highly uneven distribution of acetyl groups in the xylan was determined in analyses with 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) [9]. These studies [8, 9] are, however, based on rather complicated method for extraction with a low yield, the results of which might not be able to reflect the whole native structure of xylan.|$|R

Significant amounts of low molecular mass compounds, xylobiose and trace amounts of xylose were liberated from <b>birch</b> wood <b>xylan</b> after 24  h (Lin et al. [1999]) using Thermomyces lanuginosus enzyme; however cellulase activity could contaminate this endo-β-(1 [*]→[*] 4)-xylanase preparation (Subramaniyan and Prema [2002]) explaining the results obtained. Xylanase from Thermotoga maritima is an extremely thermostable enzyme which hydrolyzed xylo-oligosaccharides and xylans to yield predominantly xylobiose as end product (Jiang et al. [2004]). Xylobiose and small xylooligomers as main products in high amount from Arundo biomass confirmed this activity. The absence of glucose {{can be explained by}} better purity of enzymatic preparation (xylanase) with respect to T. lanuginosus reaction. As far as T. neapolitana CFE-TN and T. thermostercoris CFE-TT were concerned, presence of xylanases, xylosidases, glucuronidases and arabinofuranosidases were confirmed in the crude extracts by the action on suitable chromophoric and polysaccharidic substrates (data not shown). The results on Arundo indicated also that action of β-glucosidases is dependent on enzymatic load in the reaction mixture, and this phenomenon could be analyzed with respect to the known interrelation of cellulases and xylanases in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic material (Hu et al. [2011]).

40|$|The {{xylanase}} XynC of Fibrobacter succinogenes S 85 {{was recently}} shown to contain three distinct domains, A, B, and C (F. W. Paradis, H. Zhu, P. J. Krell, J. P. Phillips, and C. W. Forsberg, J. Bacteriol. 175 : 7666 - 7672, 1993). Domains A and B each bear an active site capable of hydrolyzing xylan, while domain C has no enzymatic activity. Two truncated proteins, each containing a single catalytic domain, named XynC-A and XynC-B were purified to homogeneity. The catalytic domains A and B had similar pH and temperature parameters of 6. 0 and 50 degrees C for maximum hydrolytic activity and extensively degraded <b>birch</b> wood <b>xylan</b> to xylose and xylobiose. The Km and Vmax values, respectively, were 2. 0 mg ml- 1 and 6. 1 U mg- 1 for the intact enzyme, 1. 83 mg ml- 1 and 689 U mg- 1 for domain A, and 2. 38 mg ml- 1 and 91. 8 U mg- 1 for domain B. Although domain A {{had a higher}} specific activity than domain B, domain B exhibited a broader substrate specificity and hydrolyzed rye arabinoxylan {{to a greater extent}} than domain A. Furthermore, domain B, but not domain A, was able to release xylose at the initial stage of the hydrolysis. Both catalytic domains cleaved xylotriose, xylotetraose, and xylopentaose but had no activity on xylobiose. Bond cleavage frequencies obtained from hydrolysis of xylo-alditol substrates suggest that while both domains have a strong preference for internal linkages of the xylan backbone, domain B has fewer subsites for substrate binding than domain A and cleaves arabinoxylan more efficiently. Chemical modification with 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide methiodide and N-bromosuccinimide inactivated both XynC-A and XynC-B in the absence of xylan, indicating that carboxyl groups and tryptophan residues in the catalytic site of each domain have essential roles...|$|R
40|$|The {{sorption}} kinetics for <b>birch</b> {{black liquor}} <b>xylan</b> onto unbleached softwood kraft fibers at industrial relevant process conditions was investigated. The impact of process conditions on total sorption and rate was studied. It {{was found that}} an unbleached fiber can increase its weight up to 40 % by sorption of xylan if process conditions are favorable and sufficient xylan {{is present in the}} liquor. A decrease in pH, an increase in temperature and an increase in ionic strength enhances both the initial sorption rate and the maximum sorption, as expected from the literature. Moreover, an increased xylan charge from 5 to 10 g/l increased sorption by about 20 - 30 % on average. At the highest temperature tested some deviations from the expected results were obtained, which indicates that more than one mechanism affect sorption. Analysis of the surface carbohydrate composition suggests that xylan is preferably sorbed on the fiber surfaces. This is especially obvious at higher sorption temperatures. SEM pictographs of the cellulose fibers indicate that xylan sorbs as single xylan chains at 87 and 127 degrees C. In contrast, at 167 degrees C globular structures are observed on the fibers, which probably is clue to precipitation of globular xylan aggregates from the liquor...|$|R
