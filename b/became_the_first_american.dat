5|$|After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, {{joined the}} PCHA in 1914, the {{trustees}} {{issued a statement}} that the Cup was no longer for {{the best team in}} Canada, but now for {{the best team in the}} world. Ice hockey in Europe was still in its infancy at this time, so it was without much controversy that winners of the Stanley Cup began styling themselves as the world champions just like in baseball. Two years later, the Rosebuds <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> team to play in the Stanley Cup Final. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> team to win the Cup.

It was John Knowles Paine, however, who <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> composer to be accepted in Europe. Paine's example inspired the composers of the Second New England School, which included such figures as Amy Beach, Edward MacDowell, and Horatio Parker.|$|E

5|$|After their 1908–12 trip, {{the couple}} stopped {{exploring}} {{and turned to}} writing and lecturing, {{primarily because of the}} onset of World War I in 1914. Fanny Workman <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> woman to lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris.

5|$|Baltimore was far {{and away}} the most {{successful}} of any American CFL team on the field and off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 their first year. Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Stallions mostly with CFL veterans. As coach, he brought in Don Matthews, who had already played in two Grey Cups and won one. The result was a team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> team to qualify for the playoffs. They advanced {{all the way to the}} Grey Cup. In a thrilling match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated the Stallions on a last second field goal. Perhaps most remarkably, they were reported to have turned a profit in their first year after an initial US$7 million investment by Speros.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Dover {{defeated}} Reiner Klimke, a six-time Olympic gold medalist, at the German Aachen Grand Prix freestyle competition.

5|$|In 1991, Subspecies <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> film to be {{filmed in}} Bucharest, Romania. Director Ted Nicolaou was {{initially}} apprehensive about shooting {{on location in}} Romania, but during a four-day location scout he came to love the location thanks to the free rein he had over the ancient ruins and woodland area. Other Transylvanian areas {{would be used for}} all Subspecies films, with specific location shootings at Hunedoara, Brașov, and Sinaia. Although, the remnants of communism left in the country, along with cultural differences and the general problems that accompany film productions lent to a difficult experience for the crew while shooting the first Subspecies film.|$|E
