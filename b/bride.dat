5|$|In Liao custom betrothal {{was seen}} as being equally serious to, if not more serious than, {{marriage}} itself, and was difficult to annul. The groom would pledge to work for three years for the bride's family, pay a <b>bride</b> price, and lavish the bride's family with gifts. After the three years, the groom {{would be allowed to}} take the <b>bride</b> back to his home, and the <b>bride</b> would usually cut off all ties with her family.|$|E

Ching-teng grabs the groom and pushes him onto the table, kissing him like he would kiss Chia-yi. During their kiss, he remembers how he regrets their fight from years ago, and what could have {{happened}} had he apologized for being childish.|$|E
30|$|In {{literature}} review, although {{using the}} term “foreign brides,” it refers particularly to Vietnamese <b>brides</b> or those <b>brides</b> who are from Southeast Asian countries. Often, Vietnamese <b>brides</b> and those <b>brides</b> who are from Southeast Asian countries share many similarities {{due to the fact}} that many Southeast Asian countries are under the deep influence of Confucian and filial cultures. However, the author also notices the difference between Vietnamese <b>brides</b> and other <b>brides.</b> Comparably, Vietnamese <b>brides</b> at the China-Vietnam border maintain much more frequent cross-border activities even after they get married and settle down in China.|$|R

5|$|The Roce (anointing) ceremony, {{conducted}} one or {{two days}} before a wedding, celebrates the last day of virginity of the <b>bride</b> and bridegroom and involves the parents' blessing of the <b>bride</b> and groom, who are anointed with roce, a mixture of coconut milk and coconut oil, while a cross is inscribed on the bride's forehead. The marriage traditions include Soirik (betrothal), exchange of Paan Pod (betel leaves) during the marriage ceremony, which known as Badalchen (changing hands; formal acceptance of the promise made by the bride's father to the bridegroom's father that he will give his daughter in marriage). The <b>bride</b> is adorned with the Sado (wedding sari) and Pirduk (wedding necklace). Other rites include the Onpnni (giving away the <b>bride</b> formally by the father or the guardian of the <b>bride),</b> Porthoponn (re-invitation to the bride's house), and singing of Honvious (hymns). Some non-marriage traditions include Novemjeevon (partaking of the food prepared from new corn) and Novem (blessing of new harvests).|$|E
5|$|The clip {{starts with}} a <b>bride</b> reaching, on a limousine, the chapel on which she's about to get married. As she is shown walking inside the chapel's doors, Arjona starts to sing while sit on the chairs in the empty chapel. Then, the <b>bride</b> is shown again {{alongside}} the groom in the altar, ready to make the vows, while the chapel {{is filled with the}} invitees. Then, scenes of Arjona playing the piano and singing, and scenes of the ceremony are interpolated, showing the behaviour of the invitees. Later, the invitees are shown involved in discussions and fights while Arjona keeps singing the chorus and verses of the song. As the fights between the invitees increase, the groom rejects the <b>bride</b> and she, stunned, escapes from the chapel. Then, it is shown that all was an illusion from the <b>bride,</b> and they are shown exiting the chapel, married. As of 11 July 2012, the video has reached 14 million views on YouTube.|$|E

5|$|Before marriage, women {{used to wear}} a Kirgi (sari) and Baju (blouse). The Kirgi is a {{piece of}} cloth not longer than four feet, and about three feet wide. It was wrapped around the body from the waist down. A jacket with long sleeves called a Baju, was used to cover {{the upper part of the}} body. This dress was a sign of the bride's virginity and was worn during the Ros ceremony. The Kirgi was wrapped around the waist, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder. To wear the sari with its end thrown over the shoulder, known as Worl, is the {{exclusive}} right of a married woman. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. The Salwar kameez is another form of popular dress for females. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding sari is known as a Sado. It is usually a red-coloured Banarasi sari which is made of finely woven silk and is decorated with elaborate engravings. In olden days, the <b>bride</b> wore on her head a red cloth, three feet square. Gold ornaments were absent in those days: the <b>bride</b> went to the church dressed as a virgin girl. In modern times, the <b>bride</b> wears (in place of the Kirgi) a red sari, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder; it is wrapped around the waist. The <b>bride</b> wears a few gold ornaments, some rings on the fingers, earrings, and at least two of the Dantoni (golden combs). Other ornaments worn by the <b>bride</b> in the olden days included Kanti, Chakrasar, Kap, Karap, Mugud, Kanto, and Dantoni.|$|E
