40|$|Hemolymph {{and soft}} tissues of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) kept in sand-filtered {{seawater}} at temperatures between 1 and 8 °C were normally found to contain bacteria, with viable counts (CFU) in hemolymph {{in the range}} 1. 4 × 102 to 5. 6 × 102 bacteria per ml. Pseudomonas, Alteromonas, Vibrio, and Aeromonas organisms dominated, with a smaller variety of morphologically different unidentified strains. Hemolymph and soft tissues of <b>horse</b> <b>mussels</b> (Modiolus modiolus), locally collected from a 6 - to 10 -m depth in the sea at temperatures between 4 and 6 °C, also contained bacteria. The CFU in <b>horse</b> <b>mussel</b> hemolymph was of the same magnitude as that in oysters (mean, 2. 6 × 104), and the bacterial flora was dominated by Pseudomonas (61. 3 %), Vibrio (27. 0 %), and Aeromonas (11. 7 %) organisms. In soft tissues of <b>horse</b> <b>mussels,</b> a mean CFU of 2. 9 × 104 bacteria per g was found, with Vibrio (38. 5 %), Pseudomonas (33. 0 %), and Aeromonas (28. 5 %) constituting the major genera. After the challenge of oysters in seawater at 4 °C to the psychrotrophic fish pathogen Vibrio salmonicida (strains NCIMB 2245 from Scotland and TEO 84001 from Norway) and a commensal Aeromonas sp. isolated from oysters, the viable count in hemolymph increased 1, 000 -fold to about 105 bacteria per ml. In soft tissues, about a 1, 000 -fold increase in CFU to 6 × 107 was observed. V. salmonicida NCIMB 2245 invaded hemolymph and soft tissues after 14 days and dominated these compartments after 41 days, whereas strain TEO 84001 did not invade soft tissues to the same extent. Challenge with V. salmonicida NCIMB 2245 resulted in 100 % mortality, whereas about 50 % of the oysters survived challenge with the Norwegian strain, TEO 84001. The commensal Aeromonas sp. invaded hemolymph and soft tissues and caused 100 % mortality. Oyster hemolymph contained agglutinins for Vibrio anguillarum but not for V. salmonicida, whereas {{we did not find}} agglutinins for either of these bacteria in <b>horse</b> <b>mussels.</b> Agglutinins for <b>horse</b> and human erythrocytes were found in hemolymph from both animals. We found no differences in agglutinin titers in oysters from different Norwegian locations, and long-term challenge with bacteria in seawater did not result in changes of agglutinin activity. These studies demonstrate that bacteria exist in hemolymph and soft tissues of marine bivalves at temperatures below 8 °C. Increased bacterial numbers in seawater at 4 °C result in augmented invasion of bacteria in hemolymph and soft tissues. V. salmonicida, a bacterium pathogenic for fish at low temperatures, invades bivalve hemolymph and soft tissues, and thus bivalves may serve as a reservoir for pathogens of fish at low seawater temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Biogenic reefs {{created by}} Modiolus {{modiolus}} (Linnaeus, 1758) (<b>horse</b> <b>mussel</b> reefs) are marine habitats which support {{high levels of}} species biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services. Currently, M. modiolus reefs are listed as a threatened and/or declining species and habitat in all OSPAR regions and thus are highlighted as a conservation priority under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Determining patterns of larval dispersal and genetic connectivity of remaining <b>horse</b> <b>mussel</b> populations can inform management efforts and is {{a critical component of}} effective marine spatial planning (MSP). Larval dispersal patterns and genetic structure were determined for several M. modiolus bed populations in the Irish Sea including those in Wales (North Pen LlÅ·n), Isle of Man (Point of Ayre) and Northern Ireland (Ards Peninsula and Strangford Lough). Simulations of larval dispersal suggested extant connectivity between populations within the Irish Sea. Results from the genetic analysis carried out using newly developed microsatellite DNA markers were consistent with those of the biophysical model. Results indicated moderately significant differentiation between the Northern Ireland populations and those in the Isle of Man and Wales. Simulations of larval dispersal over a 30 day pelagic larval duration (PLD) suggest that connectivity over a spatial scale of 150 km is possible between some source and sink populations. However, it appears unlikely that larvae from Northern Ireland will connect directly with sites on the LlÅ·n or Isle of Man.

The corals are the calcareous skeletons of polyps and the variability in shape is at least partly caused by the activities of <b>horse</b> <b>mussels</b> (Lithophaga spp.) which bore into the skeletons.

Lining the corallites are {{a large number of}} ridge-like septa radiating from the centre. The polyps often feed in the daytime, and when their tentacles are extended the basic skeleton of the coral is hidden. The general colour of the coral ranges from green and grey to reddish brown. The tentacles are often a contrasting colour and are usually tipped with white. A few of the tentacles are modified into sweeper tentacles which can be extended to 30 cm in length and serve to deter other organisms from settling close by.|$|R
