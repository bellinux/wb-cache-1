50|$|The {{cream is}} made by {{whipping}} egg yolks and sugar together until the yolk is almost white, and then slowly adding hot milk, while whisking. This process is {{commonly referred to as}} tempering. Vanilla beans (seeds) may be added for extra flavour and visual appeal. The sauce is then cooked over low heat (excessive heating may cause the yolks to cook, resulting in scrambled eggs) and stirred constantly with a spoon until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and then removed from the heat. It is also possible to set the sauce into custard cups and <b>bake</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bain-marie until the egg yolks set. If the sauce reaches too high a temperature, it will curdle, although it can be salvaged by straining into a container placed in an ice bath. Cooking temperature should be between 70 °C (156 °F) and 85 °C (185 °F); the higher the temperature, the thicker the resulting cream, as long as the yolks are fully incorporated into the mixture.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of an in-situ {{hydrogen}} bake and an ex-situ HF etch prior to polysilicon deposition on the electrical characteristics of bipolar transistors fabricated with low thermal budget in-situ phosphorus doped polysilicon emitter contacts. Emitter contact deposition in an UHV-compatible LPCVD cluster tool is also compared with deposition in a LPCVD furnace. TEM and SIMS are used to characterise the emitter contact material and the interface structure and a comparison is made with Gummel plots and emitter resistances on bipolar transistors. The SIMS results show that an in-situ hydrogen <b>bake</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cluster tool gives an extremely low oxygen dose at the interface of 6. 3 E 13 cm- 2, compared with 7. 7 E 14 and 2. 9 E 15 cm- 2 for an ex-situ HF etch and deposition in a cluster tool or a LPCVD furnace respectively. TEM shows that the in-situ hydrogen bake results in single-crystal silicon with a high density of defects, including dislocations and twins. The ex-situ HF etch gives polycrystalline silicon for deposition in both a cluster tool and a LPCVD furnace. The single-crystal silicon emitter contact has an extremely low emitter resistance of 21 ohm. µm 2 {{in spite of the}} high defect density and the light emitter anneal of 30 s at 900 ?C. This compares with emitter resistances of 151 and 260 ohm. µm 2 for the polycrystalline silicon contacts produced using an ex-situ HF etch and deposition in a cluster tool or a LPCVD furnace respectively. These values of emitter resistance correlate well with the interface oxygen doses and the structure of the interfacial oxide layer. The high defect density in the single-crystal silicon is considered to be due to the high concentration of phosphorus (> 5 E 19 cm- 3) in the as-deposited layers...|$|E
