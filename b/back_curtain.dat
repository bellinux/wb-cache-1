25|$|Fashion Bonnets {{for outdoor}} wear had small brims that {{revealed}} the face. Earlier bonnets {{of the decade}} had lower brims. However, by mid-century Spoon Bonnets, which featured increasingly high brims and more elaborate trimmings, became the vogue. Bonnets were made specifically to accessorize a dress. Other less common variants, such as the Marie Stuart Bonnet, with its heart-shaped brim, and the fanchon bonnet, with its very short brim and <b>back</b> <b>curtain,</b> made appearances {{in the realm of}} fashionable headwear.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will call}} him," [...] said Rollo. So he turned round, and kneeled up upon the seat, {{so that he}} could look out behind the chaise, for the <b>back</b> <b>curtain</b> was up. Lucy did the same, but Jonas was not to be seen. They looked a little longer, and {{presently}} saw him coming along round a curve in the road. They beckoned to him, and as he rode up, they saw he had a bush in his hand. He came up {{to the side of the}} chaise, and handed it to Rollo. It was a large blueberry-bush, covered with beautiful ripe blue berries. Rollo took them, and admired them very much; and at first he was going to divide them between Lucy and himself; but they concluded, on the whole, to send them forward to his mother. Jonas told them the mountain before them was Benalgon, and rode on to carry the blueberry-bush to the other chaise. Presently he came back, bringing it with him, except a small sprig which Rollo's mother had taken off. The rest she had sent back to the children.|$|E

5000|$|For example, {{to the far}} left, a yellow, drawn <b>back</b> <b>curtain</b> is used. With a rich tone {{of lemon}} yellow to {{complete}} the woman’s jacket, Vermeer is {{able to create a}} balance between the two ends of his painting. The window that the curtain would cover is very similar to that in his painting, “The Woman with the Water Pitcher.” ...|$|E

John Parker, 1st Baron Boringdon (1734/5-1788) of Saltram, near Warleigh, was a {{childhood}} friend of Reynolds, born nearby, and commissioned him to paint several portraits {{of his friends and}} family.

5000|$|Designed {{by a local}} engineer, William Morris Booth II (who is {{also the}} patent holder), and built in 1962 by volunteers at an {{estimated}} cost of $250,000, this fountain {{was based on a}} Przystawic musical fountain show seen in Germany and was the largest musical fountain in the world when it was built. The display comprises a small number of water formations grouped in odd and even segments, with the same formations on each. Augmented by curtains of water at the back and front, a large fanlike array called the Peacock, and three fire hose nozzles - one placed vertically in the center, and the others aimed at an angle from each end - the show produces a simple Dancing Waters style display. Colored lights are arrayed along the front of the fountain in individually controllable groups in red, blue, amber and white, and the <b>back</b> <b>curtain</b> and Peacock sprays have their own lights - green and yellow for the <b>back</b> <b>curtain,</b> and two sets each red, blue and amber for the Peacock. In addition, nozzles called [...] "sweeps" [...] provide the moving effects, swaying side-to-side. A patented drive mechanism allows each pair of sweeps to follow or oppose each other in direction of movement, to move along long or short paths, and to move at any of three speeds, allowing the moving water to follow nearly any kind of music. The original show used punched paper cards, though computers control the new system. The nozzles and pumps have never been changed, only cleaned and cared-for; and shows must still be programmed by hand. Even with the simplest of the many programs used to create shows for this fountain, choreographing one three-minute song can take anywhere from two to ten hours.|$|E

50|$|Curtained hair or Curtains is a hairstyle {{featuring}} a long fringe divided {{in either a}} middle parting or a side parting, with short (or shaved) sides and <b>back.</b> <b>Curtained</b> hair generally applies to males, although an alternative name, the undercut, is used for {{both male and female}} haircuts following this style. Variations on this haircut have been popular in Europe and North America throughout the 20th century and in the 21st century.|$|R
50|$|Two large seven-branched Menorot candelabras {{stand on}} {{either of the}} Torah Shrine. It is {{interesting}} to note that the base and branches of the two Menorot are not identical in form; the right-hand Menorah has an upright base, while the left-hand Menorah has two crescent shaped legs and one upright leg. Lastly, the entire scene is framed by the two pulled <b>back</b> <b>curtains,</b> which served to demarcate the sacred space of the Torah Shrine.|$|R
5000|$|One other notable {{fountain}} of the choreographed type is the Grand Haven Musical Fountain in Grand Haven, Michigan.

500|$|Lucius {{emerges from}} this {{experience}} in the morning, [...] and the priests dress him in an elaborately embroidered cloak.

The priests draw <b>back</b> <b>curtains</b> to reveal Lucius to a crowd of his fellow devotees.

60|$|As I did so I looked back. The battle still raged but {{it seemed}} to me with less fury than before. It was as though both sides were weary of slaughter, their leaders being fallen. The litter was borne forward, till at length the noise of {{shouting}} and tumult grew low. Twisting myself round I peered through the <b>back</b> <b>curtains</b> and saw that the Inca host and that of the Chancas were separating sullenly, neither of them broken since they carried their wounded away with them. It was plain that the battle remained drawn for there was no rout and no triumph.|$|R
5000|$|Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Randy Lewis said Newman had [...] "peeled <b>back</b> the <b>curtain</b> on... bigots and hypocrites" [...] {{with this}} song. In 1995, Newman {{admitted}} {{that he was still}} nervous performing the song.|$|R
