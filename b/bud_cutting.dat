Increasing the biomass of patchouly plants by triggering the growth could be one way to increase the production of pathouly oil. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to study the effect of apical <b>bud</b> <b>cutting</b> towards patchouly growth, and also to understand the optimum location of cutting on the nodus. The research used Complete Random Design method with 5 repetitions. There were 3 locations of cutting (R), i. e. R 0 (without cutting), R 1 (cutting at the first nodus), R 2 (cutting at the second nodus). The observed variables are length and amount of lateral bud, wet weight, and dried weight. The data were then analysed using ANOVA with significancy level of 95 %. If there were real different, the analysis were then continued using Duncan test with significancy level of 95 %. The results showed that apical <b>bud</b> <b>cutting</b> gives real effect to the variable of length and amount of lateral bud. The untreated plant has the most lateral bud shorter than the treated ones. For the variables of wet and dried weight there were not any significant differents.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of <b>bud</b> removal and <b>cutting</b> length on storage root yield and starch content of three cassava varieties. Field experiment was conducted in a split–split plot design with four replications in 2010 and 2011, under rainfed conditions. Three cassava varieties (KU 50, RY 9 and HB 60) were assigned as main plot. Two cutting lengths (15 cm and 30 cm) were assigned as sub plots, and two treatments of buds (buds cut and not cut) were assigned as sub–sub plots. The <b>buds</b> on the <b>cuttings</b> that were inserted into the soil were removed. In 2010, the plants from 15 -cm long <b>cuttings</b> subjected to <b>bud</b> removal had higher fresh storage root yield (88. 4 Mg ha− 1) than did plants from 30 -cm long <b>cuttings</b> subjected to <b>bud</b> removal (75. 8 Mg ha− 1).

Introduction: The United States is {{becoming}} the greatest fruit consuming nation in the world. The interest {{in the work of}} planting parks and lawns as well as landscape gardening is increasing year by year and we hope Professor John Craig of Cornell University is right when he says "Beautiful America is coming. " In traveling through the eastern portion of the United States one especially notices the lack of young orchards and that the old orchards that have yield such large return must soon be replaced. Throughout the irrigation districts, {{as well as in the}} Southern Central states, large commercial orchards are being planted every year. One of the most important features of orchard work is the increasing number of "Small Family" orchards. More and more do our people realize the pleasure and profit of having fresh, home grown fruit for family table use. To furnish well-formed trees, free from disease or injury and true to label is the mission of the nurseryman. In considering the effect of nursery stock upon the subsequent trees and shrubs only a few of the most prominent features will be discussed. Tree Breeding. We might properly speak of this as the "Thoroughbred Age" Animals, grain and even trees must have "pride of ancestry" before they meet with the approval of the progressive American. No doubt the term "pedigreed trees" has been used to increase business yet every honest nurseryman will exercise the greatest care in the selection of scions, <b>buds,</b> <b>cuttings</b> and seeds to be used in propagation. In fruit plantations it, is a well-known fact that some trees will produce superior fruit in size, flavor or color to others of the same variety. Just how far this characteristic will be transmitted by buds or scions is not definitely known. It seems reasonable to assume however that better results will be obtained if the nurseryman propagates from the tree yielding the best fruit...|$|R

60|$|Many {{cases of}} non-inheritance {{apparently}} {{result from the}} conditions of life continually inducing fresh variability. We have seen that when the seeds of pears, plums, apples, etc., are sown, the seedlings generally inherit some degree of family likeness. Mingled with these seedlings, a few, and sometimes many, worthless, wild-looking plants commonly appear, and their appearance {{may be attributed to}} the principle of reversion. But scarcely a single seedling will be found perfectly to resemble the parent-form; and thus may be accounted for by constantly recurring variability induced by the conditions of life. I believe in this, because it has been observed that certain fruit-trees truly propagate their kind whilst growing on their own roots; but when grafted on other stocks, and by this process their natural state is manifestly affected, they produce seedlings which vary greatly, departing from the parental type in many characters. (12/63. Downing 'Fruits of America' page 5: Sageret 'Pom. Phys.' pages 43, 72.) Metzger, as stated in the ninth chapter, found that certain kinds of wheat brought from Spain and cultivated in Germany, failed during many years to reproduce themselves truly; but at last, when accustomed to their new conditions, they ceased to be variable,--that is, they became amenable to the power of inheritance. Nearly all the plants which cannot be propagated with any approach to certainty by seed, are kinds which have been long propagated by <b>buds,</b> <b>cuttings,</b> offsets, tubers, etc., and have in consequence been frequently exposed during what may be called their individual lives to widely diversified conditions of life. Plants thus propagated become so variable, that they are subject, as {{we have seen in the}} last chapter, even to bud-variation. Our domesticated animals, on the other hand, are not commonly exposed during the life of the individual to such extremely diversified conditions, and are not liable to such extreme variability; therefore they do not lose the power of transmitting most of their characteristic features. In the foregoing remarks on non-inheritance, crossed breeds are of course excluded, as their diversity mainly depends on the unequal development of character derived from either parent or their ancestors.|$|R

40|$|Edelweiss’ is an {{important}} grape cultivar grown in the Midwestern part of the USA. This grapevine is tolerant to extreme winter temperatures which can be experienced in the areas where it is most widely grown. ‘Edelweiss’ {{is one of the}} earliest cultivars in the vineyard to break bud, making it very susceptible to late spring freezes. The primary buds of ‘Edelweiss’ produce a significant amount of fruit, while unlike many other hybrids, the secondary and tertiary buds will have little to no yields, thus making it important to protect the primary buds from a late freeze. The objective of this research was to determine if multiple applications of Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or Amigo Oil has a greater effect on bud delay when compared to single applications. ‘Edelweiss’ vines were treated with one, two, or three applications of NAA or Amigo Oil at monthly intervals starting in early January. The purpose of the Amigo Oil and NAA application was to delay bud break without affecting desired characteristics such as yield or fruit composition. Amigo Oil was applied at 10 % concentration (v/v) and the NAA at 1000 ppm with a custom built all-terrain vehicle (ATV) sprayer. All treatments of Amigo Oil led to a significant bud break delay ranging from 3 to 11 days as compared to the control. None of the treatments resulted in negative effects on yield or fruit characteristics. A controlled laboratory experiment was also conducted, where single <b>bud</b> <b>cuttings</b> were forced in forcing solution containing 200 ppm 8 -hydroxyquinoline citrate and 2 % sucrose at 25 °C under 12 hour days. Treatments of one, two, or three applications of 1000 ppm NAA and 10 % (v/v) Amigo Oil were applied to single buds at weekly intervals. Julian days until bud break were recorded and treatment-related bud break delays were observed. Two and three applications of oil significantly delayed bud break ranging from 14 to 24 days. All NAA treatments led to significant bud delay ranging from 6 to 9 days. Grape growers in climates with the potential of late spring freezes may consider the use of Amigo Oil as a potential means to protect their vines from freeze injury. Advisor: Paul E. Rea...|$|R

Shoot {{cuttings}} were {{harvested from}} four-year-old, loblolly pine hedges in March and September of 1987, and placed {{into a series}} of factorial combinations of cutting length, diameter class, and the presence/absence of a terminal bud to assess effects on rooting and field performance. Average rooting in the March trial was 50 percent and only 20 percent for the September trial; however, the best treatment in March yielded 100 percent rooting. Terminal bud status did not appear to influence percent rooting. Shorter cuttings (5. 1 or 7. 6 cm) with an average diameter of 2 or 3 mm tended to root better and develop more roots. Field performance of the rooted cuttings through age five suggests that the original cutting does not require a terminal bud, but the best set of morphological traits differ depending on bud status. Considering both rooting ability and field growth with an original tip bud present, the best cutting dimensions were 5. 1 or 7. 6 cm long and 2 or 3 mm in diameter.

Second factor was media consisting of soil, sugarcane pulp, water hyacinth, and peat. All the data were analyzed using ANOVA and means were separated by Orthogonal Polynomial. The results showed that peat medium combined with each of the concentration of shallot extract of 800 g/L water, 975 g/L water, 850 g/L water, 630 g/L water, and 820 g/L water produced the optimum number of roots (5. 06), the longest root (13. 27 cm), the longest shoot (21. 52 cm), the maximum number of leaves (12. 44), and the greenest leaves (55. 82), respectively...|$|R
40|$|Exogenous {{application}} of plant growth regulators (PGRs) {{may be an}} effective technique for increasing the rooting ability {{and the growth of}} vegetative fragments (cuttings) of plants used in dune restoration programs. Various concentrations (0, 50 and 100 mg l 1) of two auxins, alpha-naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA) and indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA), and two cytokinins, 6 -furfurylaminopurine (Kinetin) and 6 - benzylaminopurine (BAP), were applied separately to cuttings of two widely used species for restoration, Ammophila arenaria and Sporobuls virginicus. Root development and production of new <b>buds</b> in <b>cuttings</b> were examined under laboratory conditions one month after application. Cuttings were also examined one year after transplanting into a sandy substratum under natural conditions, to test for possible long term effects of PGRs on plant establishment success and growth. The response of the two study species to PGRs differed substantially. In A. arenaria the auxin NAA at 100 mg l 1 reduced the time for root initiation and increased the rooting capacity of cuttings, while the cytokinin Kinetin at 50 mg l 1 facilitated root growth. No auxin had effect on rooting or growth of S. virginicus cuttings, but treatment with 100 mg l 1 Kinetin resulted in higher rooting success than the control. One year after planting, the cuttings of A. arenaria treated with 100 mg l 1 NAA showed a higher establishment success (90...|$|R
30|$|Cuttings of 3 – 5  cm length with 1 – 3 {{leaves were}} {{obtained}} from subcultured poplar trees approximately 20 – 40  cm tall, which were grown in a growth room (closed, 14 -h light, 24 – 28  °C). The cuttings were placed in pots (7.5  cm diameter, 6.5  cm depth) containing a mix of vermiculate:red clay ball soil (2 : 1). The potted cuttings were incubated with water only, until rooting. After the confirmation of new shoot growth from the axillary <b>bud,</b> the potted <b>cuttings</b> were placed in plastic containers (16  cm ×  11  cm, 4.5  cm depth) one by one, and cultured with 2000 -fold-diluted Hyponex fertilizer (N:P:K =  6 : 10 : 5, HYPONeX Japan, Osaka, Japan) placed at 0.5 – 2  cm depth. Four individual poplar trees were cultured for three cycles of the shortened annual cycle system described below.|$|R
40|$|Cell {{division}} and cell expansion during {{early stages of}} tuber development were studied using developing axillary <b>buds</b> on single-leaf <b>cuttings</b> from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Cuttings taken from plants induced to form tubers, by short day (SD) treatment, were compared with cuttings from non-induced (long day, LD) plants. In the apical zone of the buds, cell division occurred {{from the first day}} after cutting, in both LD and SD cuttings. The planes of these divisions were transverse, associated with elongation of the buds. At day 5, a new orientation of cell division was observed in the subapical zone of SD cuttings only. These divisions were longitudinal, associated with radial growth. Cell expansion occurred in both SD and LD cuttings, and was not uniquely related to the onset of tuber formation.

40|$|Viticulture is an {{important}} and intensive agricultural branch in Çanakkale province and also in Turkey. Different American vine rootstocks are widely used against phylloxera in our country. Plant breeders have been using gamma radiation for creating new varieties of crops and for obtaining broad genetic diversity for years. In this study, four different doses of gamma rays were applied to 420 A and 5 BB American vine rootstocks when the <b>buds</b> on the <b>cuttings</b> were at the dormant stage. Then, effects of different gamma radiation doses on the cuttings of 420 A and 5 BB American vine rootstocks were investigated. The {{aim of the research}} was to study the effect of different gamma radiation doses on some growth parameters of cuttings of 420 A and 5 BB, and to determine the GR 50 dose.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} an efficient protocol for the in vitro propagation of the endangered, endemic and decorative species Dianthus pinifolius Sibth. et Sm. The effects of different concentrations of 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) and naphtalenacetic acid (NAA), and different explant types (single-node <b>cuttings,</b> terminal <b>buds</b> and shoot <b>cuttings)</b> on shoot multiplication were examined on Murashige and Skoog (MS) and half-strength MS media. The best results were obtained for shoot cuttings on the MS medium supplemented with 0. 5 mg/L BAP and 0. 1 mg/L NAA, achieving a maximum rate of regeneration (100 %) and a total of 15. 4 newly-developed shoots per explant. The highest rooting rate (96. 7 %) was obtained on MS medium containing 1 mg/L NAA, while the acclimatization of the microplants obtained to ex vitro conditions was successful (88. 9 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} of “tuberization stimulus” in potato shoots (Solanum tuberosum L.) {{can be assessed}} from cuttings containing one or more leaves. Cuttings maintained in a mist chamber under long days will form tubers from underground buds if prior to taking the cutting the leaves received sufficient exposure to photoperiods less than the critical photoperiod. The greatest tendency to tuberize was found in cuttings that consisted of a single, fully expanded leaf and its subtended bud. Grafts showed that genetical differences in critical photoperiod resided in properties of the leaf. Short days before cutting tended to shift growth from above ground <b>buds</b> of two-node <b>cuttings</b> to below ground buds, even {{if the number of}} short days was insufficient for tuber induction. As few as 6 short days reduced growth of shoots at the upper bud and increased underground growth of shoots and stolons...|$|R
40|$|Four {{interspecific}} hybrids between cassava {{and wild}} Manihot species were polyploidized by {{the application of}} colchicine to <b>cutting</b> <b>buds.</b> Totally tetraploid types of 2 n= 72 as well as sectorial and periclinal chimeras were produced. Morphological, cytogenetial and anatomical exames were efficient in identifying different types of chimers. Somatic selection applied to lateral buds of sectorial chimeras   enabled obtaining totally tetraploids. The fertility of sterile   interspecific hybrids was restored by chromosome duplication  and reached 93 % of viable pollen in tetraploid types compared to 13 % in the diploid forms. New Manihot species have evolved  due to this  induced fertility. Periclinal chimeras showed high vigorisity compared to both tetraploid and diploid types. The fertile interspecific hybrids will be crossed with apomictic   clones to produce triploid apomictic ones.

60|$|We {{have seen}} in the first chapter, that the several kinds of dogs are almost {{certainly}} descended from more than one species, and so it is with cattle, pigs and some other domesticated animals. Hence the crossing of aboriginally distinct species probably came into play at an early period in the formation of our present races. From Rutimeyer's observations {{there can be little doubt}} that this occurred with cattle; but in most cases one form will probably have absorbed and obliterated the other, for it is not likely that semi-civilised men would have taken the necessary pains to modify by selection their commingled, crossed, and fluctuating stock. Nevertheless, those animals which were best adapted to their conditions of life would have survived through natural selection; and by this means crossing will often have indirectly aided in the formation of primeval domesticated breeds. Within recent times, as far as animals are concerned, the crossing of distinct species has done little or nothing towards the formation or modification of our races. It is not yet known whether the several species of silk-moth which have been recently crossed in France will yield permanent races. With plants which can be multiplied by <b>buds</b> and <b>cuttings,</b> hybridisation has done wonders, as with many kinds of Roses, Rhododendrons, Pelargoniums, Calceolarias, and Petunias. Nearly all these plants can be propagated by seed, most of them freely; but extremely few or none come true by seed.|$|R
40|$|Tradescantia pallida var. purpurea <b>cuttings</b> with flower <b>buds</b> are {{utilized}} in bioassays to diagnose genotoxic effects of water. The literature describes different substances used {{to adapt and}} recover the cuttings before and after exposure to water samples and also describes the effects of different exposure times. This study evaluated and compared the micronuclei (MCN) frequencies in T. pallida when <b>cuttings</b> with flower <b>buds</b> were submitted to different methodological conditions. The bioassay was then applied bimonthly during seven months to assess the genotoxic potential of a site located on the Sinos River in Campo Bom, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Micronuclei frequencies in <b>buds</b> of <b>cuttings</b> adapted and recovered in distilled water and in Hoagland solution were 3. 0 and 2. 9, respectively, for cuttings exposed to river water, and 1. 19 and 1. 23 in controls. No significant differences among MCN frequencies were observed when cuttings were exposed for 8, 24 or 32 hours to river water (from 3. 07 to 4. 73) and in controls (from 1. 13 to 2. 00) in all samplings during a year. Adaptation and recovery of cuttings in distilled water or Hoagland solution and exposure for different times did not influence the response of T. pallida, indicating that all the conditions tested are viable for biomonitoring of water genotoxicity. Water samples from the Sinos River presented genotoxicity during the period monitored, evidenced by the MCN frequencies recorded which {{were significantly higher than}} the frequencies of the controls...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} size and {{division}} of the mother corm on yield of gladioli inflorescences, corms and cormlets and on inflorescence quality were studied in two experiments in south-east Queensland. Planting with whole large corms resulted in greater inflorescence yield, higher inflorescence quality and gave more high quality inflorescences than planting with smaller corms. Flowering percentage [(number of inflorescences/number of corms planted) x 100] was increased by cutting the large corms, but was reduced by cutting the smaller corms. Inflorescence quality was reduced by cutting corms. Some multiple shooting (greater than one shoot per corm) occurred with whole large corms and increased the flowering percentage, but inflorescence quality was still higher than for the smaller corms, and was acceptable by market standards. The yield of new corms was increased by cutting corms of large or number 3 size, but was reduced by cutting the smaller initial corms. For the large corms, cutting increased the yield of new corms by 93 %. The method of cutting corms influenced subsequent plant development. Cutting to remove storage tissue and damage to part of the root initials without damaging the buds, stimulated multiple shooting, increased inflorescence yield, decreased inflorescence quality, and substantially increased the number and weight of new corms. Removal of <b>buds</b> in <b>cutting</b> reduced inflorescence number and corm and cormlet yield. Commercial producers {{may be able to}} cut large corms to rapidly propagate new planting material, concurrently with flower production. However, cultivars differ in their response to cutting...|$|R
