50|$|Alvin uses four 208 lb steel weights (~1.7 {{cubic feet}} of steel) to provide {{negative}} buoyancy {{for the trip to}} the ocean floor. Alvin contains a <b>ballast</b> and <b>trim</b> <b>system,</b> but the steel weights allow deep dives to be achieved more rapidly. These weights are jettisoned on each dive and left at the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|The {{occupied}} pressure hulls of {{deep diving}} submarines such as [...] are spherical instead of cylindrical. This allows a more even distribution of stress {{at the great}} depth. A titanium frame is usually affixed to the pressure hull, providing attachment for <b>ballast</b> and <b>trim</b> <b>systems,</b> scientific instrumentation, battery packs, syntactic flotation foam, and lighting.|$|R
40|$|BalTrim is an Excel(R) {{spreadsheet}} {{designed to}} calculate the inertial mass properties and <b>ballast</b> <b>trim</b> weight for either an assembled reentry vehicle (RV) or reentry body (RB). With this application, the user enters known mass properties and global coordinates for each subcomponent of the assembly, and BalTrim calculates the mass properties of the total assembly. Then, using the assembly mass properties, BalTrim calculates the necessary amount of <b>ballast</b> <b>trim</b> weight required to dynamically and statically balance the assembly mass properties. The final mass properties and <b>trim</b> <b>ballast</b> weight calculated with BalTrim agree with physicaly measured values...|$|R

40|$|A superconducting ring {{cyclotron}} {{proposed as}} a booster {{of the existing}} RIKEN Ring Cyclotron (RRC), is composed of six superconducting sector magnets. In each sector mag-net, the pole pieces are placed at 4 K {{to be used as}} a sup-port structure of the coil vessel against large electromag-netic forces and also to enhance magnetic flux efficiently. The field <b>trimming</b> <b>system</b> suitable for such a cyclotron is thought to be a combination of superconducting and nor-mal trim coils. Considering their differing properties, opti-mization of a <b>trimming</b> <b>system</b> has been carried out using numerical methods. The <b>trimming</b> <b>system</b> is required to isochronize the magnetic fields for various ions in a wide range of beam energy. Features of the trim coils and the results of optimization are described. ...|$|R

White Knight is also equipped with a <b>trim</b> <b>system</b> which (when activated) causes it to have the same glide profile as SpaceShipOne; this allows the pilots to practice for landing SpaceShipOne.

5000|$|Using side-scan sonar, {{remotely}} operated vehicles, and a commercial fishing trawler, workers recovered about 85% of the fuselage (including the tail section) {{and a majority}} of the wing components. In addition, both engines, as well as the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and CVR were retrieved. All wreckage that was retrieved from the crash site was unloaded at Port Hueneme, California for examination and documentation by NTSB investigators. Both the horizontal stabilizer <b>trim</b> <b>system</b> jackscrew (also referred to as [...] "acme screw"), and the corresponding acme nut, which the jackscrew turns through, were retrieved. As the jackscrew rotates it moves up or down through the (fixed) acme nut. This up and down motion moves the horizontal stabilizer for the <b>trim</b> <b>system.</b> Upon recovery from the crash site, and subsequent examination, the jackscrew was found with metallic filaments wrapped around it; these were later determined to be the threads from the acme nut.|$|R
50|$|The low-set, {{straight}} wing has a double-taper planform, 2Â½-deg dihedral {{from the}} roots, {{a relatively low}} aspect ratio, and 100 L fuel tanks permanently attached to the wingtips. The trailing edge has double-slotted trailing edge flaps inboard of mass-balanced ailerons; the flaps are separated from the ailerons by small wing fences. An automatic <b>trimming</b> <b>system</b> was present, the flaps and the <b>trim</b> <b>system</b> being connected in order to counteract the potentially large pitch changes {{that would otherwise be}} generated by vigorous movements of the flaps. The tall, swept vertical tail has an inset rudder. Variable-incidence horizontal stabilizers with inset elevators are mounted {{at the base of the}} rudder and over the exhaust nozzle. Side-by-side airbrakes are located under the fuselage ahead of the wing's leading edge. The flaps, landing gear, wheel brakes and air brakes are powered by a hydraulic system. Controls are pushrod-actuated and have electrically powered servo tabs on the ailerons and rudder. Operational g-force limits at 4,200 kg are +8/-4 g.|$|R
5000|$|Alaska 261 {{departed}} from Puerto Vallarta at 13:37 PST, and climbed to its intended cruising altitude of flight level310 (...) [...] The plane {{was scheduled to}} land at San Francisco International Airport. Some time before 15:49, the flight crew contacted the airline's dispatch and maintenance control facilities in SeaTac, Washington, on a company radio frequency shared with operations and maintenance facilities at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), to discuss a jammed horizontal stabilizer and a possible diversion to LAX. The jammed stabilizer prevented operation of the <b>trim</b> <b>system,</b> which would normally make slight adjustments to the flight control surfaces to keep the plane stable in flight. At their cruising altitude and speed, {{the position of the}} jammed stabilizer required the pilots to pull on their controls with approximately 10 pounds (44 N) of force to keep level. Neither the flight crew, nor company maintenance, could determine the cause of the jam. Repeated attempts to overcome the jam with the primary and alternate <b>trim</b> <b>systems</b> were unsuccessful.|$|R
5000|$|Again in 1972, {{this time}} with the Tupolev Tu-154, the carrier became the first foreign {{customer}} to incorporate a new Tupolev aircraft into its fleet. The latter type was deployed first on charter flights, and later on scheduled services. By [...] the same year, Balkan had two of these aircraft in service. It also launched non-Soviet use of the Tu-154A, Tu-154B, Tu-154B-2 and Tu-154M. Balkan was a useful test-bed for new ideas by the Tupolev bureau. The airline pioneered the use of three-person flightdeck crews on the Tu-154 by removing navigators (flight crew members whom the designers had intentionally inserted into the Tu-134 and Tu-154) between 1972 and 1976. Balkan also removed the Tu-154's concrete <b>ballast</b> <b>trim</b> on which conservative Tupolev engineers had insisted. In the mid-1980s, a team of Bulgarian engineers interlinked the automatic flight control systems of the airline's Tu-154s with OMEGA Navigation System receivers, enabling very accurate automatic long-range overwater navigation. In the 1990s, Balkan {{was among the first to}} fit GPS navigation to its Tu-154 fleet. A Tu-154B was flown non-stop from Montreal to Sofia, a distance of over 7000 km and a record for the type, during a charter flight.|$|R
