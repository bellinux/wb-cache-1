40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} the {{options available to}} general practitioners (GPs) to help patients experiencing economic hardship to manage their illnesses {{and the implications of}} these findings for policy. Method: Cross-sectional survey of 134 GPs practising within the WentWest Division of General Practice and Blue Mountains GP Network in NSW. Results: Most general practitioners in our survey encountered patients whom they perceived to be experiencing economic hardship. Of the 134 responses received (21 % response rate), 123 (92 %) GPs reported treating patients who found it difficult to afford health care; and 86 (64 %) GPs estimated that some of these patients had: (1) deterioration in their health; (2) been admitted to hospital as a consequence of failure to take prescribed medicines; or, rarely, (3) died, as a result of failure to take prescribed medicines. The GPs usually learnt about their patients’ financial difficulties because patients: told them; asked for their consultations to be bulk-billed; or were reluctant to take medications or to see specialists because of cost. The GPs most often offered these patients <b>bulk</b> <b>billed</b> services, drug sample packs or a change to a more affordable treatment regimen. Conclusion and Implication: GPs have limited options available to them to assist patients experiencing economic hardship. A policy response should ensure that co- payments for medications and medical care do not block access to necessary prescription medicines or services...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} actual {{availability and}} cost of general practitioner appointments for children with conditions of low acuity and low urgency, {{from the perspective of}} the child's family. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A "secret shopper" method, whereby research assistants posing as parents seeking appointments for mildly ill children telephoned a random sample of 225 general practice clinics within three Melbourne Medicare Local catchments, which included urban, suburban and regional areas; the study was conducted between 1 August and 30 September 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Availability of same-day appointments and time until appointment; bulk-billing status of the clinic and/or the potential cost of an appointment. RESULTS: High availability of appointments was found in all three catchment areas (range, 72 %- 81 % of clinics contacted). About half (49 %) had appointments available within 4 hours. Between 72 % and 80 % of clinics contacted in the three Medicare Local catchment areas offered bulk-billing for paediatric appointments. CONCLUSION: There is extensive same-day new-patient GP appointment availability for mildly ill children in the catchment areas of Melbourne studied. Further, as most of the available appointments are in clinics that <b>bulk</b> <b>bill,</b> financial access should not affect this availability. Increased paediatric presentations to emergency departments are not likely to be the result of limited GP availability.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess a}} {{national}} sample of Australian parental confidence in general practitioner (GP) care for illness and injury for their children. METHODS: Cross-sectional, internet-based survey of a national, {{representative sample of}} parents of children birth - 17 [*]years in Australia was used. Purposeful recruitment was used to achieve a national, representative sample of 2100 Australian parents, reflective of demographic and geographic distribution based on census data. Parents {{were asked to indicate}} their degree of confidence in a GP to handle medical problems as well as their preference for, and use of, paediatric speciality care for their children. RESULTS: Fewer than half of parents (44 %) reported that they were completely confident in a GP to provide general care as defined as 'can handle almost all general health issues for my child'. A slightly greater proportion of parents (56 %) were completely confident in a GP to provide care for minor injuries, defined as injuries not requiring an X-ray. Greater confidence in general care was seen among parents > 40 [*]years of age and those whose GP is always <b>bulk</b> <b>billed.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Parental confidence in GPs is an important issue. Our findings that fewer than half of parents are completely confident in their GP to provide general care to their child may be an influencing factor on current health-care utilisation trends. The potential implications of low parental confidence in GPs are greater numbers of emergency department presentations for children with lower urgency conditions and increased referrals of children for specialty care.

40|$|The {{impact on}} {{attendance}} {{of the distance}} to general practice surgeries, and the attributes offered by those surgeries, was investigated. One thousand and forty four subjects, selected at random from the metropolitan area of Perth, Western Australia, responded to a household interview survey concerning which attributes of general practice (GP) surgeries they found attractive and {{the identity of the}} surgery they preferred to attend. The sample was stratified by different levels of social disadvantage and by good and poor global levels of spatial accessibility of GP surgeries. In separate fieldwork, interviewers collected detailed environmental data from practice staff at 466 GP surgeries available to the community survey respondents within metropolitan Perth. Respondents living in areas of poor global access were more likely to attend their nearest surgery (25 % vs. 6 %) and to bypass fewer surgeries to attend a preferred surgery (median 2 vs. 20). Those who were most socially disadvantaged were less likely than those who were better off to bypass surgeries where global access was poor, but more likely to bypass nearby surgeries and to seek out a surgery that <b>bulk</b> <b>billed</b> in areas where global access was good. A number of attractiveness factors had an important influence on choice of surgery, including: 'easy to make an appointment'; 'generally sees patients on time'; 'pharmacy nearby'; 'bulk bills' and 'open at all on Sundays'. Respondents attending their nearest surgery {{were more likely to have}} all of their nominated 'very important' attributes satisfied at that surgery than non-attenders (40 % vs. 16 %). A logistic regression model, adjusting for distance effects and size of surgery, showed within each level of global access and social disadvantage a consistent increase in the odds of attending a surgery that satisfied the attributes desired by respondents.

50|$|In West Manila, Maynilad {{initiated}} early {{attempts to}} connect the poor in slums {{through the construction of}} piped networks by a small local company called IWADCO (Inpart Waterworks and Development Company) using its own funds and buying water in bulk from the utilities. Local banks initially refused to lend to the company even when it already had 25,000 paying customers. A NGO called Streams of Knowledge, which is associated with the Philippine Center for Water and Sanitation and was supported by UNDP, helped to set up the arrangement together with the local government and Maynilad which provides water at a discounted bulk rate. Users pay their water bills to water coordinators from the respective communities, which in turn pay Streams, which in turn pays a salary to the coordinator, pays the <b>bulk</b> water <b>bill</b> and returns part of the funds to the community. Maynilad built the piped network only to supply points at the entry of narrow alleys, from where residents distributed it among themselves with rubber hoses. A connection fee of 5000 Pesos (about US$90) was paid in instalments, resulting in monthly payments of about 200 Pesos (US$3.70) per household. This was about four times less than what the poor had paid to water vendors before. Maynilad pursued an approach to connect poor communities that included laying pipes in slums, which made it difficult to control theft. Indeed, non-revenue water even increased in West Manila.|$|R

The throat and breast are scaled with broad flat feathers of an intense golden hue, changing to green and blue tints in certain lights. On the back of the head is a broad recurved band of feathers, whose brilliancy is indescribable, resembling the sheen of emerald and topaz rather than any organic substance. Over the forehead is a large patch of pure white feathers, which shine like satin; and from the sides of the head spring the six wonderful feathers from which the bird receives its name. These are slender wires, six inches long, with a small oval web at the extremity. In addition to these ornaments, there is also an immense tuft of soft feathers on each side of the breast, which when elevated must entirely hide the wings, and give the bird au appearance of being double its real <b>bulk.</b> The <b>bill</b> is black, short, and rather compressed, with the feathers advancing over the nostrils, as in Cicinnurus regius.

50|$|In Australia {{the current}} system, known as Medicare, was instituted in 1984. It coexists {{with a private}} health system. All legal {{permanent}} residents are entitled to government-paid public hospital care. Treatment by private doctors is also paid by the government when the doctor direct bills the Health Department (<b>Bulk</b> <b>Billing).</b> Medicare is funded partly by a 1.5% income tax levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private health insurance. There is a means tested 30% subsidy on private health insurance. As well as Medicare, there is a separate Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under which listing and a government subsidy is dependent on expert evaluation of the comparative cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals. In 2005, Australia spent 8.8% of GDP on health care, or US$3,181 per capita. Of that, approximately 67% was government expenditure.|$|E
40|$|Background: International {{research}} has shown that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups experience significantly higher mortality and morbidity rates than other groups. Both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes are major contributors to Australia's burden of disease, and individuals from lower socioeconomic groups {{are more likely to be}} affected by both, and to have worse prognoses and outcomes. There is substantial research evidence that a range of preventive activities can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions. Research in countries with good access to primary health care services has demonstrated that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups tend to have higher levels of medical consultations, but make less use of preventive care and screening services. This fact contributes to their poorer health outcomes, as diagnosis will typically occur later than for more advantaged individuals, thus leading to a poorer prognosis. However, to date, there has been little research on the differential utilisation of preventive health services for CVD and diabetes by different socioeconomic groups in Australia. To understand socioeconomic influences on the use of preventive health services, a comprehensive review of the literature of determinants of health service utilisation was conducted and a number of explanations for this relationship considered. It was proposed that the following factors are likely to be important in this relationship: differences in the perception of the availability of, and accessibility to health care, attitudes and beliefs toward preventive health care, having a regular source of care, perception of interpersonal care from general practitioners, and social support. A number of theoretical models were also reviewed; in particular, the Andersen Behavioural Model of Health Service Research Utilisation. Aims: This doctoral research program has described the relationship between socioeconomic position (SEP) and utilisation of preventive health services in relation to CVD and diabetes. It aims to improve the understanding of the determinants of uptake and utilisation of preventive health services in general practice by different socioeconomic groups in Australia. Methods: The study was conducted in Brisbane Australia, in 2004, using a cross-sectional design and a self-administered mailed survey for data collection. A sample of adults aged 25 - 64 years was selected randomly from the Brisbane Electoral Roll. A conceptual model incorporating a range of relevant socio-demographic, risk-factor and behavioural variables in the relationship between SEP and GP-based use of preventive health services was used to develop a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was pilot-tested and then reviewed by a panel of international experts. A new self-administered questionnaire, the Health Service Utilisation Questionnaire (HSUQ), was developed. It included 79 items: 12 socio-demographic items; 10 items assessing health status, disease conditions and smoking status; 20 items assessing use of health services; and 37 items assessing the factors that might affect use of health services utilisation. The HSUQ was then mailed to 800 randomly selected survey participants. The survey response rate was 65. 6 per cent. After exclusion of those patients with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, the final sample size was 381, consisting of 155 males and 226 females. Socioeconomic indicators were individual education level and family income. Blood pressure, blood cholesterol and blood glucose check-ups by general practitioners (GPs) were used as the major outcome variables. Nine scales and two dichotomous variables that measure those potential factors were derived following Principal Component Analysis and reliability testing. The data were analysed separately by gender, and adjusted for age and each of the socioeconomic indicators. Statistical description, bivariate analysis and multivariable modelling in SPSS were applied for the data analysis. Results: The survey results were suggestive of socioeconomically disadvantaged people being less likely than more advantaged people to utilise preventive health services for CVD and diabetes. For males, the low socioeconomic groups recorded the least use of preventive health services among the three education and income groups, including blood cholesterol and blood glucose check-ups, while the high socioeconomic group recorded the greatest use of preventive health services. There was no apparent relationship between education level and blood pressure check-up, while individuals from low-income families were less likely to go for a blood pressure check-up. For females, most of the results suggested that the low socioeconomic groups were less likely than the high socioeconomic groups to have blood cholesterol and blood glucose check-ups. However, this was not the case for blood pressure check-ups. The results showed that the low and middle socioeconomic groups were more likely than the high socioeconomic groups to have BP check-ups. However, the low socioeconomic groups were still less likely than the middle socioeconomic groups to have a blood pressure check-up. Overall, there was a similar pattern between education and income and the use of GP-based preventive health services among both males and females. The findings from the examination of the mediating factors between SEP and the GP-based use of preventive health services suggested that socioeconomically disadvantaged adults (both low level of education and low income) are more concerned about transport and travel time to health care, and accessibility to health care in terms of finding a GP who <b>bulk</b> <b>bills,</b> the cost of seeing a GP and having a choice of GP. They are also less likely to have a regular place of care and social support. These potential factors are likely to result in a lesser use of preventive health services than their high-SEP counterparts. In addition, the findings also suggested that respondents with a low level of education have less-positive attitudes towards health care, and that those from low-income families do not have a regular care provider and are less likely to visit their GP for a preventive check-up in relation to CVD and diabetes in Australia. Conclusions: Strategies for reducing socioeconomic health inequalities are partly associated with changing social and economic policies, empowering individuals, strengthening social and family networks, and improving the equity of the health care system. Strategies have been recommended for implementation in general practice that are directed at targeting the needs of disadvantaged groups; for example, providing longer consultation time and actively offering information on preventive care. Implementation of health promotion programs is needed in disadvantaged areas to keep the community informed about the availability of health services and to make health services more accessible. The health care system needs to be geographically accessible through improvements to the transport system. In addition, improving access to a regular source of primary health care is likely to be an important step in encouraging low-SEP individuals to use preventive health services...|$|R
5000|$|The austere budget faced {{widespread}} {{criticism and}} was overwhelmingly {{rejected by the}} Australian public as reflected in all opinion polls after its release. [...] Opposition to [...] "unfair" [...] budget measures came from the opposition and cross-bench, pensioners, economists, the union movement, students and welfare, community and disability groups with some taking {{to the streets in}} protest.

5000|$|A {{period of}} {{division}} for the Liberals followed, with former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock for supremacy. The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document—a radical collection of [...] "dry", economic liberal measures including {{the introduction of}} a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of <b>bulk</b> <b>billing</b> for non-concession holders, {{the introduction of a}} nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation {{of a large number of}} government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST—leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and <b>bulk</b> <b>billing</b> were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.|$|E
