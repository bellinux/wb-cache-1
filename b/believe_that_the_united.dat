5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} seem to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country {{under the control of}} a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E

25|$|From being a {{supporter}} of British membership of the Common Market in 1970 I have come to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom would be Better Off Out of the developing European Republic of the 21st century. We British have a thousand year history of self-government. We have been free and democratic longer than any other nation. The European Union is too diverse, too bureaucratic, too corporatist and too centralist to be a functioning democracy. We are happy to trade with our European friends {{and the rest of}} the world – but we would prefer to govern ourselves.|$|E

[...] Activists at the Ocean Conservancy have been working on a campaign called the Save Our Ocean Legacy, a campaign lasting several years trying to establish Marine Protected Areas' off of the California coasts. [...] 29 Marine Protected Areas were planned to be established when the legislation bill passed in 1999. [...] The hope is that the plan will be finalized in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Knowing {{that the}} United States had pledged {{to defend the}} oil-producing kingdoms in the Persian Gulf {{according}} to the Carter Doctrine, primarily to ensure oil supplies to Europe, not its homeland, the Soviets decide that eliminating NATO is a necessary first step before its Persian Gulf operation can take place. It launches a KGB operation {{to carry out a}} false flag operation framing a West German for a terrorist attack on civilians in the USSR. It would then launch a [...] "limited" [...] campaign to overthrow the government of West Germany.

2500|$|Many Americans {{agreed with}} Paine, {{and came to}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States' virtue {{was a result of}} its special {{experiment}} in freedom and democracy.

[...] To Americans in the decades that followed their proclaimed freedom for mankind, embodied in the Declaration of Independence, could only be described as the inauguration of [...] "a new time scale" [...] because the world would look back and define history as events that took place before, and after, the Declaration of Independence.

2500|$|Labor unions were {{a factor}} in the Court's decision. Labor unions use {{picketing}} as a common tactic, so any case concerning public assembly is of great interest to labor groups. Justices Black and Clark made note of the obstruction charge as bad for labor picketing in their opinions, and even stated that the threat to labor picketing was their main reasoning for that decision. (Kalven 1965) In the words of one justice, Hugo L. Black, [...] "Those who encourage minority groups to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Constitution and Federal laws give them a right to patrol and picket in the streets whenever they choose, in order to advance what they think to be a just and noble end, do no service to those minority groups, their cause, or their country."

Louisiana, was formerly special counsel to the major labor group the AFL-CIO (New York Times July 16, 1960 pg. 7).|$|E
