40|$|In {{the quest}} for a {{sustainable}} bio-based economy, <b>biorefineries</b> play a central role as they involve the sustainable processing of biomass into marketable products and energy. This paper aims to provide a perspective on applications of separations that can make a great difference in <b>biorefineries,</b> by significantly reducing the costs and thus making the processes competitive without subsidies. A parallel is drawn between bio-refinery and petro-refinery, to highlight the specific separation challenges encountered in <b>biorefineries</b> and point out the impact of separations on the total costs. Existing and foreseen separations in <b>biorefineries</b> are reviewed, and the upcoming challenges in the bio-domain (additional to current fossil) are identified. Relevant industrial examples are provided to illustrate the tremendous eco-efficiency benefits of well-designed separation processes based on process intensification principles (e. g. reactive separations, dividing-wall column, affinity and trigger-enhanced separations). These examples also illustrate the low sustainability of several bio-separations currently practiced, in terms of high relative energy requirements, large amounts of gypsum co-production and/or excess use of caustic...|$|R

40|$|Replacing {{fossil fuels}} with biomass in the {{production}} of energy carriers, materials and specialty chemicals is a challenge that now confronts humanity. Numerous questions demand an answer: in which applications we shall use the limited biomass resource; how the raw materials are best refined; if <b>biorefineries</b> can be integrated in existing industries; and what policy instruments are required to realise the <b>biorefineries</b> of the future.

40|$|Despite {{some success}} with {{microbial}} fuel cells and microbial electrolysis cells in recovering resources from wastes, challenges with their scale and yield {{need to be}} resolved. Waste streams from <b>biorefineries</b> e. g. bioethanol and biodiesel plants and wastewaters are plausible substrates for microbial electrosynthesis (MES). MES integration can help <b>biorefineries</b> achieving the full polygeneration potentials, i. e. recovery of metals turning apparently pollutants from <b>biorefineries</b> into resources, production of biofuels and chemicals from reuse of CO 2 and clean water. Symbiotic integration between the two systems can attain an economic and environmental upside of the overall system. We envision that electrochemical technologies and waste <b>biorefineries</b> can be integrated for increased efficiency and competitiveness with stillage released from the latter process used in the former as feedstock and energy resource recovered from the former used in the latter. Such symbiotic integration can avoid loss of 2 material and energy from waste streams, thereby increasing the overall efficiency, economics and environmental performance that would serve towards delivering the common goals from both the systems.

30|$|Lignin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{plentiful}} biopolymers on Earth. It is a complex alkyl–aromatic heteropolymer found in the plant cell wall, which provides strength and protection to terrestrial plants. Currently, technical lignin is produced from either the pulp/paper industries and/or cellulosic ethanol <b>biorefineries,</b> where it is mainly used as an energy source to produce steam and electricity. Lignin is underexploited as a chemical feedstock because of its heterogeneity and intractable structure (Ayyachamy et al. 2013). The valorization of lignin to produce renewable fuels and chemicals is important to further develop the <b>biorefineries</b> (Beckham et al. 2016; Camarero et al. 2014; Rodriguez et al. 2017). To allow lignin to be used as a substrate for bioconversion, a depolymerization step is essential to generate a combination of monomeric, dimeric and oligomeric lignin-based compounds (Rinaldi et al. 2016; Xu et al. 2014). These can be further catabolized into various bio-based compounds of economic value for lignocellulosic <b>biorefineries</b> (Abdelaziz et al. 2016; Salvachúa et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|Abstract In today's world, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} trend towards the use of renewable, cheap and readily available biomass {{in the production of}} a wide variety of fine and bulk chemicals in different <b>biorefineries.</b> <b>Biorefineries</b> utilize the activities of microbial cells and their enzymes to convert biomass into target products.
