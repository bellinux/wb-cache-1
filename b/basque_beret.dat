5000|$|Winners {{receive a}} <b>Basque</b> <b>beret</b> (boina or txapela) as a trophy, hence the Basque word for [...] "champion" [...] - txapeldun, {{literally}} [...] "one {{who has a}} beret".|$|E
50|$|It was {{standard}} practice among the Maquis to identify members by wearing a <b>Basque</b> <b>beret</b> {{because it was}} common enough not to arouse suspicion but distinctive enough to be effective.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Basque</b> style <b>beret</b> was the {{traditional}} headgear of Aragonese and Navarrian shepherds from the Ansó and Roncal valleys of the Pyrenees, a mountain range that divides Southern France from northern Spain.The commercial production of Basque-style berets {{began in the}} 17th century in the Oloron-Sainte-Marie area of Southern France. Originally a local craft, beret-making became industrialised in the 19th century. The first factory, Beatex-Laulhere, claims production records dating back to 1810. By the 1920s, berets {{were associated with the}} working classes in a part of France and Spain and by 1928 more than 20 French factories and some Spanish and Italian factories produced millions of berets.|$|R
5000|$|Berets {{came to be}} popularised across Europe {{and other}} parts of the world as typical Basque headgear, as {{reflected}} in their name in several languages (e.g. <b>béret</b> <b>basque</b> in French; Baskenmütze in German; Basco in Italian; or baskeri in Finnish), while the Basques themselves use the words txapela or boneta. They are very popular and common in the Basque Country. The colours adopted for folk costumes varied by region and purpose: black and blue are worn more frequently than red and white, which are usually used at local festivities. The people of Aragon adopted red berets while the black beret became the common headgear of workers in France [...] and Spain.|$|R
50|$|Oloron is also famous, among hat enthusiasts, as {{the capital}} of the <b>basque</b> <b>beret,</b> {{although}} the beret business has fallen victim to the widespread collapse of the European textile business as well as changing fashions. Today only one beret business survives in Oloron. This is the Béatex company which employs approximately 80 people.|$|E
5000|$|Count Gastone Brilli-Peri (24 March 1893 - 22 March 1930) was an Italian racing driver, {{who won the}} 1925 Italian Grand Prix in an Alfa Romeo P2, {{securing}} the inaugural World Manufacturers' Championship title for Alfa Romeo. Known simply as [...] "Brilli", his face had been permanently scarred in an accident during a Tour of Italy motorcycle race. He used to race wearing a hat similar to a <b>Basque</b> <b>beret,</b> which is now known in Italy as a brilliperi.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the modern}} version, Olentzero is {{depicted}} as a lovable character, widely attributed to being overweight, having a huge appetite and thirst. He {{is depicted as}} a Basque peasant wearing a <b>Basque</b> <b>beret,</b> a farmer's attire with traditional abarketa shoes and smoking a pipe. Whether he has a beard or not is not yet an established tradition. Sometimes his face is stained with charcoal, {{as a sign of}} his trade as a charcoal-burner. On Christmas Eve, groups of people or children carry effigies of Olentzero around on a chair through the streets, singing Olentzero carols and collecting food or sweets (not unlike the American trick or treat) and the traditions surrounding the holiday of Santa Ageda in the Basque Country where oles egitea [...] "asking for alms" [...] is practised. At the end, it is customary in some places to burn the Olentzero, for example in Lesaka.|$|E
5000|$|Turbans {{continued}} gaining {{in popularity}} {{from the early}} 1920s. Some of {{this may have been}} due to the increasing availability of the motor car, since the close-fitting design helped to protect the hair and head from the elements. A 1923 fashion report in The Times described the arrival of neat leather caps and new turban designs, adding that the turban is: [...] "seen in many embroidered and swathed varieties, some of which are built on 'beret', others on Russian designs, turning right off the face, and some on close-fitting lines." [...] Its popularity survived the decade, a 1929 newspaper report on the autumn Paris fashions noted that the cloche hat had given way to the <b>Basque</b> <b>beret</b> and the turban trimmed with ribbon bows. Designs were typically made of silk, felt or velvet and could be finished with additional details such as feathers or brooches.|$|E
50|$|The monument, {{designed}} by the architect Mathieu Forest, is located in Craonnelle and {{is also known as}} the Memorial to the French 36th Infantry Division. It was erected in 1928. The 36th Infantry Division, notably the Infantry Regiment of Pau, the 34th Infantry Regiment of Mont-de-Marsan and the 14th Artillery Regiment of Tarbes, was composed mostly of recruits from the southwest region of France: Hautes-Pyrénées, Landes and Basses-Pyrénées and it fought on the Chemin des Dames during the 1914-1918 war and sustained substantial losses notably in fighting at the Hurtebise farm area and at Craonne. The monument comprises a 14 metre high obelisk made from stone from Souppes near Melun, the stone used for the Arc de Triomphe and the basilica of Sacre-Coeur at Montmartre and {{at the base of the}} obelisk is a Grange sculpture of a soldier in traditional basque costume and wearing a <b>basque</b> <b>beret.</b> He carries a makhila. The soldier has turned his back on the battle area and looks out in the direction of his homeland. The base of the memorial also records the names of the regiments which made up the 36th and, under the carving of a military helmet, the names of the battles in which the 36th fought and the names of the division's principal commanders.|$|E
