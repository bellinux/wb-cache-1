50|$|A {{jack plane}} is the {{general-purpose}} <b>bench</b> <b>plane,</b> used for general smoothing of the edges, sizing of timber but only making it smaller to correct size - wood edge jointing. Jack planes are about 12-15 inches long, and the blade can have either a slightly curved edge for smoothing stock, or {{a straight edge}} for jointing stock.|$|E
50|$|A {{smoothing}} plane or smooth plane {{is a type}} of <b>bench</b> <b>plane</b> used in woodworking. The {{smoothing plane}} is typically the last plane used on a wood surface. When used properly, it produces a finish that equals or surpasses that made by sandpaper. The smooth finish is the result of planing the wood off in strips, rather than by successive buffing and scratching.|$|E
25|$|Most {{planes are}} broadly {{categorized}} as either <b>bench</b> <b>planes,</b> block planes, or specialty planes. In modern-day carpentry, electrically powered hand planers (also called hand or handheld power planers or simply power planes) {{have joined the}} family.|$|R
5000|$|Bedrock is {{a design}} of <b>bench</b> <b>planes</b> {{developed}} by Stanley Works as {{an improvement over}} the Bailey plane design. It {{was introduced in the}} early 20th century.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bench</b> <b>planes</b> are {{characterized}} by the cutting iron bedded with the bevel facing down and attached to a chipbreaker. Most metal <b>bench</b> <b>planes,</b> and some larger wooden ones, are designed with a rear handle known as a tote. Block planes {{are characterized}} {{by the absence of}} a chipbreaker and the cutting iron bedded with the bevel up. The block plane is usually a smaller tool that can be held with one hand and is used for general purpose work such as taking down a knot in the wood, smoothing small pieces, chamfering edges, and making the end of a sawed board square and smooth.|$|R
5000|$|A scrub {{plane is}} {{generally}} used in diagonal strokes {{across the face}} of a board, rather than parallel to the length of the board (along the grain) as with most other <b>bench</b> <b>planes.</b> In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the scrub plane is usually followed by the jack plane, jointer plane, then smoothing plane.|$|R
5000|$|Different {{types of}} <b>bench</b> <b>planes</b> are {{designed}} to perform different tasks, with the name {{and size of the}} plane being defined by the use. Bailey iron <b>bench</b> <b>planes</b> were designated by number respective to the length of the plane. This has carried over through the type, regardless of manufacturer. A No. 1 plane is but little more than five inches long. A typical smoothing plane (approx. nine inches) is usually a No. 4, jack planes at about fourteen inches are No. 5, an eighteen inch foreplane will be a No. 6, and the jointer planes at twenty-two to twenty-four inches in length are No. 7 or 8 respectively. A designation, such as No. 4½ indicates a plane of No. 4 length but slightly wider. A designation, such as 5-1/2 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly wider (actually, the width of a No. 6 or a No. 7), while a designation, such as 5-1/4 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly narrower (actually, the width of a No. 3). [...] "Bedrock" [...] versions of the above are simply 600 added to the base number (although no [...] "601" [...] was ever produced, such plane is indeed available from specialist dealers; 602 through 608, including all the fractionals, were made).|$|R
25|$|J: The frog is {{a sliding}} iron wedge {{that holds the}} plane iron at the proper angle. It slides to adjust {{the gap between the}} cutting edge and the front of the mouth. The frog is screwed down {{to the inside of the}} sole through two {{parallel}} slots and on many planes is only adjustable with a screwdriver when the plane iron is removed. Some planes, such as the Stanley Bedrock line and the <b>bench</b> <b>planes</b> made by Lie-Nielsen and WoodRiver/Woodcraft have a screw mechanism that allows the frog to be adjusted without removing the blade.|$|R
2500|$|Hand {{planes are}} {{generally}} {{the combination of}} a cutting edge, such as a sharpened metal plate, attached to a firm body, that when moved over a wood surface, take up relatively uniform shavings, by nature of the body riding on the 'high spots' in the wood, and also by providing a relatively constant angle to the cutting edge, render the planed surface very smooth. A cutter which extends below the bottom surface, or sole, of the plane slices off shavings of wood. A large, flat sole on a plane guides the cutter to remove only the highest parts of an imperfect surface, until, after several passes, the surface is flat and smooth. When used for flattening, <b>bench</b> <b>planes</b> with longer soles are preferred for boards with longer longitudinal dimensions. A longer sole registers against a greater portion of the board's face or edge surface which leads to a more consistently flat surface or straighter edge. Conversely, using a smaller plane allows for more localized low or high spots to remain.|$|R
5000|$|Johnston {{was still}} {{the owner of the}} Mount Molloy sawmill when it burnt down on 31 January 1934, William J Santowski being the manager at the time. It was {{reported}} that [...] "One 350 h.p. boiler was in the destroyed building, also one Sandycroft steam engine; one twin circular log breaking down plant, four saw <b>benches,</b> one <b>planing</b> machine, saw-dust carriers, belting, shafting and pulleys and other tools of various descriptions, 29 circular saws, one log rolling winch, two saw sharpening machines, three cross-cut sawing machines". However, the employees were able to protect the boiler, main engines and pumping plant from serious damage. There were also two other planing machines in a separate building that was not destroyed. Prior to the fire Johnston had purchased machinery for a new sawmill at Shipton's Flat near Cooktown, and after the fire he placed some of the machinery at Mount Molloy. He claimed that the latter was a paying proposition and a very essential part of his organisation. It was also essential to have the mill at Mount Molloy, as most hardwood supplies came from there.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to measure the spatial resolution, {{particularly}} in z-axis, of an image obtained from an optical arrangement where a linear sensor was integrated. Comparing the experimental results and theorethical expressions for z-axis resolution [1, 2] in confocal microscopy we will expect to show that from this concept could arise a promising approach to this field. The optical setup consists in a reflection epi-illuminated configuration and different layouts were tested: 1) full and line-illumination; 2) wide-field or confocal pinholes of two different diameters; 3) Aspheric and achromatic objective lens. A 5 mW diode laser λ= 635 nm, an aspheric expander lens, an anamorphic optical lens as a single element line generator, neutral density filters and a beamsplitter were the low-cost optics mounted in an optical <b>bench.</b> A <b>plane</b> mirror was mounted in a piezoelectric driven translation stage to measure the z-axis resolution (depth discrimination) of each optical configuration. The initial work consisted {{in the development of}} a simple circuitry using a microcontroller PIC 16 F 876 from Microchip for readout of data from a linear sensor. This sensor is an array of 1024 photo-diode pixels (7. 8 µm x 125 µm) from Photon Vision Systems – LIS 1024. Th...|$|R
50|$|Gonies {{village is}} located 35 km {{southeast}} of Heraklion city and just 2 km from Avdou village, {{on the west}} side of Selenas Mountain, deep in the inland of Hersonissos Municipality and at an altitude of 260m. The position of this village, offers a magical view of Avdou village and a vast wooded area, as well as the two gorges of Panagia and Roza that spread on the left and right side of Gonies. The Agios Georgios square is located in the centre of the village, at an altitude of 262 m, it is marble paved with and <b>benches,</b> the <b>plane</b> trees and cypresses offer plenty of shade for every visitor to enjoy. Furthermore, the churches of the village, dated back to the middle 18th and early 19th century, witness the strong bond with the Christian Orthodox Church, characteristic examples being those of Agios Georgios, Agia Triada and Panagia of Maxa churches decorated with magnificent and enviable frescoes. The windmills in the area of Gonies prove the long tradition of agricultural production of the village since the 17th century, which is maintained to this day with the production of virgin olive oil, exceptional quality local wine and recherché dairy products. The gorges of the area are located a short distance away from the settlement and a characteristic example is the gorge of Roza, its entrance is just 600 m southeast of Gonies at an altitude of 330 m. During the summer time, the village is well known for its events that mostly take place in the Agios Georgios square, the Panagia celebration on the 15th of August stands out. Locals and visitors attend the religious ceremony and afterwards feast on local delights and drinks to the sounds of traditional music and dance till the early morning hours.|$|R
