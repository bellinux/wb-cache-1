40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} priority {{setting and}} decision-making {{in primary care}} organisations and to determine how resources are managed {{in order to meet}} the oral health needs of local populations. Method: This is a qualitative study. The purposive sample comprised twelve dental public health consultants and six senior finance representatives from contrasting care systems across the United Kingdom. Participants completed a written information sheet followed by a recorded semi-structured telephone interview. Conversations <b>were</b> <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed</b> verbatim and analysed independently by two investigators using the constant comparative method. Results: The emergent themes focused upon: the role of participants in decision-making; professional relationships; managing change; information needs; and identifying and managing priorities. There was wide interpretation with respect to participants' roles and perceived information needs for decision-making and commissioning. A unifying factor was the importance placed by participants upon trust and the influence of individuals on the success of relationships forged between primary care organisations and general dental practitioners. Conclusion: To facilitate decision-making in primary care organisations, commissioners and managers could engage further with practitioners and incorporate them into commissioning and resource allocation processes. Greater clarity is required regarding the role of dental public health consultants within primary care organisations and commissioning decisions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{research}} has highlighted an ambiguity in understanding cooking related terminology {{and a number}} of barriers and facilitators to home meal preparation. However, meals prepared in the home still include convenience products (typically high in sugars, fats and sodium) which can have negative effects on health. Therefore, this study aimed to qualitatively explore: (1) how individuals define cooking from 'scratch', and (2) their barriers and facilitators to cooking with basic ingredients. METHODS: 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants (aged 18 - 58 years) living on the island of Ireland, eliciting definitions of 'cooking from scratch' and exploring the reasons participants cook in a particular way. The interviews <b>were</b> <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed</b> verbatim and Nvivo 10 was used for an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Our results highlighted that although cooking from 'scratch' lacks a single definition, participants viewed it as optimal cooking. Barriers to cooking with raw ingredients included: 1) time pressures; (2) desire to save money; (3) desire for effortless meals; (4) family food preferences; and (5) effect of kitchen disasters. Facilitators included: 1) desire to eat for health and well-being; (2) creative inspiration; (3) ability to plan and prepare meals ahead of time; and (4) greater self-efficacy in one's cooking ability. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to understanding how individuals define cooking from 'scratch', and barriers and facilitators to cooking with raw ingredients. Interventions should focus on practical sessions to increase cooking self-efficacy; highlight the importance of planning ahead and teach methods such as batch cooking and freezing to facilitate cooking from scratch...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine multiple intervention adaptations made during pre-implementation, implementation, maintenance, and evolution phases of human immunodeficiency virus HIV prevention technology transfer. We examined two important categories of adaptations [...] modifications to key characteristics, such as activities or delivery methods of interventions and reinvention of the interventions including addition and deletion of core elements. Methods Study participants were thirty-four community-based organization staff who were implementing evidence-based interventions in Los Angeles, California. Participants were interviewed twice and interviews <b>were</b> <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed.</b> Transcriptions <b>were</b> coded by two coders with good inter-rater reliability (kappa coefficient = 0. 73). Sixty-two open-ended codes for adaptation activities, which were linked to 229 transcript segments, were categorized as modifications of key characteristics or reinvention. Results Participants described activities considered modifications to key characteristics and reinvention of evidence-based interventions during pre-implementation, implementation, and maintenance phases. None of the participants reported accessing technical assistance or guidance when reinventing their interventions. Staff executed many of the recommended steps for sound adaptation of these interventions for new populations and settings. Conclusion Staff reported modifying and reinventing interventions when translating HIV prevention programs into practice. Targeted technical assistance for formative evaluation should be focused on the pre-implementation phase during which frequent modifications occur. Continuous or repeated measurements of fidelity are recommended. Increased technical assistance and guidance are needed to ensure that reinventions are evaluated and consistent with the aims of the original interventions. Providing strategic technical assistance and written guidance can facilitate effective HIV prevention technology transfer of evidence-based interventions. </p...|$|R

As the majority of portion size research to date has been overwhelmingly quantitative in design, {{there is a clear}} need to qualitatively explore consumers&# 8217; views in order to fully understand how food portion size decisions are made. Using qualitative methodology this present study aimed to explore consumers&# 8217; views about factors influencing their portion size selection and consumption and to identify barriers to appropriate portion size control. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Ten focus groups with four to nine participants in each were formed with a total of 66 persons (aged 19 &# 8211; 64 years) living on the island of Ireland. The semi-structured discussions elicited participants&# 8217; perceptions of suggested serving size guidance and explored the influence of personal, social and environmental factors on their food portion size consumption. Audiotapes of the discussions <b>were</b> <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed</b> verbatim, loaded into NVivo 9, and analysed using an inductive thematic analysis procedure. 				 				 					 						Results 					The rich descriptive data derived from participants highlight that unhealthy portion size behaviors emanate from various psychological, social and behavioral factors. These bypass reflective and deliberative control, and converge to constitute significant barriers to healthy portion size control. Seven significant barriers to healthy portion size control were apparent: (1) lack of clarity and irrelevance of suggested serving size guidance; (2) guiltless eating; (3) lack of self-control over food cues; (4) distracted eating; (5) social pressures; (6) emotional eating rewards; and (7) quantification habits ingrained from childhood. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Portion size control strategies should empower consumers to overcome these effects so that the consumption of appropriate food portion sizes becomes automatic and habitual...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Wide {{variation}} in the outcomes of colorectal surgery persists, despite a well-established evidence-base to inform clinical practice. This variation {{may be attributed to}} differences in quality of care, but {{we do not know what}} this means in practical terms of care delivery. This telephone interview study aimed to identify distinguishing characteristics in the organisation of care among colorectal units with the best length of stay results in England. METHODS: Ten English National Health Service hospitals were identified with the shortest length of stay after elective colonic surgery between January 2011 and December 2012. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with a senior colorectal surgeon and ward nurse, who were not informed of their performance, at each site. Audio recordings <b>were</b> <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed</b> and thematically analysed for similarities and differences in practice between units. RESULTS: All ten short length of stay units approached agreed to participate, and 19 of 20 interviews were recorded. These units standardised clinical care based upon an Enhanced Recovery Program. Beyond this, they organised the clinical team to efficiently and reliably deliver this package of care, with the majority of day-to-day care delivered by consultants and nurses. Patients were closely monitored for postoperative deterioration, using a combination of early warning scores, nurses clinical judgement and regular senior medical review. Of note, operative volume and laparoscopy rates in these units were not statistically significantly different from the national average (p[*]=[*] 0. 509 and p[*]=[*] 0. 131, respectively). The postoperative analgesic strategy varied widely between units, from routine epidural use to local anaesthetic infiltration or patient-controlled analgesia. CONCLUSIONS: The Enhanced Recovery Program may be seen as necessary but not sufficient to achieve the best length of stay results. In the study units, consultants and nurses led and delivered the majority of patient care on the ward. High quality teamwork helped detect and resolve clinical issues promptly, with nurses empowered to contact consultants directly if needed. Other units may learn from these teams by adopting protocol-based, consultant- or nurse-delivered care, and by improving coordination and communication between consultants and ward nurses...|$|R
40|$|Title: Behavioral Inflexibility in ASD: Impact {{on family}} occupations Purpose: Four multi-site focus {{groups have been}} {{undertaken}} {{as a first step}} for developing a parent rated measure for behavioral inflexibility (BI) in children with developmental disabilities. The purpose of this research paper is to highlight the findings from these focus groups and the implications of the findings for occupational science and therapy. Methods: Four focus groups were conducted at three project sites (UNC-Chapel Hill, Ohio State University, and Vanderbilt University) with caregivers of girls and boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The participant population was diverse as the individuals with autism ranged from 3 - 18 years, had varying diagnostic histories, and varying ASD severity. Caregivers were asked to reflect on their children’s inflexible behaviors and how those behaviors impacted their family life. The focus groups <b>were</b> <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed</b> and two independent coders carried out detailed semantic coding. Data-driven themes were then abstracted from these codes by collating them into broader categories, using Braun 2 ̆ 6 Clarke’s (2006) description of thematic analysis. Results: Children with ASD display limited interests and many inflexible behaviors. These behaviors restrict the opportunities for children and families to engage in meaningful occupations. However, many caregivers identified a positive impact on family life as a by-product of these inflexible behaviors. Three basic themes and several sub-themes reflected the impact of BI on overall family functioning. These included, (1) restricted child and family occupations, such as poor social relationships, inability to participate in sports, restricted community outings, etc.; (2) negative impact on child and family, such as poor academic outcomes, parent/sibling stress, increased child anxiety, etc.; and (3) positive impact on family, such as increased acceptance and tolerance, family flexibility to adapt to child’s inflexibility, structure and predictability leading to smooth family functioning, etc. Implications: Although BI leads to many challenges for families to engage in meaningful occupations, researchers and clinicians must take into account families’ resilience and willingness to derive positive meanings from such inflexible situations. The findings suggest that families adapt to their children’s inflexible behavior to form new occupational patterns to maintain smooth family functioning. Future research should focus on these positive outcomes for families and innovative ways of using these occupational patterns for therapeutic gains. Discussion Questions: How do families navigate change in their daily lives? Does an attempt to conform children to societal norms undermine their diverse viewpoints? What are some future directions for research and practice...|$|R

40|$|Exclusive {{and safe}} formula feeding can {{eliminate}} {{the risk of}} vertical HIV transmission due to breastfeeding. Therefore many countries advise all HIV-positive women to avoid breastfeeding their infants. However, little research explores the experiences of women attempting to exclusively formula feed (EFF) in countries with free and universal access to HAART. This article examines the success of Brazil in supporting HIV-positive women as they EFF their infants. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 HIV-positive women receiving care at the primary facility for HIV/AIDS in Salvador, Brazil about their attitudes and practices related to EFF as well as challenges with adhering to EFF. All interviews <b>were</b> recorded, <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed</b> and translated, and then analyzed. Our results showed that one woman reported both breastfeeding and formula feeding her infant; all others reported EFF. Postpartum counseling regarding the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding was the primary motivation for EFF. Challenges included difficulty reconciling their perceptions that breastfeeding is an important maternal responsibility, trouble accepting that breastfeeding can cause potential to harm their infants, confronting HIV-related stigma associated with EFF, and unexpected financial burdens due to EFF. We conclude that HIV-positive women adhered to national guidelines recommending EFF; this phenomenon has likely contributed to declining rates of vertical transmission in Brazil. Despite this success, many women experienced challenges with EFF. Greater support services may enhance Brazil’s success in empowering HIV-positive women and eliminating vertical HIV transmission via breastfeeding...|$|R
40|$|Peters (1985), defines racial {{socialization}} as 2 ̆ 2 tasks Black parents {{share with}} all parents - providing for and raising children [...] . but include {{the responsibility of}} raising physically and emotionally healthy children who are Black in {{a society in which}} Black has negative connotations 2 ̆ 2 (p. 161). Racial socialization is a complex multidimensional construct and scholars have made attempts to capture the essence of its process. However, due to its complexity, no single or commonly accepted definition currently exists in the literature (Lesane-Brown, 2006). To date, most of the racial socialization literature has addressed the types of messages that African American parents transmit to their children, for example, preparation for bias and promotion/socialization of mistrust (Hughes 2 ̆ 6 Chen, 1999). However, what is specifically absent in the current racial socialization literature are the types of messages transmitted to African American women related to skin tone. Sociologists and psychologists have demonstrated that the racial socialization of skin tone impacts an African American woman 2 ̆ 7 s sense of self worth and efficacy (Boyd-Franklin, 1989; 2003; Jones 2 ̆ 6 Shorter-Gooden, 2004). 	Utilizing a qualitative methodological design, with a phenomenological orientation, {{the purpose of this study}} was to better understand the lived experiences of the racial socialization of skin tone in a cohort of older African American women. Twenty older African American women (10 light skinned and 10 dark skinned) from three mid-sized, Midwestern cities were interviewed utilizing an adapted classical phenomenology interview approach (Siedman, 2006). This researcher, two-hour semi-structured interviews, and 30 - 60 minute formal member checks were the primary research tools implemented to obtain rich data for this project. Once the interview data was collected, the interviews <b>were</b> <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed</b> verbatim to capture the full essence of the participants 2 ̆ 7 lived experiences of the phenomenon under investigation. The data were then critically and rigorously analyzed, by hand, utilizing a phenomenological data analytic method as outlined by Hycner (1985; 1999). Five salient thematic domains, along with twenty-three subthemes, emerged from the phenomenology data analysis procedure. An additional verification method (i. e., inter-rater reliability Kappa coefficient) was employed to assist in cross-validation of the study 2 ̆ 7 s findings (Landis 2 ̆ 6 Koch, 1977). Kappa coefficients demonstrated that of the twenty-three subthemes, which emerged from the analysis, 7 had slight inter-rater agreement 5 had fair inter-rater agreement, 7 had moderate inter-rater agreement, 2 had substantial inter-rater agreement, and 2 had almost perfect inter-rater agreement.

Design: Institutional ethnography. Setting: The mother/baby unit of a tertiary care hospital with 4200 births per year. Participants: Registered nurses (N = 16) who provided care on the night shift to mother/infant dyads in the immediate postpartum period. Methods: Data were collected using focus groups, individual and group interviews, and mother/baby unit observations. The focus groups were held before the night shift and had five participants. The nine individual and group interviews were conducted between 0100 and 0230 on the mother/baby unit. Three unit observations were conducted. Interviews <b>were</b> recorded, <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed,</b> and analyzed using a content analysis method. Results: Data analysis yielded three themes that described these nurses’ support of breastfeeding on the night shift: competing priorities, incongruent expectations, and influential institutional structures. The need of visitors to see their new family members competed {{with the needs of}} mothers to rest and breastfeed their newborns. Helping breastfeeding dyads who experienced difficulties competed with providing care to other patients. Parents’ expectations regarding newborn behavior were incongruent with the reality of newborn feeding and sleeping patterns.

We sought to characterize motivations for adoption of e-PCR systems, challenges associated with adoption and implementation, and emerging implementation strategies. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured in-depth interviews with EMS agency leaders. Participants were recruited through a web-based survey of National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP) members, a didactic session at the 2010 NAEMSP Annual Meeting, and snowball sampling.

Results: Twenty-three interviewees represented 20 EMS agencies from the United States and Canada; 14 EMS agencies were currently using e-PCR systems. The primary reason for adoption was the potential for e-PCR systems to support quality assurance efforts. Challenges to e-PCR system adoption included those common to any health information technology project, as well as challenges unique to the prehospital setting, including: fear of increased ambulance run times leading to decreased ambulance availability, difficulty integrating with existing hospital information systems, and unfunded mandate...|$|R
40|$|Consumers’ grocery {{purchasing}} is {{an important}} activity in determining the healthfulness of their food intake and that of their household’s. Recent till receipt studies(1) have made valuable contributions to understanding the nutritional quality of the food that consumers buy. However, these studies fail to explore the reasoning behind consumers’ product selections {{and the way in}} which health considerations drive the shopping process. The aim of this study was to obtain empirical data on this, thus identifying perceived barriers to choosing healthful foods. Fifty semi-structured face to face interviews were conducted following an accompanied shop and followed up with a telephone interview a week later. Audiotapes of all discussions <b>were</b> <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed,</b> verbatim uploaded to NVIVO (9), and analysed using an inductive, thematic analysis(2). In addition, demographic data such as age, gender, socio-economic status and household size were gathered. Participants justified the healthfulness of their grocery shop in four different ways: (1) the inclusion of healthy foods (e. g. fruit and vegetables); (2) the avoidance or exclusion of particular food groups (e. g. foods high in sugar); (3) restriction on the quantity of certain food groups (e. g. red meat); and; (4) a balance between healthy and unhealthy foods (e. g. healthy foods vs. treats). Participants also identified two separate themes as barriers to making healthy choices while shopping. The first theme addressed the lack of skills for: (a) planning a healthy shop that will translate into healthy meals, taking into account all of the family’s preferences and needs (e. g. “... I have such a wide range of people in my house to cook for and to try and cook a healthy meal everyone likes... I would find that challenging”), (b) budgeting so that healthy food can be prioritised (e. g. “lack of money and time lead to quick and easy solutions, throwing stuff into the oven or microwave from packets”), (c) cooking quick healthy meals that can be made after work (e. g. “I’ve had a long day’s work and I don’t feel like going down and making myself something... maybe something quick, I’ll probably make something quick, maybe just a kind of ready cooked meal”). The second theme addressed participants’ mood and its effect on food preferences. When stressed, tired or feeling lazy participants preferred to prioritise pleasure over health (e. g. “... if I go shopping when I am hungry it’s easier and very tempting when you see all the stuff, the bad stuff... it’s easier to pick something bad”). The results provide evidence of the different strategies consumers use to make their shopping healthy and the main barriers they perceive as preventing them from achieving this goal. This study highlights the need to develop more practical, skill-based information and tools that will assist consumers to shop for more healthful foods. This material is based upon work supported by SafeFood, the food safety promotion board, under grant no. 16 - 2010...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical Background and {{research}} questions/hypothesis: Recently, throughout Australasia, humorous appeals have become implemented increasingly in health advertising despite limited evidence regarding the persuasiveness {{of different types}} of humour. Of those studies available which have examined the persuasiveness of humorous messages, the type of humour is often not defined so it is unclear what type of humour is being examined. Speck’s (1991) typology includes five types of humour; comic wit, sentimental humour, satire, sentimental comedy, and full comedy. Each type of humour is based on one or more humour generation processes; namely, incongruity-resolution, disparagement humour, and arousal-safety. It has been acknowledged that {{more research is needed to}} determine the relative persuasiveness of these different types of humour and to identify those types which may be most effective for health advertising. The current research explored individuals’ thoughts about, and their responses to some different types of, humorous messages addressing the serious health topic of road safety. Methods: A preliminary qualitative, study was conducted involving discussions with licensed drivers (N = 18) regarding their thoughts and feelings about humorous road safety messages in general as well as in response to some (5 in total) pre-existing advertisements. Men (n = 10) and women of younger and older age groups (17 - 24 or 25 + years) participated in one of six discussions. Participants were recruited from an existing community-based database held by the authors’ Research Centre or were approached directly on the university campus. Ethical approval was gained for the study. Each participant was offered AUD 40. A semi-structured interview schedule guided the discussion (e. g., was it humorous?, would this ad influence you?). Audio-recordings of the discussions <b>were</b> <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed</b> and the transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The findings revealed that, irrespective of age and gender, humour that was clever, incorporated something unexpected and contrasting with the everyday, was a preferred and relevant approach, thus aligning with incongruity-based theories of humour generation and humour types, such as comic wit and satire. As a persuasive function, humorous messages were considered likely to be talked about (and relatively more so than traditional fear-based approaches). Participants also felt that humorous messages would need to be used cautiously as humour that was considered inappropriate and/or associated with serious occurrences, such as a crash, would be unlikely to persuade. Conclusions: The findings highlight some of the potential benefits of using humour, such as increasing the extent to which an advertisement is talked about as well as the types of humour which may be effective in this context. Implications for research and/or practice: While this research has provided important insight, future research which quantitatively assesses the persuasive effects {{of different types of}} humorous road safety messages within a larger, representative sample is needed. This current study has highlighted some humorous approaches which may hold persuasive promise in encouraging individuals to adopt safer attitudes and behaviours not only on the road, but in relation to serious health issues more broadly. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: General {{practitioners}} (GPs) have a {{key role}} in cancer detection as the usual first point of contact for patients with potential cancer symptoms. Nevertheless, there is limited work that investigates their perceptions of their role in the early detection of cancer. To address this gap, we aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of cancer diagnosis from the perspective of GPs. Methods: Individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with 55 GPs from the North and North East of England and Greater London. All interviews <b>were</b> recorded and <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed</b> verbatim. Repeated reading and co-coding engendered systematic thematic analysis across the interview material. Results: Three main themes emerged from the analysis of our data. First, we identified the burden of early cancer detection in general practice, both related to the anxiety and symptoms patients bring to GPs and the need for GPs to recognise patterns of cancer symptoms and refer appropriately; second, this burden is intensified by a perceived fragmentation of services within the National Health Service (NHS); and third, it is made more complex by the interface between general practice and public health. Conclusions: GPs occupy a challenging but pivotal role in cancer detection. It is crucial that this role be supported by policy and research. Diagnosing cancer when it is at an early stage is important, as the stage of disease at diagnosis is related to survival for many cancers. Because of this, there has been increasing interest in how patient...|$|R
40|$|To {{build on}} a growing {{interest}} in community-based obesity prevention programs, methods are needed for matching intervention strategies to local needs and assets. We used the Community Readiness Model (CRM), a structured interview guide and scoring system, to assess community readiness to act on childhood obesity prevention, furthering a replication study of a successful intervention. Using the CRM protocol, we conducted interviews with 4 stakeholders in each of 10 communities of similar size, socioeconomic status, and perceived readiness to implement a community-wide obesity prevention intervention. Communities were in California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. The 4 stakeholders were the mayor or city manager, the school superintendent, the school food service director, and a community coalition representative. Interviews <b>were</b> recorded and <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed.</b> Pairs of trained reviewers scored the transcriptions according to CRM protocol. The CRM assesses 9 stages of readiness for 6 dimensions: existing community efforts to prevent childhood obesity, community knowledge about the efforts, leadership, community climate, knowledge about the issue, and resources. We calculated an overall readiness score for each community from the dimension scores. Overall readiness scores ranged from 2. 97 to 5. 36 on the 9 -point scale. The mean readiness score, 4. 28 (SD, 0. 68), corresponds with a "preplanning" level of readiness. Of the 6 dimensions, community climate varied the least (mean score, 3. 11; SD, 0. 64); leadership varied the most (mean score, 4. 79; SD, 1. 13). The CRM quantified a subjective concept, allowing for comparison among 10 communities.

This study specifically examined the factors that these treating physicians perceived as influential within the RTW process. Semistructured, face-to-face interviews were conducted during the early part of 2009 with nine general practitioners, four specialists (orthopaedic surgeons) and one physician with expertise in the field of disability management. Interviews were conducted with each treating physician individually in their clinical office. Interviews <b>were</b> recorded and <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed.</b> A grounded theory approach was used to analyze the findings from these interviews. The treating physicians identified several factors that I categorized into micro, meso, and macro level factors. At the micro level, the role of the treating physician and the treating physician?s view of an injured worker?s motivation to return to work and the perception of safe return-to-work emerged as important themes. At the meso level, communication as an overall theme with the frequency of communication, broken telephone syndrome, and facilitated return-to-work coordination as subthemes emerged. Further, at the macro level, the treating physicians revealed that the WSIB process, the social environment of the workplace, and the availability of health care services influenced their experiences with the RTW process and the medical management of the injured workers. The treating physicians in this study described many challenges to medically managing injured workers following an occupational injury. Improvements were recommended in areas of physician remuneration, stakeholder collaboration, communication between parties, and facilitation of the RTW process. This study was {{the first of its kind}} to interview the treating physicians in a northern Ontario setting. Further research is needed to better understand the experiences of other stakeholders, including injured workers and other health care providers during the RTW process...|$|R

40|$|The health {{outcomes}} for Indigenous peoples are well publicised as being poorer {{than that of}} the rest of the Australian population. The importance of physical activity as part of a balanced approach to health and wellbeing are well documented. Physical inactivity is a significant risk factor for many preventable diseases that many non-Indigenous, but specifically more Indigenous peoples die from. A recent report on Indigenous health indicated that only 23 % of adults living in remote and very remote areas, such as Cape York, participated in regular physical activity. Physical activity initiatives in remote Indigenous communities on Cape York are commonly delivered by external agencies that ‘fly in and fly out’. While members of Indigenous communities may engage with the initiatives while they are being provided once the external agencies leave some of the benefits made may be quickly lost. There is no current published literature on the variety, prevalence and outcomes of ‘fly-in fly-out’ physical activity programs, or on the agencies that provide them. An understanding of these factors would facilitate a better understanding of the opportunities available to Indigenous communities on Cape York and provide important foregrounding to an investigation of community capacity for physical activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the range of physical activity programs being offered by external agencies to Indigenous Cape York communities. Methods : Five physical activity agencies that routinely engaged with Indigenous communities on Cape York were interviewed. The semi-structured interviews focussed on what activities were being conducted; by whom; when; and their concomitant outcomes. Interviews <b>were</b> recorded and <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed.</b> Transcriptions <b>were</b> then analysed using content analysis to identify themes. Results : Each physical activity agency had a variety of ways of engaging with community. The key initial focus point for each provider was the local school. Contacts within the school and opportunities to provide workshop opportunities for the students then facilitated wider community engagement. Discussion : There were limited opportunities for these agencies to build community capacity to maintain their physical activities due to a variety of reasons that included: resources (both human and material); transient populations and an entrenched culture of ‘having things done to’ rather than with Indigenous people. In order to improve the physical activity outcomes of Indigenous people on Cape York community’s strategies that engage and empower the local population to take control of their needs should be employed...|$|R
40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{ascertain}} the views {{and experiences of}} mental health consumers regarding the availability and quality of care and treatment received for their physical health needs. Background. People diagnosed with mental illness have higher occurrence of physical health problems. Responsive health care services are crucial for prevention and management of physical health problems, and for reducing disparities in health between people diagnosed with mental illness {{and those who are}} not. There is limited research giving voice to consumer perspectives on their experiences with health care providers. Design. Exploratory qualitative. Methods. Focus group interviews with mental health consumers accessed via a consumer network group in a region of Australia (n = 31). All interview audio recordings <b>were</b> <b>transcribed</b> <b>professionally.</b> Interviews <b>were</b> thematically analysed. Results. The main themes were: symptomising, failure to act and alertness to prejudice. The first two themes were consumer perceptions of the actions and behaviours of health professionals, and the third describes consumer responses to these behaviours and actions. Consumers described increased risks of illness and death because of undiagnosed physical illness despite their physical health advice-seeking as the reason for the health consultation. Conclusion. Health care providers’ non-recognition of physical health problems presents a clear example of a significant and potentially life threatening health inequity. The service provider responses described by participants suggest that mental health consumers’ physical health needs may not be taken seriously. Relevance to clinical practice. Clinicians need to take seriously the physical health needs and concerns of people with mental illness. Nurses can {{play a crucial role in}} the prevention of diagnostic overshadowing as part of a broader direction of balancing biomedical perspectives with other approaches to health care...|$|R

40|$|It is {{imperative}} that dyadic heart failure (HF) self-care be carefully examined so we can develop interventions which improve patient outcomes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to qualitatively examine how patient/informal caregiver dyads mutually engage in managing the patient’s HF at home. Twenty-seven dyads were interviewed using a theoretically derived interview guide. All interviews were digitally recorded and <b>professionally</b> <b>transcribed,</b> and iterative thematic analysis was conducted. Three descriptive themes emerged—Mutual engagement in self-care involves maintaining established patterns of engagement across the life course of the relationship, changing patterns according to whether it is day-to-day care or symptom management, and mobilizing the help of a third party as consultant. These themes reveal the dyadic conundrum—whether to change or remain the same in the face of a dynamic and progressive condition like HF. The themes suggest potential targets for intervention—interventions focused on the relationship or caregiver activation...|$|R
