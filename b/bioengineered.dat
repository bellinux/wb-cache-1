5|$|Blade Runner is a 1982 American neo-noir {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Ridley Scott, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, and starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos. It is a loose {{adaptation of the}} 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. Set in a dystopian Los Angeles in 2019, the film depicts {{a future in which}} synthetic humans known as replicants are <b>bioengineered</b> to work on off-world colonies. When a fugitive group of replicants led by Roy Batty (Hauer) escape back to Earth, burnt-out cop Rick Deckard (Ford) reluctantly agrees to hunt them down. During his investigations, Deckard meets Rachael (Young), an advanced replicant who causes him to question his mission.|$|E

25|$|Set in 2019 Los Angeles, {{the game}} {{tells the story}} of Ray McCoy, an elite detective charged with hunting down a group of {{dangerous}} replicants (<b>bioengineered</b> androids designed to look and act like humans). Although several of the film's characters appear in the game, with the original actors returning to voice them, the film's protagonist, Rick Deckard, does not appear in a speaking role. Instead, he is referred to on multiple occasions, is seen several times, and his activities as depicted in the film are mentioned. Other parallels with the film include the reproduction of several prominent locations, as well as scenes and dialogue closely modelled on the original. The game also features extracts from the film's soundtrack.|$|E

2500|$|A replicant is {{a fictional}} <b>bioengineered</b> or biorobotic android in the 1982 film Blade Runner, in its 2017 sequel Blade Runner 2049, {{and in the}} 1997 video game based on the film. The 'Nexus' series of replicants are {{virtually}} identical to adult humans, but have superior strength, speed, agility, resilience, and intelligence to varying degrees depending on the model. [...] Thus a replicant can only be detected {{by means of the}} fictional Voight-Kampff test, in which emotional responses are provoked; replicants’ nonverbal responses differ from humans'. Nexus 6 replicants also have a safety mechanism, namely a four-year lifespan, to prevent them from developing empathic abilities (and, therefore, immunity to the test). Replicants are sometimes referred to by the slur [...] "skin-job".|$|E
2500|$|In {{his essay}} on the sociobiological {{backgrounds}} of Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy, J. Adam Johns describes how Butler's narratives counteract the death drive behind the hierarchical impulse with an innate love of life (biophilia), particularly different, strange life. Specifically, Butler's stories feature gene manipulation, interbreeding, miscegenation, symbiosis, mutation, alien contact, non-consensual sex, contamination, {{and other forms of}} hybridity as the means to correct the sociobiological causes of hierarchical violence. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, [...] "n [...] narratives the undoing of the human body is both literal and metaphorical, for it signifies the profound changes necessary to shape a world not organized by hierarchical violence." [...] The evolutionary maturity achieved by the <b>bioengineered</b> hybrid protagonist {{at the end of the}} story, then, signals the possible evolution of the dominant community in terms of tolerance, acceptance of diversity, and a desire to wield power responsibly.|$|E

The Torumekians have a strong military, but the Doroks, whose ancestors <b>bioengineered</b> the progenitors of the Sea of Corruption, have developed a genetically modified version of a mold from the Sea of Corruption. When the Doroks introduce this mold into battle, its rapid growth and mutation result in a daikaisho (roughly translated from Japanese as [...] "great tidal wave"), which floods across the land and draws the insects into the battle, killing as many Doroks as Torumekians. In doing so, the Sea of Corruption spreads across most of the Dorok nation, uprooting or killing vast numbers of civilians and rendering {{most of the land}} uninhabitable.|$|E

40|$|Does {{the future}} of {{bioengineering}} lie in models or experiments? The long-standing debate on how and how much experimental and theoretical research in our field should cooperate can shape the future. This debate means often a choice, early in the <b>bioengineer’s</b> career. A <b>bioengineer</b> may prefer to address scientific questions based on experimental tests, or on computational and theoretical analyses. This fundamental choice can drive the future <b>bioengineer’s</b> mindset. Unsurprisingly, laboratories and researchers often assemble in separate, competitive teams. Indeed, the way <b>bioengineers</b> tackle a question is shaped by the characteristic techniques – experimental, theoretical, and computational – they are trained for. Here, without neglecting the obvious advantages of specializing exclusively in experimental, or theoretical and computational studies, I advocate {{a way of doing}} synergistic research that combine different approaches. Moreover, I believe that bioengineering desperately needs synergy and cooperation {{to pave the way for}} significant discoveries. We need efforts to train a new generation of biomedical engineers: individuals who take advantage of these synergies, who design projects accordingly, and who make these approaches work cooperatively.
