40|$|In this study, a {{new method}} for {{designing}} a particular <b>braced</b> <b>system</b> by using multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed. This type of <b>braced</b> <b>system,</b> {{which is called}} non-geometric <b>braced</b> <b>system</b> are mostly used in seismic areas and it allows architects to have more openings in the panels. Non-straight diagonal member of this system introduces eccentricity and it {{is connected to the}} corner of the frame by a third member. In designing this system, designers often use trial and error method to locate the connection point of the brace elements by considering various parameters which affect the design such as opening and frame dimensions, cross section areas of brace elements and the location of brace element connection. Hence, finding the best connection point with maximum stiffness and minimum weight of brace elements with conventional methods is not trivial. In this study, a multi-object genetic algorithm is proposed in determining the best selection for connection point and also the brace elements' cross section area proportions which is the key rule in determining the stiffness of the system. Boundary equations are set by introducing feasible area to avoid improper individuals followed by utilization of some operators such as selection, mutation, crossover and elite genetic algorithm. Based on the plain aggregate approaches for transforming the objective vector in scalar, some modifications are proposed to assist designers in making decision on prioritizing between the frame stiffness and brace frame weight in their design...|$|E

Reliability assessment of the limit state performance of a braced excavation systems may offer a more rational way to prevent or reduce the chance of failure, including damage to the adjacent buildings. However, no procedures are currently available for assessing ultimate or serviceability reliability of braced excavation system. In the proposed research, the reliability analysis methods, are used along with stability analysis methods and deformation analysis methods to establish a framework for a rigorous fully-probabilistic assessment of excavation. The project, if successfully that will significantly improve the engineer’s ability to assess the reliability of deep excavation and its impact on adjacent buildings.

In steel plants, steel silos are used for the storage of bulk materials. However, steel silos differ principally from their concrete counterparts in physical properties like the high strength per unit weight and ductility. The high yield and ultimate strength result in slender sections. Being ductile the steel structures give sufficient advance warning before failure by way of excessive deformations. Steel silo is elevated and supported by frames. This paper describes the analysis and design of high-rise steel building frame with braced and without braced under effect of wind and earthquake using SAP 2000 and also to compare the response of braced and unbraced building which subjected to horizontal or lateral loading system.

40|$|The method {{selected}} {{for the design of}} structures not only can affect their seismic vulnerability but also can affect their construction cost. For the design of steel structures, two distinct methods have been introduced by existing codes, namely allowable stress design (ASD) and load resistant factor design (LRFD). This study investigates the effect of using the aforementioned design methods on the seismic vulnerability and construction cost of steel structures. Specifically, a 20 -story building equipped with special moment resisting frame and an eccentrically <b>braced</b> <b>system</b> was {{selected for}} this study. The building was designed for three different intensities of peak ground acceleration including 0. 2 g, 0. 25 g, and 0. 3 g using the ASD and LRFD methods.

Then, the designed frames were subjected to nine natural earthquake records which were scaled to the designed response spectrum. For each frame, the base shear, story shears, and inter-story drifts were calculated and then were compared. Results indicated that the LRFD method led to a more economical design for the frames. In addition, the LRFD method resulted in lower base shears and larger inter-story drifts when compared with the ASD method. It was concluded that the application of the LRFD method not only reduced the weights of structural elements but also provided a higher safety margin against seismic actions when compared with the ASD method...|$|E

Moreover, steel <b>bracing</b> <b>systems</b> have relatively low cost and easy construction phases. For this purpose, several configurations of steel <b>bracing</b> <b>systems</b> can be applied for upgrading the seismic behavior of the structures. The most frequently utilized systems comprise concentrically-braced frames, eccentrically-braced frames, and knee-brace frames [1].
