50|$|ZX Spectrum is factory {{equipped}} with a Sinclair <b>BASIC</b> <b>editor</b> and interpreter that enables immediate program execution without a compilation pass and not consuming memory for the compiled code. This comes, however, {{at the price of}} execution speed. A number of integer and floating point compilers have been released since (e.g.: HiSoft Basic http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0008249, HiSoft Colt http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0008254, Softek IS/FP http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0008693, MCoder http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0013864, ZIP Compiler http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0009452, Boriel ZX Basic http://www.boriel.com/software/the-zx-basic-compiler/, Blast http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0007980). Unfortunately, the Sinclair BASIC enables programming constructs that are hard or even impossible to be compiled (e.g.: GO TO line number which is an expression calculated at runtime). Thus compatibility between the interpreter and a compiler is an issue.|$|E

5000|$|The {{growth of}} the {{hobbyist}} graphing calculator community in the 1990s brought with it sharing and collaboration, including the need to share TI-BASIC code on mailing lists and discussion forums. At first, this was done by typing out the TI-BASIC code from a calculator screen into a computer by hand, or conversely, entering programs manually into calculators. TI-BASIC programs are stored in a tokenized format, they cannot be edited using standard computer text editors, so as the calculator programming community matured, a need for an automated converter arose. The format for computer-stored TI-BASIC programs generated by Texas Instruments' TI-GraphLink application was eventually decoded, and third-party tools were created to manipulate these files. TI created a <b>BASIC</b> <b>editor</b> that they included in certain releases of the TI-GraphLink linking program, {{but it has not}} gained widespread usage. In particular, it used a custom character set that did not display properly when copied and pasted to fora. In 2005, United-TI member Joe [...] "Brazucs" [...] Penna (now known as MysteryGuitarMan) created a translator in PHP that would convert text from the TI-GraphLink editor into standard Unicode, a project that soon expanded to include a regex-based TI-BASIC optimizer. Independently, Christopher [...] "Kerm Martian" [...] Mitchell of Cemetech began creating an online converter to extract plain-text (and later HTML and BBCode-formatted) contents from tokenized TI-BASIC programs, which expanded to include an online program editor, exporter, and TI-83 Plus emulator. The SourceCoder project absorbed OptiBASIC at the end of 2005. The only other major TI-BASIC editor currently in use is TokenIDE (or [...] "Tokens"), created by Shaun [...] "Merthsoft" [...] McFall. An offline editor, Tokens can import, edit, and export TI-BASIC programs, includes tools to track program size and correctness, and offers ancillary features such as a sprite/image editor. Built around token definitions stored in XML files, it is intended to be extensible to work with any user-specified token mapping.|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} design standards Eurocodes will become obligatory in Slovenia {{from the beginning}} of 2008. The main focus of the diploma thesis is the Eurocode 8 standard for earthquake resistant design of structures. More specifically, the computer program is developed for determination of the behaviour factor, the design response spectrum, the fundamental period of the structure according to simplified procedure and for determination of the seismic design forces according to lateral force method of analysis. The program is made in Excel by emplying Visual <b>Basic</b> <b>Editor.</b> Firstly, the procedure for determination of behaviour factor and design response spectrum is explained for different types of structures, then, the algorithms for program are developed and implemented and at the end for examples are presented. In the first example we have tested the program by an example of multi-storey building. The second example was a comparison between different structural types. We have seen that the lowest seismic loading is foreseen for frame structural types. Third example was a comparison between low (DCL), medium (DCM) and high (DCH) ductility class. It is shown that for selected case the design seismic forces for DCH ductility class are for 50 % lower in comparison with the design forces for DCM ductility class and 300 % lower than DCL ductility class. DCM ductility class is for 167 % lower than DCL ductility class. Based on our fourth example we found out that the most appropriate ground for earthquake resistant buildings are grounds type A...|$|E
