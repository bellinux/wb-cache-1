5|$|Altgens {{shared a}} story about Billy Lovelady for No More Silence: An Oral History of the Assassination of President Kennedy (1998). Lovelady had {{contacted}} Altgens {{and asked him to}} deliver a copy of the first photograph along Elm Street. Altgens was met instead by Lovelady's wife, who said her husband would never agree to be interviewed. The couple had moved several times, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> being harassed by people who wanted the shirt Lovelady was wearing when Kennedy was shot.|$|E
5|$|Walter's granddaughters Maud and Margaret {{were due}} to inherit Walter's {{remaining}} estates on his death, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> unmarried, making it {{hard for them to}} hold property in their own right. Henry informally divided the lands up between them, giving Ludlow to Maud and marrying her to one of his royal favourites, Peter de Geneva, cancelling many of the debts they had inherited from Walter at the same time. Peter died in 1249 and Maud married a second time, this time to Geoffrey de Geneville, a friend of the Prince Edward, the future king. In 1260, Henry officially split up Walter's estate, allowing Geoffrey to retain the castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, the United States Government {{intended}} {{to present a}} set of then-current US coins to four Asian rulers the US had either made agreements with or else hoped to treat with. Neither the silver dollar nor the eagle had been struck since 1804, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> considered current coins. Putting the date of striking on the pieces would make them {{appear to be in}} violation of Jefferson's prohibition which remained in force. Mint Director Moore decided to strike 1804-dated dollars and eagles for the sets, and four 1804 eagles were struck. They differ from the pieces struck thirty years earlier, lacking a crosslet {{on the right side of}} the crossbar of the 4. Two were presented, to the Sultan of Muscat and the King of Siam, before the diplomat in charge of the expedition, Edmund Roberts, died of disease in Macao, and his mission was abandoned. The remaining two sets were returned to the United States.|$|E

5|$|Bushnell and Dabney {{began to}} design custom {{hardware}} {{to run the}} game's functions, and they soon discovered that the cost to build the whole game's computing systems would be much lower. As a result, they would not need to have multiple instances of the game running on the same machine {{in order to be}} profitable. On the other hand, however, the custom hardware was not as powerful as the more expensive Nova computer, which meant that the pair needed to make gameplay modifications. Spacewar was a two-player game featuring dogfights around the gravitational field of a central star; neither of these features could be run on the dedicated circuits the pair were making, so the game was cut down to a single-player game wherein the player would fight against two computer-controlled spaceships in open space. By January 1971, the pair had built some basic hardware which could connect to a monitor, with plans to continue expanding it to make a game now named Cosmic Combat, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> far away from turning what was then a dot moving on a screen into a full Spacewar-like game cabinet.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 {{and participated in}} fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909, the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909, and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July. She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 {{in an attempt to}} cure the electrical problems with her turrets, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> unsatisfactory. Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911, but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her turrets to hydraulic power. This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1912. On 17 March 1913, she collided with the submarine , but the collision was ruled the fault of the submarine. She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her turrets hydraulic power and make her battle-worthy.|$|E

Around this time, MTV also introduced a fashion news show, House of Style; a dance show, Club MTV; and a game show, Remote Control. Programs like these did not feature music videos, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> largely based around the world of music.|$|E

25|$|Only two of {{the wooden}} streetcars in use in the 1950s had been given away to railfan groups {{before the rest of}} the fleet was burned. They are owned by the Minnesota Streetcar Museum (TCRT No. 1300) and the Seashore Trolley Museum (TCRT No. 1267) in Maine. One other steel-sheathed car (TCRT No. 1583) had been sent to a railway to the north in Duluth-Superior, but it was never used. It now resides at the East Troy Electric Railroad Museum in Wisconsin.

25|$|Gloucestershire Gladiators made it past Glamorgan Dragons to take {{a victory}} in their {{final game of the}} season, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> relegated into Division Two, thus {{suffering}} relegation in both forms of cricket. Winning the toss and bowling first, Gloucestershire's spinners Malinga Bandara and Mark Hardinges shared four for 87 in their 18 overs after the opening bowlers Jon Lewis and James Averis went wicketless. Gloucestershire did concede 32 extras, however, as Glamorgan assembled 262 for 8. Steve Adshead and Kadeer Ali added 86 for Gloucestershire's first wicket, before Craig Spearman took on the Gloucestershire bowlers to hit 80 off 71 balls. Despite his dismissal to send the score to 228 for 6, Bandara, Lewis and Mark Alleyne added the required runs, as Gloucestershire won with 14 balls to spare.|$|E

25|$|The {{battles over}} the Arakan in 1943 {{represented}} the last large-scale {{use of the}} Hurricane as a pure day fighter. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> used in the fighter-bomber role in Burma {{until the end of}} the war and they were occasionally caught up in air combat as well. For example, on 15 February 1944, Flg Off Jagadish Chandra Verma of No 6 Sqdn of the Royal Indian Air Force shot down a Japanese Ki-43 Oscar: it was the only RIAF victory of the war. The Hurricane remained in service as a fighter-bomber over the Balkans and at home as well where it was used mainly for second-line tasks and occasionally flown by ace pilots. For example, in mid-1944, ace Sqdn Leader 'Jas' Storrar flew No 1687 Hurricane to deliver priority mail to Allied armies in France during the Normandy invasion.|$|E
25|$|Dutch–South African Ryan ten Doeschate made a career-best 89 not {{out with}} five sixes as Essex Eagles {{made their way}} to 273 for 6 at Chelmsford. Sajid Mahmood was the main {{recipient}} of ten Doeschate's boundary-hitting – ending with figures of two for 67 in nine overs. England Under-19 player Tom Smith, who had taken 15 Test wickets in three U-19 matches with Sri Lanka, finished with 42 conceded runs off his five overs. When Lancashire Lightning batted, Darren Gough got the early wicket of Iain Sutcliffe, and despite scores in the 30s from Andrew Crook and Mal Loye, Lancashire lost their first four wickets for 91 runs. Andrew Symonds rebuilt with Mark Chilton, but once Symonds was bowled by Gough – who ended with four for 31 – Lancashire began to lose wickets, as the last six fell for 65. Kyle Hogg took 25 balls for his 36, lifting Lancashire to a total of 218, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> defeated.|$|E
25|$|Ronnie Irani and Alastair Cook, {{who both}} made fifties, lifted Essex to 297 after {{being put in}} to bat at Grace Road. David Masters was Leicestershire's best bowler, with four for 65, and he bowled eleven maidens in 25 overs. However, Masters {{and the rest of}} the Leicestershire middle order showed precariously little {{resistance}} with the bat, as Darren Gough took two quick wickets before stumps on day 1 and Tony Palladino joined in with two more as Leicestershire imploded to 20 for 4. John Maunders and Aftab Habib lifted Leicestershire to a more respectable score, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> 132 for 6 at close on day 2, with half the second day's play lost due to rain. The third day was rained off, and on the fourth day Habib went on to make an unbeaten 153, Leicestershire declared on 382 for 8, and the match ended in a draw as Essex easily survived 29 overs to make 80 for 2.|$|E

25|$|Football League runners-up {{and twice}} champions Preston North End sent an under-strength eleven for a {{friendly}} meeting with Small Heath. The team was further weakened when their trainer {{had to play}} in place of Bob Roberts, who failed to turn up, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> too good for their hosts. Aston Villa did much of the attacking in the semi-final of the Birmingham Charity Cup but Charsley and his defenders were up to their task, and Small Heath progressed to the final by two goals to nil. In the final, at Aston Lower Grounds, Hallam scored with a header after only five minutes, and failed {{to take a good}} chance when Wolverhampton Wanderers' goalkeeper lost his grip on the ball, but at the interval the score was 1–1. In the second half, with both sun and wind in their favour, Heath struck the woodwork several times, but the only goal came when an error from their backs allowed Harry Wood a free run.|$|E

Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E
25|$|Gordeeva and Grinkov won the 1985 World Junior Championships in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The {{following}} year {{they won the}} first of their four World Championships. They {{are one of the}} few pair teams to win back-to-back junior and senior World Championship titles. They successfully defended their World title in 1987 and then won gold at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, despite a nasty accident. In November 1987, Grinkov caught a blade on the ice during a practice session and dropped Gordeeva on her forehead. She was hospitalized for a time, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> able to compete in, and win, the 1988 Winter Olympics which began the following February. They remain the youngest pairs team ever to win Olympic gold. After a fall in their long program, they took silver at the World Championships in 1988, but reclaimed the title in 1989 and 1990. They turned professional in the fall 1990, winning their first World Professional Championship in 1991. They also won that title in 1992 and 1994.|$|E

25|$|This series {{marked the}} return of Billy Murdoch as Australia’s leader, and pitched him against The Champion, WG Grace. The Australian side was good, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> without some of their best players. 1890 was a wet summer, and the rain {{affected}} all of the three planned Tests. The first Test was the most eagerly anticipated match of the English summer, with 30,279 spectators watching it over the 3 days, though Stoddart and Briggs did not play. Rain on the 2 days before the match left the pitch slow, but it got steadily better and better, and was at its best on the last day, when England scored 137 to win by 7 wickets, with Grace, who was out for a duck in the first innings, scoring 75 not out. The second Test at the Oval was particularly tense, partly, no doubt, because Andrew Stoddart (an amateur) chose to play for Middlesex, whilst Peel and Ulyett (professionals) were claimed by Yorkshire. Rain before the first day’s play contributed to 22 wickets falling for 197 runs on day 1. On day 2, England only needed 95 to win, they lost eight wickets to Charles Turner and Ferris before getting them, with the winning run being scampered as Australia missed a clear run out chance. A planned third Test match at Old Trafford, Manchester was washed out, thereby becoming the first Test to be abandoned entirely because of the weather.|$|E
