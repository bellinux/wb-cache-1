Green created a specific viewing arrangement {{to investigate the}} European perception of the black female body as [...] "exotic", [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "monstrous". Viewers were prompted to step onto the installed platform which was meant to evoke a stage, where Baartman may have been exhibited. Green recreates the <b>basic</b> <b>setting</b> of Baartman's exhibition. At {{the centre of the}} platform, which there is a large image of Baartman, and wooden rulers or slats with an engraved caption by Francis Galton encouraging viewers to measure Baartman's buttocks. In the installation there is also a peephole that allows viewers to see an image of Baartman standing on a crate. According to Willis, the implication of the peephole, [...] demonstrates how ethnographic imagery of the black female form in the nineteenth century functioned as a form of pornography for Europeans present at Baartmans exhibit.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that topological {{classification}} of dynamical systems with hyperbolic dynamics is significantly defined by dynamics on nonwandering set. F. Przytycki generalized axiom $A$ for smooth endomorphisms that was previously introduced by S. Smale for diffeomorphisms and proved spectral decomposition theorem which claims that nonwandering set of an $A$-endomorphism is a union of a finite number <b>basic</b> <b>sets.</b> In present paper the criterion for a <b>basic</b> <b>sets</b> of an $A$-endomorphism to be an attractor is given. Moreover, dynamics on <b>basic</b> <b>sets</b> of codimension one is studied. It is shown, that if an attractor is a topological submanifold of codimension one of type $(n- 1, 1) $, then it is smoothly embedded in ambient manifold and restriction of the endomorphism to this <b>basic</b> <b>set</b> is an expanding endomorphism. If a <b>basic</b> <b>set</b> of type $(n, 0) $ is a topological submanifold of codimension one, then it is a repeller and restriction of the endomorphism to this <b>basic</b> <b>set</b> is also an expanding endomorphism...|$|R

50|$|As well as {{the three}} {{versions}} of the main game, adventures and expansions have been published for Monsters. Creator Baugh wrote The Dreadful Secrets of Candlewick Manor, a campaign sourcebook which presents an alternate take on the <b>basic</b> <b>setting,</b> and Bigger Bads, an expansion which adds additional options for monsters. Bigger Bads was funded through Kickstarter. Road Trip and Curriculum of Conspiracy were written by Ross Payton.|$|E
50|$|As a {{customizable}} game, {{it allows}} players and developers to script their own mods. Different mods have {{different sets of}} unique weapons, and may also differ in player gravity and movement. The default mod is Liero 1.0, also called Classic, which is roughly equal to the <b>basic</b> <b>setting</b> in original Liero. On top of this, several player-created mods {{are included in the}} standard game packs, some of which are more popular than the default setting. Similarly to Liero, the default level is Dirt Level, consisting of diggable terrain with some indestructible rock. The default level is comparatively rarely played compared to more complex player-created levels.|$|E

50|$|Realistic fiction {{typically}} {{involves a}} story whose <b>basic</b> <b>setting</b> (time and {{location in the}} world) is real and whose events could feasibly happen in a real-world setting; non-realistic fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case, often being set in an entirely , an alternative {{history of the world}} other than that currently understood as true, or some other non-existent location or time-period, sometimes even presenting impossible technology or a defiance of the currently understood laws of nature. However, all types of fiction arguably invite their audience to explore real ideas, issues, or possibilities in an otherwise imaginary setting, or using what is understood about reality to mentally construct something similar to reality, though still distinct from it.|$|E
5000|$|The canonical, <b>basic</b> <b>setting</b> is {{referred}} to as the [...] "Weird West" [...] due to the juxtaposition of the Western setting with the horrific and fantastical elements of the game. The history of the Weird West is identical to real-world history, up until July 3, 1863. On this date in the fictional universe, a group of American Indians from various tribes, led by a Sioux shaman known as [...] "Raven," [...] performed a ritual in an effort to drive out the European settlers. This ritual created a conduit to a spiritual realm populated by powerful malicious entities known as the [...] "Reckoners." [...] The events surrounding and immediately subsequent to Raven's ritual is known as [...] "The Reckoning." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tuvok [...] is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the Star Trek media franchise. One of the main characters on the television series Star Trek: Voyager, Tuvok {{is a member of}} the fictional Vulcan species who serves as the ship's second officer, Chief of Security, and Chief Tactical Officer. Tim Russ portrayed Tuvok throughout the show's run, from 1995 to 2001 and has also been involved in subsequent portrayals. Tuvok's backstory is that, up to the time of the first episode, Caretaker, he was working as an undercover Federation agent in a Maquis group led by Chakotay aboard the Maquis ship the Val Jean. His recovery is the actual mission Voyager is sent on, a mission that is completed by Janeway at the cost of about one third of her crew and seven years in space, creating the <b>basic</b> <b>setting</b> of the series.|$|E
50|$|The Fischer {{groups are}} named by analogy {{with the large}} Mathieu groups. In Fi22 a maximal set of 3-transpositions all {{commuting}} with one another has size 22 and is called a <b>basic</b> <b>set.</b> There are 1024 3-transpositions, called anabasic that do not commute with any in the particular <b>basic</b> <b>set.</b> Any one of other 2364, called hexadic, commutes with 6 <b>basic</b> ones. The <b>sets</b> of 6 form an S(3,6,22) Steiner system, whose symmetry group is M22. A <b>basic</b> <b>set</b> generates an abelian group of order 210, which extends in Fi22 to a subgroup 210:M22.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Basic</b> <b>Set</b> saw a major {{revision}} in 1981 by Tom Moldvay. The overarching goal of {{the revision}} was to provide subsequent expansions to the game, each describing {{a specific set of}} levels of character development. The <b>Basic</b> <b>Set</b> described character levels 1 through 3, as had its immediate predecessor, the <b>Basic</b> <b>Set</b> edited by J. Eric Holmes in 1977. The Moldvay <b>Basic</b> <b>Set</b> was immediately followed by the release of the Expert Set edited by Dave Cook, supporting character levels 4 through 14. The Isle of Dread was included in the set as an example of an outdoor adventure and setting. The set included dice, and featured cover art by Erol Otus.|$|R

50|$|While {{continuing}} more or {{less with}} the <b>basic</b> <b>setting</b> of its predecessor, Manga Kenkanryu 2 also deals with such topics as Zainichi issues, the Sea of Japan naming dispute, and Japan's Protection of Human Rights Bill. It is also not merely a criticism of South Korea {{but also of the}} position of the Japanese media, House of Councillors member Tomiko Okazaki's participation in anti-Japanese demonstrations, and the educational position of the Japan Teachers Union. On the article regarding Zainichi issues, the book by name focuses upon South Korea but is centered upon the North Korean-linked Chogin Credit Cooperatives, Zainichi North Korean schools, and the North Korean abduction issue with focus upon Zainichi North Koreans and the North Korean-linked General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, and this aspect of the book's organization has undergone criticism from Japanese netizens for failing to touch upon the subject of Zainichi South Koreans and the South Korean-linked Korean Residents Union in Japan. Another issue the sequel deals with is the media's response (including that of The New York Times) to the original book.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku {{gives the}} preview episode a mixed review. He praised the episode's {{beginning}} for introducing the <b>basic</b> <b>setting</b> and shows {{the first meeting}} of Freyja, Hayate, and Mirage along with some short character building scenes for each, but criticised halfway point of the episode. Despite praising the aerial dogfight, he thinks the sudden conflict and the introduction of 15 different characters was [...] "far too much too fast". For the music, while the first two Walkure songs are deemed forgettable, he thinks the final song used for the ending and credits, [...] "Ikenai Borderline", is great. Richard's main problem is Walkure themselves, referring them as the elephant in the room. He commented [...] "While their [...] "magic" [...] is clearly technology-based, it is something so unexpected in a Macross anime, it's likely to throw even longtime fans for a loop—I know it did me". Nevertheless, he genuinely interested to see more and hopes much of the information will be sorted out by the time the series makes its true premiere this spring.|$|E

50|$|I {{start out}} feeding my brain with newspapers, books, TV news, Internet news, {{listening}} to conversations. Then I write, {{usually in the}} morning. Gags comes out of nowhere. Even if it's silly or stupid or unusable, I write it down. I can edit it later. I let the writing simmer. After a day, a week, sometimes years, I go back, fix the writing and pick out some gags to draw. Occasionally I have brainstormed via email with other cartoonists. It works great, and I can't ever remember when either of us wanted the other one's ideas; so we never really stepped on each other's toes... I make a primitive, rough outline of the people, main characters, in a <b>basic</b> <b>setting</b> on crummy copy paper with a regular pencil. Then I put a nice piece of smooth HP laser paper over the sketch and ink over it on a light table. For crowd, bar, vegetation, beach and laboratory scenes, I draw directly on the finished paper with no sketches because I draw fast, and background scenes are loosely lined. I use Pigma pens and a brush, sometimes a Sharpie or a black calligraphy pen. Then I scan the drawings into Photoshop. If a company wants an original, I ink on good watercolor paper and add a gray wash or watercolor. But in Photoshop I shade/color the drawing using a Wacom tablet. If I'm on vacation, I can draw on tracing paper and save that to scan later, or photocopy the cartoons, send by mail to various companies, then scan them when I get home. I like to have every single cartoon scanned, so I can pull them up at a moment's notice and either print hard copies or send PDFs. I've been sending stuff via PDF for years worldwide, and I think it's given me an edge over a lot of cartoonists who concentrate on the regular major markets here in the U.S.|$|E
