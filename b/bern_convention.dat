5|$|In Europe, {{it is one}} of 32 {{threatened}} species proposed for protection under the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention.</b> It has been recorded from Czechoslovakia, and Poland, where it is mostly found in old-growth forests. It is rare in northern Europe, where it has been found in Finland growing on Picea abies and Alnus incana, and in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{is rare in}} Europe and its {{distribution}} typically {{corresponds with}} high elevations {{at or near the}} alpine tree line. It is found in at least 11 countries, and has been included in the Red List of 8 countries. It is considered critically endangered in the Czech Republic. The European Council for Conservation of Fungi (ECCF) has suggested Suillus sibiricus be listed in Appendix II of the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention.</b> Factors that threaten the habitat of S.sibiricus include deforestation and construction of skiing pistes and other infrastructure for winter sports.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{found in}} {{coniferous}} forests, G.clavatus is mycorrhizal, and {{is associated with}} tree species {{in a variety of}} coniferous genera, particularly spruces and firs. It is more common at elevations of greater than , in moist, shady areas with plenty of leaf litter. Although widespread, G.clavatus has become rare in many parts of Europe and extinct in the British Isles. It has been placed on the national Red Lists of threatened fungi in 17 European countries and is one of 33 species proposed for international conservation under the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention.</b>|$|E
40|$|Avifauna of {{landscape}} park «Alexandria», Bila Tserkva (central Ukraine, natural forest-steppe zone) was studied, and 81 {{species of birds}} were found. 70 of them are protected by the Bonn and the <b>Bern</b> <b>conventions.</b> In the park is dominated by forest habitats, so most birds {{are members of the}} Passeriformes. Dominant species are the chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), song thrush (Turdus philomelos) and collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). In general, in the park's avifauna presented the usual species of the forest-steppe zone of Ukraine...|$|R
50|$|Latvia {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of conservation. The first laws and regulations were promulgated in the 16th and 17th centuries. There are 706 specially state-level protected natural areas in Latvia: four national parks, one biosphere reserve, 42 nature parks, nine areas of protected landscapes, 260 nature reserves, four strict nature reserves, 355 nature monuments, seven protected marine areas and 24 microreserves. Nationally protected areas account for 12790 km2 or around 20% of Latvia's total land area. Latvia's Red Book (Endangered Species List of Latvia), which was established in 1977, contains 112 plant species and 119 animal species. Latvia has ratified the international Washington, <b>Bern,</b> and Ramsare <b>conventions.</b>|$|R
5|$|Myriostoma is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Geastraceae. The genus is monotypic, {{containing}} the single species Myriostoma coliforme. It is an earthstar, so named because the spore-bearing sack's outer wall splits open {{into the shape of}} a star. The inedible fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been found in Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Europe, where it grows in humus-rich forests or in woodlands, especially on well-drained and sandy soils. A somewhat rare fungus, it appears on the Red Lists of 12 European countries, and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for protection under the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention</b> by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi.|$|E
5|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, the {{porbeagle}} is on {{the verge}} of extinction, with a population decline of over 99.99% since the mid-20th century. Its range has contracted to the waters around the Italian Peninsula, where there may be a nursery area. Only a few dozen specimens have been recorded in the past few decades, from scientific surveys, swordfish fishery bycatch, and sport fishers. In 1995, it was included in Annex III ("species whose exploitation is regulated") of the Barcelona Convention Protocol on protected areas and biodiversity in the Mediterranean, which has not been ratified. In 1997, it was listed on Appendix III of the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention</b> (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). However, these listings have yet to result in the implementation of new management plans, despite the recognized need for urgent action.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} found singly, scattered, or {{clustered}} together in broad-leaf woods favoring beech, less frequently with conifers. A preference for calcareous soils has been noted, {{but they will}} also grow on acidic bedrock. Because their initial development is subterranean, young fruit bodies are easy to overlook, as they as usually covered with dirt or forest duff. They are more common in mountainous locations, and occur most frequently in the spring, often near melting snow. The fungus is distributed in 23 European countries, North Africa, and North America, from British Columbia eastward to Michigan and New York, south to Veracruz, Mexico. It has also been collected from Israel and the Asian part of Turkey. In Europe, the fungus is red-listed in 14 countries, and is considered a threatened species by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi. It is short-listed {{for inclusion in the}} <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention</b> by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi. Threats to the species include loss and degradation of habitats due to clearcutting and soil disturbance.|$|E

25|$|Umbra krameri or in Serbian mrguda ("frown fish") in Serbia lives only in Zasavica. It {{has been}} {{classified}} as {{an endangered species}} in the entire of Europe and placed under the strict protection by the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention.</b> In Serbia it has been protected in 1993. In March 2008 the fish has been discovered {{in the village of}} Bački Monoštor, near town of Sombor, almost 150 kilometers north of Zasavica.|$|E
25|$|Zasavica hosts 27 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} and amphibians, of which all 12 amphibian and 4 reptilian species are protected {{and some of}} them are on the preliminary list to be included into the Red Book. Six amphibian and seven reptilian species are also classified as the endangered species by the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention.</b> Two endemic Balkan species live in Zasavica: Danube crested newt and eastern sub-species of the sand lizard, Lacerta agilis bosnica, which is European Protected Species.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, Porpolomopsis calyptriformis {{is typical}} of waxcap grasslands, a declining habitat due to {{changing}} agricultural practices. As a result, the species is of regional conservation concern {{and is one of}} 33 larger fungi proposed for international protection under the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention.</b> Porpolomopsis calyptriformis also appears on the official or provisional national red lists of threatened fungi in several European countries, including Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany (Bavaria), Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and Switzerland. In 2008, the Pink Waxcap was featured on a postage stamp issued by the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Some of the animals, which live in Rila, are {{in danger}} as well. 24 of the species that inhabit Rila {{are listed in the}} IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. There are 172 types of {{vertebrates}} living in Rila and 121 of them are registered in the Bulgarian Red List of Threatened Species, 15 are recorded in the European Red List of Threatened Species, 24 are listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature and 158 of 172 are included in the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention</b> lists. Such animals are Barbus cyclolepis (which is rare because of the habitat loss and the river pollution), Triturus alpestris, Spermophilus citellus (European Ground Squirrel) and others.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, {{the very last}} strongholds of the European moose {{appeared}} to be in Fennoscandian areas and patchy tracts of Russia, with a few migrants found in what is now Estonia and Lithuania. The USSR and Poland managed to restore portions of the range within its borders (such as the 1951 reintroduction into Kampinos National Park and the later 1958 reintroduction in Belarus), but political complications limited the ability to reintroduce it to other portions of its range. Attempts in 1930 and again in 1967 in marshland north of Berlin were unsuccessful. At present in Poland, populations are recorded in the Biebrza river valley, Kampinos, and in Białowieża Forest. It has migrated into other parts of Eastern Europe and has been spotted in eastern and southern Germany. Unsuccessful thus far in recolonizing these areas via natural dispersal from source populations in Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Slovakia, it appears to be having more success migrating south into the Caucasus. It is listed under Appendix III of the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention.</b>|$|E
25|$|Approximately 235 {{vertebrate}} {{species were}} identified {{within the boundaries}} of the park, of which 200 are threatened or under protection. These include three species of bat under pressure (of the eight that exist): greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and Mediterranean horseshoe bat (Rhinoloplus euryale). Other species of particular importance: the Iberian shrew (Sorex granarius), the European pine marten (Martes martes), the wildcat (Felis silvestris), the gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica) and the snub-nosed viper (Vipera latastei). A few of the local species are protected by the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention.</b> The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) whose habitat is restricted and marginal in continental Portugal, is another species that is common to the park. After four centuries absent from Portuguese territory, its population began to be recorded in 1985-1986, in Viana do Castelo. There were also registered sightings in Albergaria, Lamas de Mouro and Serra da Paneda, while comparable encounters in Spain were identified across the border. Roe deer, which are a symbol of the park are encountered in prolific quantity, along the margins of the park, where they find shelter and food.|$|E
500|$|The {{population}} of the Danube crested newt has declined significantly, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as [...] "near threatened". The main threat is habitat destruction by humans, especially through drainage, damming, or pollution. Hybridisation with other crested newt species {{and a loss of}} breeding ponds because of decreasing spring rain in the southern range (possibly due to global warming) are also seen as threats. Like the other crested newts, T.dobrogicus is listed in the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention</b> (appendix II) and the EU Habitats Directive (annexes II and IV), and capture, disturbance, killing, trade, and destruction of habitats are prohibited.|$|E
500|$|In Europe, Gomphus clavatus {{appears on}} the {{national}} Red Lists of threatened fungi in 17 countries {{and is one of}} 33 species of fungi proposed for international conservation under the <b>Bern</b> <b>Convention.</b> Due to a substantial decline in sightings, Gomphus clavatus became a legally protected species in Hungary on September 1, 2005. It also has legal protection in Slovakia and Slovenia. The species formerly occurred in the British Isles, but has not been seen since 1927 and is now regarded as extinct. The fungus faces loss and degradation of its habitat; eutrophication (increased nitrates in the soil) is another potential threat. Gomphus clavatus [...] was selected as the 1998 Pilz des Jahres ("Mushroom of the Year") by the German Mycological Society, partly to highlight its vulnerable status.|$|E
