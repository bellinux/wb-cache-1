5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan had <b>been</b> <b>contacted</b> by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has a lot of history so there was a lot to call upon.|$|E
5|$|Gillan had <b>been</b> <b>contacted</b> by Episode Six's manager Gloria Bristow, {{who worked}} for Helmut Gordon, {{original}} manager of The Detours, later to become the Who. He replaced original lead singer Andy Ross, who left to get married, and joined keyboardist and singer Sheila Carter, guitarists Graham Carter and Tony Lander, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Harvey Shields. Gillan considers Episode Six to be his first truly professional band, and in their early days were sponsored and championed by Tony Blackburn, who occasionally accompanied Gillan on stage. Later, as well as performing concerts in the UK, Episode Six also toured Germany and Beirut., and had regular appearances on the BBC Light Programme. During his time with Episode Six, Gillan began writing songs together with Glover, forming an ultimately long lasting partnership. After a strained tour of Beirut, Shields left the band and was replaced first by John Kerrison, then by Mick Underwood. Underwood had previously played in The Outlaws with Ritchie Blackmore, and it was via him that Ian was put in touch with to form Deep Purple in 1968. Gillan originally declined the position of lead singer in the band, though by 1969, after having released nine singles, none of which charted in the UK, and finding their style of music too restrictive for him, he decided to leave Episode Six.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{clinical trial}} {{in which the}} serum anti-phenolic glycolipid (anti-PGL- 1) antibodies were analysed in household contacts (HHC) of patients with leprosy as an adjunct early leprosy diagnostic marker was conducted. The families of 83 patients underwent clinical examination and serum anti-PGL 1 measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 320 HHC, 98 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of lepromatous leprosy (LL), 80 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of borderline lepromatous (BL), 28 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of borderline (BB) leprosy, 54 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of borderline tuberculoid (BT), 40 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of tuberculoid (TT) and 20 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of indeterminate (I) leprosy. Consanguinity with the patients was determined for 232 (72. 5 %) HHC. Of those 232 contacts, 183 had linear consanguinity. Forty-nine HHC had collateral consanguinity. Fifty-eight contacts (18. 1 %) tested positive for anti-PGL 1 antibodies. The number of seropositive contacts based on the clinical forms of the index case was 17 (29. 3 %) for LL, 15 (25. 9 %) for BL, one (1. 7 %) for BB, 14 (24. 1 %) for BT, three (5. 2 %) for TT and eight (13. 7 %) for I. At the one year follow-up, two (3. 4 %) of these seropositive contacts had developed BT leprosy. The {{results of the present}} study indicate that the serum anti-PGL- 1 IgM antibody may be useful for evaluating antigen exposure and as a tool for an early leprosy diagnosis in HHC.
