25|$|This <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his {{reliance on}} thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't {{able to see}} family resemblances. We've {{made a mistake in}} understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E
500|$|The pilot episode {{received}} acclaim {{from television}} critics. TV Guide's Matt Roush praised {{the marriage of}} Scorsese and Winter, saying it [...] "... brilliantly marries Martin Scorsese's virtuosic cinematic eye to Terence Winter's panoramic mastery of rich character and eventful story," [...] and finished his review by stating [...] "It's the most purely—and impurely—enjoyable storytelling HBO has delivered in ages, like a movie that {{you never want to}} end." [...] Variety's Brian Lowry praised the show for returning network HBO to top form, saying [...] "This is, quite simply, television at its finest, occupying a sweet spot that—for all the able competition—still remains unique to HBO: An expensive, explicit, character-driven program, tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio would dare touch... For those wondering when the channel would deliver another franchise to definitively put it on top of the world, Ma, the wait is over: Go directly to [...] "Boardwalk."" [...] "One of the unexpected joys of [...] "Boardwalk Empire," [...] though, lies in the way the show revels in the oddities of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a giddy shadow world of criminals and politicians collaborating to keep the liquor flowing," [...] says online magazine Salon's Heather Havrilesky who went on to call the pilot [...] "breathtaking." [...] Roberto Bianco from USA Today said in his review that Boardwalk Empire was [...] "Extravagantly produced, shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice, Boardwalk Empire <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the world's former playground at the start of Prohibition—and brings HBO back to the forefront of the TV-series race." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{would have}} been strange indeed if John Marrot could have been much put about by a small matrimonial breeze, seeing that his life was spent in riding on an iron monster with {{white-hot}} lungs and boiling bowels which carried him through space day and night {{at the rate of}} fifty miles an hour!

"We are here," [...] said Maxwell, laying {{his finger}} on the paper, [...] "on the {{threshold}} of what the niggers call the Leopards' country, which is marked as partly explored territory, with this patch to represent the dominions of King, or headman, Shaillu. A few armed expeditions have traversed it farther east, and found it thinly peopled by petty tribes hostile to Europeans, while nobody knows much about Shaillu except that he abruptly broke off the negotiations he once began with the authorities.

In many ways the study of games and game design <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> tenets of education that we have long known, including the benefits of self-directed learning and project-based work.

6000|$|The {{belief that}} the sun will rise to-morrow might be falsified if the earth came {{suddenly}} into contact with a large body which destroyed its rotation; but the laws of motion and the law of gravitation would not be infringed by such an event. The business of science is to find uniformities, such as the laws of motion and the law of gravitation, to which, so far as our experience extends, there are no exceptions. In this search science has been remarkably successful, {{and it may be}} conceded that such uniformities have held hitherto. This <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the question: Have we any reason, assuming that they have always held in the past, to suppose that they will hold in the future? ...|$|E

60|$|And {{thus the}} sagacious {{foresight}} {{of the great}} lawgiver of systematic zoology, Linnaeus, becomes justified, and a century of anatomical research <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his conclusion, that man {{is a member of}} the same order (for which the Linnaean term PRIMATES ought to be retained) as the Apes and Lemurs. This order is now divisible into seven families, of about equal systematic value: the first, the ANTHROPINI, contains Man alone; the second, the CATARHINI, embraces the old-world apes; the third, the PLATYRHINI, all new-world apes, except the Marmosets; the fourth, the ARCTOPITHECINI, contains the Marmosets; the fifth, the LEMURINI, the Lemurs--from which 'Cheiromys' should probably be excluded to form a sixth distinct family, the CHEIROMYINI; while the seventh, the GALEOPITHECINI, contains only the flying Lemur 'Galeopithecus',--a strange form which almost touches on the Bats, as the 'Cheiromys' puts on a rodent clothing, and the Lemurs simulate Insectivora.|$|E

60|$|And {{if things}} were once in this train, that is, if virtue and {{religion}} were established as the necessary titles to reputation and preferment, and if vice and infidelity were not only loaded with infamy, but made the infallible ruin of all men's pretensions, our duty, by becoming our interest, would take root in our natures, and mix with the very genius of our people, {{so that it would}} not be easy for the example of one wicked prince <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our former corruptions.|$|R
60|$|The {{real reason}} {{of this great}} {{development}} of eloquence among the lower orders again <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the case of the}} aristocracy in earlier times. The lower classes live in a state of war, a war of words. Their readiness is the product of the same fiery individualism as the readiness of the old fighting oligarchs. Any cabman has to be ready with his tongue, as any gentleman of the last century had to be ready with his sword. It is unfortunate that the poetry which is developed by this process should be purely a grotesque poetry. But as the higher orders of society have entirely abdicated their right to speak with a heroic eloquence, {{it is no wonder that}} the language should develop by itself in the direction of a rowdy eloquence. The essential point is that somebody must be at work adding new symbols and new circumlocutions to a language.|$|E
60|$|This was no mere quarrel {{of rival}} authors. It marked a {{fundamental}} divergence in thought, and proclaimed {{the beginning of}} a disastrous reaction in {{the very heart of the}} school of illumination. Among the most conspicuous elements of the reaction were these: the subordination of reason to emotion; the displacement of industry, science, energetic and many-sided ingenuity, by dreamy indolence; and finally, what <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our starting-point, the suppression of opinions deemed to be anti-social by the secular arm. The old idea was brought back in a new dress; the absolutist conception of the function of authority, associated with a theistic doctrine. Unfortunately for France, Rousseau's idea prospered, and ended by vanquishing its antagonist. The reason is plain. Rousseau's idea exactly fitted in with the political traditions and institutions of the country. It was more easily and directly compatible than was the contending idea, with that temper and set of men's minds which tradition and institutions had fixed so disastrously deep in the national character.|$|E
60|$|We {{have now}} {{constructed}} a largely hypothetical {{picture of the}} world, which contains and places the experienced facts, including those derived from testimony. The world we have constructed can, {{with a certain amount}} of trouble, be used to interpret the crude facts of sense, the facts of physics, and the facts of physiology. It is therefore a world which may be actual. It fits the facts, and there is no empirical evidence against it; it also is free from logical impossibilities. But have we any good reason to suppose that it is real? This <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our original problem, as to the grounds for believing in the existence of anything outside my private world. What we have derived from our hypothetical construction is that there are no grounds against the truth of this belief, but we have not derived any positive grounds in its favour. We will resume this inquiry by taking up again the question of testimony and the evidence for the existence of other minds.|$|E
