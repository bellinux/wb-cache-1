He also served as the national team's assistant coach in 2002 and was an active participant of the San Miguel Corporation All-Stars, a group composed of several former professional basketball players.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that <b>blink</b> <b>and</b> saccadic suppression are produced by the same mechanism (Volkmann, 1986; Uchikawa & Sato, 1995; Ridder & Tomlinson, 1993, 1995). These studies demonstrated that <b>blink</b> <b>and</b> saccadic suppression {{have the same effect}} on various visual functions. However, none of these studies made a comparison of <b>blink</b> <b>and</b> saccadic suppression in the same individual. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the effects of <b>blink</b> <b>and</b> saccadic suppression on contrast sensitivity functions in the same subject. The effect of saccadic suppression on the contrast sensitivity function in three normal observers was determined. Employing a two-alternative, forced-choice technique, thresholds were measured for seven spatial frequencies. At each spatial frequency, the threshold was determined immediately following detection of a voluntary saccade. The magnitude of suppression was taken as the log ratio of the contrast sensitivities obtained while foveating the stimulus and those obtained during saccades. The magnitude of saccadic suppression was found to increase as the saccade amplitude increased and to be spatial-frequency dependent. Low spatial frequencies were suppressed more than high spatial frequencies. The blink suppression data have been measured previously (Ridder & Tomlinson, 1993). Saccadic <b>and</b> <b>blink</b> suppression were qualitatively similar. A vertical shift of the data brought the saccadic <b>and</b> <b>blink</b> suppression data into register. These results suggest that <b>blink</b> <b>and</b> saccadic suppression are produced by the same or similar mechanisms...|$|R
