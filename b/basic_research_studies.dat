40|$|Nicotinic acid (at a {{daily dose}} of grams) {{has been shown to}} induce potent anti-atherosclerotic effects in human and animal models. Evidence from {{clinical}} studies performed in the 1950 s has shown that nicotinic acid treatment remarkably improves the plasma lipid profile. Large clinical studies showed that nicotinic acid improves clinical cardiovascular outcomes. Given the protective effects of niacin, <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> were designed to explore additional anti-atherosclerotic pathways, such as those involved in cardiovascular inflammation. After the discovery of the nicotinic acid receptor GPR 109 A on adipocytes and immune cells, novel direct immunomodulatory properties of nicotinic acid have been identified. Importantly, the regulation of the release of inflammatory mediators from adipose tissue was observed, independent of lipid level amelioration. Less is known about the possible direct anti-inflammatory activities of nicotinic acid in other cells (such as hepatocytes, endothelial and vascular cells) previously indicated as key players in atherogenesis. Thus, further studies are needed to clarify this promising topic. Emerging evidence from clinical and <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> indicates that novel direct anti-atherosclerotic properties might mediate nicotinic acid-induced cardiovascular protection. Despite some limitations in its clinical use (mainly due to the incidence of adverse events, such as cutaneous flushing and hepatotoxicity), nicotinic acid should be considered as a very potent therapeutic approach to reduce atherosclerosis. Promising research developments are warranted in the near future...|$|E

30|$|The {{complexity}} of a situation, including {{the information provided}} to building occupants in a fire situation, may affect whether information is processed systematically or heuristically. In one <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> <b>study,</b> participants rated ostensible food additives as more harmful when their names were more difficult to pronounce than when their names were easier to pronounce. The study indicates that information which is more demanding to process increases perceived risk (Song and Schwarz 2009). Transferring that to evacuation scenarios, Drabek hypothesizes that inconsistency, ambiguity and overload of information increase emergent perceived risk (Drabek 2001). In line with these findings, another study found that mobility impaired building occupants associated lack of information (ambiguity) with highest ratings of concern during a fire evacuation (McConnell and Boyce 2013). However, given {{the small number of}} studies on the effect of the {{complexity of}} a situation on RP, further research is clearly necessary.|$|R
