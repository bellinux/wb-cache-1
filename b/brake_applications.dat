25|$|The first {{development}} of the modern ceramic brake was made by British engineers working in the railway industry for TGV applications in 1988. The objective was to reduce weight, the number of brakes per axle, {{as well as provide}} stable friction from very high speeds and all temperatures. The result was a carbon-fibre-reinforced ceramic process which is now used in various forms for automotive, railway, and aircraft <b>brake</b> <b>applications.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 1910, an {{improved}} braking schedule had been introduced, known as AMRE. This setup, and all others to come after, permitted graduated {{release of the}} brakes for finer control of <b>brake</b> <b>applications.</b> Additionally, AMRE allowed for the electric synchronization of braking throughout an entire train, causing all brakes on all cars of the train to apply uniformly and simultaneously. This created a smoother braking effort throughout the train. In order for the electric synchronization to work, {{it was necessary to}} insert an electric brake key to activate the feature. All of the older IRT cars, including the Composites, were refitted with the new AMRE system circa 1910.|$|E

The triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the rate of brake pipe pressure reduction. Therefore, as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe, each car's triple valve will cause an emergency brake application. However, if the brake pipe pressure is too low due to an excessive number of <b>brake</b> <b>applications,</b> an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves, leaving the engine driver with no means to stop the train.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{automotive}} {{brake rotors}} {{are made with}} cast iron. Besides having economical advantage, cast iron rotor provides many disadvantages due to its weight, such as reduction in fuel efficiency, increase in green house gas emission, and increase in noise, vibration and hardness. With the development of commercial aluminum composites, composite brake rotors are now manufactured. However, the present commercial composite materials are not specifically made for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> and there are drawbacks. A major drawback is their poor elevated temperature property. In this paper, the unique properties offered by an aluminum composite for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> is addressed, and an approach to compensate its properties for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> is highlighted...|$|R
2500|$|In addition, an {{emergency}} application brings in an additional component of each car's air brake system: the emergency portion. The triple valve {{is divided into}} two portions: the service portion, which contains the mechanism used during <b>brake</b> <b>applications</b> made during service reductions, and the emergency portion, which senses the immediate, rapid release of train line pressure. In addition, each car's air brake reservoir {{is divided into two}} portions—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the [...] "dual-compartment reservoir”. Normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service portion to the brake cylinder, while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the service portion and the emergency portion of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder, resulting in a 20–30% stronger application.|$|E

50|$|The {{automatic}} {{vacuum brake}} as described represented a considerable technical advance in train braking. In practice steam locomotives had two ejectors, a small ejector for running purposes (to exhaust air that had leaked into the train pipe) {{and a large}} ejector to release <b>brake</b> <b>applications.</b> Later Great Western Railway practice was to use a vacuum pump instead of the small ejector.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical ATS {{was more}} popular on rapid transit systems and {{dedicated}} commuter rail than freight or long distance passenger lines {{due to a}} combination of the increased complexity found in mainline railroad operations, the risk of inadvertent activation by debris or other wayside appliances, and the danger of emergency <b>brake</b> <b>applications</b> at high speeds.

SES used a system of transponder beacons attached to wayside block signals to enforce signal speed. SES was disliked by engine crews due to its habit of causing immediate penalty <b>brake</b> <b>applications</b> without first sounding an overspeed alarm and giving the engineer a chance to decelerate.

50|$|Despite {{emergency}} <b>brake</b> <b>applications</b> being made, {{the train}} eventually derailed on the trap {{points at the}} exit of the goods yard and continued for a further 70 yards before finally crashing into the Coton Hill South signal box, destroying it completely. The first 11 wagons followed the locomotive, but {{the destruction of the}} signal box opened a set of points which sent 24 further wagons into a siding, where they derailed and some collided with a second Class 47 diesel which was waiting to leave the yard. The destruction was widespread and the cleanup operation was further hampered by hydrochloric acid leaking from a damaged wagon. Normal service was not restored until 14 January.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a drum brake's {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference of the brake, a drum brake can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake. The increased friction contact area of drum brake shoes on the drum allows drum brake shoes to last longer than disc brake pads used in a brake system of similar dimensions and braking force. Drum brakes retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear <b>brake</b> <b>applications</b> due to the low heat generation of rear brakes, a drum brake's self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW of braking power).|$|E
50|$|If an {{automatic}} <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> occurs {{due to a}} violation of an ASFA signal, the train has to completely {{come to a halt}} and a manual reset of the ASFA system in the train must be performed.|$|R
5000|$|On a long {{train the}} brake force during a <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> was not {{consistent}} {{along the length}} of the train; the response to the driver’s operation of the brake valve varied according to train length and the variation caused longitudinal surging.|$|R
5000|$|... for {{the same}} reason, on a very long train, a {{considerable}} volume of air has {{to be admitted to}} the train pipe to make a full <b>brake</b> <b>application,</b> and a considerable volume has to be exhausted to release the brake (if for example a signal at danger is suddenly lowered and the driver requires to resume speed); while the air is traveling along the train pipe, the brake pistons {{at the head of the}} train have responded to the <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> or release, but those at the tail will respond much later, leading to undesirable longitudinal forces in the train. In extreme cases this has led to breaking couplings and causing the train to divide.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, an {{emergency}} application brings in an additional component of each car's air brake system: the emergency portion. The triple valve {{is divided into}} two portions: the service portion, which contains the mechanism used during <b>brake</b> <b>applications</b> made during service reductions, and the emergency portion, which senses the immediate, rapid release of train line pressure.

50|$|In {{the event}} of a loss of braking due to {{reservoir}} depletion, the engine driver may be able to regain control with an emergency brake application, as the emergency portion of each car's dual-compartment reservoir should be fully charged - it is not affected by normal service reductions.

50|$|Traditional {{train braking}} systems use {{pneumatic}} valves {{to control and}} generate <b>brake</b> <b>applications</b> on the cars {{along the length of}} the train. In general, this conventional system consists of a brake pipe that runs the length of the train which supplies air to reservoirs mounted on each of the cars. When the brake pipe and car components are charged with air, the brakes release. When the engineer needs to make a brake application, control valves in the locomotive reduce the brake pipe pressure. As the brake pipe pressure reduces, the service portion on each car divert air from their reservoirs to their brake cylinders. To release the brakes, the engineer charges the brake pipe. This method of controlling the brakes on freight and passenger cars has been virtually the same since its invention by George Westinghouse in 1868.|$|E
2500|$|Following the accident, it was {{revealed}} that the line was not equipped with the TBL 1+ signalling system, which is capable of automatic <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> if a train passes a red signal. This system was introduced following the Buizingen train crash in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the engine}} moved forward the shunter {{saw that the}} signals were at [...] "danger"; the shunter then applied the brake and noted that the brakes were working {{correctly}} as he noticed a reduction in speed. Within 10 yards of the signal at [...] "danger", the shunter believing the train was now stopping, released his brake. He then immediately checked the signals and seeing them at [...] "danger" [...] immediately re-applied the brake. At the inquest the shunter stated that the first <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> was not full due to his fear of the train dividing; the second <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> although applied {{to a greater extent}} was still not a full application. The parcels train now blocked the track upon which the excursion train was attached.|$|R
40|$|This {{proof-of-concept}} {{research was}} performed to explore the feasibility of using real-world braking data from commercial motor vehicles to make a diagnosis of brake condition {{similar to that of}} the performance-based brake tester (PBBT). This was done by determining the relationship between pressure and brake force (P-BF), compensating for the gross vehicle weight (GVW). The nature of this P-BF relationship (e. g., low braking force for a given <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure) may indicate brake system problems. In order to determine the relationship between brake force and <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure, a few key parameters of duty cycle information were collected. Because braking events are often brief, spanning only a few seconds, a sample rate of 10 Hz was needed. The algorithm under development required <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure and speed (from which deceleration was calculated). Accurate weight estimation was also needed to properly derive the braking force from the deceleration. In order to ensure that braking force was the predominant factor in deceleration for the segments of data used in analysis, the data was screened for grade as well. Also, the analysis needed to be based on pressures above the crack pressure. The crack pressure is the pressure below which the individual brakes are not applied due the nature of the mechanical system. This value, which may vary somewhat from one wheel end to another, is approximately 10 psi. Therefore, only pressures 15 psi and above were used in the analysis. The Department of Energy s Medium Truck Duty Cycle research has indicated that under the real-world circumstances of the test vehicle brake pressures of up to approximately 30 psi can be expected. Several different types of data were collected during the testing task of this project. Constant-pressure stopping tests were conducted at several combinations of <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure (15, 20, 25, and 30 psi), load conditions (moderately and fully laden), and speeds (20 and 30 mph). Data was collected at 10 Hz. Standard and stepped-pressure performance-based brake tests with brake pressure transducers were performed for each loading condition. The stepped-pressure test included the constant-pressure intervals of <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> at 15, 20, 25, and 30 psi. The PBBT data files included 10 Hz streaming data collected during the testing of each axle. Two weeks of real-world duty cycle (driving and braking) data was also collected at 10 Hz. Initial analysis of the data revealed that the data collected in the field (i. e., day-to-day operations) provided the same information as that obtained from the controlled tests. Analysis of the data collected revealed a strong linear relationship between <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure and deceleration for given GVWs. As anticipated, initial speed was not found to be a significant factor in the deceleration-pressure relationship, unlike GVW. The positive results obtained from this proof of concept test point to the need for further research to expand this concept. A second phase should include testing over a wider range of speeds and include medium <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressures in addition to the low pressures tested in this research. Testing on multiple vehicles would also be of value. This future phase should involve testing to determine how degradation of braking performance affects the pressure-deceleration relationship...|$|R
