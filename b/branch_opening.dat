5|$|By 1914 the non-militant {{elements}} of the suffrage movement had built up a steady presence and, although damaged by the bad press violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity. A summer school {{had been set up}} by the NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and now their members were benefitting from the training in public speaking that was given. In south Wales signs of working-class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women's Co-operative Guild, with a <b>branch</b> <b>opening</b> in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews.|$|E
500|$|Service was set {{to begin}} in October 2002, with the Jamaica station set for {{completion}} by 2005. The Howard Beach branch was supposed to open first, with the Jamaica <b>branch</b> <b>opening</b> later, in 2003. In July 2002, an AirTrain derailed during testing, injuring three workers on board the train. On September 27, 2002, a train operator died in another derailment during a test run, which delayed the system's opening. The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the crash {{and found that the}} train had been speeding excessively on a curve {{at the time of the}} crash. After the death, Southeast Queens residents feared the project could become a [...] "boondoggle." [...] By this time, the system had cost $1.9 billion to build. The entire system {{was set to}} open in June 2003 following the fatal crash, but its opening date was pushed to on December 17, 2003. AirTrain JFK and the rest of the airport, like other Port Authority properties, did not receive subsidies from the state or city for its operating costs, which became one of the reasons cited for its relatively high fare.|$|E

50|$|The unsystematic {{progression}} (or otherwise) from linen {{agency to}} bank branch {{makes it difficult}} to be certain about the number of branches the Company had in the late eighteenth century. Malcolm's list of <b>branch</b> <b>openings</b> suggests that there were 18 bank branches by 1800 and a further 25 added {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century. The pace of activity accelerated in the second half of the century with over 70 <b>branch</b> <b>openings.</b> The one thing that British Linen did not do was to acquire other banks. The one exception was in 1837 when it bought the Paisley Banking Company with its three branches. By 1901, British Linen's branch network was given as joint third to the Royal Bank and the Commercial Bank of Scotland.|$|R

2500|$|In June 1879, under a {{mortgage}} foreclosure, {{what was left}} of the South Side Railroad was sold, and it was conveyed to the newly organized Brooklyn and Montauk Railroad, which was immediately leased as the Montauk Division to the LIRR. In 1881, the line was extended east from Patchogue to Eastport by the Brooklyn and Montauk Railroad, connecting it to the Sag Harbor <b>Branch,</b> <b>opening</b> on July 17, 1881. This created a continuous rail line along the South Shore to Sag Harbor. It was thought that the line connecting the Main Line to Sag Harbor via Eastport could be abandoned, but residents got the LIRR to use the line as a cutoff for trains between the Main Line and the Montauk Division, and as a way for passengers to travel between the North and South Forks. This service was termed as a [...] "scoot". These trains ran from Greenport to Sag Harbor, and later to Montauk. In October 1889, the Brooklyn and Montauk Railroad merged into the LIRR.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 June 1902, the UERL {{took over}} the Metropolitan District Traction Company. The UERL built a large power station that {{would be capable of}} {{providing}} power for the District and underground lines under construction. Work began in 1902 at Lots Road, by Chelsea Creek, and in February 1905 Lots Road Power Station began generating electricity. For the three lines similar electric multiple units were purchased, known as [...] "Gate Stock" [...] as access to the cars was via lattice gates at each end operated by gatemen. As on the District Railway the track was provided with separate positive and negative conductor rails, in what was to become a London Underground standard. A number of the surface buildings, with an exterior of glazed dark red bricks, were designed by Leslie Green and 140 electric lifts were imported from America from the Otis Elevator Company. A length of the Baker Street & Waterloo between Baker Street and Kennington Road (now Lambeth North) opened in March 1906, and the line reached Edgware Road the following year. It was named the 'Bakerloo' in July 1906, called an undignified [...] "gutter title" [...] by The Railway Magazine. The Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway (the Piccadilly) opened from Finsbury Park to Hammersmith in December 1906, the Aldwych <b>branch</b> <b>opening</b> the following year. [...] "Moving staircases" [...] or escalators were first installed at Earl's Court between the District and Piccadilly line platforms, and at all deep level tube stations after 1912.
