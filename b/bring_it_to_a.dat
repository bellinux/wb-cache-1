5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E

25|$|Charles was {{initially}} {{treated as a}} hero on his return to Paris but {{after several years of}} war, the French were short of money and eager to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> conclusion; following the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the Stuarts were once more banished from France. Charles secretly visited London in 1750 and continued attempts to reignite his cause but the heavy drinking that was now a feature of his life made him argumentative and hard to work with. In 1759, the French Chief Minister, de Choiseul met with Charles to discuss Jacobite participation in another ambitious invasion attempt but dismissed him as incapable through drink. Charles never visited Britain again and in January 1788, died in Rome, a disappointed and embittered man.|$|E
25|$|Horve {{decided to}} take the enemy ship as a prize and <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> British port. Since Draug had almost no {{anti-aircraft}} weapons to speak of, and the skies were full of enemy aircraft, the destroyer could do little good by remaining where she was. He ignored an order from Naval Command to go to the Hardangerfjord and block German naval forces from gaining access to that fjord. As Horve knew that the Naval Command headquarters in Bergen had been captured by the German invaders, he assumed that the order was false, although it later turned out it was not. When ordered to steer his ship towards Britain, the captain of Main refused, only yielding after the Norwegian warship fired several warning shots and threatened to torpedo him.|$|E

If the fleeing driver chooses to pass the traffic, usually on the hard shoulder, the pursuing vehicles follow it.

Kit Chan played the second female lead. They achieved 42 consecutive full-house performances at the gigantic Hung Hom Hong Kong Coliseum which remains the record today.

25|$|The {{same month}} Davis was named commissioner, several NFL owners, along with Dallas Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm, {{secretly}} approached Lamar Hunt and other AFL owners {{and asked the}} AFL to merge. They {{held a series of}} secret meetings in Dallas to discuss their concerns over rapidly increasing player salaries, as well as the practice of player poaching. Hunt and Schramm completed the basic groundwork for a merger of the two leagues by the end of May, and on June 8, 1966, the merger was officially announced. Under the terms of the agreement, the two leagues would hold a common player draft. The agreement also called for a title game to be played between the champions of the respective leagues. The two leagues would be fully merged by 1970, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle would remain as commissioner of the merged league, and additional expansion teams would eventually be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 28-team league. The AFL also agreed to pay indemnities of $18 million to the NFL over 20 years. In protest, Davis resigned as AFL commissioner on July 25 rather than remain until the completion of the merger, and Milt Woodard was named President of the AFL.|$|E

500|$|The {{government}} did not give up on addressing the problem when it ended subsidies. [...] It had previously commissioned {{a number of studies}} on the agricultural situation and related factors, and converted some of the results of these studies into legislation. [...] The Debt Adjustment Act of 1923 was designed to adjust farmers' debts to a level that they could actually pay, thus allowing them to carry on while still ensuring that creditors received as much as was feasible. [...] In the words of University of Calgary professor David C. Jones, the bill offered [...] "solace, but no real satisfaction".

By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine."
