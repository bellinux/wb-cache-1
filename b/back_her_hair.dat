500|$|... "Cafe Disco" [...] {{included}} several callbacks to previous The Office episodes. Michael blames Charles Miner, the new Dunder Mifflin vice president, {{for the poor}} atmosphere around the office; Charles was the antagonist of a recent six-episode story arc revolving around Michael's defection from Dunder Mifflin to the Michael Scott Paper Company. The office space used for Cafe Disco is the old Michael Scott Paper Company office space previously featured in the episodes [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company", [...] "Heavy Competition" [...] and [...] "Broke". The episode features Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt) as Kevin's date at the dance; Lynne was previously introduced in [...] "Blood Drive", the fifth season's Valentine's Day episode, where the two met at an office singles party. Television reviewers also compared the bonding between Dwight and Phyllis in [...] "Cafe Disco" [...] as a throwback to [...] "Crime Aid", an episode earlier in the season, in which Phyllis tries to console a saddened Dwight {{in the wake of}} Andy and Angela's engagement. [...] Ironically, in preparing to elope with Jim, Pam pins <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> partially reverting to her style from earlier seasons, while conversely, Pam lets down her hair in [...] "The Secret" [...] when Kelly asks how Pam will style her hair to wed Roy.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. New York magazine's James Lim wrote that while Gaga's magazine covers were showing the singer in more modest poses, the book showed the [...] "wild, funky, creative Gaga {{that we all}} know and love". Liesl Bradner of the Los Angeles Times expressed surprise at seeing Gaga without her makeup and stage costumes. [...] "It's when the singer takes a moment from the madness, pulls <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> and ditches the costumes, that we see the real girl who is the mastermind behind the monster," [...] Bradner wrote, adding that the release would be special for the fans. Eden Carter Wood of Diva magazine shared the same thought with Bradner and added that the book contained nice portraits of the artist. Arthur House from The Daily Telegraph was positive in his review, while finding the pictures to be glossy and enjoyable. Toronto Stars David Graham compared the book to Madonna's similar styled book called Sex (released in 1992). However, he found a [...] "distinct lack of fanfare surrounding the book". Lady Gaga x Terry Richardson, according to Graham could not generate the same amount of [...] "shock and awe that erupted when Madonna came out with Sex". However he still believed that there were [...] "outrageous — even disturbing — photographs" [...] of Gaga.|$|E
500|$|On February 8, 2011, Gaga tweeted {{the words}} [...] "Trois Jours" [...] ("Three Days"), {{along with a}} picture of the {{official}} single artwork, via TwitPic. Gaga is shown topless in the black-and-white cover art and displays the tattoos on her <b>back.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> is air-blown and she wears heavy make-up while sharp edges protrude from her face and shoulders. The artwork was described by Charlie Amter from The Hollywood Reporter as harkening back to the classic record covers from the 1980s. He compared it to the artworks by bands like Missing Persons, Roxy Music and Duran Duran. Gordon Smart from The Sun also felt that the [...] "stark black and white image" [...] had a glossy eighties air about it. Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the cover art, feeling that Gaga looked almost [...] "animalistic" [...] in the picture, and her flowing hair made her look like a creature from the African jungle. She also added that the artwork was [...] "totally and completely fierce". Archana Ram from the same publication found similarities between the [...] "Born This Way" [...] cover art and [...] Kylie Minogue's cover art for her 2007 single [...] "2 Hearts". Nicole Eggenberger from OK! described the artwork as a perfect balance between the singer's [...] "wild side" [...] and her [...] "glamorous" [...] looks. Leah Collins from Dose believed that the extreme make-up and tattoos were an ironic play on the title of the song.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Verloc {{touched the}} <b>back</b> of <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> It was in perfect order.|$|R
6000|$|... "Woogh!" [...] snarled Eureka, arching <b>her</b> <b>back</b> until <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> stood {{straight}} on end; [...] "it's den of alligators, or crocodiles, {{or some other}} dreadful creatures! Don't you see their terrible eyes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do I care?" [...] said Sally, tossing <b>back</b> <b>her</b> long <b>hair</b> as {{she brushed}} it, and then {{stopping}} to examine {{one of her}} eyelashes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{painting}} shows a half-length figure, {{the body}} of a woman turned at a three-quarter angle toward her right, but her face turned toward her left. Her gaze is directed neither straight ahead, nor toward the viewer, but toward a [...] "third party" [...] beyond the picture's frame. In her arms, Gallerani holds a small white-coated stoat, known as an ermine. Gallerani's dress is comparatively simple, revealing that she is not a noblewoman. Her coiffure, known as a coazone, confines her hair smoothly to her head with two bands of hair bound {{on either side of her}} face and a long plait at the <b>back.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> is held in place by a fine gauze veil with a woven border of gold-wound threads, a black band, and a sheath over the plait.|$|E
60|$|Nell, regaining her composure, {{wiped her}} eyes and {{smoothed}} <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
60|$|The chalk-pit {{was full}} of {{sunshine}} and the murmuration of bees. Fleur flung <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
60|$|They {{looked very}} elegant, {{the pair of}} them. Lettie was wearing a long coat which fitted close; she had a small hat whose {{feathers}} flushed straight <b>back</b> with <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{tossed her}} head. With {{her hands to}} the <b>back</b> of <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> she turned round to look at herself {{for a moment in}} one of the mirrors which lined the inside of the bar. Burton grinned at his late employer.|$|R
60|$|Her lips moved, {{but made}} no sound. She seemed strangely disquieted, and shook <b>back</b> <b>her</b> loose <b>hair,</b> and with <b>her</b> small toes moved the {{sparkling}} sand at her feet, and {{once or twice}} her eyes glanced shyly at my face.|$|R
60|$|She shook <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> {{and then}} let it spread over her {{shoulders}} in luxuriant curls.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{five minutes}} Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and pushed <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him heavily as she put <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair.</b> Suddenly he put his finger-tips on her cheek.|$|E
50|$|My Long-Haired Life was {{a return}} to her {{previous}} method of blending original songs and covers. Having cut <b>her</b> characteristically long <b>hair</b> when she became a mother, the album title alludes to her life of singing <b>back</b> when <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> was long. The album's cover shows a self-painted portrait of Jones sitting in a barber's chair, her golden locks strewn on the floor.|$|R
60|$|That {{she herself}} {{had to take a}} looking-glass and go upon the roof to do <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>hair,</b> she thought less amusing.|$|R
6000|$|... 89 whatever; {{but in this}} he was wrong. For each {{girl had}} stuck through the knot of <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>hair</b> two long, {{glittering}} knitting-needles.|$|R

6000|$|Quite deaf to {{the chorus}} of sneezes which {{accompanied}} her words, Christie answered, brushing <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> as if {{to get a better}} out-look at creation generally: ...|$|E
60|$|Yet she heeded {{not their}} offers, but {{dismissed}} {{them with a}} blessing, Then she let down all <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>hair,</b> which had taken long in dressing.|$|R
60|$|The Lady Rowena, {{with three}} of her attendants {{standing}} at <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> and arranging <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> ere she lay down to rest, was seated {{in the sort of}} throne already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general homage. The Pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection.|$|R
6000|$|After telling Mr Powell {{not to go}} {{away the}} captain {{remained}} silent. Suddenly Mrs Anthony pushed <b>back</b> <b>her</b> loose <b>hair</b> with a decisive gesture of her arms and moved still nearer to him. [...] "Here's papa up yet," [...] she said, {{but she did not}} look towards Mr Smith. [...] "Why is it? And you? I can't go on like this, Roderick--between you two. Don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{called her}} from where I stood--"Annabel Lee!" [...] She {{lifted her head}} and shook <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> and gazed at me startled and intent. I went nearer.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you' said Kalliope, pushing <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> with a half- bewildered look. 'I {{remember}} my poor mother was very anxious about that. But {{it seems a}} little thing now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Essie was not {{delighted with}} {{this mode of}} consolation, and when her mother tenderly {{smoothed}} <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> and bade her bathe her face and dress for dinner, she clung to her and said—- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've won!" [...] she cried, shaking <b>back</b> <b>her</b> long <b>hair.</b> [...] "I've won, and for {{the stake}} of Egypt, why, 'twas a game worth playing! With this dagger, then, thou wouldst have slain me, O my royal Rival, whose myrmidons even now are {{gathered}} at my palace gate? Art still awake? Now what hinders me that I should not plunge it to thy heart?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sylvie laughed merrily. [...] "What do you mean?" [...] she said. And {{she pushed}} <b>back</b> <b>her</b> heavy brown <b>hair</b> with both hands, {{and looked at}} him with dancing eyes in which the big teardrops were still glittering.|$|R
60|$|He led the {{way down}} the lane, the two women {{following}} together. Jessamine thought she must be in a pleasant dream. The whole afternoon was a feast of delight to her starved heart. When sunset came she sat down, tired out, but radiant, on the porch steps. Her hat had slipped <b>back</b> and <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> was curling around her face. Her dark eyes were aglow; the roses still bloomed in her cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|KATHERINE {{turns back}} to her glass, puts <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> and [...] smooths her lips and eyes. The door from the {{corridor}} is [...] opened, and HELEN's voice says: [...] "Kit! You're not in bed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The child pushed <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> {{with her}} little hands, and after waiting to realise the {{situation}} to the limit of her small experience, she said, {{with a smile that}} showed her pretty teeth, [...] "Yes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's {{only one}} day till I shall see papa. That's what mamma said. Where is mamma?" [...] asked the child, rising to her knees, and {{sweeping}} <b>back</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> from her face with either hand.|$|E

[...] "One {{of these days}} you'll meet some lovely American girl and then you'll put a worm down <b>her</b> <b>back</b> or pull <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> or {{whatever}} it is you do when you want to show your devotion, and.... What are you looking at? Is something interesting going on behind me?" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{he went to}} {{her room}} from his library, where she left him the whole evening with the children, he found her before the glass thoughtfully {{removing}} the first dismantling pin from <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
