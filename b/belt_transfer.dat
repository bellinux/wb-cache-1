40|$|Float {{coal dust}} is {{produced}} by various mining methods, carried by ventilating air and deposited on the floor, roof and ribs of mine airways. If deposited, float dust is re-entrained during a methane explosion. Without sufficient inert rock dust quantities, this float coal dust can propagate an explosion throughout mining entries. Consequently, controlling float coal dust is of critical interest to mining operations. Rock dusting, which is the adding of inert material to airway surfaces, is the main control technique currently used by the coal mining industry to reduce the float coal dust explosion hazard. To assist the industry in reducing this hazard, the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division of the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health initiated a project to investigate methods and technologies to reduce float coal dust in underground coal mines through prevention, capture and suppression prior to deposition. Field characterization studies were performed to determine quantitatively the sources, types and amounts of dust produced during various coal mining processes. The operations chosen for study were a continuous miner section, a longwall section and a coal-handling facility. For each of these operations, the primary dust sources were confirmed to be the continuous mining machine, longwall shearer and conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>transfer</b> points, respectively. Respirable and total airborne float dust samples were collected and analyzed for each operation, and the ratio of total airborne float coal dust to respirable dust was calculated. During the continuous mining process, the ratio of total airborne float coal dust to respirable dust ranged from 10. 3 to 13. 8. The ratios measured on the longwall face were between 18. 5 and 21. 5. The total airborne float coal dust to respirable dust ratio observed during belt transport ranged between 7. 5 and 21. 8.

40|$|The {{development}} of extensional basins is commonly explained as {{induced by the}} kinematics of tectonic plates (lithospheric stretching and flexure, strike-slip-related basins) and by the density imbalances produced by oceanic ridges, continental margins and plateau uplifts. Strike-slip-related basins are commonly associated to transform plate boundaries, to obliquely-converging plate boundaries where deformation is fully partitioned into dip-slip and strike-slip faulting, and to intraplate strike-slip deformation <b>belts</b> <b>transferring</b> displacement from convergent plate boundaries to the plate interiors. The occurrence of strike-slip deformation belts that are significantly active in intraplate regions is possibly uncommon in divergent plate boundaries, that are generally believed {{to be dominated by}} sea floor spreading and passive margin development. Plate tectonics theory does not predict any strike-slip movement along fracture zones once they pass outboard of their associated ridge segments and away from the plate boundary. In this contribution we illustrate the Cenozoic geodynamic framework at the northeastern edge of the Antarctic plate, where we believe there is strong evidence for the occurrence of post-rift strike-slip deformation belts including both the intraridge (transform) and out-of-ridge segments of fracture zones, and their collinear onshore strike-slip fault systems. These impressively long strike-slip <b>belts</b> <b>transfer</b> differential spreading at the constructional plate boundary into the plate interior, where residual horizontal displacement is accommodated in a lithosphere-scale horsetail array of transtensional basins. Deep basins originated also along the main traces of these intraplate strike-slip belts, both in oceanic and continental crust. Basin opening to accommodate displacement associated to intraplate strike-slip deformation belts dissecting passive margins provides an additional geodynamic scenario for explaining the occurrence of important extensional deformations in the plate interiors...|$|R

These mines use {{a wide variety}} of extraction methods, but they have many common dust sources and dust control needs. Ore passes, drills, blasting, conveyor <b>belts,</b> <b>transfer</b> points, crushers, and load-haul-dump operations can be major sources of dust. Roadheaders, which are sometimes used in hard-rock mines, produce dust in large quantities. For the most part, dust in hard-rock mines is controlled with ventilation air, water sprays, and dust collectors. It is also important to prevent dust from getting into the air in the first place. Good dust control practices will reduce overall mine ventilation requirements. [Lack of maintenance is the main source of dust problems in hard-rock mines according to Rodgers [1974], who conducted a dust survey of hard-rock mines several decades ago. Rodgers found that spray systems had clogged sprays, dust enclosures had improperly fitted skirts, and ductwork was plugged and had leaks.
