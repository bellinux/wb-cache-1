5000|$|This speech {{reveals that}} this Great Mogul must {{constantly}} move {{from place to}} place, has no friends, and can never die. All of these signs point to {{the legend of the}} Wandering Jew. On top of this, the Great Mogul reveals, “God has set his seal upon me, and all his creatures respect this fatal mark”. This refers to the burning cross on his forehead, a mark of God that gives the Great Mogul his power to destroy evil spirits, such as the Bleeding Nun. This <b>burning</b> <b>mark</b> is a characteristic of the Wandering Jew specifically found in Spanish variants of the legend. The Monk is primarily set in Spain and its main characters, like Raymond, are mostly Spanish. Therefore, the Wandering Jew fulfills the aspects of the legend most commonly found in Spain. Another characteristic of the Wandering Jew found in Spain is that although he is miserable and cursed, he spends his time praying, doing good works, and helping others. Theodore tells Raymond that “he did much good in the town,” and he helps Raymond get rid of the Bleeding Nun. The Great Mogul’s identity as the Wandering Jew is eventually revealed: ...|$|E

40|$|I am {{obsessed with}} the pieces of existence; the memories, {{experiences}} and emotions that make up human identity. Our lives are defined by entropy that causes these pieces to fragment and become distorted over time. Looking back at the pieces they become almost unrecognizable, and it becomes unclear if they are something or if they are nothing. My work centers on a compulsive desire to put these pieces into something that makes sense. The photograph serves as {{a representation of the}} memory and experience, broken down into parts that remove them as a piece of an identifiable whole. The photographs are chosen as fragile objects of nostalgia, with the intent of leading the viewer into the past instead of the present or future. In addition to fragmenting the images, I often destroy them further by <b>burning</b> or <b>marking</b> to continually hint at the inevitable decay memory and experience are subjected to. My materials are chosen for their ephemeral nature, as well as their receptiveness to the destructive actions I take upon them. These obscured pieces I create quickly become subject to my compulsion for order, much as the actual fragments of my existence do within my mind. Individually the parts take on little meaning, but {{as a part of a}} greater whole I can enact significance and structure. The compilation further encourages the identification of the object/image as either something or nothing as it becomes more confrontational in size. More than anything I want this order to give way to meaning. Yet more often than not the combative dualities remain: fragments or whole, something or nothing, important or futile. The more I work with these ideas, however, the more I am beginning to believe that the juxtaposition of these dichotomies is where the true significance lies. Although the creation of this work allows me to investigate these dualities within the studio in both a literal and psychological way, my hope is to open up conversations with the viewer about memory, identity and the entropic human condition.

40|$|Tse-whit-zen {{is a large}} well {{preserved}} {{archaeological site}} that was discovered in August 2003 in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State. By 2004 an archaeological dig crew was working tirelessly on the site, {{which turned out to}} be one of the largest Native American villages ever found in the Pacific Northwest. This village was shown to have been inhabited by the Lower Elwha Klallam tribe, whose descendants still continue to live in the region. The site was occupied for thousands of years, with the oldest material dated at 2, 700 years ago and the youngest at 100 years ago when the village was buried under dirt and rubble. Excellent preservation at the site led to the discovery of 335 human burials, thousands of artifacts, and a multitude of mammal, fish, shellfish, and bird bones. Since 2011 research on the bird bones found at Tse-whit-zen has been going on at the University of Rhode Island with many of the bones already identified by element (i. e. humerus, femur, etc.) and taxa (i. e. duck, gull, etc.) by undergraduates and Professor Bovy. The Tse-whit-zen bird bones are currently the largest analyzed bird bone assemblage in the Olympic Peninsula. Taphonomy is the study of the processes that affect animal remains after their death, including human butchering, animal gnawing, or natural processes. Taphonomic evidence on bones, including <b>burning</b> or cut <b>marks,</b> can show cultural aspects, such as how food was cooked and processed by people in the past. The main question focused on in this study is how the people of Tse-whit-zen cooked and processed the birds that were available and whether these activities varied by taxa or element. In this report a subset of the entire Tse-whit-zen avian assemblage was analyzed. Each bone was studied for taphonomic markers, such as <b>burning</b> and cut <b>marks,</b> all of which were recorded in a database, which also included the catalog number and provenience of each bone. I observed several different types of modifications during data collection. Burning is the most frequent of all modifications observed, including burning along the broken shaft of limb bones, such as humeri. There are also several instances of cut marks on the bone as well as a few marks that may have been created during the process of disarticulating the bird carcass. These results are summarized and quantified in the report by type of modification, kind of bird, and skeletal element. Furthermore, the results of the burning on the bones are then compared to the frequency and location of burning noted in other analyzed bird bone assemblages in the surrounding areas of the Tse-whit-zen site. The evidence for processing and cooking of birds at Tse-whit-zen is summarized within the context of the site and the larger Northwest Coast region...|$|R
40|$|During the Middle Ages in Europe, a {{different}} post-mortem funerary custom {{came to be}} used in order to transport and solemnly dispose of the bodies of high-status individuals. Because of their high degree of mobility, most medieval kings and queens rarely died where they had planned to be buried; thus, they had to be moved to the place of burial. Ancient writings describe some post-mortem funerary practices carried out to facilitate transport, such as boiling or burning of bodies after death. The remains of Henry VII of Luxembourg were analysed in order to determine which post-mortem practices were utilized. A detailed chemical-physical analysis was conducted to highlight the changes in the bone matrix due to post-mortem alteration. Boiling and <b>burning</b> leave different <b>marks</b> in the bone that could be differentiated through the analysis of the inorganic and organic components of the bone. Accordingly, anthropological, X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), collagen ratio, and scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM/EDAX) analysis were performed on two different bone fragments: cranial and tibial shaft. This multidisciplinary approach has enriched scientific understanding of the post-mortem practices to which the skull and tibial shaft of Henry VII were subjected. The results highlight that the tibial shaft was treated under higher temperature respect to the skull. Furthermore, this analysis also shed light on the state of preservation of the bone fragments analysed and has allowed us to initiate more complex molecular analysis, as well as ancient DNA analysis...|$|R
40|$|A Chinese fir forest (Cunninghamia lanceolata, CL) and a {{secondary}} evergreen broadleaved forest (BF) located in Fujian Province, south-eastern China, were examined before clear-cutting to compare their ecosystem carbon and nitrogen pools (above- and below-ground tree, understorey vegetation and forest floor biomass + 0 - 100 cm mineral soil layer). The ecosystem pools of C and N in the CL before clear-cutting were 257 Mg ha(- 1) and 8605 kg ha(- 1), respectively. The corresponding {{values for the}} BF were 336 Mg ha(- 1) of C and 10, 248 kg ha(- 1) of N. For the two forests, most of the C was in the trees, whereas most of the N pool was in the soil.

During clear-cutting, 117 Mg ha(- 1) C and 307 kg ha(- 1) N in stem wood with bark and coarse branches (> 2 cm) {{were removed from the}} CL compared to 159 Mg ha(- 1) C and 741 kg ha(- 1) N from the BF. Two days after slash burning, C removal from logging residues (including forest floor material) was estimated at 10 Mg ha- 1 for CL and 23 Mg ha(- 1) for BF, and N removal was 233 and 490 kg ha(- 1) in the CL and BF, respectively. Compared with the pre-burn levels in the CL, contents of topsoil organic C and total N 2 days after burning were reduced by 17 and 19 %, respectively. In the BF, the corresponding proportions were 27 % (C) and 25 % (N). Our results indicate that clear-cutting and slash <b>burning</b> had caused <b>marked</b> short-term changes in ecosystem C and N in the two forests.

40|$|Background: Because of the {{decrease}} in the Helicobacter pylori eradication rate after standard triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics, bismuth-based therapy has recently been recommended as alternate firstline regimen in children. Aim: To comprehensively review the clinical, pharmacologic and microbiologic properties of bismuth salts, and to summarise the evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of bismuth-based therapy for H. pylori eradication in children. Methods: Bibliographical searches were performed in MEDLINE. Results on the efficacy of bismuth-containing regimens on H. pylori eradication were combined using the inverse variance method. Results: Bismuth monotherapy showed a very low efficacy. Overall, the mean eradication rate with bismuth-based dual therapy was 68 % (95 % CI, 60 - 76 %) (intention- to-treat analysis-ITT) and 73 % (95 % CI, 64 - 81 %) (per protocol-PP). In case series, the overall percentages of children with successful eradication for triple therapy containing bismuth were 82 % (95 % CI, 76 - 88 %) and 86 % (95 % CI, 80 - 92 %) according to ITT and PP respectively. In comparative studies, H. pylori eradication rates ranged between 69 % and 85 % according to ITT and between 74 % and 96 % PP. Side effects included dark stools, urine discoloration, black tongue, <b>burning</b> tongue, and <b>marked</b> darkness of the gums. Conclusions: The evidence in favour of bismuth compounds for treating infected children is still not clear. Well-designed, randomised, multi-centre studies of H. pylori eradication trials in children comparing bismuth-based triple therapy with the best available recommended first-line therapies are needed. The evidence obtained from audited case series that produce an eradication rate of > 95 % on PP analysis should also be considered. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, laser {{machining}} {{technology has been}} used widely in industrial applications usually {{with the aim of}} increasing the production capability of mass production lines - especially for fast marking, engraving type of applications where speed is an important concern - or manufacturing quality of a certain facility by increasing the level of accuracy in material processing applications such as drilling, cutting; or any scientific research oriented work where high precision machining of parts in sub millimeter scale might be required. A galvanometric scanner is a high precision device that is able to steer a laser beam with a mirror attached to a motor, whose rotor angular range is usually limited with tens of degrees in both directions of rotation; and position is controlled either by voltage or current. Due to their lightness, the rotor and the mirror can move very fast, allowing fast <b>marking</b> (<b>burning</b> out) operation with the laser beam. This can be evaluated as a great advantage compared to slower mechanical appliances used for cutting/machining of different materials. This study concentrates on the analysis of galvanometric scanner system components; and the design and implementation of a hardware and software based control system for a dual-axis galvo setup; and their adaptation for use in laser micromachining applications either as a standalone system or a modular subsystem. Analysis part of the thesis work contains: evaluation of dominant laser micromachining techniques, an overview of the galvanometric scanner system based approach and related components (e. g. electromechanical, electrical, optical), understanding of working principles and related simulation work, compatibility issues with the target micromachining applications. Design part of the thesis work includes: the design and implementation of electronic controller board, intermediate drive electronics stage, microcontroller programming for machining control algorithm, interfacing with graphical user interface based control software and production of necessary mechanical parts. The study has been finalized with experimental work and evaluation of obtained results.

40|$|This project {{examined}} the effects of <b>burning</b> on saw <b>mark</b> characteristics of isolated semi-fleshed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) long bones as a substitute for human remains. Different classes of saws were examined to determine which type of saw mark characteristics are obliterated when burned and which are not. The saw mark characteristics that were examined are superficial false start scratches, false start kerfs, and completely sectioned cuts with breakaway spurs/notches. The long bones were burned at the Boston University School of Medicine using a muffle furnace, at differing temperatures and at differing time increments. The author hypothesized that the higher the temperature and the longer the duration of bone burning, the greater will be the obliterative effect on saw mark characteristics. All samples were examined using a Motic® Digital Light Microscope 12 VDC with a Nikon® MKII Fiber Optic Light attached with accompanying Motic® imaging and measuring software. Distances were measured between striations on complete cuts, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths using the Motic® imaging and measuring software. Images were also taken of the cross sections of the kerf floors. The striations on the kerf walls, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths were compared to the control samples. Measurements taken from false start scratches, false start kerfs, and complete cuts were averaged and compared to the averages from each temperature and the control samples, to assess the degree of shrinkage from thermal alteration. The false start kerf profile shapes were blindly examined and classified into Class A, B, C, or D(following the system of Symes 1992) and compared to the control samples. Kerf flare and blade drift were examined to determine if thermal alteration obliterated those saw mark characteristics. The chainsaw false start kerfs and complete cuts were examined macroscopically to determine what effects thermal alteration had on those types of marks. All thermally altered samples were assessed for color change, heat-related fracturing, and whether or not the saw marks were still visible. The author found that all saw marks made with the mitre saw, crosscut saw, and bow saw were still visible and identifiable, even in a fractured state and, when burned up to 700 °C for one hour. Most of the false start kerf samples were classified into the correct kerf profile shape as outlines in Symes (1992). False start kerfs and complete cuts made with the chainsaw were blindly examined and showed that these marks are distinct and easily identifiable when the bone is completely intact or has very minimal fracturing. The crosscut saw false start scratch and crosscut saw complete cut samples showed signs of shrinkage. The average width of the false start scratch samples burned at 700 °C for one hour was about 50 % smaller than the control sample's average width. The same was true for the complete cut striation widths. Shrinkage did not appear to alter the crosscut saw false start kerf widths or the bow saw false start scratch widths. For all cuts made with the mitre saw shrinkage did appear to alter the samples. Warping did occur where some of the burned averages were larger than the control sample averages. This suggests that some warping did take place by widening the kerf, thus changing the analysis of the saw mark characteristics. Blade drift and kerf flare were seen in the samples and thus were not affected by thermal alteration. The author's hypothesis was not rejected, because in some cases thermal alteration did modify the saw mark characteristic measurements and in some cases thermal alteration did not alter the measurements. Some of the saw marks were affected by shrinkage, while others were not. False start kerf profile shape classification was not affected by thermal alteration. The chainsaw samples were affected most by the thermal alteration, because of the obliterative effects of heat-related fracturing which progressed generally with the greater temperature...|$|R
40|$|Pech-de-l'Azé I {{is part of}} {{a complex}} of Paleolithic sites (Pech I to V) located in the Perigord noir, in the Enea valley, a small {{tributary}} to the Dordogne river. Pech I is located at the entrance of a karstic tube, at the other extremity of which was found Pech-de-l'Aze II (containing “Acheuléen méridional” and middle Paleolithic deposits). Pech IV is located {{at the bottom of the}} same cliff as Pech I, 80 meters away toward the East, and preserved Middle Paleolithic deposits recently excavated by H. Dibble and S. Mc Pherron. Pech-de-l'Azé I is one of the two type-sites for the Mousterian of Acheulian tradition. Only Mousterian of acheulian tradition (MTA) occupations were recognized by R. Vaufrey, F. Bordes and us: one complex of MTA type A occupations at the bottom (layer 4), and then several MTA type B occupations. A juvenile Neandertal skull and mandible was recovered early in twenty century in one of the higher layers. In 1999, we undertook the curation (washing, labeling and organizing by layer) and the analysis of the unpublished material collected during the last excavation done in 1970 - 1971 by F. Bordes (14 942 coordinated remains). We also started limited excavation at the site in 2004 and 2005. We present here the first results of our inter-disciplinary research focusing on site formation processes, zooarcheology, cémentochronologie, lithic and pigment technology, as well as on use-wear analysis. Artefacts, bones and ashes from fire-places had been preserved by numerous blocks fallen from the limestone walls and roof overhang in a clayish sand matrix transported in by run-off. In consequence, and probably also because of a very fast rate of sedimentation at the site, the archaeological remains and features had been quickly fossilized and preservation is good. The size of the shelter was considerably reduced from the first and to the last occupations. Pech I sequence is shorter than the one of Pech II, not because of a massive draining of Pech I as suggested by previous authors, but because of the speed of the backward movement of the shelter higher at Pech I than at Pech II. If they were older occupations at Pech I, they've been redeposited on the hillside. ESR, U/Th and AMS C 14 measurements indicate than the site was occupied right before the arrival of anatomical modern humans in this area of Western Europe, around 45 to 40 000 years ago. Combustions features and possible in-situ fire places with a circular shape covering about 50 cm 2 had been found in the MTA type A layer (layer 4) during 2004 excavation and are under analyses. Micromammals, fish and reptiles remains are well preserved; they were probably mostly accumulated by bird of prey. The density of micromammals remains is not correlated with the density of archaeological material and might be a testimony of longest occupations of the site by hominids at the bottom of the sequence. Preservation of larger bone is also good: less than 30 % of the bones were affected by surface weathering, and less than 8 % of them were rounded. Large mammal remains are dominated by red deer, followed by bison and aurochs, suggesting a forested environment with open grassland during a temperate phase of IOS 3. They were clearly accumulated at the site by hominids as there is an almost complete absence of carnivore bones (except for one red fox tooth), and the number of bones showing carnivore damage is very low (less than 1 %). Additionally, 30 % of the bones show evidence of human activity (including cut-marks, <b>burning,</b> and percussion <b>marks</b> (several quartz and quartzite hammer suitable for bone breakage had been found), which is consistent with an anthropogenic assemblage that was undisturbed by carnivores before deposition. Skinning, dismembering, filleting (?) and marrow extraction (several hammer had been recovered) were done at the site in every layer. Cement analyses had been done on more than 70 % of the NMI of large mammals recovered by Bordes and by us. Going up through the sequence, the season of hunting red-deer and bison got more and more precise: from all around the year in layer 4 to the end of good season only during layer 7. Most of bird bones were accumulated at the site by natural agencies, with the exception of two golden eagle phalanges which show evidence of cut-marks which produced the segmentation of the eagle finger. This is one of the very rare evidence of use of bird bone by Neandertals. Cut-marks were also found on a few beaver bones, behaviour barely documented until now for Neandertals. In 2004, a new Neandertal tooth belonging to another juvenile individual had been receovered. The lithic industry is characterised by scrapers, denticulates, cordiform and triangular bifaces, backed knifes, and elongated blanks. The manufacture of the bifaces is highly standardized across time at the site and at other MTA sites, and is understood a testimony of a specific technical tradition flourishing in Périgord around 50 000 years ago. In the MTA type A layer 4, bifaces are numerous and are a testimony of the interest of these Neanderthals groups for stone-tools suitable for travel as these bifaces were multifunctional, resharpenable and flake producer tools, as evidenced by techno-functionnal and use-wear analysis. Pech I was used to manufacture stone-tools; a number of them certainly being exported out of the site. Yet, even in a setting where raw material is abundant, lithic artefacts (and especially bifaces) had been imported at the site in layer 4. Stone-tools types are numerous in layer 4, and evidence of hafting are available for some of them. Also, an incredible collection of black pigments (more than 450), among which half of them show clear traces of use, were recovered in layer 4. The density of material is much lower in the upper layers 6 and 7 (MTA type B). Only small number of lithic had been imported at the site, and evidence of fragmentation and long-term planning of lithic production are scarce, as always recorded at other MTA type B sites. Bifaces are almost absent in these MTA type B assemblages, as well as evidence for hafting and evidence of use of pigments. Every available line of evidence, including cementochronology, is then pointing toward shorted occupation of the site during the deposition of the upper MTA type B layers, layer 6 and 7, and longer occupations of the site in layer 4. This is not surprising, considering that the size of the rock-shelter is strongly reducing from the bottom layer to the upper layer. MTA type B had always been found in stratigraphy underneath MTA type A. At Pech I, climate does not seem to vary much from MTA type A to B, as fauna spectrum stays the same across the sequence. Available radiometric measurement do not allow to separate in time these two episodes. Technological analyses of other MTA sites had shown that this tendency to manufacture tool designed for travelling is strong only during the MTA type A. And, MTA type A assemblages show more evidence of long-term planning than MTA type B assemblages. Behavioural changes from MTA A to MTA B at Pech I might be related to changes in Neandertals mobility patterns, from a logistical pattern to one that is more residential in a smaller and smaller territory. Yet, change in the use of caves, the only type of setting used in our analysis, might also have played a role; caves being used as base camps during the MTA type A and no more during the MTA type B. Yet, MTA type B open air assemblages are still to be discovered. The interdisciplinary analyses of Pech I is still on going. We hope to provide in the near future a detailed analysis from as many points of view as possible to provide precise understanding of the behaviour of some of the last Neandertals group right before the arrival of anatomical modern Humans in that aera of Western Europe. Pech-de-l'Azé I fait partie d'un complexe de gisements paléolithiques mis en valeur en particulier par les travaux de F. Bordes des années cinquante aux années soixante-dix. Ce gisement en entrée de grotte conserve plusieurs niveaux attribuables au Moustérien de tradition acheuléenne qui ont livré notamment le crâne et la mandibule d'un enfant néandertalien et un ensemble de minéraux colorants sans équivalents connus en contexte moustérien (plus de 250 blocs de dioxyde de manganèse utilisés). En 1999, nous avons entrepris l'analyse du matériel issu des fouilles menées par F. Bordes en 1970 - 1971 resté jusqu'à présent inédit (14 942 pièces ont ainsi été lavées, marquées, classées par niveau et inventoriées), puis nous avons repris des fouilles programmées en 2004 et 2005. Nous pouvons désormais préciser les processus de formation du gisement et le degré de préservation des témoins archéologiques. Une approche interdisciplinaire (analyse des micromammifères, archéozoologie des mammifères et des oiseaux, cémentochronologie des grands mammifères, anthropologie physique, technologie des industries lithiques en silex et autres matériaux, études fonctionnelles des silex et des colorants) nous permet dès à présent de discuter certains des comportements des Néandertaliens qui ont occupé le Pech-de-l'Azé I lors du stade isotopique 3 et leur variabilité au cours du temps...|$|R
