500|$|Like most of Moore's work {{completed}} after 1954, {{this was a}} modeled sculpture instead of a direct carving. The sculpture is composed of two bronze semicircles, one set inside and {{at right angles to}} the other and a slim bronze rod that extends {{from one end of the}} outer semicircle to the other that serves as the gnomon (indicator). [...] The bowstring equatorial sundial derives its name from the appearance of the shadow-casting gnomon, which resembles a <b>bow</b> <b>string.</b> The shadow of the rod projects onto the inner semicircle, which serves as the dial face (or dial plate), to mark the time of day when there is sufficient sunlight to produce shadows.|$|E

Two of the arrows, which were broken, were tipped with flint and had fletching (stabilizing fins), {{while the other}} 12 were unfinished and untipped.

50|$|The <b>bowed</b> <b>string</b> {{model is}} a {{physical}} model of the scraping of a <b>bow</b> across a <b>string</b> on a stringed instrument such as the cello. Programmable parameters include bow speed and bow pressure. The <b>bowed</b> <b>string</b> model emulates various elements of a <b>bowed</b> <b>string</b> sound, such as attack harmonics, providing a more detailed sound than a typical sample-based synthesizer would normally be capable of.|$|R
40|$|As the {{underlying}} physical processes of <b>bowed</b> <b>string</b> instruments {{have been investigated}} extensively and are understood well, {{it becomes clear that}} the instrument model on its own is not sufficient for realistic synthesis of <b>bowed</b> <b>strings.</b> Controlling the parameters for the excitation of the string model is comparable to playing the real instrument, and the design of algorithms controlling the artificial instrument is as much of a challenge for the technician as playing the real instrument for a musician. We describe a method for the generation of control parameters for a <b>bowed</b> <b>string</b> model from MIDI input using a simple model for the playing dynamics. This player modeling and the use of waveguide models for <b>bowed</b> <b>strings</b> with nonlinear excitation functions contributes to an naturally sounding <b>bowed</b> <b>string</b> synthesis...|$|R
2500|$|The {{payment for}} a {{crossbow}} mercenary {{was higher than}} for a longbow mercenary, but the longbowman {{did not have to}} pay a team of assistants and his equipment was cheaper. Thus the crossbow team was twelve percent less efficient than the longbowman since three of the latter could be part of the army in place of one crossbow team. Furthermore, the prod and <b>bow</b> <b>string</b> of a composite crossbow were subject to damage in rain whereas the longbowman could simply unstring his bow to protect the string. French forces employing the composite crossbow were outmatched by English longbowmen at Crécy in 1346, at Poitiers in 1356 and at Agincourt in 1415. As a result, use of the crossbow declined sharply in France, and the French authorities made attempts to train longbowmen of their own. After the conclusion of the Hundred Years' War, however, the French largely abandoned the use of the longbow, and consequently the military crossbow saw a resurgence in popularity. The crossbow continued to see use in French armies by both infantry and mounted troops until as late as 1520 when, as with elsewhere in continental Europe, the crossbow would be largely eclipsed by the handgun. Spanish forces in the New World would make extensive use of the crossbow, even after it had largely fallen out of use in Europe. [...] Crossbowmen participated in Hernán Cortés' conquest of Mexico and accompanied Francisco Pizarro on his initial expedition to Peru, though {{by the time of the}} conquest of Peru in 1532-1523 he would have only a dozen such men remaining in his service.|$|E

6000|$|The true {{story of}} the sin of the Sultan he is always trying, by {{listening}} to these stories, to forget. As we have said before in this chapter, he {{would prefer not to}} remember, because he has made up his mind not to repent. It is a curious story, and I shall try to tell it truly in the two chapters that follow. In all ages the tyrant is hard because he is soft. If his car crashes over bleeding and accusing crowds, it is because he has chosen the path of least resistance. It is because {{it is much easier to}} ride down a human race than ride up a moderately steep hill. The fight of the oppressor is always a pillow-fight; commonly a war with cushions--always a war for cushions. Saladin, the great Sultan, if I remember rightly, accounted it the greatest feat of swordsmanship to cut a cushion. And so indeed it is, as all of us can attest who have been for years past trying to cut into the swollen and windy corpulence of the modern compromise, that is at once cosy and cruel. For there is really in our world to-day the colour and silence of the cushioned divan; and that sense of palace within palace and garden within garden which makes the rich irresponsibility of the East. Have we not already the wordless dance, the wineless banquet, and all that strange unchristian conception of luxury without laughter? Are we not already in an evil Arabian Nights, and walking the nightmare cities of an invisible despot? Does not our hangman strangle secretly, the bearer of the <b>bow</b> <b>string?</b> Are we not already eugenists--that is, eunuch-makers? Do we not see the bright eyes, the motionless faces, and all that presence of something that is dead and yet sleepless? It is the presence of the sin that is sealed with pride and impenitence; the story of how the Sultan got his throne. But it is not the story he is listening to just now, but another story which has been invented to cover it--the story called [...] "Eugenius: or the Adventures of One Not Born," [...] a most varied and entrancing tale, which never fails to send him to sleep.|$|E
