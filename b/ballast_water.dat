5|$|C.maenas has {{the ability}} to {{disperse}} by a variety of mechanisms, including <b>ballast</b> <b>water,</b> ships' hulls, packing materials (seaweeds) used to ship live marine organisms, bivalves moved for aquaculture, rafting, migration of crab larvae on ocean currents, and the movement of submerged aquatic vegetation for coastal zone management initiatives. Thresher et al. found C.maenas dispersed in Australia mainly by rare long-distance events, possibly caused by human actions.|$|E
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding <b>ballast</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{detected}} in New Zealand {{in the port}} of Timaru, South Island in 2002. This was the first incident of C.mutica being reported in the southern hemisphere. Since then, more well-established populations of C.mutica {{have been found in}} Port Lyttelton in 2006, and in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington Harbour in 2007. Additional specimens were also recovered from the hulls of vessels in other ports, though they did not seem to have established colonies in the ports themselves. Genetic studies of the New Zealand populations suggests a possibility that these were secondarily introduced from non-native populations of C.mutica in the Atlantic through <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> in the sea chests of international shipping.|$|E

5|$|The {{pelagic zone}} {{contains}} macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. Most {{of the smallest}} organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized fish and other nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to {{other regions of the}} ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling community on the hulls of vessels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ballast</b> <b>water</b> onboard the CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin {{is treated}} {{directly}} when pumped {{on board and}} again during ballast operations. The <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> is filtered and passed under UV lamps in order to detect any living organisms. These living organisms are then killed {{in order to prevent}} these species from invading natural habitats. There are no chemical products ejected back into the sea with the Benjamin Franklin’s ballast system.|$|E

50|$|A {{common type}} of ballast for small boats that avoids many of the {{problems}} of high-density <b>ballast</b> is <b>water</b> <b>ballast.</b> While it seems counter-intuitive that placing water in the hull (which is, after all, close to the same density as the water outside the hull- fresh vs salt water) would add any stability, adding <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> below the vertical center of gravity increases stability. The <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> {{does not need to be}} lifted above the waterline to affect stability, as any material having greater bulk density than air will have an effect on the centre of gravity. It is the relationship between centre of gravity and centre of buoyancy that dictates the righting moment.|$|R
50|$|Croatian Coast Guard (Obalna straža Republike Hrvatske) is a {{division}} of the Croatian Navy responsible for protecting interests of the Republic of Croatia at sea. The Croatian Navy is composed of classical naval forces structured into a flotilla and the Coast Guard that solely consists of ships with peacetime duties, e.g. protection of ecology, fishing, control of tankers, <b>ballast</b> <b>waters,</b> combat against terrorism, trafficking of people, narcotics and similar.|$|R

25|$|All {{international}} going ships {{under the}} Convention must implement a ‘Ballast water management plan’ {{that enables the}} ship to manage their <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> and sediment discharge to a certain standard. The plan is {{designed to meet the}} requirements for compliance with the Convention and the G4 Guidelines produced by the IMO. It includes standard operational guidance, planning and management, as well as additional details including sampling points and systems. Additionally all ships over 400GT must also carry a <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> record book that details such requirements as the filling and discharge of each tank, according to time, date, location and the treatment applied to the water.|$|E
25|$|The caisson lock can however be powered, and the caisson lifted, by {{buoyancy}} alone. Pumping <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> {{in and out}} of the caisson {{is enough}} to float it up or down the lock chamber. The weight of <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> is approximately that of the canal barge being lifted. The boat lift though needs a mechanical lift system. In most vertical lift systems, this must also lift or lower the weight of the caisson and its water contents as well. This is substantially more than the barge alone, and the power to lift it is supplied mechanically. At the time of their development, the steam engine was in its infancy. Steam engines had been developed as water pumps, but not yet for the supply of mechanical power (see rotative steam engine). Given the engineering constraints of the time, lifting an enclosed caisson by buoyancy was more practical than driving a boat lift.|$|E

He developed a new animal feed, potentially a new human food source, by developing a process for cultivating fungi on corn processing leftovers being commercialized. His ozonation process disinfestates ships' <b>ballast</b> <b>waters</b> of feral species to avoid introduction into coastal waters by shipping and has been applied on oil tankers.|$|R

25|$|<b>Water</b> <b>ballast</b> {{tanks were}} fitted to {{each end of}} the vessel which enabled her to be trimmed to any desired draught. There were also large <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> tanks in the holds in order for {{trimming}} the vessel in rough weather.|$|R
25|$|Oil spills are {{probably}} the most emotive of marine pollution events. However, while a tanker wreck may result in extensive newspaper headlines, much of the oil in the world's seas comes from other smaller sources, such as tankers discharging <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> from oil tanks used on return ships, leaking pipelines or engine oil disposed of down sewers.|$|E
25|$|Then in 1970 another oyster started {{outgrowing}} {{the native}} rock oyster. This newcomer was the Pacific oyster, which {{had probably been}} introduced into New Zealand waters in the 1950s from a Japanese vessel hull or in their <b>ballast</b> <b>water.</b> At first, farmers tried to remove it from their collecting sticks, but year by year Pacific oyster spat increased, out-competing the native rock oyster.|$|E
25|$|During further stormy weather, {{the ship}} was pushed onto the beach {{so that it was}} almost {{parallel}} to the beach, and both bow and stern were stuck on the sand. The whole ship was then completely trapped between the beach and a rocky reef. In the first week the salvage crew loaded the ship with <b>ballast</b> <b>water,</b> which sunk it lower, so that its hull was firmly on the seabed.|$|E
40|$|In December 2014 {{the adult}} females and copepodites of alien paracalanid copepod Parvocalanus crassirostris were {{identified}} in the Central Adriatic port of Šibenik. The most probable transmission vector for this small copepod were <b>ballast</b> <b>waters</b> from the cargo ships that are regularly discharged at these locations. This paper is focused on P. crassirostris morphology {{and the state of}} population in the port of Šibenik. The possible path of introduction of Parvocalanus crassirostris into the Adriatic Sea is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{competition}} gliders carry jettisonable <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> (in {{the wings}} and sometimes in the vertical stabilizer). The extra weight provided by the <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> is advantageous if the lift {{is likely to be}} strong, and may also be used to adjust the glider's center of mass. Moving the center of mass toward the rear by carrying water in the vertical stabilizer reduces the required down-force from the horizontal stabilizer and the resultant drag from that down-force. Although heavier gliders have a slight disadvantage when climbing in rising air, they achieve a higher speed at any given glide angle. This is an advantage in strong conditions when the gliders spend only a small amount of time climbing in thermals. The pilot can jettison the <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> before it becomes a disadvantage in weaker thermal conditions. Another use of <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> is to dampen air turbulence such as might be encountered during ridge soaring. To avoid undue stress on the airframe, gliders must jettison any <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> before landing.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{non-native}} amphipod Grandidierella japonica Stephensen, 1938 {{is reported}} {{for the first time}} on the Atlantic coast of mainland Europe, specifically from Marennes-Oléron Bay, France. Likely vectors for this introduction include commercial shellfish transplants and <b>ballast</b> <b>waters.</b> A native of Japan, this species had previously only been reported twice outside the Pacific region; in both cases from coastal waters of England. Adults of both sexes, females carrying eggs, and juveniles were collected in Marennes-Oléron Bay, which suggests the species has become established...|$|R
25|$|The mussels were {{initially}} {{brought to the}} United States through the <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> of ships entering the Great Lakes. These aquatic invaders soon spread to many bodies {{of water in the}} Eastern United States and have even {{made their way to the}} western United States. In January 2008, Zebra mussels have been detected in several reservoirs along the Colorado River system such as Lakes Mead, Mojave, and Havasu.|$|E
25|$|As {{the wind}} shifts {{direction}} and changes the loads on the turbine and foundation, a secondary hull-trim system shifts <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> between {{each of the}} three columns. This permits the platform to maintain even keel while producing the maximum amount of energy. This is in contrast to other floating concepts which have implemented control strategies that de-power the turbine to compensate for changes in turbine thrust-induced overturning moment.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} predatory copepods exist {{throughout}} the Delta, about which relatively little is known. Sinocalanus doerri, Acartiella sinensis, and Tortanus dextrilobatus all {{appear to be}} morphologically capable of predation upon other copepods. Each {{was introduced to the}} estuary, probably through <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> exchange since the 1980s. Generally, they are not in sufficient abundance to negatively impact copepod consumers; however, periodic blooms of S. doerri and A. sinensis occur which have not been well studied.|$|E
40|$|An {{individual}} {{belonging to}} the eunicid polychaete species Marphysa disjuncta Hartman, 1961 was collected on muddy substratum at 100 m deep in Fethiye Bay (Levantine Sea, eastern Mediterranean). This species is new to the Mediterranean fauna. It closely resembles to Marphysa bellii, a native species, but it lacks compound falcigers and has unidentate subacicular hooks. This species was only reported from the eastern and western Pacific Ocean and could have been introduced to the Mediterranean Sea via <b>ballast</b> <b>waters</b> of vessels...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{invasive}} oriental shrimp Palaemon macrodactylus Rathbun, 1902 has considerably {{extended its}} distribution in transitional waters along the Atlantic and Channel coasts of France {{during the period}} 2007 - 2010. The most probable method of a primary introduction of this species is <b>ballast</b> <b>waters,</b> but passive transport by water currents is also a possible mechanism of colonization (secondary introductions). Palaemon macrodactylus is a powerful invader of transitional waters and these new populations should be monitored {{in the future to}} assess any consequences to native species...|$|R

Four alien fish parasites have been recorded in Polish coastal lakes and lagoons, all parasitising eels. Three were introduced with the final host - the Japanese eel - introduced for aquaculture (Anguillicola crassus, Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae and Pseudodactylogyrus bini) and one (Paratenuisentis ambiguus) with its sole intermediate host (Gammarus tigrinus) ...|$|R
25|$|When larger ships such as {{cargo ships}} and tankers capsize or sink {{not only is}} {{recovery}} not possible but great environment damage can occur from spillage of cargo.

25|$|As {{the cargo}} {{is carried on}} the main deck, the barges have {{considerable}} tank capacity belowdecks. In addition to 12,413.75 m3 of <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> in the side tanks and 12,304 m3 of void space {{in the middle of}} the barge there are tanks for 592.66 m3 of heavy fuel oil that can be used to replenish the fuel tanks of the pusher, 82.05 m3 of marine diesel oil for the pusher's auxiliary engines and the barge's own generator and 82.05 m3 of freshwater.|$|E
25|$|However, on April 5, the Coast Guard {{stated that}} filling the empty tanks with <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> was not possible, {{because it would}} create a {{hazardous}} waste that the neither the facility nor the Coast Guard was {{prepared to deal with}} afterward. Instead, the oil was removed and the empty tanks remained vulnerable to damage from further flooding. In the meantime, oil production in Cook Inlet was suspended, because the tank farms were out of commission while Mount Redoubt remained in an eruptive state.|$|E
50|$|In view {{of these}} safety and cost-related arguments, the Standard Class rules were updated to allow {{disposable}} <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> and retractable undercarriages.
