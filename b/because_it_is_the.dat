5|$|The Elmer S. Dailey is {{historically}} significant <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only known surviving Erie Canal boat {{and is one}} of a few remaining wooden-hulled canal boats. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978. It and the other two barges that sank with it are the only shipwrecks in Connecticut listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|The duality {{represents}} a major advance {{in our understanding}} of string theory and quantum gravity. This is because it provides a non-perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most successful realization of the holographic principle, an idea in quantum gravity originally proposed by Gerard 't Hooft and promoted by Leonard Susskind.|$|E
5|$|Uranium-235 is {{important}} for both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only uranium isotope existing in nature on Earth in any significant amount that is fissile. This means {{that it can be}} split into two or three fragments (fission products) by thermal neutrons.|$|E

50|$|Those {{who oppose}} the theory that he was Samuel's {{grandson}} and believe he was merely a local Bulgarian claim that he was proclaimed as tsar in Belgrade not <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first border town between the Byzantine Empire and Hungary that he reached when he joined them as a prince of royal blood, but merely <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first important town that the rebels captured.|$|R
5|$|A {{large amount}} of lakes and rivers {{are found in the}} Eurasian Economic Union. Major lakes include Ladoga and Onega, two of the largest lakes in Europe. The largest and most {{prominent}} of the union's bodies of fresh water is Lake Baikal, the world's deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious fresh water lake. The Baikal lake alone contains over one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water. Russia is second only to Brazil in volume of the total renewable water resources. Of the union's numerous rivers, the Volga is the most famous, not only <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> longest in Europe, but also because of its major role in history. In Siberia the Ob, Yenisey, Lena and Amur are among the longest rivers in the world.|$|E
5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean was {{the first}} film {{released}} under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA; one executive noted that she found the film too intense for her five-year-old child. Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough to add The Curse of the Black Pearl subtitle to the film in case sequels were made, and to attract older children. Verbinski disliked the new title <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Aztec gold rather than the ship that is cursed, so he requested the title to be unreadable on the poster.|$|E
5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only enzyme {{that is part of}} both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E
5000|$|The {{social justice}} model evolved next and {{extended}} {{the idea that}} individuals outside of the dominant group should be given opportunities within the workplace, not only <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> law, but <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> right thing to do. This model still revolved around the idea of tokenism, but it also brought {{in the notion of}} hiring based on a [...] "good fit".|$|R

5|$|The Manasollasa {{has been}} called an {{important}} source on socio-cultural history of medieval India, particularly {{for the history of}} food, drinks and cuisines and of sports. Mandakranta Bose, a professor on South Asian studies, describes the text to be of great interest <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> earliest known text with details on dance genres in India. A team consisting of Bruno Nettl, a professor of music and anthropology, has called Manasollasa an enormous treatise with large sections on music, dance and other performance arts.|$|E
5|$|The St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame is a {{professional}} wrestling hall of fame. After several years of debating {{the idea of creating}} the Hall of Fame, former owner and promoter of the St. Louis Wrestling Club Larry Matysik opened it in 2007. He was joined in this effort by promoter Herb Simmons, SBAC Member Tony Casta, sports journalist Keith Schildroth, and longtime fan Nick Ridenour. Although these directors oversee the selection process, the St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame is unique <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only wrestling hall of fame that allows fans to vote for potential inductees.|$|E
5|$|The case {{is often}} {{referred}} to as Oneida II <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> second of three times the Oneida Indian Nation reached the Supreme Court in litigating its land rights claims. It followed Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (Oneida I) (1974), holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction, and was followed by City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), rejecting the tribe's attempt in a later lawsuit to re-assert tribal sovereignty over parcels of land re-acquired by the tribe in fee simple.|$|E

5|$|The {{document}} today {{exists only}} in a 17th-century transcript by the antiquarian William Dugdale. The Boulogne agreement was largely unknown to modern historians up until the 1960s, but it is now considered significant <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first documented expression of the conflict between king and nobility, which was to dominate {{so much of the}} reign of Edward II. Though historians agree on the document's importance, there is still disagreement over its interpretation, particularly whether the signatories should be seen as oppositional or loyal to the king.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{methods for}} different isotopes vary, and only those for promethium-147 are given <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 {{is produced in}} large quantities (compared to other isotopes) by bombarding uranium-235 with thermal neutrons. The output is relatively high, at 2.6% of the total product. Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium-146 with thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator. Another method is to bombard uranium-238 with fast neutrons to cause fast fission, which, among multiple reaction products, creates promethium-147.|$|E
5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E

5|$|It {{belonged to}} Señora O. Yturbe of Madrid, who sold it in 1930 to Franz M. Zatzenstein, {{founder of the}} Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin. That April, the Duveen Brothers, less {{affected}} by the 1929 stock market crash than other dealers, paid Zatzenstein £30,000, in cash, for the painting and sold it immediately to Mellon. A dealer usually {{had to go through}} the lengthy process of sending photographs of a painting via trans-Atlantic ship to an American buyer and then wait for a reply; the transaction for the Nativity is exceptional <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first painting of which the photograph was wired via Marconi cable from England to America. To avoid the export fees due if the painting been sent directly to New York, the Duveens took a circuitous route– from Madrid to Germany, then to Paris and America. In 1936 it was acquired by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, and gifted to the National Gallery a year later.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) is {{depressed}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first Valentine's Day {{since he}} and Holly broke up. Michael donates blood at a mobile blood drive {{being held in}} the business park's parking lot and has a nice conversation with a female donor (Kathryn Aselton) sitting next to him. When they both finish at the same time, Michael passes out {{because he did not}} eat much before giving blood, and when he wakes up she is gone. A disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it, hoping she will come back for it. When Michael goes back into the office, he decides to gather all the single employees into the conference room to discuss their own personal romantic dilemmas. After becoming further depressed by their sad dating stories, Michael decides to try lifting their spirits by holding a singles mixer. He puts up flyers which also advertise the finding of a missing glove, and Michael hopes his mystery woman will come to the party as a result.|$|E
5|$|Mushishi {{opens with}} Yoki {{and his mother}} walking along a {{mountain}} when a cliff suddenly collapses. This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)—an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes and the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only name he can remember.|$|E

5|$|William {{wrote an}} account of the Lateran Council and a history of the Islamic states from the time of Muhammad. Neither work survives. He is famous today as the author of a history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. William {{composed}} his chronicle in excellent Latin for his time, with numerous quotations from classical literature. The chronicle is sometimes given the title Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum ("History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea") or Historia Ierosolimitana ("History of Jerusalem"), or the Historia for short. It was translated into French soon after his death, and thereafter into numerous other languages. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only source for the history of twelfth-century Jerusalem written by a native, historians have often assumed that William's statements could be taken at face value. However, more recent historians have shown that William's involvement in the kingdom's political disputes resulted in detectable biases in his account. Despite this, he is considered the greatest chronicler of the crusades, {{and one of the best}} authors of the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|The Holy Scripture is not {{identical}} with divine revelation, but {{a part of}} it. Scriptures were written later by apostles and evangelists, who knew Jesus. They give infallible testimony of his teachings. Scripture thus belongs to Tradition in the larger sense, where it has an absolute priority, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Word of God, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> unchangeable testimony of the apostles of Christ, whose fullness the Church preserves with its tradition.|$|E
