5|$|Under ideal observing conditions, some hint of {{nebulosity}} {{may be seen}} {{around the}} cluster, and this shows up in long-exposure photographs. It is a reflection nebula, caused by dust reflecting the <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> of the hot, young stars.|$|E
25|$|Only {{emergency}} and police vehicle may use <b>blue</b> <b>lights.</b> This includes firefighters, rescue services, emergency response vehicles for public utilities and civil defense units. All {{other kinds of}} <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> (e.g. car floor lighting or cab interior lights) are illegal on public roads. Flashing <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> and sirens may only be used by authorized vehicles in case of {{emergency and}} order all other vehicles to make way, since these vehicles have the absolute right of way. <b>Blue</b> <b>lights</b> alone {{may be used to}} secure the site of an accident (or a standing emergency vehicle). Sometimes, columns of emergency or police vehicles use <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> (without sirens) to make the column more visible to other vehicles.|$|R

5|$|Incandescent {{lights are}} filled with argon, to {{preserve}} the filaments at high temperature from oxidation. It {{is used for the}} specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics.

5|$|Italian {{ships of}} Mussolini's navy {{retained}} its pre-war scheme of light gray overall for its smaller ships, but the larger units mostly had dazzle camouflage of dark gray, light sea <b>blue,</b> <b>light</b> sea green and light gray. Italian foredecks had a high-visibility pattern {{of red and}} white diagonal stripes so that their own aircraft would not attack them.|$|E
5|$|The sea-firefly {{is a small}} {{crustacean}} {{living in}} sediment. At rest it emits a dull glow but when disturbed it darts away leaving a cloud of shimmering <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> to confuse the predator.

25|$|Blue Police {{vehicles}}, medical {{vehicles and}} fire engines use white along with dark ‘Euro blue’ to improve visibility during daylight hours. <b>Blue</b> <b>lights</b> are also {{allowed to be}} used on vehicles of “vital importance to the community”. This means response vehicles from gas companies and electrical companies may use <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> and sirens, vehicles use by railroad/tram/metro fast response units including private tow operators that are contracted to lift trams, vehicles of the Swedish Military Police and vehicles of the Swedish Customs Service. Vehicles that transport blood or donor organs may also use <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> and sirens. Cars carrying armed security officers (tasked with protecting embassies, airports and government buildings) may use <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> and sirens if responding to an alarm.|$|R
25|$|In New York State, {{forward facing}} <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> are not {{permitted}} on any emergency vehicles, an anomaly in the US.

5|$|X-ray {{observations}} by the Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed six {{sources in}} the HDF, which were found to correspond to three elliptical galaxies: one spiral galaxy, one active galactic nucleus and one extremely red object, {{thought to be a}} distant galaxy containing a large amount of dust absorbing its <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> emissions.|$|E
5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale <b>blue</b> <b>light,</b> which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E

5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{originally}} {{supposed that}} the entire trans-Neptunian population would show a similar red surface colour, as they were thought to have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to have large amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the Sun. This would absorb <b>blue</b> <b>light,</b> creating a reddish hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a white or greyish appearance.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{north of}} the block, a glass column is sited in a {{reflecting}} pool. The column is internally illuminated by fibre optic cables with a faint <b>blue</b> <b>light,</b> symbolising the blue lamp which traditionally hangs outside police stations in the United Kingdom. The column is intended to screen the vitrine from passing traffic on The Mall. The column is 7.4m high, consisting of 622 stacked sheets of glass (a total surface area of 954m2), weighing 28.6 tonnes.|$|E

5|$|In the end, four {{broadband}} filters were chosen, centred at wavelengths of 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450nm (<b>blue</b> <b>light),</b> 606nm (red light) and 814nm (near-infrared). Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E
5|$|Many adult dragonflies have {{brilliant}} iridescent or metallic colours {{produced by}} structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. Their overall coloration {{is often a}} combination of yellow, red, brown, and black pigments, with structural colours. Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect <b>blue</b> <b>light.</b> Greens often combine a structural blue with a yellow pigment. Freshly emerged adults, known as tenerals, are often pale-coloured and obtain their typical colours after a few days, some have their bodies covered with a pale blue, waxy powderiness called pruinosity; it wears off when scraped during mating, leaving darker areas.|$|E
5|$|Selective mirrors {{to create}} {{interference}} effects are formed of micron-sized bowl-shaped pits lined with {{multiple layers of}} chitin in the wing scales of Papilio palinurus, the emerald swallowtail butterfly. These act as highly selective mirrors for two wavelengths of light. Yellow light is reflected directly from the centres of the pits; <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> is reflected twice by {{the sides of the}} pits. The combination appears green, but can be seen as an array of yellow spots surrounded by blue circles under a microscope.|$|E

40|$|Red {{warning lights}} {{delineate}} the runway approach with additional <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> juxtaposed {{with the red}} lights such that the red lights are chromatically balanced. The red/blue point light sources result in the phenomenon that the red lights appear {{in front of the}} <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> with about one and one-half times the diameter of the blue. To a pilot observing these lights along a glide path, those red lights directly below appear to be nearer than the <b>blue</b> <b>lights.</b> For those lights farther away seen in perspective at oblique angles, the red lights appear {{to be in a position}} closer to the pilot and hence appear to be above the corresponding <b>blue</b> <b>lights.</b> This produces a very pronounced three dimensional effect referred to as chromostereopsis which provides valuable visual cues to enable the pilot to perceive his actual position above the ground and the actual distance to the runway...|$|R

5|$|The marine hatchetfish is {{extremely}} flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, {{and the body}} is so silvery as to resemble aluminium foil. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures {{similar to those used}} to provide structural coloration: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of guanine spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.|$|E
5|$|An hour later, having {{endured the}} fire of the guns on both shores, Aigle was in a {{position}} to attack the rear-most frigate of the pair as they emerged from the western side of the island. This frigate sought the shelter of Groix' batteries, so Aigle set off in pursuit of the other which was now making for Lorient. As it was now dark, Aigle displayed a <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> to indicate her position to the closing Impétueux, and at 21:00, coming within 50 yards, exchanged fire with the Frenchman. To prevent a boarding, which Wolfe was determined upon, the frigate came about and, shortly after the British had broken off their attack for lack of sea room, ran aground on the Pointe de Chats on the eastern edge of Groix.|$|E
5|$|The data {{processing}} yielded four monochrome images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. One image was designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and <b>blue</b> <b>light,</b> the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.|$|E
