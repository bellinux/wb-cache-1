40|$|<b>Bacon</b> <b>pigs</b> {{were fed}} diets {{containing}} 300 and 500 ppb aflatoxin B 1 + B 2 {{during a long}} period (120 — 231 days). When organs and tissues were examined for residues, sizable amounts of aflatoxin (max. 54 ppb) were detected. Since macroscopic alterations were slight in livers and absent in other organs and tissues, most livers and all other organs and carcasses could have passed meat inspection and been distributed for human consumption. This calls for careful control of animal feed, {{in order to avoid}} the use of heavily contaminated batches. Information on aflatoxin residues in food of animal origin has so far been restricted to the excretion of aflatoxins, including aflatoxin M, in the milk of lactating animals. Purchase 1 has recently reviewed this aspect extensively. Although aflatoxin has been found in liver and kidney of small laboratory animals after a single dose of aflatoxin, attempts to detect aflatoxin in organs and carcasses of farm animals have mainly been unsuccessful.

40|$|Scholars {{have long}} debated {{whether there was}} enough food in Ireland to feed the {{population}} during the Great Irish Famine; there has been less detailed examination of high-frequency data to understand how markets distributed food after the harvests failed. This article explores a hitherto unused weekly price and quantity data set from the Cork city markets to analyse how markets may have hindered the distribution of available food from 1846 to 1849. Although, historically, economists have long suspected that raw data {{on the market for}} potatoes during the Irish Famine behaved like that for a classical ‘Giffen’ good, there is little evidence for this among foodstuffs available throughout the crisis in Cork. But <b>bacon</b> <b>pigs</b> – a food that never reached a stable equilibrium but completely disappeared from the market in 1847 – exhibited some characteristics which do not appear to accord with the classical law of demand. Further analysis of this data suggests that middle-class purchasing power outbid the poorest people in Ireland {{at a time when there}} was a surplus of superior foods and a deficiency of inferior foods. These circumstances indicate that unusual market behaviour may have made the crop failure’s redistributive consequences – as well as its mortality toll – much worse.

Subsidies or price insurance schemes were created for sugar beet, wheat, cattle, dairy and sheep. The Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marketing) Act 1928 promoted the standardisation of grades and packaging and introduced the [...] "National Mark", a trade mark denoting home-produced food of a defined quality for eggs, beef, apples and pears. The Agricultural Marketing Acts of 1931 and 1933 sought to organise farmers into co-operative marketing associations and created Marketing Boards for <b>bacon,</b> <b>pigs,</b> hops, milk and potatoes. The Import Duties Act 1932 introduced a tariff on most imports including {{fruit and vegetables}} and quotas on imports of bacon, ham and other meat products. In 1936, the title rent charge was abolished, compensation paid to the Church and the money recovered from farmers over a 60-year period. In 1937, a scheme was introduce to subsidise the spread of lime on agricultural land to boost the fertility of the soil. The Minister of Agriculture was given powers to regulate the cultivation and management of land, end tenancies, even take possession of land, under the Defence of the Realm regulations. On 1 September 1939, much of these powers were delegated to County War Agricultural Executive Committees ("War Ags").|$|R

40|$|A {{serological}} {{survey of}} pig sera from six regional areas throughout New Zealand indicated that 60 % had titres to Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona and 13 % to serovar tarassovi. Pig sera from the North Island districts had higher titres to pomona {{than those from}} the South Island districts, however the converse was true for titres to tarassovi. A serological survey of <b>bacon</b> weight <b>pigs</b> at slaughter revealed that 60 % had titres to pomona, 53 % to bratislava, while titres to tarassovi were undetectable. There was no significant linear association between the magnitude of corresponding pomona and bratislava titres. Pomona was isolated from 53 % of pigs kidneys, however attempts to isolate bratislava were unsuccessful. The median prevalence of infection in <b>bacon</b> <b>pigs</b> from farms with endemic pomona infection, {{at the time of}} slaughter was 80 %. A retrospective study of farming practices revealed that vaccination of breeding pigs had no effect on the infection status of their grower pigs at slaughter. It was also found that farms which reared their grower pigs to pork weight for slaughter were free of leptospiral infection, as were farms with less than fifty breeding sows. Cross sectional serological and cultural prevalence studies of grower pigs on farms with endemic pomona infection revealed that pigs less than ten weeks of age were not leptospiruric and had low or undetectable titres to pomona. Pigs between ten and twenty weeks of age showed an increasing prevalence of both leptospiruria and pomona titres. Further prospective studies indicated that piglets acquire passive immunity from their dams, which has a half life of around sixteen days. The majority of pigs less than fourteen weeks of age appear to be resistant to infection, thereafter the level of their passive immunity wanes and they become infected and leptospiruric. The weekly incidence of leptospiruria for pigs in an infected grower house was usually between 10 % and 20 %. Following infection, the intensity of leptospiruria was greatest in the first three to four weeks and it lasted for at least six weeks. Infection is believed to occur by both direct and indirect transmission of leptospires between infected and susceptible pigs. It was shown that grower pigs are at the centre of the endemic cycle of infection which is perpetuated by the transmission of infection from older infected pigs to younger susceptible pigs. This cycle of endemic infection can persist independently of the breeding herd. Experimental evidence following the artificial exposure of grower pigs to either serovar pomona or bratislava supported an hypothesis that the occurrence of bratislava titres were associated with early infection of pigs with serovar pomona. The heterologous titres were believed to be a serological cross reaction with homologous IgM antibody to which pigs had been exposed. Experimental evidence demonstrated that leptospires could survive in droplets of less than 50 um, however hamsters exposed to a leptospiral aerosol containing droplets of less than 50 um failed to become infected. Infection via the intranasal route in both hamsters and pigs showed that the infective dose of pomona was between 104 and 106 leptospires, indicating the intranasal route as a natural route for infection. Transmission of infection could therefore occur directly by infective droplets lodging in the nasal cavity. The vaccination of pigs, commencing at ten weeks of age on a farm with endemic pomona infection, revealed that multiple inoculations of a commercially available bacterin can be used to control the level of endemic infection within a grower pig herd. There was evidence to suggest that persistent passive immunity in young pigs could interfere with the efficacy of vaccination. A computer simulation model of endemic pomona infection in a pig herd [Simulated Leptospiral Infection within a Pig herd, SLIP 89] was developed using the results of investigations described in this thesis by sequentially breaking down the cycle of endemic pomona infection into a series of logical events. The model repeats a number of predetermined independent and dependant events for each pig within a simulated herd. The outcome of each event is randomly determined from an appropriately selected probability distribution. Each cycle of repetition represents one week in time. The outcome generated by the simulation can be used to observe varying patterns of infection which are due to either the element of chance or the alteration of key variables within the model. The results generated by the SLIP 89 must be viewed with the structure and limitations of the model in mind...|$|R

5000|$|Pigs {{are part}} of the mixed farming economy. Traditionally every farm kept a pig as part of the staple diet. During the winter, the main source of meat was cured ham and <b>bacon</b> from <b>pigs</b> raised on the farm. Hams were cured in the large {{chimneys}} of farm kitchens, which slowly dried the ham and bacon after it had been salted. This tradition has largely died out, but the remaining producers make hams which are similar to Bayonne, Serrano, or Parma hams. Freshly cured ham is sliced for grilling, older ham is boiled as a York ham, and ham cured for many months is sliced wafer thin, like Parma ham. Carmarthen ham has a similar delicious farmyard flavour. The hocks have the greatest flavour, and need to be boiled a long time to soften the meat. They make a good base for winter stew, or a summer ‘paysanne’ salad. Dry-cured Carmarthen Ham can be found at Carmarthen Market. Five generations of the Rees family have sold ham here [...] spanning 200 years. and their family were the first commercial producers of dry-cured ham in Britain. Carmarthen Ham is dry salt-cured and then air dried and sold whole boneless, or sliced thinly and vacuum packed. Legend has it that when the Romans settled in Carmarthen they stole the recipe and on their return to Italy called it Parma Ham. The ham is cut in thin wafers and is served like prosciutto or Parma ham, but is saltier. Carmarthen Ham production remains a cottage industry, in order to keep it a premium product. Carmarthen Ham is a particular favourite of the Prince of Wales. The Rees family also produce a short back and streaky bacon. This is dry-cured for one week and hung for a further three weeks. It is recommended that the bacon is blanched before frying to remove any excess salt. The Rees family have more than 80 hams curing at any one time, and it takes nine months to cure [...] they also have a mail order business and travel to the nearby markets of Brecon, Fishguard, Haverfordwest, Pembroke and Cardigan. Recipes for Carmarthen ham include: ‘Country Ham with Vegetable Stew’, ‘Pancakes stuffed with Carmarthen Ham and Wild Mushrooms with a savoury Custard’, and ‘Salad Paysanne with Carmarthen Ham and Lentils,’ and ‘Carmarthen Ham in Beer’ [...] Carmarthenshire Ham has featured on Rick Stein’s “Food Heroes” [...] The Welsh chef Dudley recommends pork wrapped in Carmarthenshire ham [...] At the Royal Welsh Show 2010, Carmarthenshire Ham was included in the new European Protected Food names initiative for Protective Geographical Indication (PGI) status, which would give European Union legal status to Carmarthenshire Ham.|$|R
5000|$|Munster, {{being the}} most {{significant}} dairying region of Ireland, {{was also one of}} the most important areas for pork production as buttermilk made an excellent feed for pigs. Irish pork producers embraced innovation in the course of the late 19th century. In 1862, when a new method of curing bacon was developed it was immediately employed by Irish pork processors. Similar advances were made in breeding. In 1887, the <b>Bacon</b> Curers’ <b>Pig</b> Improvement Association was established and played a central role in popularising the Large White Ulster breed across Munster.In 1820, Henry Denny began business as a provisions merchant in Waterford and, over the following decades, patented a number of production methods of bacon as well as establishing of the Denny ‘star’ brand in Britain., In 1880s, Henry's son Edward established pork processing plants in Germany, Denmark and America with Denny technological expertise in particular helping the Danish bacon industry to develop. Another large Irish pork processor of the era, O'Mara's, meanwhile set up bacon curing facilities in Russia in 1891.The famous Limerick cured ham was also developed around this era. According to a 1902 document from the Department of Agriculture, it came about largely by accident: ‘1880… Limerick producers were short of money…they produced what was considered meat in a half cured condition. The unintentional cure proved extremely popular and others followed suit.’ [...] The decreasing use of salt was additionally supported by advances in technology and transport which meant pork did not need to be stored at ambient temperatures for a long period of time. Recognising the change in tastes that favoured mild cure, Alexander Shaw commented in 1902 that ‘the hard cured bacon of former days would today be looked on as akin to Lot's wife.'One of the by-products of an export-oriented commercial pork industry was the plentiful availability of cheaper cuts to the local populace. In the major Irish production centres such as Limerick, Waterford and particularly Cork, crubeens (pigs totters), drisheen (blood pudding) and tripe were staples of the local diet throughout the 19th and much of the 20th centuries as a result of their plentiful availability.Key brands established in the 19th and early 20th century such as Denny, Galtee, Roscrea and Shaw's remain today among the leading pork, bacon and sausage brands in Ireland. All are owed by Irish food company Kerry Group, which also owns the UK sausage brand Richmond. Richmond Irish sausages Have the largest number of sausages sold by any company in the UK. Denny's sausages receive a mention in James Joyce's Ulysses. 'And a pound and a half of Denny's sausages…The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausage pink' and the company also claims to have invented the skinless sausage in 1941.|$|R
40|$|Ractopamine {{hydrochloride}} (RAC), a ??-adrenergic agonist, increases {{muscle mass}} and decreases fat deposition in the pig. Though RAC {{has been extensively}} studied, to date no experiments have quantified {{its effect on the}} pork shoulder. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize the effects of RAC on fresh meat and further processing characteristics of muscle from the shoulder of finishing pigs. Two hundred and forty shoulders originating from 120 carcasses (60 barrows and 60 gilts) were selected from a commercial population of pigs. This study was designed as a 2 x 2 factorial in a randomized complete design. Factors were RAC inclusion in the diet (0 mg/kg or 7. 4 mg/kg) and sex (barrow or gilt). Paired shoulders (120 right sides and 120 left sides) were transported from a federally inspected harvest facility under refrigeration to the University of Illinois Meat Science Laboratory for evaluation. Subsequently, right and left shoulders were separated and designated for 2 separate experiments. Experiment 1 used the right shoulder to determine further processing characteristics. Cottage bacon was manufactured from cured and smoked CT Boston butts. Experiment 2 used the left shoulder to determine fresh meat characteristics. Due to the lack of interactions (P > 0. 05) during both experiments, data were reported as main effect means. Pigs fed RAC had greater carcass weight (P = 0. 09) and loin depth (P = 0. 03) than controls. Inclusion of RAC increased shoulder cutability. Feeding RAC decreased Boston butt fat content (P = 0. 01). In contrast, RAC inclusion had no effect on picnic fat content (P = 0. 86). Inclusion of RAC also increased Boston butt salt soluble proteins (SSP) extractability (P = 0. 03) at 0. 5 % salt concentration. Surprisingly, RAC inclusion also improved (P = 0. 03) picnic SSP extractability at 1. 5 % salt concentration. Feeding RAC had no effect on cottage bacon percent cooked yield (P = 0. 33). However, RAC inclusion reduced (P < 0. 01) cottage bacon fat content, and had no effect on protein content (P = 0. 50). In addition, RAC improved loin end (P = 0. 07), middle end (P = 0. 07), and blade end (P < 0. 01) slice lean area. Cottage <b>bacon</b> from RAC-treated <b>pigs</b> had sensory characteristics similar to controls. Shoulders from pigs fed RAC might be of benefit to the industry because they provide more pounds of sellable products with decreased fat content and greater lean area in cured Boston butt. At the same time, no detrimental effects on processing characteristics and sensory attributes of cottage bacon were observed. These results are in agreement with most of the literature that RAC supplementation produces heavier and leaner carcasses with little to no impact on pork meat quality...|$|R
40|$|An Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (I. F. A. T.) was {{developed}} for the Identification of carriers of Streptococcus suis. This test was more accurate than the "traditional" cultural techniques. The sensitivity for detecting S. suis type 1 from tonsillar swabs was 62 %, and 76 % for S. suis type 2. For nasal swabs collected from live pigs the sensitivity was 48 % and 60 % respectively. From the examination of 959 non specific pathogen free domesticated pigs fron 63 herds, 263 specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs from seven herds and 96 feral pigs it is concluded that all non-SPF domesticated pigs older than five weeks of age are infected with both S. suis types 1 and 2. Variation in the apparent prevalence of infection between different herds {{was associated with the}} number of pigs sampled in each herd rather than a real variation in the prevalence and was similar in both New Zealand and Australian non-SPF domesticated pigs. Three of seven SPF herds tested in Australia were free from infection with S. suis types 1 and 2. It is proposed that all SPF pigs are delivered free from infection and that infection is subsequently introduced into the piggery. Streptococcus suis was detected from numerous tissues and fluids Including the blood of normal pigs. It is suggested that the isolation of S. suis from "diseased" tissue does not infer that S. suis was the primary aetiological agent. Although both S. suis types 1 and 2 were readily detected in the environment of pigs housed in an intensive piggery, the main routes of transmission were considered to be direct contact or neonatal infection of piglets born to sows with vaginal infections. Based on serological results from using an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), the pattern of infection due to S. suis types 1 and 2 was similar in domestic pigs. In feral pigs the pattern of infection due to S. suis type 2 was similar to that of domestic pigs, {{but in the case of}} S. suis type 1 the prevalence and titres were considerably lower in feral pigs. It is concluded from these results, that both domestic and feral pigs are true long term carriers of S. suis type 2 whilst S. suis type 1 is maintained within a population by a series of reinfections dependent on the population density. There was no evidence of ascending uro-genital infection or signs of clinical disease in 24 <b>bacon</b> weight <b>pigs</b> inoculated with S. suis type 1 or 2 by either the intravaginal or intrapreputial routes. When two litters of previously non-infected pigs were intranasally inoculated with S. suis, no pigs developed clinical signs. The results of this experiment showed that the infective dose was less than 100 organisms by this route. Only one of eight pigs developed "classical" clinical signs after intravenous inoculation with a porcine isolate of S. suis type 2. Some pigs remained apparently normal even though high numbers of organisms were present in the blood for up to two weeks. Only two of fourteen pigs inoculated with S. suis type 2 into the cerebro-spinal fluid (C. S. F.) developed signs of clinical disease. Both these pigs were inoculated with a human strain of S. suis type 2. To explain these results it is proposed that strains of S. suis of different pathogenicity exist. This hypothesis was supported by the findings that this human strain was also pathogenic for mice, rats and rabbits whilst the porcine isolate was pathogenic only for rabbits. A cross-sectional study of various occupational groups showed a positive correlation between contact with pigs and being seropositive to S. suis type 2. No veterinary students, 10. 3 % of meat inspectors, 14 % of dairy farmers who also kept pigs and 21. 4 % of pig farmers were seropositive. In exposed pig farmers the annual incidence of seroconversion could be as high as 30 %. It is believed that subclinical infection of humans, as well as pigs, occurs and that isolates pathogenic for pigs are also pathogenic for other species of animals including man. It is hypothesized that S. suis is endemic in pigs at a prevalence rate approaching 100 % in all countries where pigs are kept. The pathogenicity of isolates can vary and this could account for variations in the severity of disease reported throughout the world. It is concluded that S. suis is usually a commensal and is involved in a disease process only when pathogenic strains are present and after some other primary insult...|$|R
