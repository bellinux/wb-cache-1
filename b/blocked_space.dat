40|$|We {{present a}} robust {{algorithm}} for free space construction for a moving polyhedron with three degrees of freedom: two translations and one rotation. The free space is a 3 D manifold {{of all the}} transformations of a moving polyhedron with respect to an obstacle polyhedron, {{where there is no}} overlap between them. The algorithm explicitly constructs a combinatorial representation of the configuration space, where configuration space is the superset of both free space and <b>blocked</b> <b>space.</b> For robust implementation, we use the adaptive control perturbation (ACP) library and we handle identities explicitly. ^ ACP perturbs the input and stores the input as intervals. It computes the signs of the predicate using interval arithmetic. Failed predicates are reevaluated after increasing the precision of its arguments. However algebraically dependent input could yield degenerate predicates and hence any perturbation strategies would fail. We call this type of degeneracy an identity because the predicate is identically zero for all inputs. In our implementation of the free space computation algorithm, we explicitly detect identities by inspecting the input vertices and handle them accordingly. ^ Free space computation algorithms can help in solving other computational geometry problems. The path planning problem, where the goal is to find a path from a start pose of a robot to a goal pose, can be solved using these algorithms. Another application of free space construction algorithms is the maximum clearance problem, which tries to find a path that stays as far away from the obstacle as possible. We validate our free space algorithm by implementing path planning and maximum clearance using our free space construction algorithm. ...|$|E

We provide a new proof for the continuity of B in critical weak-Morrey spaces without using auxiliary norms of Besov type neither Kato time-weighted norms. As a byproduct, we reobtain the uniqueness of mild solutions in the class of continuous functions from [0, T) to critical Morrey spaces. Our proof consists in estimates in <b>block</b> <b>spaces</b> (based on Lorentz spaces) that are preduals of Morrey Lorentz spaces. For that, we need to obtain properties like interpolation of operators, duality, Holder and Young type inequalities in such <b>block</b> <b>spaces.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Frame-based features were computed based on an encoding of the global spectral shape using a Discrete Cosine Transform. In most current “standard” methods, trajectory (dynamic) features are determined from frame-based parameters using a fixed time sampling, i. e., fixed block length and fixed <b>block</b> <b>spacing.</b> In this research, new methods are proposed and investigated in which block length and/or <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> are variable.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the sprint start time to the first 10 and to the second 10 meters as a result of alteration of starting block angles and lateral block spacings. One male world class, two female college level, one male and one female high school level sprinters served as subjects. During the test period each subject completed twelve 20 -meter sprints. Sprint starts were made from combinations of 52. 5, 65, and 75 degrees front starting block angle and 60 and 80 degrees rear starting block angle from a 4 inches and a 10 inches lateral <b>block</b> <b>spacing.</b> A subjects by treatments analysis of variance indicated a significant difference in time over the first 10 meters {{as a result of the}} alteration of block angle and lateral <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> but no significant difference was obtained for the second 10 -meter. Combination of 65 degrees front angle with 60 degrees rear block angle, and 75 degrees front angle with 60 degrees rear block angle were significantly different based on Duncan's new multiple range test. Significant difference in time by the subjects was found for all combinations of block angles for both the first 10 meters distance and for the second 10 meters distance. Based on Duncan's new multiple range test, male subjects performed significantly different than female subjects. A multiple linear regression procedure and a rank order correlation established that a significant difference existed in the independent variables that would predict the start time for the identified block combinations. FF 2 P, the second peak of resultant force of front foot, FVF 2 P, the second peak of vertical resultant force of front foot, and FRH, horizontal resultant force, were the independent variables most commonly identified although the contribution order was not the same. Little concordance existed in the rank of independent variables among the three significantly different combinations. Resultant force and resultant force angle, combinations of block angles and lateral <b>block</b> <b>spacing,</b> and sprint start time formed a mutual dependent relationship in this study. If an optimal model of statistical relationship between resultant force and resultant force angle, and combinations of block angles and lateral <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> could be set up, the range of block angle and lateral <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> variations could be minimized...|$|R

At present, it is unclear as to how the block arrangement affects the forces applied to the blocks and consequent performance during sprint start. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effects of the starting block arrangement on the forces applied to them. For 18 different arrangements of <b>block</b> <b>spacing,</b> forces applied by a sprinter to the front and rear starting blocks, as well as to the ground on the first step, were measured using three force plates. The results indicate that when in the starting posture, the magnitude of the impulse applied to both blocks changes little between the 18 arrangements. Likewise, no substantial change occurs in the forces applied to the ground upon the first step. However, as the distance between the front and rear blocks was changed, the ratio of the impulses applied to the front and rear blocks did change: as the <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> was increased, the impulse applied to the front block while in the starting posture decreased, while that applied to the rear block increased. In addition, changing the distance from the starting line to the front block influenced the relation between the <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> distance and the forces applied to the two starting blocks...|$|R

This paper presents a model for spreading the blocks uniformly over the chip area, to accommodate the routing requirements, such that the desired adjacency relations between the blocks are retained. The <b>block</b> <b>spacing</b> problem is solved via a graph model, whose vertices represent the building blocks, and its arcs represent the <b>space</b> between adjacent <b>blocks.</b> Then, the desired uniform spacing can be presented as a space balancing problem. In this paper the existence and uniqueness of {{a solution to the}} one dimensional space balancing problem are proved, and an iterative algorithm which converges rapidly to the solution is presented.
