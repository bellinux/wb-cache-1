5|$|Initial DVT {{costs for}} an average hospitalized patient in the U.S. are around $7,700–$10,800. VTE {{follow-up}} costs at three months, six months, and a year are about $5,000, $10,000, and $33,000 respectively; in Europe, the three and six-month figures are about €1,800 and €3,200. Post-thrombotic syndrome is a significant contributor to DVT follow-up costs. Annual DVT costs in the U.S. are an estimated $5 billion or in excess of $8 billion, and the average annual cost per treated individual {{is thought to be}} about $20,000. As an example, if 300,000 symptomatic DVT patients were treated at costs averaging $20,000 annually, that would cost $6 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

5|$|Jordan's total {{foreign debt}} in 2012 was $22 billion, {{representing}} 72% of its GDP. In 2016, the debt reached $35.1 billion representing 90.6% of its GDP.

According to the World Bank, Syrian refugees have cost Jordan more than $2.5 <b>billion</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> amounting to 6% of the GDP and 25% of the government's annual revenue. Foreign aid covers {{only a small part}} of these costs, 63% of the total costs are covered by Jordan.

In 2015, there were 296 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 731,000 deaths. Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa. Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%, but increased from 2014 during which there were 198 million cases.
