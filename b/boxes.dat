5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create <b>boxes</b> and make use of them to clear the obstacles. <b>Boxes</b> are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of <b>boxes</b> in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string of <b>boxes</b> then push it to different positions. The <b>boxes</b> can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string of <b>boxes</b> attached to his body. He may then use the <b>boxes</b> as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the <b>boxes.</b> Creating a new string of <b>boxes</b> causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E

5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS <b>boxes</b> are 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with palindromic {{structure and}} {{a high degree of}} sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS <b>boxes</b> varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS <b>boxes</b> permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS <b>boxes</b> near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E
