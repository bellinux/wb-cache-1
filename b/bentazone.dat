Version 5. 1 of the MACRO model was tested against measurements of water flow and the behaviour of bromide, <b>bentazone</b> [3 -isopropyl- 1 H- 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazin- 4 (3 H) -one- 2, 2 -dioxide] and imidacloprid [1 -(6 -chloro- 3 -pyridylmethyl) -N-nitroimidazolidin- 2 -ylideneamine] in a cracked clay soil. In keeping with EU (FOCUS) procedures, the model was first calibrated against the measured moisture profiles and bromide concentrations in soil and in drain water. Uncalibrated pesticide simulations based on laboratory measurements of sorption and degradation were then compared with field data on the leaching of <b>bentazone</b> and imidacloprid. Calibrated parameter values indicated that {{a high degree of}} physical non-equilibrium (i. e. strong macropore flow) was necessary to describe solute transport in this soil. Comparison of measured and simulated <b>bentazone</b> concentration profiles revealed that the bulk of the <b>bentazone</b> movement in this soil was underestimated by MACRO. Nevertheless, the model simulated the dynamics of the <b>bentazone</b> breakthrough in drain water rather well and, in particular, accurately simulated the timing and the concentration level of the early <b>bentazone</b> breakthrough in drain water. The imidacloprid concentration profiles and its persistence in soil were simulated well. Moreover, the timing of the early imidacloprid breakthrough in the drain water was simulated well, although the simulated concentrations were about 2 - 3 times larger than measured. Deep groundwater concentrations for all substances were underestimated by MACRO, although it simulated concentrations in the shallow groundwater reasonably well.

There is a concern that pesticide residues and metabolites remain on or in the wheat. Thus, the study of the determination and monitoring of their residues in wheat has important significance. A rapid, simple and reliable QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) method was modified, developed and validated for the determination of dichlorprop-P, <b>bentazone</b> and its metabolites (6 -hydroxy-bentazone and 8 -hydroxy-bentazone) in wheat (wheat plants, wheat straw and grains of wheat) using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).

The movement of water, bromide ion and the behaviour of the pesticides ethoprophos and <b>bentazone</b> was studied. The substances were applied after sowing winter wheat in autumn 1990. This late application time is unusual for bentazone: it was selected on scientific grounds (without agricultural purpose). Rainfall, groundwater level and soil temperature were monitored continuously at the experimental field (80 m long and 54 m wide) until spring 1992. Soil profiles were sampled at 1, 103, 278 and 474 days after application (16 profiles at each date). In the laboratory, pesticide transformation rates were measured with soil material from 0 – 25, 50 – 100 and 100 – 200 cm depth. Sorption isotherms were measured with material from 0 – 25 cm depth.

The water that flows through these sand filters often contains low concentrations of pesticides which might cause growth of microorganisms adapted to degrade pesticides or their degradation products. Therefore, mineralization of <b>bentazone,</b> 2 -methyl- 4 -chloorphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) and 2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide (BAM) was evaluated in sand filter material from eight different drinking water production plants. Mineralization was examined by following the production of 14 CO 2 from 14 C-labelled pesticides in laboratory microcosms. MCPA was mineralized in all samples while BAM and <b>bentazone</b> were only mineralized in sand filter material from respectively two and three drinking water production plants treating water {{with a long history}} of pesticide contamination. After 50 days, mineralization of BAM, <b>bentazone</b> and MCPA reached up to 65 %, 21 % and 57 % respectively. When comparing samples from different sampling dates and different sand filters at the same site, no differences were observed. Mineralization kinetics were different per compound and per drinking water production site. Furthermore, the BAM mineralization capacity in sand filter material from Kluizen could be transferred to non-active sand. In conclusion, biodegradation of persistent pesticides and pesticide metabolites like BAM at low concentrations can be established in sand filters and is consistent in both time and space.

40|$|An {{electrochemical}} {{technique has}} been applied to enhance the removal of a common herbicide (<b>bentazone)</b> from aqueous solutions using an activated carbon cloth as electrode. A pH increase from acidic to basic reduces the uptake, with capacities going from 127 down to 80 mg/g at pH 2 and 7, respectively. Increasing the oxygen content of the carbon cloth causes a decrease in the <b>bentazone</b> loading capacity at all pH values.

40|$|Problem statement: Various {{methods are}} used to counter the {{population}} of Cyperus iria in rice fields and among the most common method are chemical approaches. Chemical control methods are preferred by rice farmers due to their efficacy, speed, ease of storage and affordable cost. The concern of chemical herbicides is on its effects on the environment. Less attention {{had been given to}} biological control methods. Limitations such as host specificity, formulations and storage requirements are some of the obstacles that have to be overcome before implementation. Although it is environmentally friendly, a total shift from chemical control methods to biological seems unreasonable. Therefore incorporation of biological control with reduced chemical herbicides is expected to produce a better and sustainable control of weeds. Approach: A study was conducted to determine the potential of using Exserohilum rostratum as a biocontrol agent (incorporated with chemical herbicide, <b>bentazone)</b> to control Cyperus iria. The biocontrol agent (E. rostratum) was confirmed to be pathogenic to C. iria by applying Kochs postulates. Preliminary laboratory experiments were carried out to ensure the interactions within the mixture was not inhibitory. Results: <b>Bentazone</b> was confirmed to be compatible with E. rostratum with an ED 50 value of 22064570. 0 Î¼g ai mL â 1. In order to determine the efficacy of the incorporations, several mixtures were tested in a greenhouse environment. It was found that the mixtures of E. rostratum (10 6 spores mL â 1) with <b>bentazone</b> (0. 4 kg ai ha â 1) was significantly a better control of Cyperus iria compared to the usage of <b>bentazone</b> alone (0. 4 kg ai ha â 1) and spores alone (10 6 spores mL â 1). It was significantly more effective than the mixture of RBD palm oil (10 %), Tween 80 (5 %) and spores (10 6 spores mL â 1) which acted as the conventional bioherbicide approach. Synergistic effects were exhibited with 50 % less herbicide concentrations from the recommended rates. The mixture exhibited 50 % disease severity in 3. 5 days compare to <b>bentazone</b> alone which requires 4. 9 days and the conventional bioherbicide mixture was relatively less effective requiring 4. 7 days. The mixture of spores alone required 7. 6 days to achieve 50 % disease severity. This suggests that the mixture can save 50 % of the cost on <b>bentazone</b> while providing a faster control.

40|$|Testing of {{pesticide}} leaching models {{is important to}} increase confidence in their use in pesticide registration procedures world-wide. The chromatographic PEARL model was tested against {{the results of a}} field leaching study on a cracking clay soil with a tracer (bromide), a mobile pesticide (<b>bentazone)</b> and a moderately sorbing, persistent pesticide (imidacloprid). Input parameters for water flow and solute transport were obtained from site-specific measurements and from literature. The model was tested using a stepwise approach in which each sub-model was sequentially and separately tested. Uncalibrated simulations for the water flow resulted in moisture profiles that were too wet. Calibration of the hydraulic relationships resulted in a good description of the moisture profiles. Calibration of the dispersion length was necessary to obtain a good description of bromide leaching. The calibrated dispersion length was 61 cm, which is very long and indicates a large non-uniformity of solute transport. The half-life of <b>bentazone</b> had to be calibrated to obtain a good description of its field persistence. The calibrated half-life was 2. 5 times shorter than the half-life derived from the laboratory studies. Concentrations of <b>bentazone</b> in drain water and groundwater were described reasonably well by PEARL. Although measured and simulated persistence of imidacloprid in soil corresponded well, the bulk of the imidacloprid movement was overestimated by PEARL. However, imidacloprid concentrations in drain water were underestimated. In spite of the extensive calibration of water flow and tracer movement, the behaviour of the moderately sorbing pesticide imidacloprid could not be simulated.

40|$|Two modellers {{tested the}} PESTLA model (version 2. 3. 1) against {{results of a}} field study on <b>bentazone</b> and {{ethoprophos}} behaviour in a sandy soil. Both modellers achieved an acceptable description of the measured moisture profiles but only after calibration of the soil hydraulic properties. Both could describe the bromide-ion concentration profiles measured {{at the end of}} the first winter reasonably well. However, both predicted that practically all bromide had leached out of the top 50 cm of the soil {{at the end of the}} second winter, whereas about 10 % of the bromide dose remained in this layer. This is attributable to a systematic deviation of bromide transport from the concept assumed in the convection/dispersion equation and/or to the release of bromide from dead root remnants. Both modellers derived pesticide transformation and sorption parameters from laboratory studies with soil from the field. Both described <b>bentazone</b> movement reasonably well. Modeller 1 described the concentration profiles reasonably well, whereas Modeller 2 strongly overestimated the concentrations at the end of the study. This difference was mainly attributable to a difference in interpretation of the temperature dependence of the transformation rate of <b>bentazone.</b> Only Modeller 2 simulated ethoprophos behaviour. He simulated the persistence of ethoprophos in the top 20 cm very well during the first 200 days. However, thereafter the transformation in the field proceeded much faster than simulated. This is probably caused by accelerated transformation resulting from exposure of the top soil layer to about 1 mg kg - 1 of ethoprophos over 200 days. Simulated penetration of ethoprophos was deeper than measured. By including accelerated transformation (admittedly on an ad-hoc basis) within the simulations, good agreement was achieved between measured and simulated penetration of ethoprophos. Calculations showed that the effect of calibrating water flow was substantial for <b>bentazone</b> but small for ethoprophos. However, the effect of calibration of water flow for <b>bentazone</b> was much smaller than the effect of the difference between the transformation rate parameters derived by the two modellers. We recommend that the guidance for deriving pesticide-soil input parameters be improved in order to reduce differences between modellers because a large influence of the person of the modeller on the outcome of model tests is unacceptable for methodological reasons.

Degradation of cyanazine, isoproturon [3 (4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea], and chlorotoluron [3 -(3 -chloro-p-tolyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea] was measured in soil amended with different amounts of lignin. The effect of lignin on degradation was small despite considerable differences in sorption. The DT 50 values of cyanazine, isoproturon, and chlorotoluron were 16. 2, 18. 6, and 33. 0 d, respectively, in soil without lignin and 19. 0, 23. 4, and 34. 6 d, respectively, in soil amended with 2 % lignin. Degradation of <b>bentazone</b> and cyanazine in repacked soil columns was similar under static and flow conditions with 50. 1 and 47. 2 % of applied <b>bentazone</b> and 74. 7 and 73. 6 % of applied cyanazine, respectively, degraded within 20 d of application. Thus, the assumptions underpinning laboratory to field extrapolation tested here were considered to hold for our experimental system.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{on the effects}} of row distances and herbicide applications on the seed yield and some characteristics of Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.) was conducted in 1998 - 1999 and 1999 - 2000 growing seasons in Bornova, Izmir, Turkey. The experimental design was split-plots design with three replications. Row distances were 20, 30 and 40 cm and the herbicides were imazethapyr, imazamox and <b>bentazone.</b> Imazethapyr is not a suitable herbicide for weed control in Persian clover. <b>Bentazone</b> must be used for broad-leaved weeds such as Anagallis caerula, Matricaria chamomilla, Polygonum aviculare, Sinapis arvensis and Stellaria media. It had an effect on Fumaria parviflora in second year, only. In case of presence of wild oat (Avena sterilis) and some broad-leaved weeds such as Sinapis arvensis, Anagallis caerula, Polygonum aviculare and Stellaria media, it is thought that imazamox is useful to achieve a satisfactory seed yield. The row distance had an effect on the number of lateral branches per plant and 1000 seed weight. Herbicide applications affected the number of lateral branches per plant, the number of heads per plant and seed yield. The highest seed yields were obtained from the control, imazamox and <b>bentazone</b> applications and the yields were 799, 733 and 712 kg ha - 1, respectively. Although there were no statistical important differences among the row distances, more seed yield (752 kg ha - 1) was obtained from the row distance of 40 cm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the application of nanofiltration for pesticide removal. Four different membranes were compared for their rejection of six important pesticides (simazine, atrazine, <b>bentazone,</b> diuron, DNOC and dinoseb). The results showed that the membrane material has a large influence on the rejection. It was found that the Hydranautics PVD 1 membrane had the best performance with rejections between 85 % and 100 % for the six tested pesticides. The worst performance, considering the pesticide rejection, was found for the Fluid Systems 4 x 21 PZ membrane. The rejections of this membrane ranged from 25 % for diuron and DNOC to 95 % for <b>bentazone.</b> In addition to the pesticide removal, the rejection of natural organic matter, calcium and chloride was monitored. The four membranes showed similar rejections of UV-absorbing compounds (> 97 %) and DOC (± 90 %). For the rejection of calcium and chloride the membranes showed typically the performance of nanofiltration membranes: high calcium rejection and low chloride rejection...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} field bean in the north-eastern part of the Republic of Croatia to compare weed control and crop response under different management practices within the critical period of field bean production. The practices consisted in broadcast application of labelled rate of preemergence herbicide (PRE) and postemergence herbicide application: (POST) broadcast, band application over the rows, and band application combined with mechanical cultivation using of different herbicide doses recommended by the manufacturer (2 x, 1 x, 1 / 2 x, 1 / 4 x, 1 / 8 x). In 1999, weed control with PRE application of pendimethalin was superior to POST <b>bentazone</b> application due to late emergence of weeds and lack of residual herbicide control. In 2000 <b>bentazone</b> combined with cycloxydim controlled weeds in field bean better than PRE herbicide application. Based {{on the results of}} this research, single PRE or POST application of herbicide did not control a broad spectrum of weeds and did not provide the commercially acceptable full season control. Reduced rates of herbicide are not advisable tinder high weed pressure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{electrochemical}} techniques {{for the removal of}} a common herbicide, <b>bentazone,</b> from water streams using a carbon-based electrode. Activated carbon cloth with high surface area and narrow micropores was used as electrode. For {{a better understanding of the}} process, adsorption was investigated under both open circuit and controlled polarization conditions, the latter in anodic and cathodic directions. It was found that anodic polarization enhances the kinetics of adsorption of the herbicide on the carbon cloth, the extent of which is strongly related to the applied current value. At converse, cathodic polarization induces the reversible desorption of the compound. Moreover, in-situ UV spectra recording on the solution did not show any structural change of the herbicide upon polarization, demonstrating the reversibility of the process for the regeneration of the adsorbent and the recovery of the compound. Based on these experiments, a mechanism is proposed to interpret the reversible sorption of <b>bentazone</b> under polarization.

40|$|The Plant Protection Product Directive (91 / 414 /EEC) {{stresses}} {{the need of}} validated models to calculate predicted environmental concentrations. The use of models has become an unavoidable step before pesticide registration. The main topic of the research presented here is the validation of the PEARL model for two well-instrumented sites located in the Netherlands and Sweden. First the water transport module was calibrated, and then the solute transport module, keeping unchanged the water transport parameters. The Dutch site is characterised by a sandy soil. PEARL predictions were very satisfactory for both soil moisture content, ground water level. Predictions for the tracer, <b>bentazone</b> and ethoprophos concentrations in the soil profile were also successful. The Swedish site is characterised by a structured clay soil. PEARL was successful in predicting soil moisture profiles and the draining water. PEARL performed well in predicting the soil concentration of <b>bentazone</b> at different depths, however it did not predict accurately solute concentration in the drainage water. A sensitivity analysis of the PEARL model performed on the Swedish site showed the greater importance of the pesticide degradation properties over the soil hydraulic propertiesJRC.

40|$|Groundwater {{contamination}} by pesticides compounds (parent {{and degradation}} by-products) {{is a well}} identified environmental issue, however factors influencing their spatial patterns and time trends remain unclear. In this context, 18 years long time series (1996 - 2013) of 3 banned (atrazine, diuron, simazine), 2 metabolites (deethyaltrazine –DEA, and 2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide –BAM) and one regulated (<b>bentazone)</b> pesticides compounds are explored, taking into account concentrations below detection limits. Using a bivariate and multivariate (PCA and hierarchical clustering) statistical framework, these time series are related to nitrate (NO 3 -) and the fraction of young water recharged since 50 years, land use, to aquifer settings (i. e. confining conditions, thickness of the unsaturated zone) and to groundwater table fluctuations. Results show that pesticides compounds are always below detection limits in the confined area where old groundwater lies. However these compounds are detected {{every year in the}} unconfined zone with maximal concentrations exceeding the current European water drinking standard of 100 ng. L- 1 every year since 2007 for atrazine. We find the greatest significant (p-value < 0. 05) positive correlations between the trio atrazine-DEA (tau= 0. 62), atrazine-NO 3 - (tau= 0. 48) and DEA-NO 3 - (tau= 0. 49). We identify positive correlations between most compounds, atrazine (tau= 0. 44), <b>bentazone</b> (tau= 0. 36), simazine (tau= 0. 71); DEA (tau= 0. 58) and BAM (tau= 0. 44), and water table fluctuations with periods spanning several years. We determine two groups (6 and 9 sites each) of site which relate to the discharge and recharge areas. Sites from the recharge area where higher diuron, simazine and BAM concentrations occurs correlate with a dense localized urban area. Atrazine and <b>bentazone</b> relates to sites with thin unsaturated zones and high mixing in the wells. Our analysis reveals critical factors affecting 7 pesticides compounds. It improves our understanding of the interplay between land use, aquifer settings and transient processes (water fluctuations) on controlling pesticides concentrations in groundwater.
