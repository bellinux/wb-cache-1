5|$|Eight {{months after}} the release of Grove's book, Titan Books, in {{association}} with Sparkplug Press, released a detailed history on the Friday the 13th series. Peter M. <b>Bracke</b> released Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th on October 24, 2005. The book chronicles the creation of the series up to the release of Freddy vs. Jason. <b>Bracke</b> spent three years researching the series and collecting more than 200 interviews from the cast and crew of each of the films. Bracke's extensive work for the book prompted Sean S. Cunningham to provide a foreword. Crystal Lake Memories also includes images, storyboards, concept art, and publicity material that had not been released to the public. A private party was held on October 22, 2005 at Universal Studios CityWalk Hollywood for the book's premiere.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Hinkley of DVD Talk {{gave the}} Blu-ray version an overall rating of four stars out of five, commending the video {{transfer}} and special features, but criticizing the audio transfer. Peter <b>Bracke</b> of High Def Digest felt similarly {{in regard to}} the transfers and special features, though he gave an overall rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five.|$|E
5|$|Fuller and Form {{said the}} casting process for Friday the 13th was more {{difficult}} than that for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because thirteen young actors were involved in Friday the 13th, as opposed to five in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The pair continually recast roles to find which actors worked best together. This recasting process lasted until the start of filming. s Richard Burgi, who was cast as Sheriff <b>Bracke,</b> did not sign his contract until twelve hours before he was due to start filming his scenes.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Farrands {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a second documentary film on the Friday franchise, this time directly inspired by <b>Bracke's</b> book. Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th discusses each of the twelve films, from the original to the 2009 remake, {{as well as the}} television series. It is narrated by Corey Feldman, and also features interviews with key individuals in the franchise's history. Farrands has suggested that his work on the well-received 2010 film, , which documented the making of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, demonstrated the possibility for a documentary film that was more in depth and more comprehensive than his previous effort, His Name Was Jason. In making such a film, Farrands turned to <b>Bracke's</b> book, which he had also worked on, and drew from its structure and content. Curious Goods: Behind the Scenes of Friday the 13th: The Series by Alyse Wax, a retrospective focusing on the 1987 television series, was released in October 2015 by BearManor Media.|$|R

50|$|The {{frequency}} of graphic violence and gore is expedited in A New Beginning, with a then-series high body count. Aside from its gore, {{the film has}} also become known for its explicit nudity and sex scenes, as well as frequent drug use. Peter <b>Bracke's</b> book Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th details that behind the scenes, the production was plagued with hardcore drug use. Produced on a budget of $2.2 million, A New Beginning grossed $21.9 million {{at the box office}} in the United States, making it the second poorest performing film in the Friday the 13th series at the time with a steep decline from the previous two entries, both of which had made well over $34 million in the US. In addition to weak box office returns, most critics gave the film negative reviews. In later years, much like the series in general, the film has obtained a cult following.|$|R

As Haney recalls in Peter M. <b>Bracke's</b> book Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th (2005): [...] "Barbara Associate Producer {{was the first person}} I had contact with. I pitched her a few ideas and she shot them all down. I only had one more. I said, 'I notice {{that at the end of}} these movies, there's always a teenage girl who's left to battle Jason by herself. What if this girl had telekinetic powers?' Barbara immediately said, 'Jason vs. Carrie. Huh. That's an interesting idea.' Then we talked once or twice before I had to go back to New York. The next day I had literally just flown in and walked up the stairs of my old apartment, and the phone rang. It was Barbara saying: 'You got the job.'" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{province}} is also {{divided into}} primarily seven municipalities; Berg Municipality, <b>Bräcke</b> Municipality, Krokom Municipality, Ragunda Municipality, Strömsund Municipality, Åre Municipality and Östersund Municipality.

25|$|Dachs is German for badger, a {{term used}} for hunting dogs with short legs. The name Dachsbracke may reflect that the Dachsbracke dogs were bred down in size by {{crossbreeding}} long-legged Bracken with the Dachshund. Historically, the term <b>Bracke</b> {{was used in}} German to mean the scenthounds. Brack is an old Low German word for a coastal marsh periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water (related to the English word brackish). In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (free running packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries communicate that game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held on a leash by the hunter.) The <b>Bracke</b> are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called Brackade. The Dachsbracke are used for hunting today mainly in Scandinavia and in alpine regions.|$|E
25|$|In Jämtland County (including the {{province}} of Härjedalen) {{the number of people}} living outside an urban area is 34% of the total population, making Jämtland one of the largest rural regions in Scandinavia. Most people in Jämtland live in Storsjöbygden, the area around lake Storsjön which includes Jämtland's only chartered city, Östersund, founded 1786 (now including Frösön), Krokom, Ås, Svenstavik, Nälden and Jämtland's second largest town Brunflo. This region is actually quite densely populated. The largest urban areas outside Storsjöbygden are primly the municipality seats Strömsund, Järpen, <b>Bräcke</b> and Hammarstrand, along with towns such as Hammerdal, Lit, and the ski resort Åre.|$|E
500|$|The DVD {{version of}} the film was {{released}} on 23 October 2001, with the Blu-ray edition released on 7 August 2007. Two weeks before it was released the DVD version was listed on Amazon.com {{as one of the}} most-anticipated releases, and it was expected to recuperate some of the money lost on the film's disappointing box office performance. Both versions contained two full-length commentary tracks (one featuring Motonori Sakakibara, sequence supervisor Hiroyuki Hayashida, lead artist Tatsuro Maruyama, and creature supervisor Takoo Noguchi; the second featuring animation director Andy Jones, editor Chris S. Capp, and staging director Tani Kunitake) as well as an isolated score with commentary. They also contained a {{version of the}} film in its basic CGI and sketch form, with the option of pop-up comments on the film. An easter egg shows the cast of the film re-enacting the dance from Michael Jackson's Thriller. Fifteen featurettes, including seven on character biographies, three on vehicle comparisons and an interactive [...] "Making Of" [...] featurette, were also included. Other features included Aki's dream viewable as a whole sequence, the film's original opening sequence, and intentional outtakes. Peter <b>Bracke</b> from High-Def Digest stated the DVD was [...] "so packed with extras it was almost overwhelming", stating that Sony went [...] "all-out" [...] on the extra features in a likely attempt to boost DVD sales and recover losses. The DVD was nominated for [...] "Best DVD Special Edition Release" [...] at the 28th Saturn Awards. Aaron Beierle from DVD Talk gave a positive review of the DVD, rating it 4½ out of 5 stars for audio quality, video quality and special features. Dustin Somner from Blu-ray.com gave the Blu-ray version 5 out of 5 stars for video quality and special features, and 4½ stars for audio quality. Peter <b>Bracke</b> gave the Blu-ray version 4 out of 5 stars overall.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year Porter again {{qualified for the}} final of the individual pursuit at the Worlds in Antwerp, however he was defeated by Ferdinand <b>Bracke,</b> who started the final quickly and caught Porter within a dozen laps. Porter regained his title in 1970 on home soil when the Worlds were held at Saffron Lane sports centre in Leicester, setting the fastest time in qualifying by seven seconds and beating Lorenzo Bosisio in the final by eleven seconds. At the 1971 Worlds in Varese, Porter finished third, prompting rival Dirk Baert to claim: [...] "Porter is finished, he is an old man". However Porter rebounded the {{following year}} to take his third individual pursuit title at the Worlds in Marseille, defeating <b>Bracke,</b> despite <b>Bracke</b> holding a two and a half second lead by lap seven. Porter described this as his [...] "most cherished" [...] world championship: [...] "I beat <b>Bracke,</b> the rider I had the most respect for... He held the Hour record, finished third in the Tour de France and won the Vuelta. He was some rider". In 1973 Porter took his fourth world title in San Sebastian, qualifying fastest and catching Martín Rodríguez in the quarter-finals (gaining revenge for the 1965 Amateur World Championships, also in San Sebastian, where Porter had also qualified fastest but had been knocked out by Rodríguez in the next round) before beating Mogens Frey in the semis and defeating René Pijnen by ten seconds in the final after trailing him with seven laps remaining.|$|E

2500|$|The English-language version, with lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer and {{additional}} material by James Fenton, was substantially expanded and reworked from a literal translation by Siobhan <b>Bracke</b> {{of the original}} Paris version, in particular adding a prologue to tell Jean Valjean's backstory. Kretzmer's work is not a direct [...] "translation" [...] of the French, a term that Kretzmer refused to use. A third of the English lyrics were a [...] "rough" [...] translation, another third were adapted from the French lyrics and the final third consisted of new material. The majority is performed in recitative style; the vocalists use natural speech delivery, not musical metrics.|$|E
