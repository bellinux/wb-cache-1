40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} problem of {{measuring}} the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> at present, this integrative performance test system for bake chamber was built up by using the computer control technology. It can measure these parameters: dynamic characteristic, static characteristic, sealing performance and return performance. To verify the system accuracy, a multi-parameter dynamic simulation model for the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> was designed based on AMESim. It breaks through the limit which was formerly difficult to analyze the defects of the theoretical parameters for <b>brake</b> <b>chamber.</b> By the simulation models and test system, the influence of the key component parameters to the output characteristic is analyzed. The experiment results show that the integrative performance of <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> can be judged very well and the simulation model is accurate and reliable...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} developing a control scheme for regulating the pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> of an air brake system found in most commercial vehicles like trucks, tractor-trailers and buses. Such a control scheme {{can be used for}} providing the ground work for future systems such as forward collision avoidance systems, advanced anti-lock brake systems and differential braking systems. The development of this controller involves two tasks. The first task was the development of a control scheme for achieving the desired pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber.</b> This scheme was based on a mathematical model of the treadle valve of the air brake system. The second task was the implementation of this control scheme on the experimental facility that was set up at Texas A&M University. The results indicate successful control of a desired <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure for a demonstrated range of controller gains...|$|R
50|$|With {{a service}} brake relay valve installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers,</b> and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers</b> in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Electro-pneumatic (EP) {{components}} are frequently used in brake systems of commercial vehicles. The simulation of EP brake systems {{is of great}} importance {{in order to understand}} their dynamics for developing a control logic being robust but fulfilling the modern functional demands. On the other hand, the simulation aids the design of EP components being able to execute the commands of a precision control. The paper presents a flexible computational simulation tool being applied in industrial research and development related to complex mechatronics in brake systems for commercial vehicles. The Electric Braking System (EBS) case study presented herein comprises an air supply unit, an EBS modulator, piping, a diaphragm <b>brake</b> <b>chamber,</b> and the connected brake mechanism. The simulation environment is AMESim ® 3. 0. Considering the complexity of the EP components and the related phenomena, special models have been elaborated for the solenoid valves, piping, and the diaphragm <b>brake</b> <b>chamber.</b> The simulation results show good agreement with measurement data. The comparative numerical and experimental study confirmed that the simulation tool can be effectively used in design, research and development of EP brake systems...|$|R

40|$|Statistics {{indicate}} that defects in brake system {{contribute significantly to}} fatal crashes involving commercial vehicles. Hence {{there is a need}} for developing preventive and active safety measures for assessing the performance of an air brake system in trucks. Existing techniques for assessing the performance of brakes are infrastructure intensive, time and labor intensive. The premise of this thesis is that model-based diagnostic techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations of existing tech- niques. The design of a model-based diagnostic system requires the development and experimental corroboration of a mathematical model of the evolution of pressure in each <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> of a truck in response to the application of brake pedal input by the driver, when there are no faults or defects in the brake system. This thesis is aimed at modeling and experimentally corroborating a subsystem of an air brake system, namely the pneumatic relay valve. The pneumatic relay valve takes a input signal from the primary delivery of a treadle valve and meters air from a storage reservoir to Type 30 rear <b>brake</b> <b>chambers.</b> A description of the development of the model, the experimental setup and corroborating experimental results are provided...|$|R

50|$|In a truck’s {{air brake}} system, relay valves get a signal when a driver presses the treadle, which then opens the valve and allows air {{to enter the}} <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> via air inlet. The {{diaphragm}} gets pushed, then the rod, then the slack adjuster which twists to turn the brake camshaft. Next, it moves the disc, wedge or s-cam, which pushes the brake shoes and lining, creating friction. This friction slows and eventually stops the brake drum’s turning, which stops the wheel.|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{pressure}} casting (VPC) uses gas pressure and a vacuum {{to improve the}} quality of the casting and minimize porosity. Typically VPC machines consist of an upper and a lower chamber—the upper chamber, or melting <b>chamber,</b> <b>housing</b> the crucible, and the lower casting <b>chamber</b> <b>housing</b> the investment mould. Both chambers are connected via a small hole containing a stopper. A vacuum is pulled in the lower chamber, while pressure is applied in the upper, and then the stopper is removed. This creates the greatest pressure differential to fill the molds.|$|R

50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear service brakes concurrently with the front service brakes, resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers.</b> In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the relay valve for remote service brake application.|$|R

50|$|The solvent {{is heated}} to reflux. The solvent vapour travels up a {{distillation}} arm, and floods into the <b>chamber</b> <b>housing</b> the thimble of solid. The condenser ensures that any solvent vapour cools, and drips {{back down into}} the <b>chamber</b> <b>housing</b> the solid material. The chamber containing the solid material slowly fills with warm solvent. Some of the desired compound dissolves in the warm solvent. When the Soxhlet chamber is almost full, the chamber is emptied by the siphon. The solvent is returned to the distillation flask. The thimble ensures that the rapid motion of the solvent does not transport any solid material to the still pot. This cycle may be allowed to repeat many times, over hours or days.|$|R
