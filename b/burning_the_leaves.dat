25|$|It's often {{recommended}} that A.sesquipedale be grown under warm to intermediate conditions and given as much light as possible without <b>burning</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves.</b> The choice of growing {{the plant in}} intermediate or warm housing conditions can affect {{the timing of the}} flowering. In order to stimulate heavy flower production {{it is important that the}} light intensity be greatest between September and November. The number of flower spikes present during flowering is dependent on the number of new leaf-pairs formed during the preceding spring and summer, since each newly formed leaf-pair produce one spike and rarely two. Angraecum sesquipedale is commonly found to have a slow growth habit, but the orchid can be expected to produce flowers even before it has reached an adult size. Angraecum sesquipedale is notorious for having sensitive roots. The roots of mature plants are best left undisturbed as much as possible and as a result it is prudent to be especially careful during repotting. Young plants however are less susceptible to such root problems. Disturbing the roots can cause the plant to sulk for 2 to 4 years or even to cause it to die. When a mature plant is disturbed it frequently loses many of its lower leaves and reverts to only producing one or two flowers at a time. To avoid these problems it is commonly advised that the orchid be planted in a coarse medium such as fir bark, crock, or charcoal to minimize disturbances to the roots. Also planting it in a basket or large pot is best since this allows the orchid to grow for many years before having to have its roots disturbed.|$|E

40|$|To {{test whether}} the {{response}} to electrical current and heat treatment {{is due to the}} same signaling pathway that mediates mechanical wounding, we analyzed the effect of electric-current application and localized burning on proteinase inhibitor II (Pin 2) gene expression in both wild-type and abscisic acid (ABA) -deficient tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and potato (Solanum phureja) plants.

Inhibition of JA biosynthesis by aspirin blocked the heat-induced Pin 2 gene expression in tomato wild-type leaves. These results suggest that electric current, similar to mechanical wounding, requires the presence of ABA to induce Pin 2 gene expression.

50|$|Angraceum sesquipedale {{was first}} {{brought to the}} United Kingdom in 1855 to be grown outside of its natural {{environment}} by William Ellis. Subsequently, Ellis achieved the first flowering of the plant in cultivation in 1857. Angraecum sesquipedale has been attributed as having a nicer appearance when grown in cultivation than when found in the wild, since wild specimens appear as a long stem surrounded by a few struggling leaves. Additionally, A. sesquipedale is seldom grown in private collections, despite its enormous importance to Darwin's concept of co-evolution and subsequently the fields of botany and evolutionary biology.It's often recommended that A. sesquipedale be grown under warm to intermediate conditions and given as much light as possible without <b>burning</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves.</b> The choice of growing the plant in intermediate or warm housing conditions can affect {{the timing of the}} flowering.

The conclusions of this first study emphasize the need for a more detailed investigation of a larger number of genera and species in order that silica bodies may be used to full effectiveness in the systematics of the family...|$|E
40|$|Biomass burning {{started to}} attract {{attention}} since the last decade because of its impacts on the atmosphere and the environmental air quality, as well as significant potential effects on human health and global climate change. Knowledge of particle emission characteristics from biomass burning is crucially important for the quantitative assessment of the potential impacts. This thesis {{presents the results of}} study aimed towards comprehensive characterization of particle emissions from biomass burning. The study was conducted both under controlled laboratory conditions, to quantify the particle size distribution and emission factors by taking into account various factors which may affect the particle characteristics, and in the field, to investigate biomass burning processes in the real life situations and to examine vertical profile of particles in the atmosphere. To simulate different environmental conditions, a new technique has been developed for investigating particle emissions from biomass burning in the laboratory. As biomass burning may occur in a field at various wind speeds and burning rates, the technique was designed to allow adjustment of the flow rates of the air introduced into the chamber, in order to control burning under different conditions. In addition, the technique design has enabled alteration of the high particle concentrations, allowing conducting measurements with the instrumentations that had the upper concentration limits exciding the concentrations characteristic to the biomass burning. The technique was applied to characterize particle emissions from burning of several tree species common to Australian forests. The aerosol particles were characterized in terms of size distribution and emission factors, such as PM 2. 5 particle mass emission factor and particle number emission factor, under various burning conditions. The characteristics of particles over a range of burning phases (e. g., ignition, flaming, and smoldering) were also investigated. The results showed that particle characteristics depend on the type of tree, part of tree, and the burning rate. In particular, fast burning of the wood samples produced particles with the CMD of 60 nm during the ignition phase and 30 nm {{for the rest of the}} burning process. Slow burning of the wood samples produced large particles with the CMD of 120 nm, 60 nm and 40 nm for the ignition, flaming and smoldering phases, respectively. The CMD of particles emitted by <b>burning</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> and branches was found to be 50 nm for the flaming phase and 30 nm for the smoldering phase, under fast burning conditions. Under slow burning conditions, the CMD of particles was found to be between 100 to 200 nm for the ignition and flaming phase, and 50 nm for the smoldering phase. For fast burning, the average particle number emission factors were between 3. 3 to 5. 7 x 1015 particles/kg for wood and 0. 5 to 6. 9 x 1015 particles/kg for leaves and branches. The PM 2. 5 emission factors were between 140 to 210 mg/kg for wood and 450 to 4700 mg/kg for leaves and branches. For slow burning conditions, the average particle number emission factors were between 2. 8 to 44. 8 x 1013 particles/kg for wood and 0. 5 to 9. 3 x 1013 particles/kg for leaves and branches, and the PM 2. 5 emissions factors were between 120 to 480 mg/kg for wood and 3300 to 4900 mg/kg for leaves and branches. The field measurements were conducted to investigate particle emissions from biomass burning in the Northern Territory of Australia over dry seasons. The results of field studies revealed that diameters of particles in ambient air emissions were within the size range observed during laboratory investigations. The laboratory measurements found that the particles released during the controlled burning were of a diameter between 30 and 210 nm, depending on the burning conditions. Under fast burning conditions, smaller particles were produced with a diameter in the range of 30 to 60 nm, whilst larger particles, with a diameter between 60 nm and 210 nm, were produced during slow burning. The airborne field measurements of biomass particles found that most of the particles measured under the boundary layer had a CMD of (83 ± 13) nm during the early dry season (EDS), and (127 ± 6) nm during the late dry season (LDS). The characteristics of ambient particles were found to be significantly different at the EDS and the LDS due to several factors including moisture content of vegetation, location of fires related to the flight paths, intensity of fires, and burned areas. Specifically, the investigations of the vertical profiles of particles in the atmosphere have revealed significant differences in the particle properties during early dry season and late dry season. The characteristics of particle size distribution played a significant role in these differences...|$|E
