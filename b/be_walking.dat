5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

500|$|Cave {{paintings}} of extinct European cave lions almost exclusively show hunting animals with no manes. Some suggest this {{as evidence that}} the males of this species were maneless, however, since the hunting usually involved groups of lionesses, this presumption remains unproven. In the Chauvet cave, there is a sketchy drawing of two maneless lions, appearing to <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> side by side. One is mostly obscured behind the other. One researcher interpreted this as [...] "a pair" [...] and asserts his perception that the larger of the two animals, the mostly obscured one, shows a scrotum. Again, this is a very individual interpretation, without any consensus among experts examining the sketch. So no conclusion may be drawn scientifically.|$|E
500|$|At 1 {{o'clock on}} Saturday 14 April, the steamers began leaving Circular Quay, {{conveying}} 8,000 {{of an estimated}} 10,000-strong crowd to Middle Harbour – a large crowd considering the alternative attractions that day of Sydney Royal Easter Show (known then simply as [...] "the Exhibition") and horse racing. The remainder were reported to <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> from St Leonards, with a [...] being collected along the way. Spectators clambered {{up the sides of}} the bay for vantage points, while hundreds more stayed on board steamboats, yachts and in row boats below. The rope was strung across the entrance to Willoughby Bay, from Folly Point {{to the head of the}} bay, a reported length of , [...] above the waters below. The distance meant that two ropes were required, spliced together in the centre, to reach the other side, with 16 stays fixed to the shore and into the harbour to steady the structure.|$|E
500|$|Gallagher was {{the primary}} {{songwriter}} in Oasis, and on the group's first three albums he was the sole songwriting contributor. He is often criticised for the praise he gives to his own songs. He points out [...] "If you'd written 'Live Forever', you'd <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> to a different tune the next day too." [...] Gallagher has often been accused by critics of plagiarising the music of his heroes, but he has maintained outright homages in his music are his intention. In a 1996 Guitar World interview, he described himself as [...] "a fan who writes songs" [...] and stated, [...] "I'm not saying, 'I'm the greatest songwriter in the world. Listen to me.' Usually, I'm saying, These are the greatest songwriters in the world. And I'm gonna put them all in this song"'. His response to critics about the topic of [...] "blatantly pinching riffs" [...] was, [...] "No, I don't feel guilty. But you feel pissed off because you didn't do it first." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his article}} for MuuMuse, Bradley Stern {{believed}} Utada's vocals and production [...] "brings the track to another level, transcending the patterns {{and limitations of}} most modern pop". Stern also valued the Japanese version as a [...] "defining moment" [...] to her artistic craft. [...] Furthermore, an editor of Square Enix Music rated it {{nine out of ten}} points, commending the production and sound; he/she labelled it to be a [...] "masterpiece". Blogcritics' Michael Pascua appreciated Utada's move to add [...] "Sanctuary" [...] as the final track to This Is The One, exclaiming [...] " [...] showcases a strong musical style that isn’t necessarily in the R flare that This is the One provides. They also help connect any video game player who hasn't necessarily listened to any of her Japanese albums or even knew that she had another English album..." [...] Céire Ní Dalaigh from The Arcade also commented that [...] "This track builds from the very beginning making it the perfect tune for any occasion.

500|$|During the 1951–1952 season, {{the program}} was {{broadcast}} from a converted NBC radio studio. The {{first year of the}} television show was done live; this led to problems as there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being able to know which way is up. [...] The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. [...] The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. [...] When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall. [...] Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> on a wall. [...] Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} considered modern as it contained [...] "open classrooms". This setup contained classrooms that had movable walls and/or book cases separating them. This made {{for an interesting}} and different learning environment since students walking in hallways would also <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> behind classes. The building was designed this way as the district chose to focus around a humanities curriculum that included interdisciplinary studies. Its faculty, a blending of teachers already working on the K-9 Ridge Street staff with new hires committed to the open-space educational concept, began an educational adventure that lasted in spirit for over 20 years.|$|E

He was, and is, a much better actor than just playing James Bond, but he became synonymous with Bond.

2500|$|Dwarfs, like fauns, satyrs, {{the river}} god and his Naiad daughters {{and the tree}} people (deities of the woods) stepped forth when Aslan (in The Magician's Nephew) called for Narnia to [...] "Awake.

The bomb was under construction in the basement of 18 West 11th Street, when it accidentally exploded; the blast reduced the four-story townhouse to a burning, rubble-strewn ruin. The two persons preparing the bomb were killed instantly (Diana Oughton and Terry Robbins), as was a third [...] "Weatherman" [...] who happened to <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> into the townhouse (Ted Gold); two others were injured but were helped from the scene and later escaped (Kathy Boudin and Cathy Wilkerson).|$|E
