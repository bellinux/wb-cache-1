Banking reform continued throughout 1999, with the merger of four state banks in October 1998 into Bank Mandiri, the closure of 38 banks, recapitalisation of nine, and takeover of seven more in March 1999. By this point the total bank capital had reached a negative 245 trillion rupiah. Twenty-three further banks were recapitalised in May, and in October 1999, Bank Mandiri itself was recapitalised. Interest rates fell steadily in 1999, to an SBI of 13.1% in October. The rupiah finished the year at Rp 7,900 to the US dollar.|$|E

In view of the above, effective collection and recovery of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> strategies are {{very important for the}} business to be successful and mitigate losses. Banks and creditors maintain the current recovery model, the in-house collection activities to recover the <b>bad</b> <b>debt.</b> However, in certain circumstances, the amount recovered is not as expected and as such, alternative options are required. The two most feasible and efficient recovery tools are to outsource the <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> to an established debt collection agency or to sell the <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> to an interested buyer to maximize the recovery. The procedures, concepts, and workflow including the guidelines of Bank Negara Malaysia involved in all the three options are outlined to have a better understanding and comparison on the different recovery activities. Literature reviews on the causes of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> and other recovery tools are discussed with the relevant examples. These <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> problems are not only affecting Malaysia, but also has been a major problem in the developed and emerging economies. The worldwide financial crisis has affected a lot of banks and other creditors with substantial amount of <b>bad</b> <b>debt.</b> Further, the increasing demand for unsecured loans including credit cards {{is one of the main}} causes for increasing of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> amount. The research is conducted with the appropriate research methodology and suitable respondents are selected as the samples. The feedbacks from the interview are reported and summarized in a tabular format to develop three different hypotheses.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{dramatic}} increase and general concern with U.

This is particularly true in terms of the potential contribution of insured patients to <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense in light of the recent shift in managed care from health maintenance organization (HMO) plans to preferred provider organization (PPO) plans (Kaiser Annual Survey Report, 2003). This study examines and attempts to explain the recent dramatic growth in <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense by focusing on and analyzing data from two Houston-area hospital providers within one healthcare system. In contrast to prior studies in which self-pay was found to be the primary source of hospital <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense (Saywell, R. M., et al., 1989; Zollinger, T. W., 1991; Weissman, Joel S., et al., 1999), this study hypothesizes that the growing hospital <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense is mainly due to the shifting trend away from HMOs to PPOs as a conscious decision by employers to share costs with employees. Compared to HMO plans, the structure of PPOs includes higher co-pays, coinsurance, and deductibles for the patient-pay portion of medical bills, creating the potential for an increase in <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> for hospital providers (from a case study). This <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense has a greater impact in the community hospital than in the Texas Medical Center hospital. ...|$|R

The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination by the new administration and increasing <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> in the banking system, pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth since 1947.

50|$|An {{additional}} factor in applying the criteria is {{the classification of}} the debt (non-business or business). A business <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> {{is defined as a}} debt created or acquired in connection with a trade or business of the taxpayer. Whereas, a non-business debt is defined as a debt that is not created or acquired in connection with a trade or business of the taxpayer. The classification is quite significant in terms of the deductibility. A non-business <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> must be completely worthless in order to be deducted. However, a business <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> is deductible whether it is partially or completely worthless.|$|R

40|$|This paper (1) {{identifies}} {{factors that}} influence changes in accounts receivable and <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> reserves and (2) measures the relation between unexpected changes in the ratio of total accounts receivable-to-sales and the ratio of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> reserves-to-sales, and (3) estimates the relation between changes in the accounts receivable-to-sales ratio and the <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> reserve-to-receivables ratio and changes in future earnings. The results show that extreme changes in both ratios are signals of declining future performance when the firm is currently profitable and are signals of better future performance when the firm is currently unprofitable. Relatively large changes in these ratios signify changes in a company’s receivable credit policy, which in turn signal changes in a company’s economic outlook. These findings are important because previous studies examining the impact of current unexpected changes in accounts receivable or <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> reserves on future earnings and stock returns sometimes report contradictory or inconsistent results...|$|R
25|$|The Triple A's chief nemesis at the time, the far-left {{terrorist}} group Montoneros, claimed up to 1,000 lives from 1970 until their elimination in 1976. They also perpetrated {{a number of}} high-profile ransom kidnappings, notably that of Jorge and Juan Born in September 1974. The Born brothers, directors of what was then one of Argentina's largest conglomerates (Bunge y Born) paid US$60 million for their release in June 1975, a world record at the time. At least US$14 million of these proceeds were laundered by David Graiver, a real-estate developer. Graiver fled Argentina in 1975 and settled in Manhattan, from where he bought controlling stake {{in a variety of}} banks in the U.S. and elsewhere. He reportedly {{died in a plane crash}} near Acapulco in August 1976, however, leaving US$45 million in <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> that resulted in the collapse of American Bank & Trust – at the time the 4th largest bank failure in U.S. history. District Attorney Robert Morgenthau was skeptical that Graiver died in the crash, and indicted Graiver for the failure of American Bank & Trust; Graiver's banks in Argentina and elsewhere also failed. New York Judge Arnold Fraiman ultimately ruled in January 1979 that Graiver was deceased, although he did so with reservations.|$|E

Examples are accumulated depreciation against equipment, and allowance for <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> (also known as allowance for doubtful accounts) against accounts receivable. United States GAAP utilizes the term contra for specific accounts only and doesn't recognize {{the second half of}} a transaction as a contra, thus the term is restricted to accounts that are related. For example, sales returns and allowance and sales discounts are contra revenues with respect to sales, as the balance of each contra (a debit) is the opposite of sales (a credit). To understand the actual value of sales, one must net the contras against sales, which gives rise to the term net sales (meaning net of the contras).|$|E
