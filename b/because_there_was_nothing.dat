25|$|Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{said that}} <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> like a Canadian TARP program, {{he did not}} think Canadians were as angry as Americans. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty {{expressed}} sympathy with the protests, citing high unemployment amongst the youth. Comparing Canada to the U.S., he said that unlike the U.S., Canada has a progressive income tax system that favors the vulnerable, and the government has regulated and supervised its financial institutions.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, he {{was given}} his first parish assignment, the obscure barrio of Banay-banay. He {{was told by the}} other priests not to stay long there <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> much to do there, to which he replied “I will look for {{something}} to do.” He visited practically every house in his parish, meeting with everyone in the process. Up to now, the people in the place which he served for two-and-a-half years remember the tall, kindly priest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{gave him}} my promise <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> else to do. I was pledged to--to him in the church at White Sage. It can't be changed. I've got to marry--Father Naab's eldest son." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> no {{need for}} {{salvation}} <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> from which we must be saved ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can, sir, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> missing {{except what}} he had on. I have all his things {{properly}} counted, and everything is there." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Man's {{knowledge}} of matter is {{knowledge of}} its forms of motion, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> {{in this world}} except matter in motion and this motion must assume certain forms." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Maze was a {{woman who}} never {{measured}} her terms, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> large enough to measure them with, and perhaps because in their utmost expansion they were a tight fit for her emotions.|$|E
60|$|But Symon still said nothing. He was {{standing}} {{as still as}} a statue, and looking steadily at the black velvet behind the glass screen. He {{was looking at the}} black velvet <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> else to look at. St. Paul's Penny was gone.|$|E
60|$|So <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> else to do, Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter, {{tired and}} hungry and angry, started for their homes beside the Laughing Brook. And Jimmy Skunk, also tired and hungry and angry, started off up the Crooked Little Path {{to look for}} some beetles.|$|E
30|$|This {{optimization}} {{is closely}} related to our example <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> that prevents to have actions in the policy that are necessary to fulfill obligations, but their execution leads to activate other obligations simultaneously.|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{are showing}} remarkably bad form, Tony,” he said. “What {{is the matter}} with you? In your case it can’t <b>be</b> worry, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> a man could wish for you {{apparently}} haven’t got.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter {{looked a}} little disappointed, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> he likes better than to be the bearer of news. [...] "I suppose," [...] said he politely, [...] "that you will be {{building}} a nest pretty soon yourself, Redwing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] said Lucy, {{who took}} nothing by her move, simply <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to take; [...] "think over it--think over it, my dear life; {{and if you}} did set your mind on any one--why, then--then maybe I might help you to a sight of him." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{boys were}} eager to see the cargo which had given them so much alarm, and had also {{possibly}} been {{the cause of the}} brig's abandonment by her original crew; therefore they went below on a tour of investigation, which was not very satisfactory <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> but a quantity of casks to be seen.|$|E
60|$|The {{village was}} a {{primitive}} one. Locks were deemed unnecessary {{in most of}} the cottages, probably <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> worth stealing within them. Gildart lifted the latch and entered. A fire, nearly out, with a large piece of coal on it, burned in the grate. The flicker of this was sufficient to illuminate the boudoir faintly.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, it is {{possible}} that the torsion coefficients are constant on the fibres of PM. Equivalently, they no longer depend on the Lie group G <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> left to normalize, although <b>there</b> may still <b>be</b> some torsion. The three remaining cases assume this.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have noticed}} nothing {{the matter with}} her health, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing.</b> But, Mr. Melbury, I have seen your {{daughter}} several times by accident. I have admired her infinitely, and I was coming {{to ask you if}} I may become better acquainted with her--pay my addresses to her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' he said, irritated, 'I don't want {{to serve}} you, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> to serve. What {{you want me to}} serve, <b>is</b> <b>nothing,</b> mere nothing. It isn't even you, it is your mere female quality. And I wouldn't give a straw for your female ego--it's a rag doll.' ...|$|R
60|$|Before midnight the {{conflagration}} in {{the portion}} of the city where we had sought refuge, had so far subsided, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> left for the flames to feed upon, that only glowing embers, and the blackened walls of the Capitol could be seen; but the night was turned into day because of the fires {{at the other end of}} the town.|$|E
60|$|Tommy's meditations {{ended in}} a series of yells as loud as his shrill little voice could make them, and he thought some one answered. But it must have been an echo, for no one came; and after another rampage round his prison, the poor boy nestled down among the leaves, and went fast asleep <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> else to do.|$|E
6000|$|And {{then she}} went on saying [...] "poor dear," [...] saying it {{presently}} <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more had come into her mind. She desired supremely to be his comfort, and {{in a little while}} she was acting comfort so poorly that she perceived her own failure. And that increased her failure, and that increased her paralysing sense of failure....|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Watson," [...] said he, as he {{rose from}} the table and paced up and down the room, [...] "You are most long-suffering, but if I have told you nothing in the last three days, it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to tell. Even now this report from Paris does not help us much." ...|$|R
60|$|However, {{there they}} found themselves. And another {{extraordinary}} {{part of the}} matter was, that {{they seemed to have}} come there, by a silent understanding. Yet when they got <b>there,</b> they <b>were</b> a little confused by being <b>there,</b> which <b>was</b> the strangest part of all; <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> naturally confusing in a Fountain. We all know that.|$|R
50|$|Another {{view of the}} Buddhist {{theory of}} the self, {{especially}} in early Buddhism, is that the Buddhist theory is essentially an eliminativist theory. According to this understanding, the self {{can not be reduced}} to a bundle <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> that answers to the concept of a self. Consequently, the idea of a self must be eliminated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{is going}} on well, Matteo, {{and we did not}} wake you, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> for you to do. We have already passed in knives and {{javelins}} to the sailors, and they are at work cutting through two planks in their bulkhead; after which we shall be able to meet in the next hold, arm ourselves, and fall upon the Genoese when the opportunity offers." ...|$|E
60|$|I skipped {{back with}} much agility, {{also a little}} to one side, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> else to do, {{reflecting}} {{in a kind of}} inconsequent way, that after all Zikali's Great Medicine was not worth a curse. The lion landed on my side of the wall and reared itself upon its hind legs before getting to business, towering high above me but slightly to my left.|$|E
60|$|The {{reception}} room seemed a mile square, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> in it except some rows of books, on unpainted white-pine bookshelves, a cracked marble-top table, a rag rug, a hairless horsehair sofa {{and two or}} three chairs. Yes, there was a picture on the wall, a colored crayon drawing of a cluster of pansies. I looked around for the portrait of Andrew Jackson and the pinecone hanging basket but they were not there.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{compares the}} tasks of part-of-speech (POS) tagging and word-sense-tagging or {{disambiguation}} (WSD), and argues that the tasks are not related by fineness of grain or anything like that, but are quite different kinds of task, particularly <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> in POS corresponding to sense novelty. The paper also argues for the reintegration of sub-tasks that are being separated for evaluation. ...|$|R
50|$|The Council has {{the power}} to block supply and force a {{government}} to election but cannot itself <b>be</b> dissolved early, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> in the Tasmanian constitution to allow that. The constitution can only be altered by a vote in each house of parliament, so the Council's rights cannot be reduced, and it cannot be abolished, without its agreement.|$|R
50|$|He {{declares}} {{that he would}} not write his prophesies and revelations <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> he could add to the plan of salvation that his forefathers didn't already write first. Besides, there wasn't enough room left on these plates to write very much. But Jarom recommends that his readers go to the other plates that have all the records of the wars between the Nephites and Lamanites.|$|R
6000|$|The others {{stood on}} the blanket and watched the strange sight anxiously. Of course, the Lion couldn't [...] "hold on tight" [...] <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to hold to, and he swayed {{from side to side}} as if likely to fall off any moment. Still, he managed to stick to the Woozy's back until they were close to the walls of the city, when he leaped to the ground. Next moment the Woozy came dashing back at full speed.|$|E
60|$|Trot sighed {{again and}} watched the {{wonderful}} Magic Flower, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> else to do. Just now a lovely group of pink peonies budded and bloomed, but soon they faded away, and a mass of deep blue lilies took their place. Then some yellow chrysanthemums blossomed on the plant, and when they had opened all their petals and reached perfection, they {{gave way to a}} lot of white floral balls spotted with crimson--a flower Trot had never seen before.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had no objection," [...] Norgate remarked, a {{few hours}} later, [...] "to lunching with you at the Berkeley--very good lunch it was, too--but to dine with you in Soho {{certainly}} seems to require some explanation. Why do we do it? Is it my punishment for a day's inactivity, because if so, I beg to protest. I did my best with Hebblethwaite this morning, {{and it was only}} <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> for him to tell me that I heard nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|Of all things, an indiscreet {{tampering}} with {{the trade of}} provisions is the most dangerous, and it is always worst in the time when men are most disposed to it,--that is, {{in the time of}} scarcity; <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> on which the passions of men are so violent, and their judgment so weak, and on which there exists such a multitude of ill-founded popular prejudices.|$|R
50|$|No {{penguins}} {{live on the}} Antarctic Plateau <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> {{for them}} to eat. Few or no birds fly over the Antarctic Plateau and if any arrive <b>there,</b> they have <b>been</b> blown in by huge blizzards - usually to their deaths by freezing, thirst or both. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> no land animals on Antarctic or Polar Plateau, except for nematodes, springtails, mites, midges, human beings and their laboratory animals.|$|R
5000|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} supporters {{make several}} arguments {{in support of}} their position. Gail Mathabane likens prohibitions on same-sex marriage to past U.S. prohibitions on interracial marriage. Fernando Espuelas argues that same-sex marriage should be allowed because same-sex marriage extends a civil right to a minority group. According to an American history scholar, Nancy Cott, [...] "there really <b>is</b> no comparison, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>is</b> like marriage except marriage." ...|$|R
