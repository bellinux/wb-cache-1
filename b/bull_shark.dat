5|$|Since the pigeye shark so {{strongly}} resembles the <b>bull</b> <b>shark,</b> morphology-based phylogenetic studies {{have considered the}} two species to be closely related. Neither this nor any other arrangement is strongly supported by molecular phylogenetic research, which to date has been inconclusive regarding this shark's evolutionary relationship to other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|The attacks at Matawan are {{the subject}} of the National Geographic Channel {{documentary}} Attacks of the Mystery Shark (2002), which examines the possibility that a <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> was responsible for killing Stanley Fisher and Lester Stilwell; Discovery Channel's Blood in the Water (2009); and Smithsonian Channel's The Real Story: Jaws (2011).|$|E
5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the <b>bull</b> <b>shark,</b> tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bull</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are able}} to {{regulate}} themselves to live in either fresh or salt water. It can live in fresh water for its entire life, {{but this does not}} happen, mostly due to reproduction. Young <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> [...] leave the brackish water in which they are born and move out into the sea to breed. While theoretically, <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> to live in purely fresh water may be possible, the <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> that were being experimented on had died within four years. The stomach was opened and all that was found were two small, unidentifiable fishes. The cause of death could have been starvation since the primary food source for <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> resides in salt water.|$|R
25|$|The <b>bull</b> <b>shark's</b> diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} bony fish and small <b>sharks,</b> including other <b>bull</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{but can also}} include turtles, birds, dolphins, terrestrial mammals, crustaceans, echinoderms, and stingrays. They hunt in murky waters where it is harder for the prey to see the <b>shark</b> coming. <b>Bull</b> <b>sharks</b> {{have been known to}} use the bump-and-bite technique to attack their prey. After the first initial contact, they continue to bite and tackle prey until they are unable to flee.|$|R
40|$|As apex predators, sharks play an {{important}} role shaping their respective marine communities through predation and associated risk effects. Understanding the predatory dynamics of sharks within communities is, therefore, necessary to establish effective ecologically based conservation strategies. We employed non-lethal sampling methods to investigate the feeding ecology of <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus leucas) using stable isotope analysis within a subtropical marine community in the southwest Indian Ocean. The main objectives of this study were to investigate and compare the predatory role that sub-adult and adult <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> play within a top predatory teleost fish community. <b>Bull</b> <b>sharks</b> had significantly broader niche widths compared to top predatory teleost assemblages with a wide and relatively enriched range of δ 13 C values relative to the local marine community. This suggests that <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> forage from a more diverse range of δ 13 C sources over a wider geographical range than the predatory teleost community. Adult <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> appeared to exhibit a shift towards consistently higher trophic level prey from an expanded foraging range compared to sub-adults, possibly due to increased mobility linked with size. Although predatory teleost fish are also capable of substantial migrations, <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> may have the ability to exploit a more diverse range of habitats and appeared to prey on a wider diversity of larger prey. This suggests that <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> play {{an important}} predatory role within their respective marine communities and adult sharks in particular may shape and link ecological processes o...|$|R
5|$|Juvenile Caribbean reef {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks {{such as the}} tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> (C. leucas). Few parasites are known for this species; one is a dark {{variegated}} leech often seen trailing from its first dorsal fin. Off northern Brazil, juveniles seek out cleaning stations occupied by yellownose gobies (Elacatinus randalli), which clean the sharks of parasites while they lie still on the bottom. Horse-eye jacks (Caranx latus) and bar jacks (Carangoides ruber) routinely school around Caribbean reef sharks.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez bribes DEA agent Ed Killifer and escapes. Meanwhile, Sanchez's henchman Dario and {{his crew}} ambush Leiter and his wife Della and take Leiter to an {{aquarium}} owned by one of Sanchez's accomplices, Milton Krest. Sanchez has Leiter lowered into a tank holding a <b>bull</b> <b>shark.</b> When Bond learns Sanchez has escaped, he returns to Leiter's house to find Leiter has been maimed and that Della has been murdered—and by implication raped. Bond, with Leiter's friend Sharkey, start their own investigation. They discover a marine research centre run by Krest, where Sanchez has hidden cocaine and a submarine for smuggling.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark can be most {{reliably}} {{distinguished from}} the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> {{by the number of}} precaudal (before the caudal fin) vertebrae (89–95 in C. amboinensis versus 101–123 in C. leucas). Externally, it has a greater size difference between its dorsal fins (first-to-second height ratio >3.1:1 versus ≤3.1:1 in C. leucas) and the notch in its anal fin margin forms an acute angle (versus a right angle in C. leucas). This species also usually has fewer tooth rows in the lower jaw (10–12 on each side versus 12–13 in C. leucas).|$|E
25|$|One {{or several}} <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> {{may have been}} {{responsible}} for the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, which were the inspiration for Peter Benchley's novel Jaws. The speculation of <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> possibly being responsible is based on two fatal bites occurring in brackish and fresh water.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to bony fish, {{with the exception}} of the coelacanth, the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the <b>bull</b> <b>shark,</b> which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the <b>bull</b> <b>shark,</b> prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the <b>bull</b> <b>shark,</b> the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E

5|$|The {{tiger shark}} {{is a member}} of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also {{including}} the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the blue shark (Prionace glauca), lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), and <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus leucas).|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} from a depth of , the blacktip reef shark is usually found in water only a few meters deep, and can often be seen swimming close to shore with its dorsal fin exposed. Younger sharks prefer shallow, sandy flats, while older sharks are most common around reef ledges and can also be found near reef drop-offs. This species has also been reported from brackish estuaries and lakes in Madagascar, and freshwater environments in Malaysia, though it is not able to tolerate low salinity to the same degree as the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> (C.leucas). At Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, blacktip reef sharks congregate in the channels between reef flats during low tide and travel to the mangroves when the water rises. There is equivocal evidence that sharks from the northern and southern extremes of its distribution are migratory.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{has generally}} nocturnal habits and {{spends much of}} the day buried in the substrate. It has been known to follow the rising tide to forage in water barely deep enough to cover its body. This species preys upon small invertebrates, including crustaceans, annelid worms, and bivalve and gastropod molluscs, and bony fishes. It mainly targets benthic and burrowing organisms, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. In Delaware Bay, this species feeds predominantly on the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa and the blood worm Glycera dibranchiata, and its overall dietary composition is virtually identical to that of the roughtail stingray (D.centroura), with which it shares the bay. The bluntnose stingray is preyed upon by larger fishes such as the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus leucas). Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium brevissime and Kotorella pronosoma, the monogenean Listrocephalos corona, and the trematodes Monocotyle pricei and Multicalyx cristata.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bull</b> <b>sharks</b> have {{an unusual}} migratory pattern in {{comparison}} to other sharks. They are found in rivers all over the world. They give birth in the fresh water of rivers. The young <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> are free from predators while they {{grow up in the}} river before they go out to the sea to find mates.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bull</b> <b>sharks</b> can {{thrive in}} both salt and fresh water and can travel far up rivers. They {{have been known}} to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, {{although}} few freshwater human-shark interactions have been recorded. Larger sized <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> are probably responsible for the majority of near-shore shark attacks, including many bites attributed to other species.|$|R

5|$|The pigeye shark is {{a largely}} solitary animal, though {{occasionally}} several individuals {{may be found}} at the same location. In the Mozambique Channel, it outnumbers the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> on the east side while the opposite is true on the west side, suggesting there may be competitive exclusion between these similar species. Parasites documented from the pigeye shark include the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini, the copepods Pandarus smithii and P. cranchii, and the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, Cathetocephalus sp., Floriceps minacanthus, Heteronybelinia australis, Otobothrium australe, O. crenacolle, and Protogrillotia sp. Young pigeye sharks are potentially vulnerable to predation by larger sharks. The natural mortality for juveniles in Cleveland Bay has been measured at no more than 5% per year; this rate is comparable to that in juvenile bull sharks, and is much lower than in juvenile blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) or lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
25|$|The <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> is diadromous, {{meaning they}} can swim between salt and fresh water with ease. These fish also are {{euryhaline}} fish, {{able to adapt}} {{to a wide range of}} salinities. The <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> is one of the few cartilaginous fishes that have been reported in freshwater systems. Many of the euryhaline fish are bony fish such as salmon and tilapia and are not closely related to bull sharks. Evolutionary assumptions can be made to help explain this sort of evolutionary disconnect, one being that the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> encountered a population bottleneck that occurred during the last ice age. This bottleneck may have separated the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> from the rest of the Elasmobranchii subclass and favored the genes for an osmoregulatory system.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} tagged {{and recorded}} {{the movements of}} young bull sharks in the Caloosahatchee River estuary. Specifically, they were testing {{to find out what}} determined the movement of the young bull sharks. It was found that the young bull sharks synchronously moved downriver when the environmental conditions changed. This large movement of young bull sharks were found to be moving as a response rather than other external factors such as predators. An interesting find was that the movement was directly related to the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> conserving energy for itself. One way the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> is able to conserve energy is that when the tidal flow changes, the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> uses the tidal flow in order to conserve energy as it moves downriver. Another way for the <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> to conserve energy is to decrease the amount of energy needed to osmoregulate the surrounding environment.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bull</b> <b>sharks</b> Carcharhinus leucas {{are common}} {{along the coast}} of Reunion Island (South-West Indian Ocean) and were {{suspected}} to aggregate in the vicinity of an aquaculture farm in Saint-Paul Bay on the west coast. In order to understand the behaviour and interaction of <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> near aquaculture cages at Saint-Paul Bay, we deployed an experimental unbaited stationary video camera. From 175 hours of recording during daylight hours from March to April 2012, eight individual female <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> (seven adults and one immature) were identified based on their natural markings. These sharks were resighted between 3 and 45 times. Residency analysis revealed site attachment under the aquaculture cages for at least three individuals {{over the course of the}} study. Recorded behaviours included intraspecific social interactions such as synchronised swimming. Social interactions and relatively strong paired associations for two pairs of females suggest some level of sociality among <b>bull</b> <b>sharks</b> around Reunion Island. Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of unbaited video systems to monitor the behaviour of adult coastal sharks...|$|R

25|$|The <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus leucas), {{also known}} as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Lake Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark {{commonly}} found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bull</b> <b>shark</b> prefers {{coastal water}} {{which is less}} than 100 feet in depth. This is mostly due to their feeding patterns, since they prefer murky waters.
