5|$|I {{have been}} {{thinking}} how very gently I have always <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> I {{have never had a}} violent shove all my life. The only desire which I can have is like David to serve my own generation by the will of God, and then fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} concerns facing the government in exile in 1940 was the situation of Belgian refugees in the United Kingdom. By 1940, at least 15,000 Belgian civilians {{had arrived in the}} United Kingdom, many of them without their possessions. The refugees had originally <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by the British government, however in September 1940, the government established a Central Service of Refugees to provide material assistance and employment for Belgians in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result of}} {{this section of the}} Act is that any case worth less than £25,000 <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> in the County Courts, any case worth between £25,000 and £50,000 <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> in either the County Court or the High Court {{depending}} on the complexity and any case worth more than £50,000 <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> in the High Court. Claims worth under £3,000 <b>are</b> automatically <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by the small claims track of the County Court. This has drastically speeded up proceedings in the High Court by making sure that only [...] "important" [...] and valuable cases <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by them.|$|R
5000|$|The Constitution {{features}} a distinct separation of powers. Legislative power <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> in Chapter I, and is vested in the Federal Parliament (section 1). Executive power <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> in Chapter II, and is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representative (section 61). The judicature <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> in Chapter III, and is vested in the Federal High Court and [...] "in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, {{and in such}} other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction" [...] (section 71).|$|R

5|$|In early 1973, the Architectural Review {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} convert the Albert Bridge into a landscaped public park and pedestrian footpath across the river. The proposal proved very popular with the area's residents, and a May 1973 campaign led by John Betjeman, Sybil Thorndike and Laurie Lee raised a petition of 2,000signatures for the bridge to be permanently closed to traffic. Although the GLC reopened the bridge to traffic in July 1973, it also announced its intention {{to proceed with the}} Architectural Review scheme once legal matters had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} European {{outbreak}} of smallpox was in 1972 in Yugoslavia, after a pilgrim from Kosovo {{returned from the}} Middle East, where he had contracted the virus. The epidemic infected 175 people, causing 35 deaths. Authorities declared martial law, enforced quarantine, and undertook widespread re-vaccination of the population, enlisting {{the help of the}} WHO. In two months, the outbreak was over. Prior to this, there had been a smallpox outbreak in May–July 1963 in Stockholm, Sweden, brought from the Far East by a Swedish sailor; this had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by quarantine measures and vaccination of the local population.|$|E
5|$|The work {{assumes that}} the royal legal system would still address some issues that later would have <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by ecclesiastical courts. Clergy are not only {{to take part in}} the shire court, but could be summoned to answer charges in the court. It also sets out the various courts that were {{established}} and their jurisdiction. It takes for granted that the Anglo-Saxon laws of England are still in effect. It also addresses the administration of forest law under Henry I. Another new concern in the Leges is law covering the roadways and highways.|$|E

50|$|The term {{abdominal}} surgery broadly covers surgical procedures that involve opening the abdomen. Surgery of each abdominal organ <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> separately {{in connection with}} the description of that organ (see stomach, kidney, liver, etc.) Diseases affecting the abdominal cavity <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> generally under their own names (e.g. appendicitis).|$|R
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|These events {{coincided with}} the {{accession}} of Nero to the imperial throne in Rome, and the young emperor decided to react vigorously. The war, which was the only major foreign campaign of his reign, began with rapid success for the Roman forces, led by the able general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. They overcame the forces loyal to Tiridates, installed their own candidate, Tigranes VI, on the Armenian throne, and left the country. The Romans were aided {{by the fact that}} the Parthian king Vologases was embroiled in the suppression of a series of revolts in his own country. As soon as these had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with,</b> however, the Parthians turned their attention to Armenia, and after a couple of years of inconclusive campaigning, inflicted a heavy defeat on the Romans in the Battle of Rhandeia.|$|E
5|$|After having Lord Rivers arrested, the two dukes {{moved to}} Stony Stratford where Richard {{informed}} the young king of a plot aimed at denying him {{his role as}} Protector whose perpetrators had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> He proceeded to escort the young king to London where they entered on 4 May displaying the carriages of weapons Earl Rivers had taken with his 2000 man army. Richard first accommodated Edward in the Bishop's apartments, then, on the Duke of Buckingham's suggestion, in the Royal Apartments of the Tower of London where kings customarily awaited their coronation. On hearing the news of her brother's arrest on 30 April, the Dowager Queen fled to sanctuary in Westminster Abbey together with her son by her first marriage Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, her five daughters and her youngest son Richard, Duke of York. On 16 June Elizabeth Woodville agreed {{to hand over the}} younger prince to the Archbishop of Canterbury so that he might attend his brother Edward's coronation, still planned for 22 June.|$|E

5|$|Much of the post-race debate {{centred on}} the Red Bulls' clash {{at the front}} of the field on lap 40. Both Webber and Vettel blamed each other for the crash. Team {{principal}} Christian Horner implied Webber remained partially responsible for failing to give Vettel enough room on the run to the corner, and he was noticeably frustrated and angry at both of his drivers for wasting a potential 1–2 finish. Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko insisted the team did not favour Vettel through their strategy and also offered the perspective that Vettel had to attack for fear of backing off into the clutches of Hamilton behind. McLaren chief engineer Tim Goss said the crash had prevented Red Bull from securing a 1–2 finish, but understood why Webber switched to a different engine mode as he noted that one of Vettel's engines had failed earlier in the season. He felt that the battle between both McLaren and Red Bull drivers for both championships would continue unabated. Red Bull held a meeting at their factory in Milton Keynes four days after the race, and all people in attendance believed the situation had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> The incident between Webber and Vettel is widely seen by the media as a key moment in the rivalry between the two drivers, which had started when Vettel collided with Webber at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and both drivers were forced to retire.|$|E
25|$|Transport for London {{proposes to}} upgrade the line eventually, but not until other deep-level lines have <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> This will include new {{signalling}} and new trains, enabling a maximum frequency of 27 trains per hour.

25|$|Testing {{revealed}} that the XB-42 suffered from some instability as excessive yaw was encountered, as well as vibration and poor engine cooling - all problems that could probably have <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> Due to the ventral vertical stabilizer and rudder surface set's tip being located underneath the fuselage, careful handling during taxiing, takeoff, and landing was required because of limited ground clearance.|$|E
25|$|This {{criticism}} was strongly {{rejected by the}} prosecutor's office on 30 November. It claimed that the corruption in the Sukhumi administration could only be investigated properly once Khajimba's allies O.L. Berulava and T.V. Parulua had been take of the case, and that corruption in other cities had not been ignored since misdealings in the Ochamchira district administration had also <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> It furthermore criticized possibly corrupt affairs during Khajimba's own time as Prime Minister.|$|E

25|$|Decades {{before the}} {{formation}} of the modern United Kingdom in 1707, English law identified anal sex and zoophilia as offences punishable by hanging {{as a result of the}} Buggery Act 1533, which was pioneered by Henry VIII. The Act was the country's first civil sodomy law; such offences having previously <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by the ecclesiastical courts. Whilst it was repealed in 1553 on the accession of Mary I, Elizabeth I re-enacted it in 1563. James Pratt and John Smith were the last two to be executed for sodomy in 1835.|$|E
25|$|Food {{security}} – Food security {{requires that}} all people at all times have both physical and economic access to basic food. According to the United Nations, the overall availability of food is not a problem, rather the problem often is the poor distribution of food {{and a lack of}} purchasing power. In the past, food security problems have <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> at both national and global levels. However, their impacts are limited. According to UN, the key is to tackle the problems relating to access to assets, work and assured income (related to economic security).|$|E
