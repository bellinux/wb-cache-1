40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze for {{resonant}} frequency, vibration transmissibility and damping ratio of multi-layered corrugated structures using a random vibration test. Methods: The random vibration test was performed by the ASTM D 4728 specifications using two paperboards (S 120, K 180) and two types of flutes (A/F, B/F). Damping ratio of the multi-layered corrugated structures was estimated using a theoretical equation derived from the measured resonant frequency and transmissibility. Results: The resonant frequency and vibration transmissibility of the multi-layered corrugated structures of K 180 and <b>B-flute</b> were higher than those of S 120 and A-flute, respectively; however, the damping ratio of each sample had the opposite tendency. The resonant frequency was inversely proportional to the sample thickness and static stress; vibration transmissibility and damping ratio were not correlated with sample thickness and static stress. In addition, we developed a mathematical model of the resonant frequency with variables of sample thickness and static stress. Conclusions: Results of this study can be useful for environment-friendly and optimal packaging design sinc...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to design a susceptor packaging to bake flaky pastry dough (puff) in microwave oven. Then, the performance of the product was evaluated through microwave testing. Paperboard, corrugated board <b>B-flute</b> and metalized polyethylene terephthalate (mpet) were used to design susceptor packaging. Quality parameters of puffs such as weight loss (WL), colour changes at top and bottom surfaces (^E), specific volume (SV) and hardness (H) were obtained as a result of the application on susceptor packaging through microwave testing. Microwave baked puffs without packaging application and conventionally baked puffs were used for comparison. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to determine significant differences between microwave powers used and baking time for each response variables in this study. As baking time increased, all the quality parameters increased. Microwave baked puffs had some quality defects such as lack of colour, become soggy and brittle when cold. It was possible to improve the quality of microwave baked puffs by using susceptor packaging. The colour of puffs were changed into desirable rich brown and gave the texture similar to the conventionally baked ones at three level power used. However, microwave baked puffs with susceptor packaging have a lower volume at all power used...|$|E
