They appear in The Hobbit and in The Lord of the Rings, but their complex history is {{described}} more fully in The Silmarillion.

500|$|Vonnegut had <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> his war {{experiences}} at Dresden {{ever since he}} returned from the war, but {{had never been able}} to write anything acceptable to himself or his publishers—Chapter 1 of Slaughterhouse-Five tells of his difficulties. Released in 1969, the novel rocketed Vonnegut to fame. It tells of the life of Billy Pilgrim, who like Vonnegut was born in 1922 and survives the bombing of Dresden. The story is told in a non-linear fashion, with many of the story's climaxes—Billy's death in 1976, his kidnapping by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore nine years earlier, and the execution of Billy's friend Edgar Derby in the ashes of Dresden for stealing a teapot—disclosed in the story's first pages. In 1970, he was also a correspondent in Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War.|$|E
500|$|He {{left for}} New York in February 1831 and {{released}} a third volume of poems, simply titled Poems. The book was financed {{with help from}} his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones that Poe had <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> commanding officers. It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as [...] "Second Edition," [...] and including a page saying, [...] "To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated". The book once again reprinted the long poems [...] "Tamerlane" [...] and [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] but also six previously unpublished poems, including early versions of [...] "To Helen", [...] "Israfel", and [...] "The City in the Sea". He returned to Baltimore to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831. His elder brother Henry had been in ill health, {{in part due to}} problems with alcoholism, and he died on August 1, 1831.|$|E

500|$|From the 1990s onward an {{increasing}} amount {{of literature on}} Canadian comics has appeared, in both official languages. [...] Books such as Guardians of the North (1992) and Invaders from the North (2006) appeared by comics historian John Bell, who became senior archivist at Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa. [...] American magazine Alter Ego ran a special issue on Canadian comics in 2004. [...] In French, Michel Viau wrote a book on francophone comics called BDQ: Répertoire des publications de bandes dessinées au Québec des origines à nos jours (2000). [...] Bart Beaty and Jeet Heer have <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> comics academically and professionally, and regularly have articles educating the public on comics published in newspapers such as the National Post and the Boston Globe, as well as comics and literary magazines. [...] Canadian feminist scholars such as Mary Louise Adams, Mona Gleason, and Janice Dickin McGinnis have done research into the anti-crime comics campaigns of the late 1940s and 1950s, {{from the point of}} view of the moral panic and social and legal history of the era, and the sociology of sexuality.|$|E
500|$|While Sherwood Smith {{originally}} wrote Crown Duel as {{two separate}} books entitled Crown Duel (1997) and Court Duel (1998), she considered them as [...] "one story." [...] Both novels explore the fictional land of Sartorias-deles, {{the world she}} has <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> since her youth. Smith grew up wondering why [...] " [...] the way [...] " [...] for instance observing, [...] "Why were the cities so clean, I wondered when I was a kid. I knew about sewers, etc. Why {{is it safe to}} drink from a stream there, and not here?". She conceived Sartorias-deles as a world where, {{over the course of several}} centuries, humans of many different races entered through [...] "worldgates" [...] and were influenced by the culture of its indigenous beings. According to Smith, while her invented world was not perfect, it contains fewer problems than Earth has endured, such as disease and overpopulation. She wrote, [...] "basically, the indigenous life forms, appalled by these things that came through and started multiplying and spreading out, carrying their diseases and wars, tried to fix things for the humans... Their history is not all happy, it's very strange, and humans still have many human problems, but in other ways they are somewhat different from [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|He wrote three discourses {{under his}} own name and one pseudonymous book [...] in 1849. He wrote The Lily in the Field and the Bird of the Air.

This he began with the confessions of the esthete and the ethicist in Either/Or and the highest good peace in the discourse of that same book. His goal {{has always been to}} help people become religious but specifically Christian religious. He summed his position up earlier in his book, The Point of View of My Work as an Author, but this book was not published until 1859.|$|E

2500|$|During 1897 Both Lukens and Muir {{were active}} in {{different}} areas of the evolving conservation movement. [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> the forests, doing what little I can to save them," [...] Muir wrote to a colleague, Henry Fairfield Osborne. Lukens that year began his campaign for watershed protection of the San Gabriel Reserve. He advocated fire protection, tree planting and removal of stockmen from the reserve. He and others undertook two pack trips into the reserve in 1897 and one expedition in 1998. Lukens wrote little, but was a prolific photographer, documenting trees, rocks and conditions during the pack trips. Lukens was often quoted in newspapers, because he gave talks to community groups about his ideas for preserving the watersheds. In an 1898 article in the Los Angeles Times, Lukens was quoted terming the driving of stock in the mountains as [...] "Hoofed Locusts." [...] His argument (and Muir's) was that sheep destroyed the mountain meadows by grazing away all vegetation and that stockman were guilty of setting wildfires {{at the end of the}} season to create more meadow for the following year.|$|E

6000|$|He {{differed}} from Longfellow in often speaking of his contemporaries. He spoke of them frankly, {{but with an}} appreciative rather than a censorious criticism. Of Longfellow himself he said that day, when I told him I had <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> him, {{and he seemed to}} me a man without error, that he could think of but one error in him, and that was an error of taste, of almost merely literary taste. It was at an earlier time that he talked of Lowell, after his death, and told me that Lowell once in the fever of his anti-slavery apostolate had written him, urging him strongly, as a matter of duty, to come out for the cause he had himself so much at heart. Afterwards Lowell wrote again, owning himself wrong in his appeal, which he had come to recognize as invasive. [...] "He was ten years younger than I," [...] said the doctor.|$|E
6000|$|As ill {{luck would}} have it, that very same evening, at his return to town, Thomas Newcome entered Bays's club, of which, at our request, {{he had become a}} member during his last visit to England, and there was Sir Barnes, as usual, on his way homewards from the City. Barnes was writing at a table, and sealing and closing a letter, as he saw the Colonel enter; he thought he had been a little inattentive and curt with his uncle in the morning; had remarked, perhaps, the {{expression}} of disapproval on the Colonel's countenance. He simpered up to his uncle as the latter entered the clubroom, and apologised for his haste when they met in the City in the morning--all City men were so busy! [...] "And I have <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> that little affair, just as you came in," [...] he said; [...] "quite a moving letter to Lady Kew, I assure you, and I do hope and trust we shall have a favourable answer in a day or two." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Max Muller, after a {{treatise}} on Agni and other fire-gods, consecrates two pages to 'Fire Totems.' 'If we are assured {{that there are}} some dark points left, and that these might be illustrated and rendered more intelligible by what are called fire totems among the Red Indians of North America, let us have as much light as we can get' (ii. 804). Alas! I never heard of fire totems before. Probably some one has <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> them, somewhere, unless we owe them to Mr. Max Muller's own researches. Of course, he cites no authority for his fire totems. 'The fire totem, we are told, would thus naturally have become the god of the Indians.' 'We are told'--where, and by whom? Not a hint is given on the subject, so we must leave the doctrine of fire totems to its mysterious discoverer. 'If others prefer to call Prometheus a fire totem, no one would object, if only it would help us {{to a better understanding of}} Prometheus' (ii. 810). Who are the 'others' who speak of a Greek 'culture-hero' by the impossibly fantastic name of 'a fire totem'? ...|$|E
60|$|Finally {{we stood}} in a level, narrow valley (a valley that had been created by the terrific march of some old time irruption) and on either hand towered the two steep peaks of Vesuvius. The one we had to climb --the one that {{contains}} the active volcano--seemed about eight hundred or one thousand feet high, and looked almost too straight-up-and-down for any man to climb, and certainly no mule could climb it with a man on his back. Four of these native pirates will carry you to the top in a sedan chair, if you wish it, but suppose they were to slip and let you fall, --is it likely that you would ever stop rolling? Not this side of eternity, perhaps. We left the mules, sharpened our finger-nails, and began the ascent I have <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> so long, at twenty minutes to six in the morning. The path led straight up a rugged sweep of loose chunks of pumice-stone, and for about every two steps forward we took, we slid back one. It was so excessively steep {{that we had to}} stop, every fifty or sixty steps, and rest a moment. To see our comrades, we had to look very nearly straight up at those above us, and very nearly straight down at those below. We stood on the summit at last--it had taken an hour and fifteen minutes to make the trip.|$|E
6000|$|The {{same sense}} of {{illusion}} still pursues me. There is some mistake in this matter. I have <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> another man's consular experiences, with which, through some mysterious medium of transmitted ideas, I find myself intimately acquainted, but in which I cannot possibly have had a personal interest. Is it not a dream altogether? The figure of that poor Doctor of Divinity looks wonderfully lifelike; so do those of the Oriental adventurer with the visionary coronet above his brow, and the moonstruck visitor of the Queen, and the poor old wanderer, seeking his native country through English highways and by-ways for almost thirty years; and so would a hundred others that I might summon up with similar distinctness. But were they more than shadows? Surely, I think not. Nor are these present pages a bit of intrusive autobiography. Let not the reader wrong me by supposing it. I never should have written with half such unreserve, had it been a portion of this life congenial with my nature, which I am living now, instead {{of a series of}} incidents and characters entirely apart from my own concerns, and on which the qualities personally proper to me could have had no bearing. Almost the only real incidents, as I see them now, were the visits of a young English friend, a scholar and a literary amateur, between whom and myself there sprung up an affectionate, and, I trust, not transitory regard. He used to come and sit or stand by my fireside, talking vivaciously and eloquently with me about literature and life, his own national characteristics and mine, with such kindly endurance of the many rough republicanisms wherewith I assailed him, and such frank and amiable assertion of all sorts of English prejudices and mistakes, that I understood his countrymen infinitely the better for him, and was almost prepared to love the intensest Englishman of them all, for his sake. It would gratify my cherished remembrance of this dear friend, if I could manage, without offending him, or letting the public know it, to introduce his name upon my page. Bright was the illumination of my dusky little apartment, as often as he made his appearance there! ...|$|E
