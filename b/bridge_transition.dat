40|$|Transition zones between bridge decks {{and rail}} tracks suffer early failure due to poor {{interaction}} between rail vehicles and sudden changes of stiffness. This {{has been an}} ongoing problem to rail industry and yet still no systematic studies {{appear to have been}} taken to maintain a gradually smoothening transmission of forces between the bridge and its approach. Differential settlement between the bridge deck and rail track in the transition zone is the fundamental issue, which negatively impacts the rail industry by causing passenger discomfort, early damage to infrastructure and vehicle components, speed reduction, and frequent maintenance cycles. Identification of mechanism of the track degradation and factors affecting is imperative to design any mitigation method for reducing track degradation rate at the <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> zone. Unfortunately this issue is still not well understood, after conducting a numbers of reviews to evaluate the key causes, and introducing a wide range of mitigation techniques. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of the available literature has been carried out to develop either a novel design framework or a mitigation technique for the <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> zone. This paper addresses three critical questions in relation to the track degradation at transition zone: (1) what are the causes of <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> track degradation?; (2) what are the available mitigation techniques in reducing the track degradation rate?; (3) what are the factors affecting on poor performance of the existing mitigation techniques?. It is found that the absence of soil-water response, dynamic loading response, and behaviour of geotechnical characteristics under long-term conditions in existing track transition design frameworks critically influence on the failures of existing mitigation techniques. This paper also evaluates some of the existing design frameworks to identify how each design framework addresses the track degradation at the <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> zone...|$|E
40|$|Differential {{settlement}} at {{the bridge}} approach between the deck and rail track on ground is often considered {{as a source of}} challenging technical and economical problem. This caused by the sudden stiffness changes between the bridge deck and the track on ground, and changes in soil stiffness of backfill and sub-grade with soil moisture content and loading history. To minimise the negative social and economic impacts due to poor performances of railway tracks at <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> zones, it is important, a special attention to be given at design, construction and maintenance stages. It is critically challenging to obtain an appropriate design solution for any given site condition and most of the existing conventional design approaches are unable to address the actual on-site behaviour due to their inherent assumptions of continuity and lack of clarifying of the local effects. An evaluation of existing design techniques is considered to estimate their contributions to a potential solution for <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> zones. This paper analyses five different approaches: the Chinese Standard, the European Standard with three different approaches, and the Australian approach. Each design approach is used to calculate the layer thicknesses, accounting critical design features such as the train speed, the axle load, the backfill subgrade condition, and the dynamic loading response. Considering correlation between track degradation and design parameters, this paper concludes that there is still a need of an optimised design approach for <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> zones...|$|E

40|$|Railway track {{components}} {{located at}} <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> zones or approach areas suffer from impact load and vibrations caused by abrupt changes in track stiffness {{on the bridge}} and the subgrade. The numerous strategies {{that can be used}} to mitigate these abrupt track stiffness changes rely on one of two concepts. The first concept is that of providing a gradual stiffness change, and the second is that of equalizing the track stiffness. A number of such mitigation methods have been developed and implemented over recent decades. Construction activities associated with these methods require various materials, processes, and uses of time, costs, and carbon emissions. In this study, eight of the most common techniques for railway <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> mitigation, including under ballast mats (UBMs), soft baseplates, under sleeper pads (USPs), rail pads, embankment treatments, transition slabs, ballast bonding, and wide sleepers, are compared. This study benchmarks the costs and carbon emissions of these eight mitigation techniques over the 50 -year lifespan of a railway system subject to identical probabilities of four environmental scenarios: a control case, extremely high temperatures, extremely low temperatures, and flash flooding. This unprecedented study systemically investigates the effectiveness of the mitigation methods while considering the effects of 30 and 100 [*]m bridge span lengths. Our results indicate that railway engineers should adopt different mitigation methods for different scenarios. The soft baseplate is the most appropriate method for a short-span bridge in the control case and the case of flash flooding, while ballast bonding is better for long-span railway bridges. Embankment treatment is recommended for both high- and low-extreme temperatures. However, its applicability is limited when the differential track stiffness is extremely high. Hence, alternatives that are 5 – 25 % more expensive are proposed in parallel. The alternative methods include ballast bonding, and the USP and UMB methods, the latter two of which are designed for different climate scenarios. These recommendations translate novel insights from the systems thinking approach into practice and will benefit the railway industry significantly over the long term, enhancing both economic and environmental sustainability...|$|E

40|$|Cyclic plastic {{deformation}} of subgrade and other engineered layers {{is generally not}} {{taken into account in}} the design of railway <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> zones, although the {{plastic deformation}} is the governing factor of frequent track deterioration. Actual stress behavior of fine grained subgrade/embankment layers under train traffic is, however, difficult to replicate using the conventional laboratory test apparatus and techniques. A new type of torsional simple shear apparatus, known as multi-ring shear apparatus, was therefore developed to evaluate the actual stress state and the corresponding cyclic plastic deformation characteristics of subgrade materials under moving wheel load conditions. Multi-ring shear test results has been validated using a theoretical model test results; the capability of the multi-ring shear apparatus for replicating the cyclic plastic deformation characteristics of subgrade under moving train wheel load conditions is thus established. This paper describes the effects of principal stress rotation (PSR) of the subgrade materials to the cyclic plastic deformation in a railroad and impacts of testing methods in evaluating the influence of principal stress rotation to the track deterioration of rail track...|$|E

This agrees very well with the corresponding Derjaguin approximation for the effective interaction between the two cylinders, while capillary forces originating from the extension of the liquid bridge turn out to be more important at large separations. In addition, we are able to infer from the wetting characteristics of the individual colloids the first-order transition of the liquid bridge connecting two colloidal particles to the ruptured state. While specific to cylindrical colloids, the results presented here provide also an outline for identifying critical Casimir forces acting on bridged colloidal particles as such, and for analyzing the <b>bridging</b> <b>transition</b> between them.

40|$|Rail track {{undergoes}} complex loading patterns under {{moving traffic}} conditions compared to roads {{due to its}} continued and discontinued multi-layered structure, including rail, sleepers, ballast layer, sub-ballast layer, and subgrade. Particle size distributions (PSDs) of ballast, subballast, and subgrade layers can be critical in cyclic plastic deformation of rail track under moving traffic on frequent track degradation of rail tracks, especially at <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> zones. Conventional test approaches: static shear and cyclic single-point load tests are however unable to replicate actual loading patterns of moving train. Multi-ring shear apparatus; {{a new type of}} torsional simple shear apparatus, which can reproduce moving traffic conditions, was used in this study to investigate influence of particle size distribution of rail track layers on cyclic plastic deformation. Three particle size distributions, using glass beads were examined under different loading patterns: cyclic sin-gle-point load, and cyclic moving wheel load to evaluate cyclic plastic deformation of rail track under different loading methods. The results of these tests suggest that particle size distributions of rail track structural layers have significant impacts on cyclic plastic deformation under moving train load. Further, the limitations in con-ventional test methods used in laboratories to estimate the plastic deformation of rail track materials lead to underestimate the plastic deformation of rail tracks...|$|E
40|$|The bump {{at the end}} of {{the railway}} bridge is a result of {{differential}} movement between the bridge deck and the approach embankment. The movement can have the form of a bump or a dip. Either defect in the track geometry can cause significant problems in track performance. The current state of practice was evaluated by conducting a literature review and an industry survey. According to the survey, approximately half of all railway bridges are affected by the bump/dip. The total annual cost for repairing these <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> problems is estimated at $ 26 million. This does not take into account the considerable cost resulting from speed reductions that railroads must place on trains at these locations. In addition to the increased maintenance costs, the bump/dip leads to higher impact loads, uncomfortable rides and possible safety hazards. The track response due to the bump {{at the end of}} the bridge was evaluated by creating a 4 -D finite element model of the train, track structure and track substructure. The motion of the train model across a bridge/approach transition, with and without a bump/dip, was then simulated using LS-DYNA. It was found that a track modulus differential alone (no bump/dip) at a bridge/approach location leads to impact forces as well as increased ballast and subgrade pressures on the approach. This instigates the formation of a bump or dip in the track. The track response is increased when a bump/dip is present in the track profile. A parametric study looking at the influence of train direction, train speed, bump/dip size, approach embankment soil modulus, approach tie material, bridge tie material, bridge deck type, ballast thickness and approach tie length on the magnitude of impact forces, track deflection, ballast and subgrade pressures was also performed with the model. Finally, a design solution to minimize the bump {{at the end of the}} bridge is proposed. The solution involves installing varying length steel bars into a soft subgrade approach embankment. The solution addresses both the settlement and track modulus differential between the bridge and the embankment. A full-scale field test of this prototype solution is underway...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{removal of}} nitrate from aqueous solutions and environmental samples such as simulated low level nuclear wastes was studied under constant and pulsing potential electrolysis. Preliminary experiments, under constant potential, {{showed that the}} efficient reduction of nitrate towards nitrogen gas can be achieved on metal electrodes of high hydrogen evolution overpotential, such as Sn, Pb, Al {{as well as on}} the alloy Sn 85 Cu 15 at extremely high cathodic overpotentials. The main products in all cases were NO 2 -, NH 3 and N 2. Small amounts N 2 O and traces of NO 2 and NO were also detected. The kinetic analysis of the experimental results indicated that the reduction of nitrate follows a consecutive reaction mechanism according to the scheme: NO 3 - ??k 1 >NO 2 - ??k 2 > NH 3 2 NO 2 - ??k 3 > N 2 The electrolytic experiments showed that at potential - 2. 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl on Sn 85 Cu 15 electrode, the selectivity (%S) of nitrogen was 35 %. Tin at high cathodic potentials(- 2, 9 V) was proved to be the most effective electrocatalyst for the reduction of nitrate, since both the rate of reduction (0. 206 mmol min? 1 cm? 2) and the selectivity of nitrogen (92 %) were the highest reported in the literature so far. As the cathodic potential increases, the %S of nitrogen increases, while that of ammonia displays a maximum at ? 2. 4 V. The %S of nitrite decreases from 65 % at ? 1. 8 V to < 0. 02 % at potentials more negative than ? 2. 4 V, which is lower than its maximum contaminant level. The rate of reduction of nitrate increased with the increase of the cathodic potential, even at extremely high values of cathodic potentials. Given that the specific adsorption of the anions on the electrode surface at cathodic potentials more negative than - 1. 8 V is impossible, it was proposed that the reduction of nitrate takes place at a large distance from the electrode surface, possibly outside the outer Helmholtz plane, where the nitrate anions forms ion pairs with the cations of the supporting electrolyte, which then are not repelled by the negatively charged electrode. Taking into account the electrolytic experiments, the voltammetric behavior of nitrate and the general literature on the reduction of anions, it was proposed that the transfer of electron from the electrode surface to the nitrate anion takes place either by <b>bridge</b> <b>transition</b> or through electron tunneling. At simulated low level nuclear wastes containing 1. 8 Μ NaNO 3 + 0. 55 M NaNO 2 + 0. 55 M NaOH after an electrolysis time of 240 min the %removal efficiency of nitrate and nitrite was 96 % and 94 % respectively, the %S of N 2 85. 2 % and the current efficiency (%CE) about 80 %. The cathodic corrosion of the tin cathode seems to be the most serious problem of the whole process, since the concentration of tin in the final solution is higher than the environmentally acceptable level. This problem could be treated further by applying a less negative potential after the removal of nitrate, in order to redeposit the dissolved tin or by the addition in the initial solution small amounts of some cations, such as caesium, rubidium or ammonium which according to the bibliography can stop the corrosion at current densities up to 2, 7 A/cm 2. The electrochemical reduction of nitrate under pulsing potential electrolysis was studied for the first time in this thesis. Symmetrical square wave, asymmetrical square wave, triangular and sinusoidal pulses as well as direct AC net current were used. It was proved that the asymmetrical square wave pulses having retention time at the cathodic and the anodic limit the 80 % and the 20 % of the period of the pulse respectively was the more efficient for the removal of nitrate. The rate of the reduction and the selectivity of the products are also affected by the kind of the electrode, the positive and the negative front of the pulse and the frequency. Cu 60 Zn 40 electrode gave the highest removal efficiency of the nitrate in the frequency region 30 - 50 Hz, while the selectivity of nitrogen reached 80 %. The corrosion of the Cu 60 Zn 40 electrode, in this frequency region, was negligible. ...|$|E
