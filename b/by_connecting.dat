5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers may {{be supplied}} with a gas mixture suitable for accelerated decompression <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> a {{supply to the}} surface gas panel and providing it through the umbilical to the divers. This allows accelerated decompression, usually on oxygen, {{which can be used}} to a maximum depth of 30ft (9m). Surface supplied heliox bounce divers will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth, and the mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths.|$|E
5|$|The Student and Instructor {{models were}} also {{introduced}} in the late 1960s. They were designed to teach the piano in the classroom. <b>By</b> <b>connecting</b> the output {{of a network of}} student models, the teacher could listen to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio backing track to them. This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completing}} either game, players {{receive a}} password {{that can be}} used to play an alternative version of the other. In this version, some characters mention passwords that can be given to characters in the first game in exchange for an item or upgrade. Then, by taking a new password back into the linked game, the item or upgrade can be transferred. Rings can be traded by this password system or randomly created <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> two games with a Game Link Cable.|$|E

At the same time, the Kitaki crime family hires him to defend one of their own, Wocky Kitaki, in a murder trial concerning the death of Dr. Pal Meraktis. <b>By</b> <b>connecting</b> the incidents to evidence recovered {{with the help of}} Detective Ema Skye, Apollo discredits the case against Wocky by proving that his fiancée, Alita Tiala, {{was the only one who}} could have committed the crime.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{conceived}} the premise <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> his viewings of {{a production of}} Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies {{and the notion of}} being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers. Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Double as another inspiration for the film. The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film The Wrestler, with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art. He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios, Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures from the ballet world helped with film production to shape the ballet presentation.|$|E

5|$|Napoli winger Insigne {{opened the}} scoring in the 11th minute by cutting {{in from the}} left and curling a shot past Fiorentina goalkeeper Neto. He doubled the lead six minutes later <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> to Higuaín's cross and forcing a {{deflection}} off Nenad Tomović. With two goals in the final, he equalled the amount of goals that he had scored in the entire Serie A season. Fiorentina responded in the 28th minute, when Josip Iličić chipped the defence and Juan Vargas volleyed {{the ball into the}} goal. In the last minute of the half, Alberto Aquilani put the ball into Napoli's goal, but it was disallowed for offside.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers may {{be supplied}} with a gas mixture suitable for accelerated decompression <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> a {{supply to the}} surface gas panel and connecting it through the valve system to the divers. This allows accelerated decompression, usually on oxygen, {{which can be used}} to a maximum depth of 20ft (6m) in water for scuba and 30ft (9m) on surface supply. Surface supplied heliox bounce divers will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth, and the mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths.|$|E
5|$|The PocketStation was a {{miniature}} game console created by SCE as a peripheral {{for the original}} PlayStation. Released exclusively in Japan on December 23, 1999, it featured a monochrome LCD, a speaker, a real-time clock and infrared communication capability. It {{could also be used}} as a standard PlayStation memory card <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> it to a PlayStation memory card slot. It was extremely popular in Japan and Sony originally had plans to release it in the United States but the plan was ultimately scrapped due to various manufacturing and supply-and-demand problems.|$|E

5|$|The freeway {{becomes an}} {{undivided}} highway at Via Mercado in Rancho San Diego. SR 94 continues through Rancho San Diego by turning southeast at the Jamacha Road and Campo Road intersection, where SR 54 and CR S17 turn northeast. As Campo Road, SR94 crosses the Sweetwater River before entering a less-developed area, winding through {{the communities of}} Jamul, Dulzura and intersecting {{the north end of}} SR 188 north of Tecate. After passing through the communities of Potrero, Campo, and the Campo Indian Reservation, SR94 continues east onto old U.S. Route 80 (US80) briefly before turning north on Ribbonwood Road west of Boulevard. The route ends <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> to I-8 near Manzanita.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} transport to Mæl was performed <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> passenger wagons to the freight trains. Up to ten trains were operated each direction each day, {{and up to}} five would correspond with the ferry; at Tinnoset trains would operate to Skien, and connection at Hjuksebø allowed for transport to Oslo Vestbanestasjon. In 1928 Norsk Transport and NSB agreed to operate a weekly night train service from Rjukan to Oslo; the service lasted until 1933. During the 1930s NSB and Norsk Hydro initiated an attempt to attract tourists to Rjukan, through discounted direct trains from Oslo, Drammen and Skien. They were taken up again after the war, and remained until 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{the award}} system from Corruption was {{incorporated}} into the first two games. Players earn credits by accomplishing certain tasks, allowing them to unlock in-game items such as artwork, music, a screenshot feature, decorative items for Samus' ship in Corruption and the Fusion Suit in Prime, in which the latter was previously unlocked <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> the Game Boy Advance title Metroid Fusion to the game. Credits could also be shared with registered Wii friends, who also {{have a copy of}} Trilogy, via WiiConnect24 which used the Wii's own 16-digit number as opposed to a separate Friend Code. Save files from the original version of Corruption cannot be transferred to the Trilogy version due to changes made to the source code. Trilogy also features the multiplayer mode from Echoes, but is limited to a local four-player game and does not feature online play, which is faithful to the original. In response to complaints from players and critics about Echoess high difficulty during some of the boss battles, the difficulty of the encounters was lowered.|$|E
5|$|Fez is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) puzzle platform game {{set in a}} three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden hexahedron that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> otherwise inaccessible platforms, and {{is the basis of}} Fez puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments, which accrete to restore order to the universe. In search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements change with the level themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.|$|E
5|$|If one removes from a 1-tree one of {{the edges}} in its cycle, {{the result is a}} tree. Reversing this process, if one augments a tree <b>by</b> <b>connecting</b> any two of its {{vertices}} by a new edge, the result is a 1-tree; the path in the tree connecting the two endpoints of the added edge, together with the added edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. If one augments a 1-tree by adding an edge that connects one of its vertices to a newly added vertex, the result is again a 1-tree, with one more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is to start with a single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number of times. The edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, one of which is a cycle and the other of which is a forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly one vertex of the cycle.|$|E
