5|$|Historically, the Great Warrior Path of the Native Americans crossed Harveys Creek {{near its}} mouth. The path ran from Sunbury to Athens. In December 1775, a battle known as Plunkett's <b>Battle</b> <b>was</b> fought along the Susquehanna River {{very close to}} the creek. This <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> one of the major battles in the Yankee-Pennamite Wars.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was challenged}} by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort {{had no intention}} to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes was written while the <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> still ongoing, not after the <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort {{in a situation where}} concessions were necessary, in order to bring hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once the <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> over and government in Montfort's hands, he had no longer any interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists, and that was why hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who maintains that the document was in fact signed after the <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> concluded.|$|E

5|$|In May 1455, Northumberland was {{travelling}} {{with the}} king and Somerset to a great council at Leicester, when the party was intercepted by York and the Nevilles. On 22 May 1455, at the First Battle of St Albans, the royal forces clashed with the forces loyal to the Duke of York, {{in what has been}} described as the first battle of the Wars of the Roses.
