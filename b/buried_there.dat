Four Shi'a Imams: Hasan ibn Ali, Ali ibn Husayn, Muhammad al-Baqir, and Jafar al-Sadiq were also <b>buried</b> <b>there</b> making it an important location for Shia Muslims. Historical records show that there were domes, cupolas, and mausoleums in Jannat al-Baqi before the 20th century; today it is a bare land without any buildings.|$|E

5000|$|The Norwich comedians were disbanded in 1843 and at <b>Bury</b> <b>there</b> {{followed}} {{more than}} half a century of economic difficulty and theatrical gloom.

The theatre closed in 1903 but it reopened in 1906 when alterations to the building were made by the architect Bertie Crewe.|$|R
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} {{suspect that}} a further 61 individuals killed at Ovčara were <b>buried</b> <b>there</b> as well. They suspect {{one or more}} additional mass graves exist in the general area, or that the bodies originally buried at the site were moved to a secondary grave. Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian {{author of a book}} on Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others were <b>buried</b> <b>there.</b> According to her, they were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities and moved to a secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow that body parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E

5|$|On 29 October 2009, {{a special}} service of thanksgiving {{was held in}} the chapel at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, to {{accompany}} the rededication of the national monument to Franklin there. The service also included the solemn re-interment of the remains of Lieutenant Henry Thomas Dundas Le Vesconte, the only remains ever repatriated to England, entombed within the monument in 1873. The following day, a group of polar authors went to London's Kensal Green Cemetery to pay their respects to the Arctic explorers <b>buried</b> <b>there.</b> Many other veterans of the searches for Franklin are <b>buried</b> <b>there</b> too, including Admiral Sir Horatio Thomas Austin, Admiral Sir George Back, Admiral Sir Edward Augustus Inglefield, Admiral Bedford Clapperton Trevelyan Pim, and Admiral Sir John Ross. Franklin's wife Jane Griffin, Lady Franklin, is also interred at Kensal Green in the vault, and commemorated on a marble cross dedicated to her niece Sophia Cracroft.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after {{settling}} down in Berlin, Accum had a house built at 16 Marienstraße (later 21 Marienstraße), where he dwelt until his death.

5|$|A stone coffin {{found during}} the 2012 {{excavation}} was opened {{for the first}} time, revealing a lead coffin inside. An investigation with an endoscope revealed {{the presence of a}} skeleton along with some head hair and fragments of a shroud and cord. The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, perhaps that of a knight called Sir William de Moton who was known to have been <b>buried</b> <b>there,</b> but later examination showed it to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may not necessarily have been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E

5|$|A third {{theme of}} the work is the stress on the {{importance}} and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be <b>buried</b> <b>there,</b> which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester {{seems to}} have been the main seat of Æthelred's and Æthelflæd's power, and before 900 they founded a new minster there, {{dedicated}} to St Peter. In 909 a West Saxon and Mercian army raided Viking territory and seized the bones of the Northumbrian king and martyr, St Oswald, from Bardney in Lincolnshire. The bones were translated to the new Gloucester minster, which was renamed St Oswald's Priory in his honour. Both Æthelred and Æthelflæd were <b>buried</b> <b>there.</b> The historian Martin Ryan sees the new minster as something like a Mercian royal mausoleum, to replace the one at Repton destroyed by the Vikings.|$|E
5|$|Harold's {{body was}} {{identified}} {{the day after}} the battle, either through his armour or marks on his body.

William ordered that Harold's body was to be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Waltham Abbey, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been secretly <b>buried</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

Carl Schlicht (1855-1930), then Evangelical pastor in Jerusalem, however, came out in favour of the continued cemeterial community and Blyth assured, an Anglican consecreation would not exclude non-Anglicans from being buried.|$|R
