40|$|Density, {{viscosity}} {{and speed}} of sound of binary liquid mixtures of <b>butyl</b> <b>propionate</b> with tetrahydrofuran, 1, 4 -dioxane, anisole and butyl vinyl ether were measured at (303. 15, 308. 15 and 313. 15) K and over the entire composition range. From the experimental data values of excess volume VE, viscosity deviations ∆η, deviation in speeds of sound ∆u, isentropic compressibility Ks and deviation in isentropic compressibility ∆KS, have been determined.

40|$|The {{partitioning}} {{behavior of}} the reactants 1 -butanol, propionic acid and <b>butyl</b> <b>propionate</b> in an aqueous/ organic two-phase system consisting of alginate beads suspended in hexane was investigated. Partitioning experiments with a single reactant showed that, even in the dilute region, the equilibrium concentrations of 1 -butanol and propionic acid cannot be described by constant partition coefficients as is normally done {{in the field of}} biocatalysis. Besides the aqueous alginate beads, two other aqueous phases with different compo-sitions (solutions with and without electrolytes) were also used for partitioning experiments. The equilibrium concentrations of the reactants obtained from the sys-tems with the three different aqueous phases (water, water plus electrolytes, alginate beads) demonstrate...|$|E
40|$|Polyisobutylene (PIB) {{possessing}} alkene end {{groups was}} ozonized. NMR spectroscopy showed that trioxolanes and tetroxolanes {{were the main}} products and that these products were relatively stable. Thermolysis of the ozonolysis products generated radicals, which were shown by ESR spin-trapping experiments to be alkyl and oxyalkyl species. Thermolysis in <b>butyl</b> <b>propionate</b> solution also generated radicals with structures consistent with those expected of species arising from hydrogen abstraction from solvent. Thermolysis {{in the presence of}} methyl methacrylate (MMA) or styrene (S) led to polymerization of both. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and gradient polymer elution chromatography (GPEC) were used to investigate the possibility that the newly formed polymer might be attached to PIB. In the case of MMA polymerizations, the final product was a blend of the two homopolymers: no evidence for block copolymers could be seen by SEC or GPEC. In contrast, both SEC and GPEC indicated that a large fraction of the newly formed polystyrene was attached to PIB, most probably in the form of P(IB-b-S) block copolymer...|$|E
40|$|Biofuels {{are one of}} {{the most}} hopeful {{alternative}} energy sources to fossil fuels. However, the processing and production of biofuels needs improvement to be economically competitive in the current market. One drawback is the presence of naturally occurring compounds that decrease the bioethanol production rate and yield; these are called inhibitors. A resolution to this problem is to remove the inhibitors from biomass fermentation broth prior to fermentation. This project examined liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) for removal of acetic acid, a major inhibitor. Initially, a stock solution of glucose, xylose, acetic acid, and water was combined with an additional organic solvent to form a two-phase system. After mixing, the concentrations of the components in the water phase were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The compounds remaining in the solvent-rich phase were calculated via a simple mass balance. Nine different organic solvents were tested with the same mixture of compounds, after which the four most effective solvents were tested with liquid fermentation broth. The four best solvents were: ethyl acetate, <b>butyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>propionate,</b> and isobutyl acetate. These four solvents had the highest split fraction, meaning that the acetic acid separated in the desired direction into the organic solvent. Butyl acetate was the best solvent because it extracted the most acetic acid, while retaining the sugars within the aqueous phase. Further research must be done on the organic phase analysis to ensure that the compound mass balance is closed. This research can help promote a more efficient production of biofuel...|$|R
40|$|The {{termination}} of model mid-chain radicals (MCRs), which mimic radicals {{that occur in}} acrylate polymerization over {{a broad range of}} reaction conditions, has been studied by single-pulse pulsed laser polymerization (SP-PLP) in conjunction with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The model radicals were generated by initiator-fragment addition to acrylic macromonomers that were preformed prior to the kinetic experiments, thus enabling separation of termination from the propagation reaction, for these model radicals propagate sparingly, if at all, on the timescale of SP-PLP experiments. Termination rate coefficients of the MCRs were determined in the temperature range of 0 - 60 °C in acetonitrile and <b>butyl</b> <b>propionate</b> solution as well as in bulk macromonomer over the range of 0 - 100 °C. Termination rate coefficients slightly below those of the corresponding secondary radicals were deduced, demonstrating the relatively high termination activity of this species, even when undergoing MCR-MCR termination. For chain length of 10, a reduction by a factor of 6 is observed. Unusually high activation energies were found for the termination rate coefficient in these systems, with 35 kJ mol - 1 being determined for bulk macromonomer.

40|$|Based on a {{pulsed laser}} polymerization-size {{exclusion}} chromatography (PLP-SEC) analysis, an alternative method {{to estimate the}} bulk backbiting rate coefficient k(bb) in acrylate radical polymerization is presented. For different solvent volume fractions (0 - 0. 75), using the unsaturated analogue of the monomer as a solvent to rule out solvent effects, regression analysis is applied to inflection point data in the low frequency range (< ca. 100 s(- 1)) only, which can be scanned with less expensive PLP equipment. Variation of the solvent volume fraction allows the independent alteration of the average mid-chain radical lifetime and improvement in {{the sensitivity of the}} method to estimate kbb confidently. The robustness of the method is verified considering in silico generated data including large artificial errors. The method is applied to experimental data of 2, 2 -dimethoxy- 2 -phenylacetophenone (DMPA) initiated PLP of n-butyl acrylate, taking <b>butyl</b> <b>propionate</b> as the solvent. A kbb value of 171 +/- 21 s(- 1) (303 K) is found, in good agreement with literature data. The method presents a generic approach for the estimation of kbb for other acrylate monomers, allows a complete statistical analysis, and {{can be used as a}} complementary tool for existing methods. In the long term, the method can even be extended for the simultaneous estimation of the bulk kbb and mid-chain radical propagation rate coefficient k(p, m) ...|$|E
40|$|Static {{headspace}} gas chromatographic (SHS-GC) {{analysis was performed}} to determine the release of 13 odorants in hydrocolloid model systems containing original or regio-selectively carboxylated cellulose at different pH values. The release of most odor compounds was decreased in the hydrocolloid solutions compared to control, with the amounts of 2 -propanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, and 2, 3 -butanedione released into the headspace being less than those of any other odor compound in the hydrocolloid model systems. However, there was no considerable difference between original cellulose-containing and carboxylated-cellulose containing systems in the release of most compounds, except for relatively long-chain esters such as ethyl caprylate and ethyl nonanoate. The release from the original and carboxylated cellulose solutions controlled to pH 10 {{was significantly higher than}} that from solutions adjusted to pH 4 and 7 in the case of some esters (ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, <b>butyl</b> <b>propionate,</b> ethyl caproate) and alcohols (2 -propanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol), in particular, ethyl butyrate and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol. In contrast, the release of 2, 3 -butanedione from both the original and carboxylated cellulose solutions was increased at pH 4 and 7 compared to that at pH 10 by about 70 % and 130 %, respectively. Our study demonstrated that the release of some odorants could be changed significantly by addition of both original and carboxylated cellulose in hydrocolloid model systems, but only minor effect was observed in pH of the solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{partitioning}} {{behavior of}} the reactants 1 -butanol, propionic acid and <b>butyl</b> <b>propionate</b> in an aqueous-organic two-phase system consisting of alginate beads suspended in hexane was investigated. Partitioning experiments with a single reactant showed that, even in the dilute region, the equilibrium concentrations of 1 -butanol and propionic acid cannot be described by constant partition coefficients as is normally done {{in the field of}} biocatalysis. Besides the aqueous alginate beads, two other aqueous phases with different compositions (solutions with and without electrolytes) were also used for partitioning experiments. The equilibrium concentrations of the reactants obtained from the systems with the three different aqueous phases (water, water plus electrolytes, alginate beads) demonstrated that the partitioning {{behavior of the}} reactants is scarcely influenced by the presence of the electrolytes or by the alginate matrix, at least up to reactant concentrations of 80 mmol/l in the organic phase. The comparison of the experimental equilibrium concentrations with predicted values obtained from simulations with the modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) model showed a generally good agreement. However, in the dilute region, differences of up to 100 % occurred between experimental and predicted values. Thus, for the later detailed mathematical modeling of processes occurring inside the alginate beads (such as mass transfer and enzymatic reaction), the modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) model is not adequate. Therefore, empirical correlations were derived for the mathematical description of the reactants’ partitioning behavior. Experiments, conducted with two reactants simultaneously present in the two-phase system, showed that at reactant concentrations in the organic phase higher than 10 mmol/l the partitioning behavior of the investigated reactants is influenced by the presence of the second component. Thus, in systems with multiple reactants the derived correlations are strictly only valid up to this concentration. ...|$|E
