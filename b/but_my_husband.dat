2500|$|After the outburst, {{the defense}} of Patterson moved for a mistrial, but Judge Hawkins denied the motion and {{testimony}} continued. The second trial continued. During the second trial's prosecution testimony, Victoria Price mostly stuck with her story, stating flatly that Patterson raped her. She accused Patterson of shooting one of the white youths. Price volunteered, [...] "I have not had intercourse with any other white man <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> I {{want you to know}} that." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the American {{invasion}} of Afghanistan, al-Masri went to Iraq via the United Arab Emirates in 2002, {{according to the}} subsequent account given by his widow. He lived initially in Baghdad's Karrada, then in the Amiriya fainal, and then al-Jadida, where he took charge of al-Qaeda’s operations {{in the southern part}} of the country. The United States military said that Masri [...] "helped draw other insurgent groups into al-Qaeda’s fold." [...] DefenseLINK News reported that Masri [...] "helped establish the Baghdad cell of al-Qaeda in early 2003". Soon after, he [...] "worked the ‘rat line’ down the Euphrates River Valley supplying suicide bombers via Syria." [...] After the US-led invasion, the family left Baghdad for Diyala to the north. Hasna related [...] "The two-storey house where we were was hit in a US air raid. Then, one of the men was killed <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> and I were able to escape to Fallujah" [...] [...] Al-Masri participated in the major 2004 battle of Fallujah. After US troops stormed the town in November 2004, the family moved again, this time to the town of Abu Ghraib, on the western outskirts of the capital. In 2007, al-Masri and his family moved to the Lake Tharthar area. [...] "We were changing houses the whole time, right up to his death," [...] claimed Hasna.|$|E

5000|$|Sekowsky, one of {{the nascent}} Marvel Comics' mainstays, chose to remain and [...] "make George's life hell", Barclay said in 2004. She further described, [...] "I was married before I met Mike, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> divorce was not final. ... I {{had to go to}} court and get an annulment. Mike paid for it and it cost $350".|$|R

"Just at present," [...] she pronounced, [...] "I realise one debt only, {{and that}} is to <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> I will come to the Embassy to-morrow and discuss these matters with you, Count, <b>but</b> whether <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> accompanies me or not, I have now no secrets from him." ...|$|R
60|$|Elv. You know <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> {{is a man}} in years; <b>but</b> he's <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> and {{therefore}} I shall be silent; but his humours are more intolerable than his age: he's grown so froward, so covetous, and so jealous, that he has turned my heart quite from him; and, if I durst confess it, has forced me to cast my affections on another man.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for Mr. Brackett's {{domestic}} troubles, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> can prove without difficulty {{that he did}} buy the picture. Can't you, dear?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> is {{not only}} an unbeliever, but one very froward, peevish, and testy, yea, so froward, &c., that I know not how to speak to him, or behave myself before him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alone--perhaps I should have. I don't know. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband!</b> I {{was able}} to {{influence}} him to his destruction, and now I am powerless. Darkness has closed around me. He would not--he will not listen to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not want}} to talk about it, Charlie. You may imagine how Ciceley and I have suffered. <b>But</b> he was <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> spare him for my sake." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought of}} giving lessons in music. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> glorious <b>husband</b> could not spare {{me away from}} him. I suppose we should have starved, and made a sad little {{paragraph}} in the English newspapers--if the end had not come in another way. My poor Pratolungo was in truth worn out. He sank under his sixteenth exile. I was left a widow--with nothing but the inheritance of <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> noble sentiments to console me.|$|R
30|$|I {{am doing}} my best. I am doing what maximum I can do here to please <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> <b>But</b> when <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> quarrels {{with me on}} some issue, he always says: “It {{would have been better}} if I had come here alone. It was my fault that I decided to bring you here.” And when I hear such things from his mouth, I feel very bad and humiliated.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{we are to}} {{love all}} our neighbours. But {{as men and women}} talk of love, I never at any moment of my life loved any man <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> Mr. Finn was a great {{favourite}} with me,--always." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{four o'clock}} now; we dine at five o'clock, when {{the office is}} closed. Many dine at one, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> likes it when he has done his work, as then he {{does not need to}} hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No one <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> {{can judge}} of that, mama,' said Annie without {{removing}} {{her eyes from}} his face, 'and he will hear me. If I say anything to give you pain, mama, forgive me. I have borne pain first, often and long, myself.' ...|$|E

60|$|They {{carried him}} to the hospital, but he never spoke again, and died {{on the next day}} <b>but</b> one. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> would not let me go to see him, as he was not {{conscious}} and it could do no good, but after Uncle William was dead they let me see him in his coffin.|$|R
5000|$|Of her {{personal}} life during this time, Barclay said in 2004 that, [...] "I was married before I met Mike, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> divorce was not final. ... His wife sent him divorce papers, and they were dated after our marriage. I {{had to go to}} court and get an annulment. Mike paid for it and it cost $350". Later, in the early 1950s, she married a man named Johnny Smith.After leaving Timely in 1949, Barclay freelanced, doing inking on D.S. Publishing's crime comic Exposed (1949), and both penciling and inking stories for Standard's Intimate Love (1951-53); DC Comics (1952); American Comics Group (1952-54); and the Ace Periodicals comic book Complete Love Magazine (1954), as well as for St. John Publications (1953). Most of her freelance comics work was in the romance genre.|$|R
60|$|MRS. JONES. Well, Sir, I have to {{give them}} their dinner to take with them. Of course I 'm not always able to give them anything; {{sometimes}} I have to send them without; <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> is very good about the children when he's in work. But when he's not in work of course he's a very difficult man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Peace, little Vengeance," [...] said Madame Defarge, laying {{her hand}} with a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, [...] "hear me speak. My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has {{deserved}} well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We do {{not want}} to go there at all, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> will go to wind up his affairs, and sell his house there. We have been talking it over, and agree that we should never like {{to go back to the}} estate again. Even if things did quiet down the {{memories}} are too terrible; and, besides, having once broken out, the blacks might do so again at any time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, you {{are very}} much mistaken!' cried the Dowager. 'Of course, as a woman, I {{have not been able}} to make the principality pay me what it ought to; <b>but</b> <b>my</b> late <b>husband</b> {{received}} a very good revenue from it, and I am sure you could do the same, if not a great deal better: for <b>my</b> late <b>husband</b> was not a good business man; he thought too much of other people and not enough of his family.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{tried to}} cut short M. de Lamont's {{transports}} by telling him that he must not take the Prince's requesting as {{the same thing as}} my doing it. Moreover, I did what my mother said was brutal and unbecoming; I informed him that he was mistaken if he thought he should obtain any claim over my son's estate, for I had nothing <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> portion, and there were other guardians besides myself, who would not suffer a stranger to have any share in the administration. Therewith he vehemently exclaimed that I did him injustice, but I still believe that his intention was, if his Prince had remained all-powerful, to get the disposition of my son's property thrown into his hands. My brother Solivet was away with the army, Eustace in Holland, whence I longed to recall him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! no, no, no--" [...] {{returned}} the girl shuddering--"That would be wicked {{as well as}} heartless! No Christian girl could, or would do that! I never shall be the wife of Hurry, I know, <b>but</b> were he <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> no man should ever be it, again, after his death!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That cannot be," [...] she cried; [...] "you may do {{what you}} please with our {{belongings}} and with Captain Marchand's ship, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> is too sick a man to walk a plank. You have not noticed, perchance, that his legs are so feeble that he could scarce mount from the cabin to the deck. It {{would be impossible for}} him to walk a plank; and as for my daughter and myself, we know nothing about such a thing, and could not, out of sheer ignorance." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{wife had}} seated herself again, and her fixed eyes, bent upon the ground, {{expressed}} {{for a few}} moments so much mute agitation that I felt as if almost any remark from my own lips would be a false note. But Mrs. Ambient quickly recovered herself, and said to me civilly enough that she hoped I did n't mind having had to walk from the station. I reassured her on this point, and she went on, [...] "We have got a thing that might have gone for you, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> wouldn't order it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall be}} {{relieved}} of all responsibility," [...] she declared. [...] "If I tell my husband that I {{do not wish}} you to obey his bidding, that will be sufficient. It {{is a matter of}} which my husband understands little. There are people whose interest it is to protect Rosario. It is they who have spoken, without a doubt, this morning through the telephone, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> does not understand. Rosario must take care of himself. He runs his own risks. He is a man, and he knows very well what he is doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR COUSIN: I am leaving {{next week}} with <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> for England, where we intend to pass some time visiting his friends. John and I have {{determined}} to accept the invitation you gave us last summer for Harold to come and spend a few months with you. His father thinks that a great future will, ere many years, open in the West, {{and that it is}} therefore well the boy should learn something of frontier life. For myself, I would rather that he stayed quietly at home, for he is at present over-fond of adventure; <b>but</b> as <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> is meditating selling his estate here and moving West, it is perhaps better for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was wrong, I grant you, grievously {{wrong in}} the course I took, even though it were not {{consciously}} deliberate. <b>But</b> if <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> had been an artist I should always have remained separated from his real life by a limitation I had no power to remove. The more I tried, the more apparent my lack of insight became to him, the more irritated he grew. I studied his sketches, I studied masterpieces, {{but it was all}} hopeless. The thing wasn't in me, and he knew it wasn't. Every remark made him quiver.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shelter I {{can give}} you," [...] {{said the old}} woman, [...] "but little else but a crust of bread {{and a cup of}} water. One time there was enough and plenty in the house; <b>but</b> now, since <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> has gone and I am left all alone, it is little I have to eat and drink. But such as I have to give you are welcome to." ...|$|R
6000|$|In pure {{goodwill}} I {{took this}} jovial spark, Of Oxford he, a most egregious clerk. He boarded with a widow in the town, A trusty gossip, one dame Alison; Full well {{the secrets of}} my soul she knew, Better than e'er our parish priest could do. To her I told whatever could befall: Had <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> piss'd against a wall, [...] 270 Or done a thing that might have cost his life, She--and my niece--and one more worthy wife, Had known it all: what most he would conceal, To these I made no scruple to reveal.

60|$|As {{we were at}} {{the best}} inn in the city, so we could readily have {{whatever}} we pleased, and whatever the season afforded; <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> the most indulgent man that ever breathed, having observed how heartily I ate my dinner at Rochester two days before, ordered the very same bill of fare, and of which I made a heartier meal than I did before. We were very merry, and after we had dined, we went to see the town-house, but as it was near five o'clock I left the Quaker behind me, to receive what intelligence she could get concerning my daughter, from the footman, who was expected to return from Dover at six.|$|E
60|$|Now, as I have said, we {{let that}} unhappy lady lie in her rude grave yonder by the sea, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> took men {{and built a}} cairn of stones over it and a strong wall about it, and there it stands to this day, for not long ago I met one of the folk from the Old Colony who had seen it, and {{who told me that}} the people that live in those parts now reverence the spot, knowing its story. Also, when some months {{afterwards}} a minister came to visit us, we led him to the place and he read the Burial Service over the lady's bones, so that she did not lack for Christian Burial.|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] she said, [...] "but I {{must speak}} while I have the chance. You must believe what <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> has said to you. He {{has told me}} everything, and I {{know that it is}} {{impossible}} for him to tell a lie. I have not yet arranged my ideas in regard to this wonderful revelation, but I believe. If the time should ever come when I shall know I should not believe, that will be another matter. <b>But</b> he is <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> I know him, I trust him. Will you not do the same?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Actually, the Mirka Cafe got too big, {{because too}} many people came and couldn't get in. And so we opened the Balzac Restaurant and the Balzac Restaurant was really the toast of Melbourne. It was a {{beautiful}} restaurant. <b>But</b> it was <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> work of art and I only came in the restaurant to help when <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> went overseas. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> always {{tried to find a}} big house so I could have a big studio. So one day <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> came and said, [...] "I have bought a hotel." [...] I did get a big studio for one week, then I had to give it to <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> for his gallery.

60|$|At supper {{he told us}} his story. He was, as {{you know}} the only scion of the old house of Aubepine, his father having {{been killed in a}} duel, and his mother dying at his birth. His {{grandparents}} bred him up with the most assiduous care, <b>but</b> (as <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> told me) it was the care of pride rather than of love. When still a mere boy, they married him to poor little Cecile de Bellaise, younger still, and fresh from her convent, promising, on his vehement entreaty, that so soon as the succession should be secured by the birth of a son, he should join the army.|$|R
