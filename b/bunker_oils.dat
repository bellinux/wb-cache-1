40|$|Pacific herring embryos (Clupea pallasi) spawned {{three months}} {{following}} the Cosco Busan bunker oil spill in San Francisco Bay showed high rates of late embryonic mortality in the intertidal zone at oiled sites. Dead embryos developed to the hatching stage (e. g. fully pigmented eyes) before suffering extensive tissue deterioration. In contrast, embryos incubated subtidally at oiled sites showed evidence of sublethal oil exposure (petroleum-induced cardiac toxicity) with very low rates of mortality. These field findings suggested an enhancement of oil toxicity through an interaction between oil and another environmental stressor in the intertidal zone, such as higher levels of sunlight-derived ultraviolet (UV) radiation. We tested this hypothesis by exposing herring embryos to both trace levels of weathered Cosco Busan bunker oil and sunlight, with and without protection from UV radiation. Cosco Busan oil and UV co-exposure were both necessary and sufficient to induce an acutely lethal necrotic syndrome in hatching stage embryos that closely mimicked the condition of dead embryos sampled from oiled sites. Tissue levels of known phototoxic polycyclic aromatic compounds were too low to explain the observed degree of phototoxicity, indicating {{the presence of other}} unidentified or unmeasured phototoxic compounds derived from bunker oil. These findings provide a parsimonious explanation for the unexpectedly high losses of intertidal herring spawn following the Cosco Busan spill. The chemical composition and associated toxicity of <b>bunker</b> <b>oils</b> should be more thoroughly evaluated to better understand and anticipate the ecological impacts of vessel-derived spills associate...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{a larger}} study on the {{bioremediation}} of oil spills in tropical mangrove habitats, we conducted a series of flask experiments to test for the presence of hydrocarbon degrading microdashorganisms in representative wetland habitats. Also tested was the biodegradation of selected oils (Gippsland Crude, Arabian Light Crude and Bunker C), that are transported along the Australian coast. We also tested for potential inhibition of biodegradation by natural organics in the mangrove pore waters and evaluated the ability of an oxygen release compound (ORC) to stimulate biodegradative processes. Evaporation was a significant factor in removing the light alkane and aromatic hydrocarbons from air and nitrogen sparged flasks. Evaporation removed sim 27 % of the Gippsland, sim 37 %of the Arabian, and sim 10 % of the <b>Bunker</b> <b>oils.</b> Oxygen was necessary to support biodegradation as expected. The microdashorganisms were capable of biodegrading the nondashvolatile saturate fraction of each oil. Degradation removed another 14 of the Gippsland, 30 of the Arabian, and 22 of the Bunker C oils. Normalisation of the individual aromatic hydrocarbon classes to internal triterpane biomarkers indicated some degradation of aromatics in the Arabian Light and Bunker C oils. Although alkane degradation rates were comparable in the three oils, the Gippsland oil had a higher wax content and after 14 days incubation, still contained as much as 25 of the alkanes present in the original oil. Thus, degradation of its aromatic fraction may have been delayed. Based on these results we estimate that Arabian Light Crude oil would have a shorter residence time than the other oils in mangrove sediment. It has a higher content of light hydrocarbons, which are readily removed by both physical and microbial processes. The Bunker C would be expected to have the longest residence time in mangrove sediment, because it contains a larger percentage of higher molecular weight, unresolved components. Comparison of the efficiency of inoculates from three tropical intertidal habitats (Avicennia and Rhizophora mangroves, plus salt marsh sediments) indicated the presence of hydrocarbon degrading microdashorganisms in all three habitats. There was no known history of oil contamination in the soil source area. There was no inhibition of degradation due to addition of mangrove pore waters. The ORC did not facilitate degradation in closed laboratory experiments. These results were used to formulate a bioremediation strategy to treat oiled sediments in mangrove forests in Queensland Australia, which was based on forced aeration and nutrient addition.

40|$|This {{work has}} been a {{preliminary}} study, aimed at investigating whether or not trace metal Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis could be a viable tool in the oil spill investigation toolbox, after having been abandoned over 20 years ago. The sample material was two previous oil spills, Full City and Server, and various heavily weathered oil samples gathered from islands off the Tr&# 248;ndelag coast. The islands were Kya, Sula, Vesterkalven, Storkalven, Kunna, and the bay Kjerv&# 229;gsundet on the larger island Fr&# 248;ya. The samples were prepared in a laboratory and analysed by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Selective Ion Monitoring (GC-MS-SIM) and ICP-MS. Through integration of key elements in the oil, also known as biomarkers, by an online database called COSIWeb, the weathered samples were classified as &# 147;crude oil&# 148;, &# 147;non-NS (North Sea) crude oil&# 148;, &# 147;bunker oil&# 148;, &# 147;unknown&# 148; and &# 147;not oil&# 148;. This classification {{was used as a}} guide to assess the viability of the trace metal analysis done by ICP-MS. The database also provided correlation calculations and five of the weathered bunker oil samples were linked to oils outside the database by &# 147;probable match&# 148;. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to investigate the ability each dataset had to classify the different weathered oil types and oil spill samples Full City and Server. Subsequently, Partial Least Squares-Regression (PLS-R) was used to investigate the stability and robustness of both datasets from GC-MS-SIM and ICP-MS together, before Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was applied to investigate if the clusters seen in PCA were significant. By PLS-DA two subgroups of crude oils were identified, possibly related to terrestrial or marine source material in the oil. Of the 46 weathered samples found on various islands, 14 samples were classified as non-NS crude oils, 9 samples were classified as crude oils, 11 samples were classified as <b>bunker</b> <b>oils,</b> 7 samples were classified as unknown oil samples, and 5 samples were classified as not oil. The last group could be oil-like material such as plastic, rubber, coal or other organic material. The most important trace metal ratios identified in this study were ratios which have been previously been singled out as important in oil analysis. These were Ni/V, V/S, U/Pb and Mn/Fe. Other ratios were helpful as well, but these were the most influential ones. The Ni/V ratio was able to separate Full City samples from Server samples without any outliers or fuzzy classification. </p...|$|E

When DBT and BNT 1 coexisted, the biodesulfurization efficiency of BNT 1 decreased significantly as the DBT concentrations increased (> 0. 1 mmol/L).

40|$|The {{grounding}} of {{the bulk}} carrier Pasha Bulker on Nobbys beach, Newcastle in June 2007 has again highlighted the risk from shipping posed to Australia’s extensive and environmentally fragile coastline. Whilst a pollution incident was averted in this case, spills from shipping {{in other states}} (such as the Nakhodka spill off Japan in 1997, the Prestige spill off France in 1999, the Erika spill off Spain in 2003 and the Hebei Spirit spill of South Korea in 2007), have required the constant monitoring and updating of the international regulatory regimes designed to prevent such incidents occurring and to provide compensation when they nevertheless do occur. Two recent additions to this international regulatory system are the Protocol on the Establishment of a Supplementary Fund for Oil Pollution Damage 2003, (the “Supplementary Fund Protocol 2003 ”) and the International Convention on Civil Liability for <b>Bunker</b> <b>Oil</b> Pollution Damage 2001 (“the <b>Bunker</b> <b>Oil</b> Convention 2001 ”).
