5|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, {{folklore}} {{often associated}} tuberculosis with vampires.

5|$|In 1950, the German {{paleontologist}} Otto Schindewolf {{argued that}} variation tends {{to move in}} a predetermined direction. He <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> was purely mechanistic, denying any kind of vitalism, but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to the organism.|$|E

5|$|Although he venerated Scott's {{writing skill}} {{and use of}} history as backdrop, Balzac worked to more {{accurately}} depict the turbulence {{of the human heart}} – and its effect on history. He considered Scott's view of women unrefined, and <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> led to a stale representation of human behavior as a result. In Les Chouans, Balzac places the romance of Montauran and Marie de Verneuil {{at the center of the}} narrative, around which all other elements revolve.|$|E
5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> {{process would}} be {{set in motion by}} the {{predicted}} Y2K problem causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{was still}} {{going on in the}} area around Dongo. Fearing that Mussolini and Petacci might be rescued by fascist supporters, the partisans drove them, {{in the middle of the}} night, to a nearby farm of a peasant family named De Maria; they <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> would be a safe place to hold them. Mussolini and Petacci spent the rest of the night and most of the {{following}} day there.|$|E
5|$|From batting in the middle-order, Ganteaume was {{eventually}} promoted {{to open the}} batting as a theory at the time suggested that wicketkeepers might make good openers as they became accustomed to the conditions while keeping wicket; Ganteaume neither <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> theory nor enjoyed being an opener. He scored his maiden first-class century in 1946; a second followed later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Gould was a {{champion}} of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, {{as well as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.|$|E

5|$|In September 2000, Tillingbourne {{controversially}} {{reduced the}} number of journeys on contracted route 516, which linked Dorking, Leatherhead and Epsom. Although this was within the terms of the contract, it was criticised by residents of intermediate villages, who claimed the communities relied in particular on a cancelled morning journey. Operations were moved to a new larger site, still located in Cranleigh, in February 2001. The company <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> would reduce operating costs and allow for future expansion.|$|E
5|$|Kanō <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> to be unacceptable. He {{refused to}} play such a subservient role when {{teaching}} his students. To Kanō, a teacher must command respect. At the same time, he employed the latest European and American pedagogical methods. The {{theories of the}} American educator John Dewey especially influenced him. Kanō's manner had the desired effect upon the students, but the administration was slower to warm to his methods {{and it was not}} until the arrival of a new principal that Kanō's ideas found acceptance.|$|E
5|$|McKenzie {{was killed}} on 17 July 1889 by {{severance}} of the left carotid artery. Several minor bruises and cuts {{were found on the}} body, discovered in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. One of the examining pathologists, Thomas Bond, <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> to be a Ripper murder, though his colleague George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed. Later writers are also divided between those who think that her murderer copied the Ripper's modus operandi to deflect suspicion from himself, and those who ascribe it to the Ripper.|$|E

5|$|Sir Nicholas' kindertransport efforts {{remained}} largely unrecognised until 1988, {{when they came}} to public attention after his wife found a scrapbook in their attic documenting the details. Only then did the individuals whom Winton arranged to have transported to safety as children learn the story of how they survived the Holocaust. As the majority of 'Winton's Children' (as they came to be known) were Jewish, it is <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> saved them from certain death had they stayed in Czechoslovakia. As of 2009, the direct descendants of Winton's Children numbered over 5000 people.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} the cricket ball is found in 1658 in Mysteries of Love and Eloquence by Edward Phillips. The pitch has been 22 yards long (i.e., a chain) since the first known code of Laws in 1744 and it is <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> length had been in use since the introduction of Gunter's chain in 1620. The over consisted of four deliveries until the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Winton's efforts did {{not come}} to public light until 1988, when his wife {{discovered}} papers in their loft, whereupon Winton began to publicly talk about his work, and he {{came to be known as}} the 'British Schindler', in comparison to Oskar Schindler.

5|$|A {{series of}} flashbacks reveals that an oracle had foretold that {{the demise of}} Olympus would come not by the revenge of the Titans, who had been imprisoned after the Great War, but by a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus and Ares <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> warrior to be Deimos, the brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares {{interrupted}} the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand, and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but was swept aside and subsequently scarred across his right eye by the Olympian. Athena stopped Ares from killing Kratos, knowing his eventual destiny. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured by Thanatos. In honor of his sibling, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark.|$|E
5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E
