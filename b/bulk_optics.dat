The wavelengths of the signal and the idler are determined by the phase matching condition, which is changed e. g. by temperature or, in <b>bulk</b> <b>optics,</b> by the angle between the incident pump laser ray and the optical axes of the crystal. The wavelengths of the signal and the idler photons can, therefore, be tuned by changing the phase matching condition.|$|E
5000|$|Linear optics, as a {{platform}} for quantum computation specifically, began to show a marked rise in activity {{after the publication of}} the seminal theory paper of Knill-Laflamme-Milburn, which demonstrated the feasibility of linear optical quantum computers using post-selection, feed-forward and number resolving detection. Following this there were several experimental proof-of-principle demonstrations of two-qubit gates performed in <b>bulk</b> <b>optics.</b> [...] It soon became clear that integrated optics could provide a powerful enabling technology for this emerging field. [...] Early experiments in integrated optics demonstrated the feasibility of the field via demonstrations of high-visibility non-classical and classical interference in simple components based on linear optics such as directional couplers (DCs) and Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These components were then be used to fabricate more complicated circuits such as multi-photon entangling gates as well as core components used for fully reconfigurable quantum circuits, where reconfigurability can achieved using both thermal and electro-optic phase shifters.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) {{is a high}} resolution, {{imaging technique}} that has developed over the last 20 years from a complicated laboratory setup into a ready-to-use commercially available device. Instead of using electronic time gating as being used by ultrasound (US) imaging, in OCT, the optical analogue of US imaging, determines the time of flight using low coherence interferometry. To date, OCT has many clinical applications and is widely used in urology, cardiovascular imaging, dentistry, dermatology and ophthalmology. Currently OCT devices are bulky and expensive, which limits the use of OCT, not only in its existing applications, but also in many application areas such as process control, biometrics or forensic science. Integrated optics can offer a significant cost and size reduction for many <b>bulk</b> <b>optics</b> components and integrate them in a single platform. As a result, integrated optics can make OCT systems smaller, robust, more cost efficient.

Many groups continue to explore alternative techniques to lithographic surface electrodes for defining the domain pattern of the poled crystal. The key objectives of these studies are to reduce the minimum domain size, produce uniformity in the domain structures and improve the cost effectiveness and speed of fabrication. We report progress on an investigation into poling lithium niobate using topographical electrode structures. The structures have been laser machined into the surfaces of 500 μm thick zcut lithium niobate crystals by various laser sources (355 nm YAG laser, 255 nm copper vapour laser, and 800 nm femtosecond laser). We will present a simple electrostatic model of the fields induced by topographical structures which indicates that there is advantages and also limitations in using this technique, in comparison to conventional surface electrodes. Good quality domain structures with periods greater than 20 μm can be routinely fabricated using this method.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, there has been {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} quasi-phase-matched (QPM) nonlinear crystals, which permit noncritical-phase-matching for any wavelengths in the transparency range of the crystal, and have the advantage of using the largest component of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor, one that is not available in birefingent phase matching without walk-off problems. QPM can be achieved by an appropriate periodic modulation of the nonlinear coefficient, which corresponds to periodic domain reversal in ferroelectric materials. In particular, the application of QPM to <b>bulk</b> nonlinear <b>optics</b> has been revolutionised by the emergence of electric field poling techniques for patterning the domain structure of ferroelectric and polar crystals. In all the reported fabrication processes the periodic electrode (consisting of resist and/or metal layers) has been fabricated {{on the surface of the}} crystal substratcs by conventional photolithography.

40|$|Accessing {{space with}} {{high-power}} laser systems {{is not a}} straightforward task as the space environment entails various risks [1] for optical surfaces and even bulk materials. High-power laser systems can respond very sensitively on absorption increase on its manifold of optical surfaces or in the <b>bulk</b> of transmissive <b>optics,</b> on misalignment of the optical axis, or coating delamination or destruction. These deleterious effects can be conveyed by a simultaneous action of outgassing contaminants and (UV) laser radiation leading to absorbing deposits on optical surfaces, by high energy solar or cosmic radiation generating color centers in the bulk of materials, by vibration-sensitive mounting of optics leading to misalignment during launch, by high-fluence exposure exceeding vacuum laser damage thresholds (coating destruction) or mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients (coating delamination), to mention just the most important risks.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{high data rate}} {{communications}} and renewable energy sources has led to new materials and platforms for optoelectronic devices, which require nanometer scale feature sizes. Devices that operate in the visible and near-infrared commonly have active areas with dimensions {{on the order of}} the diffraction limit λ/ 2 ^n, where λ is the free space wavelength and n is the index of refraction, for which the ray optics modeling techniques and <b>bulk</b> focusing <b>optics</b> traditionally used in optoelectronic device design are no longer applicable. In this subwavelength regime, nanophotonic light-trapping strategies are required to localize electromagnetic fields in the active area. This dissertation details the application of nanophotonics to two optoelectronic systems: extrinsic photodetectors for silicon photonics and light-trapping in organic photovoltaics. Error-free reception of 10 Gb/s data at λ = 1. 55 μm is demonstrated with a Si⁺ ion-implanted silicon waveguide photodiode. To mitigate the relatively small absorption coefficient of ion-implanted silicon, resonant cavity enhancement using in-line Fabry-Pérot and 1 D photonic crystal cavities, as well as slow light enhancement using a coupled resonator optical waveguide are discussed. The extension of these photodiodes to the mid-infrared is demonstrated using Zn⁺ implantation to detect over a range of λ = 2. 2 - 2. 4 μm, and a new method for modulation and switching in integrated optics by using interference in a resonant cavity, termed coherent perfect loss (CPL), is presented.

However, here, a new approach is presented to integrate epitaxial quartz films with macroperforations within the range of 500 nm and 1 mu m using chemical solution deposition. This method constitutes an appealing approach to develop piezoelectric mass sensors with enhanced resonance frequencies due to the thickness reduction. Perforated quartz films on (100) -silicon are prepared from amorphous silica films deposited via dip-coating and doped with metal cations that catalyze quartz crystallization. The metal cations are also active {{in the formation of the}} macroperforations, which arise due to a phase separation mechanism. Cationic surfactant-anion-metal cation assemblies stabilize droplets of water, creating an indentation in the hydrophilic silica matrix which remains after solvent evaporation. Many cations induce phase separation, including Li+, Na+, Sr 2 +, Mn 2 +, Fe 2 +/Fe 3 +, Ca 2 +, Ce 3 + and La 3 + but only the Sr 2 + and Ca 2 + cations in this series induce the epitaxial growth of alpha-quartz films under the conditions studied.

40|$|The {{genesis of}} this thesis {{came out of}} the {{difficulties}} encountered when trying to apply adaptive optics correction to optical fields that contain scintillation (specklelike amplitude fluctuations). These scintillated fields have non-uniform amplitude distributions and also contain discontinuities in their wavefronts where the amplitude of the field goes to zero. A traditional adaptive optics system that relies on continuous wavefronts and uniform illumination is limited in its ability to correct highly distorted fields. It became clear that adaptive correction using a modular system that does not rely on the continuity of the wavefront or indeed uniformity of the amplitude was better suited to the task. The use of a fibre optics array of sub-apertures to combine regions in close proximity into a mixed signal and to monitor the interference was examined as a more robust means of correcting an aberrated wavefront. Multi-aperture receivers have previously been shown to give an increase in the signal to noise or carrier to noise ratio and perhaps more importantly can also reduce amplitude fluctuations caused by atmospheric aberrations such as speckle. The investigation of a multi-aperture system lead {{to the development of a}} fibre based quad-cell wavefront sensor to measure the launching angle to improve the coupling of light to the fibre array. This thesis outlines the development and testing of the fibre quad-cell for use as a cell in a larger array applied to wavefront sensing. The quad-cell is made up of three directional couplers in a cascade arrangement. A directional coupler allows for evanescent coupling of light between two adjacent fibre waveguides. The response of the quad-cell arrangement of fibres was simulated numerically using the beam propagation method and a method for combining the interferometric information from the four output signals was developed. A novel aspect of this sensor compared with other fibre based wavefront sensors is the ability to differentiate between positive and negative gradients. The system was tested for a single bulk fibre optic quad-cell for measuring wavefront gradients. As part of the sensor development an FPGA interface was developed for parallel processing of a quad-cell wavefront sensor and for mirror control. Initial results from the breadboard system are presented and compared with the results of the numerical simulation. The initial results are sufficient to display the proof of concept. However, the use of <b>bulk</b> fibre <b>optics</b> made the sensor very susceptible to thermal noise. The system also proved to be very sensitive to the alignment of the fibres in the quad-cell. It is envisaged that the use of an integrated optics implementation of the sensor would remove much of the thermal noise and also enable the precise orientation and alignment of the fibres in the quad-cell array...|$|R
