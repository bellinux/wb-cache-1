Nine teams participated, with the {{exception}} of Honda and Super Aguri, who opted to test at the Jerez circuit. Neither Ferrari nor McLaren were fastest on the first two days at Silverstone, rather it was Toyota that was fastest on both of the days. However, on the third and final day of testing Felipe Massa put Ferrari on top with a time of 1:20.805. The nearest challenger, Nico Rosberg was 0.469 <b>behind,</b> <b>with</b> Fernando Alonso a further 0.010 <b>behind.</b> <b>With</b> Ferrari fastest on the third day, both of their drivers, Massa and Kimi Räikkönen were very confident heading into the French round of the season.|$|E

5|$|Mohorič {{was passed}} by Alexey Tsatevich (Katusha) and Primož Roglič (LottoNL–Jumbo), {{who went on to}} contest a two-man sprint. Tsatevich won the sprint, despite an early celebration that nearly allowed Roglič to come past him. The peloton {{finished}} together, 14 seconds <b>behind,</b> <b>with</b> Jarlinson Pantano (IAM) winning the sprint for third place. Quintana therefore sealed his overall victory, with Contador second and Martin third.|$|E

Häkkinen remained third on 38 points, six ahead of Barrichello. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's one-two finish allowed them to narrow the gap to Ferrari to be six points <b>behind,</b> <b>with</b> eight races of the season remaining.|$|E

The new Buzz then chooses to remain <b>behind</b> <b>with</b> Zurg, who has revealed himself as Buzz's father. Accompanied by three toy Aliens, Andy's toys steal a pizza planet delivery truck, and follow Al to the airport, where they enter the baggage handling system. Stinky Pete rips Woody's arm during a struggle, but Andy's toys overthrow Pete, where he ends up into a little girl's backpack. They free Bullseye, only for Jessie to {{end up on the}} plane bound for Japan. Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye, Woody frees Jessie, and the toys find their way home.|$|E
5|$|As an {{industrial}} port city, Haifa {{has traditionally been}} a Labor party stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. In recent years, {{there has been a}} drift toward the center. This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor lagging <b>behind</b> <b>with</b> 16.9%.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Roode faced Jeff Hardy in {{the sixth}} encounter. Roode's fellow Team Canada member Petey Williams {{interfered}} in the contest distracting the referee, allowing Roode to attempt to hit Hardy with the a hockey stick. Hardy dodged the swing and countered with his signature Twist of Fate maneuver, forcing Roode's chin into his shoulder. Afterwards, Hardy jumped {{off the top of}} a padded turnbuckle onto both Williams and Roode at ringside. Later, Roode re-entered the ring with Hardy remaining at ringside, allowing Jeff Jarrett to attack Hardy from <b>behind</b> <b>with</b> a hockey stick. Jarrett then pushed Hardy into the ring with Roode covering for the pinfall victory at 9 minutes and 7 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Dennis's lack {{of concern}} was vindicated on Saturday, with Hamilton setting the fastest time in {{practice}} with a lap of 1:34.811. Massa finished the session {{a tenth of a}} second <b>behind,</b> <b>with</b> third placed Alonso a further half second behind. Kubica, Räikkönen, Rosberg and Heidfeld followed, with Super Aguri driver Anthony Davidson eighth fastest. Super Aguri are regarded as a sister team to the Honda F1 works team, who set only the 17th and 19th fastest times. The 2007 Super Aguri is widely thought to be an updated version of Honda's 2006 car.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 194041, Miller was granted leave {{so that he could}} play interstate cricket. In a season {{shortened}} due to war, Miller played in three matches and scored 140 runs at 28.00. In the second match, which was against South Australia, Miller scored 63, his only fifty of the summer, and bowled {{for the first time at}} first-class level, conceding three runs from a solitary over. In the third match he took his maiden first-class wicket, in a war fundraising match for Stan McCabe's XI against Don Bradman's XI, that of Ken Ridings, caught <b>behind</b> <b>with</b> wicket-keeper Don Tallon. His pace was noticed by Bradman.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Hammond {{spent much}} of his leave with Ness-Harvey in South Africa. In 1945, she {{followed}} him back to England, but did not like it. When Hammond left to tour Australia in 1946–47, Ness-Harvey remained <b>behind</b> <b>with</b> his mother, with whom she did not get along. This was one of the factors which led to Hammond's problems on the tour. His divorce went through, and on his return, he and Sybil married at Kingston Register Office. She had already changed her name to Hammond by deed poll. Their first child, Roger, was born in 1948. Carolyn was born in 1950 and Valerie was born in 1952.|$|E

5|$|Ferrari {{dominated}} both {{practice sessions}} on the Friday, with Räikkönen fastest {{in the first}} Practice Session and Felipe Massa was fastest in the second Practice Session. Behind the Ferraris, Alonso was third in his McLaren, but seven tenths <b>behind,</b> <b>with</b> his teammate and World Championship leader Lewis Hamilton sixth, but lost nearly an hour of the session due to car trouble. The two McLarens were split by David Coulthard and Nico Rosberg.|$|E
5|$|Géza's and Solomon's {{relationship}} only {{began to}} worsen {{during the siege}} of the Byzantine fortress of Belgrade in 1071. Its commander preferred to surrender to Géza instead of the king and the Byzantine envoys who arrived in the Hungarian camp {{after the fall of}} Belgrade only negotiated with Géza. The division of the booty also gave rise to a new conflict between Solomon and Géza. Although Géza accompanied the king on a new campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1072, but his brother, Ladislaus stayed <b>behind</b> <b>with</b> half of the troops of their duchy.|$|E
5|$|In the semifinal, three skaters, {{including}} the defending champion, crashed {{into each other}} and Bradbury moved up into second place {{to qualify for the}} final. In the final, Bradbury was substantially slower than his opponents and was safely in last place, around 15m <b>behind</b> <b>with</b> only 50m to go, when all four rivals collided and fell over, allowing him to avoid the pile-up and take the victory. The unlikely win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero across Australia and around the world.|$|E
