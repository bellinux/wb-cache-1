40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if a relationship exists between the presence of a sportsmanship <b>point</b> <b>system</b> and the amount of sportsmanship participants display. Subjects were the directors of intramural sports of 50 institutions within the National Intramural Recreational-Sports Association (NIRSA) Region III. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. A nine-question, self-constructed survey was designed to assess the effectiveness of a sportsmanship <b>point</b> <b>system</b> and the perceptions the directors of intramural sports have about sportsmanship <b>point</b> <b>systems.</b> The survey was distributed to the directors of intramural sports at 80 institutions. The results indicated two conclusions. First, institutions that utilize sportsmanship <b>point</b> <b>systems</b> have less discipline incidents based on enrollment and the percent of participation from the student body. Second, directors of intramural sports that implemented a sportsmanship <b>point</b> <b>system</b> during their employment indicated a decrease in discipline incidents after the sportsmanship <b>point</b> <b>system</b> was implemented.

40|$|Various {{kinds of}} demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems</b> have been {{developed}} and implemented in European countries, aimed at tackling repeat offences in road transport by acting as a deterrent and providing sanctioning. The impact of a demerit <b>point</b> <b>system</b> {{on the number of}} crashes is often reported to be significant, but temporary. The objective of the EU BestPoint project was to establish a set of recommended practices that would result in a more effective and sustainable contribution of demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems</b> to road safety. A high actual chance of losing the licence and a high perceived chance of losing the licence are basic prerequisites for the effective operation of demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems.</b> For measures applied {{within the context of a}} demerit <b>point</b> <b>system,</b> a four-step-approach is recommended: warning letter, driver improvement course, licence withdrawal, rehabilitation course. Further recommendations concern issues like points and offences, e. g. which offences should lead to points, target groups, and the administration of demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems.</b> The final result of the EU BestPoint project is a handbook (van Schagen & Machata, 2012) which provides a concise overview of all recommended practices. The presentation/paper outlines how sustainable safety improvements can be achieved if national demerit <b>point</b> <b>systems</b> are implemented and maintained according to the recommended practices. In addition, potential further steps towards an EU-wide demerit <b>point</b> <b>system</b> (cross-border exchange on points and/or offences) are presented. (Author/publisher...|$|R
40|$|Demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> in Europe: {{room for}} improvement; Some {{recommendations}} from the European project BestPoint. Broadly speaking, a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> involves a road user receiving demerit points {{in addition to}} the regular punishment when a traffic violation has been observed. If someone has received a certain number of demerit points within a certain period of time, the driver’s licence will be temporarily suspended. Demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> aim at regular offenders and for this reason they are generally considered to be fair. This may be the explanation for their considerable popularity. Three quarters of the European Member States use some form of demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> At present, the Netherlands has a simple variant which only applies to novice drivers. Recently, the European project BestPoint has concluded a two-year study into demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> which resulted in a handbook for governments who are considering to implement a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> BestPoint investigated the actual effectiveness of a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> and which type of system may be expected to be the most satisfactory. The most important conclusion is that demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> are less effective than their popularity in Europe suggests. Initially, they have a considerable road safety effect, but their deterrence often is only short-lasting. However, the effectiveness of a demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> may be improved by setting it up in a good way; {{it is very important that}} both the objective and the subjective risk of being caught remain high and that automatically detected offences are also included...|$|R

40|$|In 2012, 21 of the 27 EU Member States {{had some}} form of demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> In theory, demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> {{contribute}} to road safety through three mechanisms: 1) prevention of unsafe behaviour through the risk of receiving penalty points, 2) selection and suspension of the most frequent offenders and 3) correction of risk behaviour through an educative element in the demerit <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> International studies show that in practice {{the effects of a}} demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> can indeed be significant, but that these effects exist only for a (very) limited period of time. Since 2002, the Netherlands has had a simple demerit <b>points</b> <b>system</b> for novice drivers and since 2011 for drink driving as well. A condition for a lasting effect of demerit <b>points</b> <b>systems</b> is a large – and continuous – objective and subjective probability of actual withdrawal of the driver’s licence. This probability is closely connected to a sufficiently high level of enforcement, efficient methods of enforcement and frequently returning publicity on the enforcement and the number of people whose licence has been withdrawn...|$|R
