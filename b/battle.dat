5|$|A {{prime example}} of Roman loss in <b>battle</b> was the <b>Battle</b> of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where three entire legions led by Publius Quinctilius Varus were {{destroyed}} by Arminius, leader of the Cherusci, an apparent Roman ally. Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the <b>battle</b> of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany. Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes; they defeated Arminius, who fled that <b>battle</b> but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.|$|E

5|$|After Caesar's {{preliminary}} low-scale {{invasions of}} Britain, the Romans invaded in force in 43 AD, forcing their way inland through several battles against British tribes, including the <b>Battle</b> of the Medway, the <b>Battle</b> of the Thames, the <b>Battle</b> of Caer Caradoc and the <b>Battle</b> of Mona. Following a general uprising {{in which the}} Britons sacked Colchester, St Albans and London, the Romans suppressed the rebellion in the <b>Battle</b> of Watling Street {{and went on to}} push as far north as central Scotland in the <b>Battle</b> of Mons Graupius. Tribes in modern-day Scotland and Northern England repeatedly rebelled against Roman rule and two military bases were established in Britannia to protect against rebellion and incursions from the north, from which Roman troops built and manned Hadrian's Wall.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements in 1813, Harrison {{took the}} offensive {{and led the}} army north to <b>battle</b> the Shawnee and their British allies.

Harrison's army defeated the British on October 5, 1813, at the <b>Battle</b> of the Thames, in which Tecumseh was killed.

5|$|After the <b>battle</b> {{both sides}} claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the <b>battle</b> remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the <b>battle</b> had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing <b>Battle</b> of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the <b>battle</b> as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E
5|$|Almirante Latorre {{was renamed}} HMS Canada and {{slightly}} modified for British service. The ship completed fitting-out on 20 September 1915, and was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 October. It initially {{served with the}} 4th <b>Battle</b> Squadron of the Grand Fleet, and saw action in the <b>Battle</b> of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. It fired 42 rounds from its 14-inch guns and 109 6-inch shells during the <b>battle,</b> and suffered no hits or casualties. Canada {{was transferred to the}} 1st <b>Battle</b> Squadron on 12 June 1916, received further modifications in 1917 and 1918, and was put into reserve in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it allowed}} the militia men to draw Native American blood in revenge, {{the result of}} the <b>battle</b> was {{inconclusive}} with respect to its original purpose of stopping the Native American raids in the area. The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The <b>battle</b> helped raise public opinion towards the militia. After the disastrous defeat at Stillman's Run in May, the <b>battle</b> at Yellow Creek coupled with the <b>Battle</b> of Horseshoe Bend, helped to demonstrate that the militia could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who {{are locked}} in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to <b>battle</b> each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (pictured on the box cover) to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in Ruby and Sapphire, in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to <b>battle</b> as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double <b>battle</b> if they are called on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in <b>battle</b> like they were in Pokémon Crystal.

It was involved in the Peninsular Campaign, particularly the <b>Battle</b> of Gaines' Mill during which it suffered its worst casualties (numerically) of the war. Their worst casualties in terms of percentages took place during the <b>Battle</b> of Gettysburg (60 percent).
