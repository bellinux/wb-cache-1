25|$|The Applegate {{mechanism}} explains {{long term}} orbital period variations seen in certain eclipsing binaries. As a main-sequence star goes through an activity cycle, {{the outer layers}} of the star are subject to a magnetic torque changing the distribution of angular momentum, resulting in {{a change in the}} star's oblateness. The orbit of the stars in the <b>binary</b> <b>pair</b> is gravitationally coupled to their shape changes, so that the period shows modulations (typically on the order of ∆P/P ∼ 10−5) on the same time scale as the activity cycles (typically on the order of decades).|$|E

50|$|A major theory {{associated}} with Structuralism was binary opposition.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} binary star systems still remain key questions in modern astronomy. Wide <b>binary</b> <b>pairs</b> (separations > 10 ^ 3 AU) are particularly intriguing because their low binding energies {{make it difficult for}} the stars to stay gravitationally bound over extended timescales,and thus probe the dynamics of binary {{formation and}} dissolution. Our previous SLoWPoKES I & II catalogs provided the largest and most complete sample of wide <b>binary</b> <b>pairs</b> of low masses. Here we present an extension of these catalogs to a broad range of stellar masses: the Gaia Assorted Mass Binaries Long Excluded from SloWPoKES (GAMBLES), comprising 8, 660 statistically significant wide pairs that we make available in a living online database. Within this catalog we identify a subset of 543 long-lived (dissipation timescale > 1. 5 Gyr) candidate <b>binary</b> <b>pairs,</b> of assorted mass, with typical separations between 10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 5. 5 AU (0. 002 - 1. 5 pc), using the published distances and proper motions from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution and Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry. Each pair has at most a false positive probability of 0. 05; the total expectation is 2. 44 false binaries in our sample. Among these, we find 22 systems with 3 components, 1 system with 4 components, and 15 pairs consisting of at least 1 possible red giant. We find the largest long-lived binary separation to be nearly 3. 2 pc; even so, > 76 % of GAMBLES long-lived binaries have large binding energies and dissipation lifetimes longer than 1. 5 Gyr. Finally, we find the distribution of binary separations is clearly bimodal, corroborating the finding from SloWPoKES and suggesting multiple pathways for the formation and dissipation of the widest binaries in the Galaxy.
