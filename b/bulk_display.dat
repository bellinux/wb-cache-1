40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) relaxation experimentation is an e ective technique for non-destructively probing {{the dynamics of}} proton-bearing uids in porous media. The frequencydependent relaxation rate T− 1 1 can yield {{a wealth of information}} on the uid dynamics within the pore provided data can be t to a suitable spin di usion model. A spin di usion model yields the dipolar correlation function G(t) describing the relative translational motion of pairs of 1 H spins which then can be Fourier transformed to yield T− 1 1. G(t) for spins con ned to a quasi-two-dimensional (Q 2 D) pore of thickness h is determined using theoretical and Monte Carlo techniques. G(t) shows a transition from three- to two-dimensional (2 D) motion with the transition time proportional to h 2. T− 1 1 is found to be independent of frequency over the range 0. 01 { 100 MHz provided h ? 5 nm and increases with decreasing frequency and decreasing h for pores of thickness h < 3 nm. T− 1 1 increases linearly with the bulk water di usion correlation time b allowing a simple and direct estimate of the bulk water di usion coe cient from the high-frequency limit of T− 1 1 dispersion measurements in systems where the in uence of paramagnetic impurities is negligible.

In this study, we assessed the effect of combining a drug that abrogates CSC properties with standard-of-care therapy in a Ewing sarcoma family tumor (ESFT). Emergence of CSC in this setting {{has been shown to}} arise from a defect in TARBP 2 -dependent microRNA maturation, which can be corrected by exposure to the fluoroquinolone enoxacin. In the present work, primary ESFT from four patients containing CD 133 (+) CSC subpopulations ranging from 3 % to 17 % of total tumor cells were subjected to treatment with enoxacin, doxorubicin, or both drugs. Primary ESFT CSC and <b>bulk</b> tumor cells <b>displayed</b> divergent responses to standard-of-care chemotherapy and enoxacin.

Our results identify a potentially attractive therapeutic strategy for ESFT that combines mechanism-based targeting of CSC using a low-toxicity antibiotic with a standard-of-care cytotoxic drug, offering immediate applications for clinical evaluation...|$|R

In particular, we exploit modern computational techniques such as density functional theory (DFT), timedependent DFT, molecular dynamics, and the Marcus theory to analyze the charge and exciton transport properties in crystalline and amorphous phases of four compounds in which one phenyl ring of the TPA block of 2 -[(5 - 4 -[methyl-(phenyl) amino]phenylthiophen- 2 -yl) methylene]- malononitrile is replaced with a methyl, an α-naphthyl, and a β-naphthyl. Our calculations unveil the molecular rationale behind the different transport properties observed in the experiments. We show that, although the effects of the substituents on the electronic and optical properties are negligible, they {{have an impact on the}} molecular packing of the crystalline structure, thus explaining the different macroscopic transport properties (observed and calculated). In particular, the substitution of a phenyl with a methyl favors face-to-face π-π packing in the crystal structure and allows a good π-orbital overlap and high hopping rates. On the other hand, the introduction of an α-naphthyl group generates a steric hindrance that negatively affects the transport properties. Moreover, the investigated substitutions do not significantly influence the degree of local order in the amorphous <b>bulks</b> <b>displaying</b> complete disorder and low hole mobilities. These results, in agreement with the experimental findings, suggest that our computational approach is able to account for the macroscopic effect of subtle transformations of a molecular structure on transport properties and thus can be further employed to obtain valuable insights into the molecular design of optimized active materials for OPV...|$|R

In Cd_ 3 As_ 2, the Dirac nodes lead to a {{protection}} mechanism that strongly suppresses backscattering in zero magnetic field, resulting in ultrahigh mobility (∼ 10 ^ 7 cm^ 2 V^- 1 s^- 1). In applied magnetic field, an anomalous Nernst effect is predicted to arise from the Berry curvature associated with the Weyl nodes. We report observation of a large anomalous Nernst effect in Cd_ 3 As_ 2. Both the anomalous Nernst signal and transport relaxation time τ_tr begin to increase rapidly at ∼ 50 K. This suggests a close relation between the protection mechanism and the anomalous Nernst effect.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Hydrothermal {{carbonization}} {{has been}} gaining significant interest {{over the past ten}} years as a low temperature, environmentally friendly method of converting naturally occurring carbon containing precursors (e. g, glucose, cellulose) into valuable carbon materials. In addition to this, the doping of carbon materials is relatively easy under hydrothermal carbonization, as the dopant of choice can be simply added to the hydrothermal solution prior to carbonization. The overall purpose of this thesis was to examine the resultant material from hydrothermally carbonizing sucrose, with or without a nitrogen dopant, specifically for the purpose of producing enhanced carbon materials for electrochemical capacitors. The introduction chapters will examine the history and current understanding of both hydrothermal carbonization and electrochemical capacitors. Sucrose was chosen for the hydrothermal precursor due to its low cost, high rate of reaction and lack of examination in the literature. It was found that nitrogen level of 9. 4 at% could be incorporated into the hydrothermal structure using a 0. 2 M NaOH + 0. 2 M (NH₄) ₂SO₄ + 0. 2 M sucrose hydrothermal solution. The hydrothermal carbons were thoroughly tested using FTIR, EA, XPS, NMR, NEXAFS, SEM and electrochemical methods. There were minimal differences between sucrose and other hydrothermally carbonized saccharides reported in the literature in regards to both the surface and bulk structure. The surface of the hydrothermal carbons from sucrose contained a wide variety of oxygenated functionalities (ketones, hydroxyls, carbonyls), whereas the <b>bulk</b> <b>displayed</b> the predominate furan structure that had previously been identified. The addition of nitrogen formed pyrroles, pyridines, imines, amides and imidazoles within the structure, while amines were only found on the surface. To the best of our knowledge, NEXAFS has not been applied to hydrothermal carbon and this is the first reported examination of hydrothermal carbon utilizing that technique. The hydrothermal carbon was also heat treated and activated for use in electrochemical capacitors, a maximum capacitance of 303 F g - 1, was achieved with non-doped hydrothermal carbon activated with H₃PO₄ at 800 °C. Step potential electrochemical spectroscopy was used to further examine the electrochemical properties of these activated hydrothermal carbons and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of using this technique on activated hydrothermal carbon. The SPECS measurements indicated a relationship between oxygen and nitrogen groups on the surface, in that diffusion limited reactions (pseudocapacitance) increased with decreasing oxygen content. This suggested that oxygen functionalities inhibit the ability for nitrogen to contribute electrochemically, a finding that had not previously been reported...|$|R
