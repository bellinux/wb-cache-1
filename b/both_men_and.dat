5|$|According to Dyer in 1982, {{exclusion}} of netball from the Summer Olympics {{is part of}} the historical pattern of the slow growth and gradual acceptance of women's sports. Women first competed in the 1900 Summer Olympics in only three sports: tennis, croquet and golf. Women's cycling was excluded for many years despite having world championships organised by 1958. Field hockey, a sport included for men as early as 1908, was not open to competition by women until 1980. By the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, there were 159 medal events for men, but only 86 for women, and 12 for <b>both</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women, and as late as 1996, 26 countries sent no women to the Olympics. There were still sports that excluded women at the 2000 Summer Olympics, such as boxing, wrestling and baseball.

5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{concerns}} women is {{the dress code}} expected of them. Islam requires <b>both</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women to dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments.

5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching <b>both</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> machinery within.|$|E
5|$|Due to World War II, no {{games were}} held in 1940 or 1944. Two new alpine events were added in 1948: {{downhill}} and slalom.

5|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting <b>both</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women.
