5000|$|His {{success in}} {{capitalizing on the}} vast honey {{potential}} of San Diego County, along with his extensive campaign of selling bees to {{the residents of the}} county was the major force in making San Diego County the greatest honey producing county in the State of California by 1874, which in turn made California the leading honey producing state of the Union. John Harbison was a major contributor to the theory of bee culture with his development of new tools and methods that characterized the remarkable advances made in nineteenth century apicultural science. Harbison and his brother William were both important 19th century American authors on <b>bee</b> keeping <b>science.</b> [...] Furthermore, he opened up the great retail markets east of the Mississippi River needed to absorb the tremendous honey crops produced in California. Harbison, known as the [...] "King of the Beekeepers" [...] died on October 12, 1912, in San Diego at the age of eighty-six.|$|R
40|$|Beekeeping {{is practiced}} {{in all parts}} of the world, and honey is {{produced}} and marketed as an international commodity. Bees are recognized as important pollinators of food crops. New management and production techniques are continually being developed in response to the increased demand for honey and other hive products and in recognition of the role of bees in pollination. In many parts of Africa, honey is collected from tree branches hollows and crevices, but only in Egypt, Kenya and Tanzania is the practice of keeping bees in hives followed to any great extent. Even there traditional beekeeping does not make use of correct equipment and modern techniques. Two books have been published recently which throw light on the practice and <b>science</b> of <b>bees</b> and beekeeping both in Africa and worldwide. Beekeeping in Africa, by Stephen O Adjare of the Apiculture Unit of the Kumasi University of Science and Technology in Ghana, is one of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Service Bulletins. It focuses on the problems, opportunities and resources which are peculiar to Africa, while drawing on the experience of beekeepers from around the world. It stresses the potential that beekeeping offers to rural development for nutrition and income generation, and concentrates on the use of local technology and materials as well as the particular characteristics of the African honeybee. <b>Bees</b> and beekeeping: <b>science,</b> practice and world resources, by Eva Crane, who was formerly director of the International Bee Research Association, explains the scientific principles underlying effective beekeeping and their practical application in different climates and conditions. Dr Crane's work includes sections on varieties of bees, types of hives, bee health, plant resources and hive products. It finishes with a study of beekeepers themselves and the laws relating to beekeeping. There are also appendices on world honey sources and their geographical distribution and a gazeteer of individual countries, together with bibliography, plant index, geographical name index and subject index.

40|$|This study {{explains}} the development paradigm of Islamic {{studies in the}} College (PTAI) that is inspired by the transformation of science that has developed along {{with the demands of}} a globalized world which is marked the transformation of information technology or information civilization. This study is a library research at IAIN Ambon. The research resource includes the book of the Scientific Development Paradigm at IAIN Ambon with hermeneutic and deconstructive approach and critical analysis. Based on the research concluded: (1) Scientific paradigm developed in Ambon IAIN is interconnected-integrated paradigm in the metaphor of <b>bees,</b> where all <b>sciences</b> are closely related each other; and (2) the development of integrated-interconnected paradigm at Ambon IAIN conceptually is not fully relevant to the idea of founding fathers on this paradigm. It seems immature and not yet supported by the strong philosophy principles. </p...|$|R
40|$|The queen mandibular gland {{component}} (2 E) - 9 -oxodecenoic acid (9 -ODA) {{has been}} suggested to function as the major sex pheromone component in all honey bee species. In contrast to this hypothesis, chemical analyses showed that in the Asian dwarf honey bee species, Apis florea, a different decenoic acid, (2 E) - 10 -hydroxydecenoic acid (10 -HDA), is the major component in the mandibular gland secretion. We show here that A. florea drones are attracted to 9 -ODA {{as well as to}} 10 -HDA. However, 10 -HDA attracted higher numbers of drones at lower dosages than 9 -ODA, and also was more attractive when directly compared to 9 -ODA in a dual attraction experiment. We conclude that 10 -HDA has to be viewed as the major sex pheromone in A. florea. The result that both pheromone components are capable of attracting drones when presented alone was unexpected with regard to existing sex pheromone attraction experiments in honey <b>bees.</b> Â© Springer <b>Science</b> + Business Media, LLC 2009...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Science</b> <b>Bee</b> contest was {{introduced}} in the year 2010 and is aimed at nurturing the interest and understanding of Science among children in grades 1 through 8. <b>Science</b> <b>bee</b> is split into 3 levels based on grade. The grade eligibility is determined as of February 1.There are 3 levels of competition in Science Bee:JSC (Junior Science Bee): Grades 1, 2 and 3ISC (Intermediate Science Bee): Grades 4 and 5SSC (Senior Science Bee): Grades 6, 7 and 8The syllabus for the <b>Science</b> <b>Bee,</b> level-wise, can be found on this website. It should be understood that any syllabus can only act as a guideline, and in the same given category of syllabus, the level of difficulty can vary dramatically from a beginner to an advanced level. This syllabus includes a comprehensive list of sub-topics and science vocabulary words the students will be expected to know. While most of the fielded questions will touch upon the topics listed in the syllabus, question papers may also incorporate a few challenging questions that go beyond factual knowledge but, instead, require interpretation or application of the scientific principles covered by the syllabus.Science bees (JSC, ISC & SSC) are held as a written examination only. Contestants should bring their own pencils and sharpeners. Parents are NOT allowed in the examination room.Each contestant will be given a set of 30 questions to answer them. The maximum time allocated to answer the 30 questions is 40 minutes. Each contestant is given the question paper along with a blank answer sheet with 30 numbered rows to write the final answer. Each question has adequate space to arrive at the answer with a pencil. No other sheets will be given. Contestants are allowed to use the backside of the question paper to work out problems. Contestants are required to transfer the answers from the question paper to the answer sheet (which is attached to the question paper and contains 30 numbered rows to write the final answer).Calculators are NOT allowed at any level.All sheets (including question and answer sheets) shall be returned {{at the end of the}} contest.Unclear and illegible writing might be open for misinterpretation. So, contestants are expected to write clearly and legibly. The decision of the judges is final.There will NOT be any partial credits for steps. There will be NO negative points for any incorrect answer. The contestant will be awarded one point for the correct answer and zero for an incorrect answer. Answers that are not transferred to the answer sheet will not get any credit.Winners and Ranks:Based on the total scores, the judges will determine the winners. The 1st-place winner shall be ahead by at least one point to be declared as the champion. In announcing the ranks 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, the judges will follow these rules:Announce Ranks 1, 2 and 3, if and only if there are at least 10 contestantsAnnounce Ranks 1 and 2 ONLY, if there are 8 or 9 contestantsAnnounce Rank 1 ONLY, if there are 5-7 contestantsDO NOT announce any ranks if there are less than 5 contestantsTiebreaker Rules:The tiebreaker rules apply ONLY if there are at least 5 or more contestants participating in a given center and at the discretion of the judges/regional coordinator.After tabulation of scores, if there is a tie, the scheme outlined below is followed in the order given, to break the tie:Score among questions 1-30Score among questions 26-30Score among questions 21-25Score among questions 11-20Score among questions 1-10If the above steps fail to break the tie in question, the foundation may use additional measures to resolve them or award joint ranks.Invitation to National Finals:Invitation to National Finals is based on the scores of all the contestants nationally and is not based on a direct correlation of ranks achieved by a contestant in a regional contest. Thus, the score of each contestant relative to all such scores around the country will determine whether the contestant will be invited to the National Finals. The regional tiebreakers are only helpful in determining the winners for a particular center, but have no bearing on the Finals invitation.|$|R
