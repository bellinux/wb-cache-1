30|$|When {{natural gas}} is processed, the heavier {{components}} are removed in order to supply high quality gas to the market and also {{to ensure the safety}} and reliability of the pipeline system. For example, gas turbine generator plants have a written requirement in their warrantees that the fuel gas must be totally gaseous. In order to comply with this requirement, the gas is superheated to a minimum of 50  °F/ 28  °C above the highest dew point of the gas at the pressure regulators located ahead of the <b>burner</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of turbojet-engine thrust augmentation {{by means of}} tail-pipe burning was conducted in the NACA Lewis altitude wind tunnel. Performance data were obtained with a tail-pipe burner having a converging conical <b>burner</b> <b>section</b> installed on an axial-flow-compressor type turbojet engine over a range of simulated flight conditions and tail-pipe fuel-air ratios with a fixed-area exhaust nozzle. A maximum tail-pipe combustion efficiency of 0. 86 was obtained {{at an altitude of}} 15, 000 feet and a flight Mach number of 0. 23. Tail-pipe burner operation was possible up to an altitude of 45, 000 feet at a flight Mach number of 0. 23...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the thermo-acoustic {{properties}} {{of a system}} equipped with a segmented burner are investigated. Such segmentation can for example be realized by combining two different burners on the same deck. The study is conducted using finite element and network modelling techniques. It is found that even a small spatial separation of the <b>burner’s</b> <b>sections</b> can lead to significant alteration of the global acoustic behavior of the system. In particular, {{the location of the}} eigenmodes and hence the stability of the system can be affected. It is shown that the local modification of the acoustic field {{in the vicinity of the}} partitioned burner is the physical reason for this phenomena. This finding poses some limitations on to use of the lumped transfer function decomposition approach to estimate the global burner response of a composite flame/burner...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new test section for fuel spray investigations of a generic aero engine <b>burner.</b> The test <b>section</b> {{is designed for}} air-preheat temperatures up to 900 K, air pressures up to 2. 5 MPa and air mass flow of 1. 5 kg/s. The {{cross section of the}} spray chamber has a dimension of 102 x 102 mm. The fuel is not burned in the spray chamber itself, but in a catalytic combustor downstream of the test section. Due to this, optical investigations of the swirling spray without disturbing effects of the combustion are possible. Another outstanding feature of this test section is the possibility of investigations of the fuel atomization inside a burner with tomographic shadowgraphy [1]. Four large optical accesses to the burner flow field in the chamber and additional three accesses {{at the end of the}} chamber offer the possibility for a wide range of optical measuring methods like LDA, PDA or Mie- Scattering...|$|R
40|$|A payload was {{designed}} {{which included a}} cryogenic oxidizer tank, a fuel tank, and <b>burner</b> <b>section.</b> Release of 30 lb of chemicals was planned to occur in 2 seconds at the optimum oxidizer to fuel ratio. The chemicals consisted of 17 lb of liquid fluorine oxidizer and 13 lb of hydrazine-barium salt fuel mixture. The fuel mixture was 17 % barium chloride, 16 % barium nitrate, and 67 % hydrazine, and contained 2. 6 lb of available barium. Two significant problem areas were resolved during the program: explosive valve development and burner operation. The release payload was flight tested, from Wallops Island, Virginia. The release took place {{at an altitude of}} approximately 260 km. The release produced a luminous cloud which expanded very rapidly, disappearing to the human eye in about 20 seconds. Barium ion concentration slowly increased over a wide area of sky until measurements were discontinued at sunrise (about 30 minutes) ...|$|E
40|$|Thrust {{augmentation}} of an axial-flow type {{turbojet engine}} by burning fuel {{in the tail}} pipe has been investigated in the NACA Cleveland altitude wind tunnel. The performance was determined over a range of simulated flight conditions and tail-pipe fuel flows. The engine tail pipe was modified for the investigation to reduce the gas velocity at the inlet of the tail-pipe combustion chamber and to provide an adequate seat for the flame; four such modifications were investigated. The highest net-thrust increase obtained in the investigation was 86 percent with a net thrust specific fuel consumption of 2. 91 and a total fuel-air ratio of 0. 0523. The highest combustion efficiencies obtained with the four configurations ranged from 0. 71 to 0. 96. With three of the tail-pipe burners, for which no external cooling was provided, the exhaust nozzle and the rear part of the <b>burner</b> <b>section</b> were bright red during operation at high tail-pipe fuel-air ratios. With the tail-pipe burner for which fuel and water cooling were provided, the outer shell of the tail-pipe burner showed no evidence of elevated temperatures at any operating condition...|$|E
40|$|Combined-gas and steam-turbine {{power plants}} have become popular {{in recent years}} for {{distributed}} power generation and heat production. The optimal thermodynamic and economical design of these plants requires the study of their main components, which are the gas turbine, the steam turbine and the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG). The HRSG is a heat exchanger that recovers heat from the gas turbine cycle and produces steam and/or hot water, either {{to be used in}} a downstream steam cycle or to feed industrial/civil utilities. Some HRSGs include Supplementary Firing (SF) which are additional burners providing additional energy at lower capital costs. However, the supplementary burners cause pressure drops through the duct burner bars which makes the gas turbine to be exhausted at higher pressures. The gas pressure drop should be limited, as previous works show each additional 10 millibars gas pressure drop in the HRSG decreases the gas turbine power output by about 1 %. In this work, pressure drop in an off- Supplementary Firing burner of HRSGs has been simulated using two- and three-dimensional models. Simulations indicate that the pressure drop increases with the temperature of the flow entering the <b>burner</b> <b>section.</b> The computational results show very good agreement with semi-empirical results. ...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experimental}} study examines NO(sub x), and CO emissions associated with three alternative fuel-injector geometries. These injectors mix fuel and air and strain their interfaces to differing extents and thus create different local equivalence ratios within flow regions upstream of flame ignition and stabilization. Two {{of the devices}} studied are lobed fuel injectors, in which molecular mixing of reactants is associated with streamwise vorticity generation, while the third one is a non-lobed fuel injector. Results show that rapid mixing allowed both lobed injector geometries to produce very lean premixed flame structures, with a lower achievable turn-down or fuel/air mass flux ratio than for the analogous non-lobed injector, which largely, produced distinct diffusion flames. All three injectors exhibited some level of sooting near walls and in the far-field region, with the non-lobed injector sooting to the greatest extent. At low fuel flow rates, in which the lobed injectors created locally very lean premixed conditions, there resulted lower NO(sub x) emissions as compared with non-lobed injector emissions. Yet at higher fuel-air mass flux ratios, NO(sub x) emissions from the lobed injectors were actually higher than for the nonlobed injector, likely due to reduced sooting and hence reduced radiative heat losses associated with enhanced mixing. For both lobed injector geometries examined here, CO emissions became high for low values of the fuel/air mass flux ratio, again consistent with locally premixed combustion behavior, {{despite the fact that}} fuel was injected separately from air directly into the <b>burner</b> test <b>section.</b> The present study demonstrates that, for fuel-air mixing enhancement devices, control of the local equivalence ratio is critical in order to optimize burner emissions...|$|R
40|$|Bilayered porous burners are {{characterized}} by being constituted of two porous layers of different porosity. The flame front is stabilized within the higher porosity layer, which is preceded by another layer with pores of smaller diameter. An innovative two-layer porous burner that integrates a newly designed household heating system is numerically studied. The bilayered porous burner studied in this work integrates an innovative household heating system, also composed of a cool flame vaporizer and a multi-jet boiler. As a consequence of this assembly, it operates facing a high temperature wall, which affects the radiative heat losses of the burner. In order to assess the influence of this high temperature wall downstream of the <b>burner</b> outlet <b>section</b> {{on the performance of}} the burner, a numerical study of the flow and heat transfer within the combustion chamber was conducted by means of a three-dimensional model of a unit cell representative of the geometry of the two-layered porous burner. The model includes the Navier-Stokes equations, the gas and solid energy balances and the transport equations for chemical species and was computationally implemented using the finite volume/finite differences method. Radiation heat transfer in the solid matrices and local thermal non-equilibrium are accounted for. Additionally, detailed reaction mechanisms are applied to model the combustion process, allowing for the prediction of the pollutants formation. Calculations of the burner over a broad range of operating conditions were conducted, considering either the existence or not of a high temperature wall downstream of the burner outlet. A comparison of the performance of the burner showed that operation facing the high temperature wall: i) promotes the stabilization of the flame front deeper inside the higher porosity ceramic foam, close to the interface of the porous layers for all the range of operating conditions and ii) results in higher peak temperatures and NO and CO emissions...|$|R
50|$|The {{ethylene}} plant produces ethylene (also {{known as}} ethene) from ethane. Ethylene and ethane are both gases. The ethane flows {{to the plant}} via a pipeline ultimately from Bass Strait oil and gas wells. The ethylene is produced by steam cracking. In this process, gaseous ethane briefly heated to 750-950 °C in a thermal cracker. The cracker is a large box with many gas <b>burners</b> and long <b>sections</b> of pipe inside. The ethane flows inside the pipe and is partially converted to ethylene and hydrogen. The reaction is moderated or improved {{by the addition of}} hydrogen sulfide. This material is usually supplied from the Litol plant or if this plant is not running dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) is used. The rest of the plant is principally involved with purifying and compressing this gas stream to a concentration suitable for the Alkylation plant. A four-stage compression plant is used to purify the ethylene. The gas mixture is washed with water and caustic to remove acid gas and sulfides. Ethylene is produced by cryogenic separation. The ethylene product of this plant is not stored but piped directly to the Alkylation plant where it is consumed. If the Alkylation plant cannot accept the ethylene, the gas is sent to the flare.|$|R
40|$|A turbine-engine-based hybrid {{propulsion}} system is described. Turbojet engines are integrated with a single-throat ramjet {{so as to}} minimize variable geometry and eliminate redundant propulsion components. The result is a simple, lightweight system that is operable from takeoff to high Mach numbers. Non-afterburning turbojets are mounted within the ramjet duct. They exhaust through a converging-diverging (C-D) nozzle into a common ramjet <b>burner</b> <b>section.</b> At low speed the ejector effect of the C-D nozzle aerodynamically isolates the relatively high pressure turbojet exhaust stream from the ramjet duct. As the Mach number increases, and the turbojet pressure ratio diminishes, the system is biased naturally toward ramjet operation. The common ramjet burner is fueled with hydrogen and thermally choked, thus avoiding the weight and complexity of a variable geometry, split-flow exhaust system. The mixed-compression supersonic inlet and subsonic diffuser are also common to both the turbojet and ramjet cycles. As the compressor face total temperature limit is approached, a two-position flap within the inlet is actuated, which closes off the turbojet inlet and provides increased internal contraction for ramjet operation. Similar actuation of the turbojet C-D nozzle flap completes the enclosure of the turbojet. Performance of the hybrid system is compared herein {{to that of the}} discrete turbojet and ramjet engines from takeoff to Mach 6. The specific impulse of the hybrid system falls below that of the non-integrated turbojet and ramjet because of ejector and Rayleigh losses. Unlike the discrete turbojet or ramjet however, the hybrid system produces thrust over the entire Mach number range. An alternate mode of operation for takeoff and low speed is also described. In this mode the C-D nozzle flap is deflected to a third position, which closes off the ramjet duct and eliminates the ejector total pressure loss...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} work done in the {{development}} of a modified Lean Premix Prevaporised (LPP) burner for the use in Alstom Power Sweden’s industrial gas turbines. Incentive for the development of the modified burner have been the need to increase the flame stability over the operating range for the burner, especially for the liquid fuel but also the gaseous fuel operation. Foundation for modifications to the baseline burner was placed by a theoretical analysis of the processes and demands, which directs the LPP burner operation. Numerical simulations were performed to establish the flow field of the existing burner and to evaluate principles for possible modifications. Based on the analysis proposal and the restrictions put by the existing hardware, a number of modifications were proposed. Modifications adapted to the burner included the introduction of a central body, a diffusion type gas pilot at the central lance tip, a quarl-diffuser burner outlet and the application of new main- and pilot liquid fuel injectors. To serve as a basis for the evaluation of the liquid fuel performance of the modified burner the liquid fuel injector’s isothermal spray characteristics were evaluated using PDA and water spray visualisation. The fuel injectors and the modifications flame stability and operation range for gaseous and liquid fuel operation at atmospheric conditions were evaluated in comparison to the existing baseline burner. Introduction of the geometrical changes to the baseline burner with the central body and quarl outlet has changed the internal aerodynamics of the burner so that at atmospheric operation the introduced modifications were able to suppress the pressure oscillations over the load range, and to decrease the Lean Blow Off limit (LBO) by a factor 1. 5 for the gaseous fuel operation. By positioning the central body end at the beginning of the diffuser quarl the firm attachment of the forward stagnation point and the recirculation zone to the central body was achieved for the liquid fuel operation. This supplied a stable aerodynamics to the flame. Introduction of the liquid fuel spray inside the swirl generator, slightly downstream half the height of the swirl generator gave a good balance between the radial transport of the spray to provide an even distribution of the <b>burner</b> cross <b>section,</b> while reducing the risk of droplets impacting on the swirl generator vanes and burner wall. The liquid fuel operation with the new injection nozzle positioned in the central body have proven to be able to supply a stable main flame operation from a normalised flame temperature 30 % below the design flame temperature. NOx emissions performance was found to be more or less solely dependent on the positioning of the spray within the swirl generator in contrast to the injection at the swirler/mixing tube transitio...|$|R
