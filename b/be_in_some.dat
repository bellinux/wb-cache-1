Large landslide deposits are common {{at the base}} of Ionian mountains, suggesting that mass wasting is the primary form of degradation. Scalloped margins are common among Io's mesas and plateaus, the result of sulfur dioxide sapping from Io's crust, producing zones of weakness along mountain margins.|$|E

The linguistically isolated Romansh culture in Graubünden in eastern Switzerland constitutes an exception, it survives only in the upper valleys of the Rhine and the Inn and strives to maintain its rare linguistic tradition.|$|E

5|$|Though a {{few small}} factions broke with Smith's {{organization}} during his lifetime, he retained the allegiance {{of the vast majority}} of Latter Day Saints until his death in June 1844. Following Smith's death, the movement experienced a leadership crisis which led to a schism within the church. The largest group, which would become the LDS Church, followed Brigham Young, settling in what would become the Utah Territory. The second-largest faction, the RLDS Church, coalesced around Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Joseph Smith. Other would-be leaders included the senior surviving member of the First Presidency, Sidney Rigdon; the newly baptized James Strang from Wisconsin; and Alpheus Cutler, one of the Council of Fifty. Each of these men still retains a following as of 2014—however tiny it may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases—and all of their organizations have experienced further schisms. Other claimants, such as Granville Hedrick, William Bickerton and Charles B. Thompson, later emerged to start still other factions, some of which have further subdivided.|$|E

25|$|The Revolution {{opened the}} way for cataclysmic change in Persia, heralding the modern era. It saw a period of {{unprecedented}} debate in a burgeoning press.

Generally only Toth sorcerers remain as wights, their spirits presumably having been stronger than their non-magical fellows.|$|E

Indeed, in systems where the number of possible states is far greater than that of molecules in the compartment (e.g. the cell), they cannot <b>be.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> cases, empirical information can be used to rule out certain states if, for instance, some combinations of features are incompatible.

25|$|Direct imaging {{can give}} only loose {{constraints}} of the planet's mass, which {{is derived from the}} age of the star and the temperature of the planet. Mass can vary considerably, as planets can form several million years after the star has formed. The cooler the planet is, the less the planet's mass needs to <b>be.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> cases it is possible to give reasonable constraints to the radius of a planet based on planet's temperature, its apparent brightness, and its distance from Earth. The spectra emitted from planets {{do not have to be}} separated from the star, which eases determining the chemical composition of planets.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Western art, drawing the human figure from living models was {{considered}} {{the most effective way}} to develop the skill of draftsmanship. First, it is best to draw from life, rather than copying two dimensional images such as photographs. Second, an artist has a connection to drawing another human being that cannot exist with any other subject. Models for life drawing classes are usually nude. In the classroom setting, where the purpose is to learn how to draw the human form in all the different shapes, ages and ethnicity, there are no real limitations on who the model can <b>be.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> cases, the model may pose with various props, one or more other models, against real or artificial background, in natural or artificial light and so on.|$|E

25|$|Having waited fifteen days to {{play their}} quarter-final, Durham progressed to Finals Day after a 44-run win at the Riverside. Having been put into bat, the {{visitors}} took three early wickets, removing dangermen Phil Mustard, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Paul Collingwood, with the score only on 26. After Michael Di Venuto fell, Durham looked to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> trouble. However, a fifth wicket partnership of 53 between Will Smith and captain Dale Benkenstein pushed the score up. Smith made 51 as Durham set a target of 164, for Glamorgan to chase. It could've been somewhat lower {{had it not been}} for virtuoso innings by Gareth Breese, smashing 20 off just 9 balls, and Liam Plunkett who hit 12* off 3. James Harris took 3 wickets, but accounted for around a quarter of the runs conceded.|$|E
25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E
25|$|Adam Gilchrist {{opened in}} his usual quick-hitting style, making 60 runs from 48 balls, {{including}} nine fours and one six. At one stage, {{in the course of}} three overs, Gilchrist piled on 41 runs. His partner Hayden contributed one run during this time. Chris Cairns was brought into the attack to attempt to slow the run rate, but it took the bowling of Scott Styris to remove Gilchrist from the batting crease, caught by Nathan Astle. The new batsman Ricky Ponting with Hayden put together a useful partnership to be 1/140, before Ponting was dismissed after making 32. It was in Ponting's innings that New Zealand's veteran bowler Chris Harris, in saving four runs, dove to his left, landed awkwardly on his shoulder and tore his rotator cuff, in his 250th ODI. Ponting's dismissal proved to be the precursor to another middle order collapse for Australia, for Hayden was dismissed just a few minutes later for 43, and in even shorter order Damien Martyn was dismissed for 5 and Andrew Symonds for his second consecutive duck. Australia had lost four wickets for eight runs and looked to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> bother, which was exacerbated five overs later with the loss of Michael Clarke for just six runs. At six wickets down though, Darren Lehmann and Brad Hogg steadied and put on a partnership of 74 runs before Darren Lehmann was run out with two overs remaining at 7/235. The incoming batsman Brett Lee put on 10 quick runs and Brad Hogg a further 16 to have Australia at 7/261 after 50 overs.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} character was generally mixed.

[...] In the third series, Mackenzie praised the episode where Tom tries to clear his name, but thought his exit was [...] "not particularly satisfying."
