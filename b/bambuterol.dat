The first order derivative spectra was obtained in chloroform and the determinations were made at 241 nm (ZCP of <b>bambuterol</b> hydrochloride) for montelukast sodium and 258. 4 nm (ZCP of montelukast sodium) for <b>bambuterol</b> hydrochloride.

40|$|<b>Bambuterol,</b> the bis-dimethyl {{carbamate}} prodrug of terbutaline, {{was tested}} for its potency in inhibiting cholinesterases in human blood. Preincubation of blood with <b>bambuterol</b> {{in the absence}} of thiocholine ester substrate was essential for obtaining maximal inhibition. The inhibition exerted by <b>bambuterol</b> after such preincubation was re-versible and noncompetitive. <b>Bambuterol</b> was an extremely effective inhibitor of cholinesterase when butyryithiocholine was used as substrate (l = 1. 7 ± 0. 3 x 10 M, N = 10) whereas it was 2400 -fold less efficient in inhibiting cholinesterase with acetyithiocholine as substrate (l = 4. 1 ± 0. 5 x 1 O M, N = 10). Because butyrylthio-choline is the preferred substrate for cholinesterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 8) and acetylthiocholine for acetyicholinesterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 7), these results indicate that <b>bambuterol</b> is a remarkably selective and potent inhib-itor of cholinesterase.

40|$|Regularity is a {{key element}} of {{maintenance}} drug treatment; compliance is crucial for treatment success. Once- or twice-daily intake of a drug is always easier to comply with than regimens requiring more frequent dosing. Bronchodilating treatment was used as an example to illustrate how sustained duration of effect can be achieved by two different approaches: oral administration of the terbutaline prodrug <b>bambuterol</b> and inhalation of formoterol. Bioanalytical methods were employed to monitor the kinetic fate of <b>bambuterol</b> and formoterol in plasma, urine, or faeces. Generated terbutaline in plasma was used as a marker of effect for <b>bambuterol.</b> Established clinical laboratory tests were used to assess local and systemic effects of inhaled formoterol compared with salbutamol. Recommended doses of <b>bambuterol,</b> 10 - 20 mg once daily in adults, normally produced plasma concentrations of the active moiety terbutaline within therapeutically relevant limits. Dose proportionality for terbutaline makes dosing with <b>bambuterol</b> predictable. Compared with adults, children should be given higher doses than indicated by their lower body weight. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that absorption of <b>bambuterol</b> was slow and multi-phasic and that slow biotransformation to terbutaline occurred both presystemically and systemically. Systemically circulating formoterol was rapidly eliminated, the inactive (S;S) -formoterol more rapidly than the active (R;R) -formoterol. An inactive phenol glucuronide was the main metabolite, and a previously unknown sulphate metabolite was discovered. Duration of systemically mediated cardiovascular or metabolic side-effects of inhaled formoterol seemed not to differ from those of an inhaled systemically equieffective dose of salbutamol. There was a trend suggesting that the magnitude of systemic side-effects may be less pronounced after inhalation of formoterol compared with a locally equieffective dose of inhaled salbutamol. Both approaches to sustaining stimulation of β 2 -adrenoceptors have their pros and cons. <b>Bambuterol</b> can be dosed orally once daily, but full effect is reached slowly. The effect of formoterol is reached within a few minutes, but administration must occur via the lungs, often twice daily.

Group 1 (n = 8) had a circadian variation of peak expiratory flow (PEF) 15 % or greater, and group 2 (n = 9) had a circadian PEF variation less than 15 %. Both groups were randomized and crossover treated for 4 weeks with (A) 0. 4 mg budesonide at 8 AM and 8 PM, (B) 20 mg <b>bambuterol</b> at 8 PM, and (C) placebo.

Details of all dispensed prescriptions for these drugs prescribed by general practitioners in England soon after their launch were provided in confidence by the Prescription Pricing Authority. Questionnaires {{were sent to the}} prescriber asking for details of events occurring after the first prescription (prescription event monitoring). Rates and relative risks of non-fatal cardiac failure and ischaemic heart disease were calculated, comparing <b>bambuterol</b> and salmeterol with the reference drug nedocromil.  RESULTS—The age and sex adjusted relative risk of non-fatal cardiac failure associated with <b>bambuterol</b> was 3. 41 (95 % confidence limits (CL) 1. 99 to 5. 86) when compared with nedocromil. When salmeterol was compared with nedocromil the adjusted relative risk of non-fatal cardiac failure was 1. 10 (95 % CL 0. 63 to 1. 91). The adjusted relative risk of non-fatal ischaemic heart disease was 1. 23 (95 % CL 0. 73 to 2. 08) and 1. 07 (95 % CL 0. 69 to 1. 66) for <b>bambuterol</b> and salmeterol, compared with nedocromil, respectively.

40|$|A {{miniaturized}} supported {{liquid membrane}} device {{has been developed}} for sample preparation and connected on-line to a packed capillary liquid chromatograph. The device consists of hydrophobic polypropylene hollow fiber, inserted and fastened in a cylindrical channel in a Kel-F piece. The pores of the fiber are filled with an organic solvent, in this study 6 -undecanone, thus forming a liquid membrane. The sample is pumped {{on the outside of}} the hollow fiber (donor), and the analytes are selectively enriched and trapped in the fiber lumen (acceptor). With this approach, the volume of the acceptor solution can be kept as low as 1 - 2 L. This stagnant acceptor solution is then transferred through capillaries attached to the fiber ends to the LC system. The system was tested with a secondary amine (<b>bambuterol),</b> as a model substance in aqueous standard solutions as well as in plasma. The best extraction efficiency in aqueous solution, with an acceptor volume of 1. 9 L, was 32. 5 % at a donor flow rate of 2. 5 L/min. At flow rates above 20 L/min, the concentration enrichment per time unit was approximately constant, at 0. 9 times/min, i. e., 9 times enrichment in about 10 min. The overall repeatability (RSD) for spiked plasma samples was ~ 4 % (n = 12).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundExisting {{treatments}} are inadequate for patients {{at high risk}} of coronary heart disease caused by elevated levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). <b>Bambuterol</b> is a prodrug of β 2 -agonist commonly used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with the advantage of once daily dosing and favorable side effect profile. The potential lipid-lowering effects of <b>bambuterol</b> were unclear, possibly due to the racemic <b>bambuterol</b> (rac-bambuterol) that was used in previous studies. MethodsThe lipid-lowering effects of R-bambuterol were examined in a randomized phase I trial in 48 healthy Chinese volunteers aged 18 – 45 years. Participants were randomly assigned to five groups to receive a single dose (2. 5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg) or multiple doses (5 mg) of oral medications of R-bambuterol, or a single dose of rac-bambuterol (10 mg). Plasma lipid levels were measured at baseline, time to peak concentration (Tmax) and 24 h after the treatment. FindingsAdministration of a single-dose of R-bambuterol resulted in dose-dependent reductions in the levels of plasma LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and apolipoprotein A 1 (ApoA 1) at Tmax. Levels of LDL-C exhibited the most reductions, which were statistically significant in all three single-dose R-bambuterol groups (all P values< 0. 05). R-bambuterol was more potent in LDL-C lowering compared to rac-bambuterol at Tmax (P= 0. 08). At 24 h after dosing, the significant lipid lowering effects of R-bambuterol sustained for LDL-C (P= 0. 01), ApoB (P= 0. 001) and ApoA 1 (P= 0. 03), but not for HDL-C. The ratio of ApoA 1 /ApoB was marginally increased (P= 0. 06). In the multiple-dose group, LDL-C levels again were significantly reduced (all P values< 0. 05), whereas the ratios of ApoA 1 /ApoB were marginally increased. InterpretationR-bambuterol can lower the plasma levels of LDL-C, and marginally raise the ratio of ApoA 1 /ApoB (indicator of HDL-C/LDL-C) with both a single dose and multiple doses. R-bambuterol was more potent in LDL-C lowering than rac-bambuterol...|$|E

40|$|Cholinergic {{neurotransmission}} ensures muscle contraction {{and plays}} a role in the regulation of respiratory pattern in the brainstem. Inactivation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by organophosphates produces respiratory failure but AChE knockout mice survive to adulthood. Respiratory adaptation mechanisms which ensure survival of these mice were examined in vivo by whole body plethysmography and in vitro in the neonatal isolated brainstem preparation. AChE-/- mice presented no AChE activity but unaffected butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity. In vivo, <b>bambuterol</b> (50 - 500 microg/kg s. c.) decreased BChE activity peripherally but not in brain tissue and induced apnea and death in adult and neonate AChE-/- mice without affecting littermate AChE+/+ and +/- animals. In vitro, bath-applied <b>bambuterol</b> (1 - 100 microm) and tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide (10 - 100 microm) decreased BChE activity in the brainstem but did not perturb central respiratory activity recorded from spinal nerve rootlets. In vitro, the cholinergic agonists muscarine (50 - 100 microm) and nicotine (0. 5 - 10 microm) induced tonic activity in respiratory motoneurons and increased the frequency of inspiratory bursts in AChE+/+ and +/- animals. These effects were greatly attenuated in AChE-/- animals. The results suggest that, in mice lacking AChE, (i) BChE becomes essential for survival peripherally but plays no critical role in central rhythm-generating structures and (ii) a major adaptive mechanism for respiratory survival is the down-regulated response of central respiratory-related neurons and motoneurons to muscarinic and nicotinic agonists...|$|E

Histochemical and enzymatic assays revealed abundance of AChE and BChE in normal mature neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). In normal NMJs, in which release was reduced by low Ca 2 +/high Mg 2 + medium BChE inhibition with tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide (iso-OMPA) or <b>bambuterol</b> decreased (∼ 50 %) evoked quantal release, while inhibition of AChE with fasciculin- 1, galanthamine (10, 20 μM) or neostigmine (0. 1 – 1 μM) increased (50 – 80 %) evoked quantal release. Inhibition of both AChE and BChE with galanthamine (80 μM), neostigmine (3 – 10 μM), O-ethylS- 2 -(diisopropylamino) ethyl-methylphosphono-thioate (MTP) or phospholine decreased evoked transmitter release (20 – 50 %). In AChE−/− NMJs, iso-OMPA pre-treatment decreased evoked release. Muscarinic toxin- 3 decreased evoked release in both AChE−/− and normal NMJs treated with low concentrations of neostigmine, galanthamine or fasciculin- 1, but had no effect in normal NMJs pretreated with iso-OMPA, <b>bambuterol,</b> MTP and phospholine. In normal and AChE−/− NMJs pretreatment with iso-OMPA failed to affect {{the time course of}} miniature endplate potentials and full-sized endplate potentials. Overall, our results suggest that inhibition or absence of AChE increases evoked quantal release by involving muscarinic receptors (mAChRs), while BChE inhibition decreases release through direct or indirect mechanisms not involving mAChRs. BChE apparently is not implicated in limiting the duration of acetylcholine action on postsynaptic receptors, but is involved in a presynaptic modulatory step of the release process...|$|E

A mouse strain with the anchoring domains of AChE deleted (del E 5 + 6 knockout mice) has very low activity {{in the brain and}} neuromuscular junction, but increased monomeric AChE in serum. A mouse strain with deletion of the muscle specific region of AChE (del i 1 RR knockout mice) exhibits no expression in muscle, but unaltered expression in the central nervous system. Neither strain exhibits the pronounced phenotypic traits observed in the complete AChE knockout strain. A third strain lacking the anchor molecule PRiMA, has no functional AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in brain and an unaltered respiratory function. BChE inhibition by <b>bambuterol</b> decreases tidal volume and body temperature in del E 5 + 6 and i 1 RR knockout strains, but not in PRiMA deletion or wild-type controls.

The onset times were similar in the two groups. There was significant prolongation of mivacurium clinical duration (by 18. 6 %) and recovery index (6. 67 %) as well as, significant reduction of the total mivacurium consumption (by 24. 1 %) in the esmolol group compared to the control group. The heart rate and blood pressure in the esmolol group were significantly lower than those in the control group throughout the study period. This study demonstrate that esmolol infusion caused a moderate inhibition of the PChE activity resulting in moderate prolongation of the clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium and reduction of its total dose consumption by infusion without the affecting the onset time. Caution is warranted if this combination is used in a patient with low PChE activity due to a disease, e. g., severe liver impairment or drugs, e. g., <b>bambuterol...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the contributions of}} acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition to the respiratory dysfunction produced by organophosphates in mice which were adapted or not to low AChE activity. Effects of acute selective inhibition of AChE and BChE on ventilation measured by whole-body plethysmography were compared in mice with either normal AChE activity (wild-type), or mice adapted to a null AChE activity (homozygotes for AChE gene deletion) or adapted to an intermediate level of activity (heterozygotes). In wild-type mice acute reduction of AChE by Huperzine A (1 mg/kg) to the level found in asymptomatic heterozygotes, induced tremors but no respiratory depression, whereas the same dose of Huperzine in heterozygote animals further reduced AChE activity, increased tidal volume (V(T)) and decreased breathing frequency (f(R)). A lethal dose of Huperzine in wild-type mice augmented these respiratory effects, but was ineffective in homozygotes. BChE inhibition by <b>bambuterol</b> was ineffective in wild-type mice and heterozygotes, decreased V(T) in homozygotes adapted to null AChE activity but increased V(T) in wild-type mice acutely treated with Huperzine, also aggravating the cholinergic syndrome. We conclude that: (1) Huperzine does not perturb respiration at a dose inhibiting 40 % of AChE, and at a lethal dose does not affect any other enzyme important for respiration; (2) Respiratory function is more sensitive to anticholinesterases in heterozygotes than in wild-type mice; (3) BChE may play distinct roles in respiratory function, because its inhibition has opposite effects on tidal volume {{depending on whether the}} mouse has adapted to null AChE or whether AChE has been lowered acutely; (4) BChE inhibition may contribute to the respiratory toxicity of organophosphates...|$|E
40|$|Background: Evidence is {{conflicting}} {{regarding the}} effectiveness of creating a low-allergen environment or reducing allergen exposure to control asthma exacerbations. Objective: This study determined the association of house dust mite (HDM) -specific IgE levels with asthma symptom control, selected medications, family history of allergic disease, and exposure to second-hand smoke and household pets. Methods: Serum samples from 102 doctor-diagnosed allergic asthma patients and 100 non-atopic controls were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the HDM species Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp), Dermatophagoides farinae (Df), and Blomia tropicalis (Bt) allergens. Point-biserial correlation coefficient, Pearson R correlation, and logistic regression analyses {{were used to determine}} association of HDM-specific IgE levels with the abovementioned variables. Results: Of the 102 cases, 38. 24 %, 47. 06 %, and 33. 33 % were sensitized to Bt, Df, and Dp, respectively. Sensitized patients showed greater probability [Bt (OR = 1. 21), Df (OR = 1. 14), and Dp (OR = 1. 35) ] to manifest symptoms than those who were not. Obtained p-values [Bt (p = 0. 73), Df (p = 0. 83), and Dp (p = 0. 59) ], however, proved that HDM-specific IgE levels had no significant contribution in predicting or explaining occurrence of asthma symptoms. Bt- and Df-specific IgEs showed moderately weak but significant relationship with <b>bambuterol</b> HCl and expectorant, respectively. Patients currently on said medications registered higher HDM-specific IgE levels than those who were not. No significant correlation between IgE levels and family history of allergic disease or with exposure to second-hand smoke was seen. Dp-specific IgE levels of patients exposed to household pets were significantly lower compared to thos...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between ultrasonication and microwave irradiation as tools {{to achieve a}} rapid sample treatment {{for the analysis of}} banned doping substances in human urine by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed. The following variables were studied and optimised: (i) time of treatment, (ii) temperature, (iii) microwave power and (iv) ultrasonic amplitude. The results were evaluated and compared with those achieved by the routine method used in the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accredited Antidoping Laboratory of Rome. Only under the effect of the ultrasonic field was it possible to enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction rate of conjugated compounds. Similar reaction yield to the routine method was achieved after 10 min for most compounds. Under microwave irradiation, denaturation of the enzyme occurs for high microwave power. The use of both ultrasonic or microwave energy to improve the reaction rate of the derivatisation of the target compounds with trimethyliodosilane/methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (TMSI/MSTFA/NH 4 I/ 2 -mercaptoethanol) was also evaluated. To test the use of the two systems in the acceleration of the reaction with TMSI, a pool of 55 banned substances and/or their metabolites were used. After 3 min of ultrasonication, 34 of the 55 compounds had recoveries similar to those obtained with the classic procedure that lasts for 30 min (Student's∈t test, n∈=∈ 5), 18 increased to higher silylation yields, and for the compounds 13 β, 17 α-diethyl- 3 α, 17 β-dihydroxy- 5 α-gonane (norboletone metabolite 1), metoprolol and metipranolol the same results were obtained increasing the ultrasonication time to 5 min. Similar results were obtained after 3 min of microwave irradiation at 1, 200 W. In this case, 30 of the 55 compounds had recoveries similar to the classic procedure (Student's t test, n∈=∈ 5) whilst 18 had higher silylation yields. For the compounds 3 α-hydroxy- 1 α-methyl- 5 α-androstan- 17 -one (mesterolone metabolite 1), 17 α-ethyl- 5 β-estrane- 3 α, 17 β, 21 -triol (norethandrolone metabolite 1), epioxandrolone, 4 -chloro- 6 β, 17 β- dihydroxy- 17 α-methyl- 1, 4 -androstadien- 3 -one (chlormetandienone metabolite 1), carphedon, esmolol and <b>bambuterol</b> the same results were obtained after 5 min under microwave irradiation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
