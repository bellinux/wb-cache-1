5|$|After the Malayan {{conflict}} {{ended in}} 1960, the U.S. considered the British precedent in deciding {{that the use}} of defoliants was a legal tactic of warfare. Secretary of State Dean Rusk advised President John F. Kennedy that the <b>British</b> <b>had</b> established a precedent for warfare with herbicides in Malaya.|$|E
5|$|As {{the night}} wore on, {{reinforcements}} arrived {{from a nearby}} British hill fort which had as yet been ignored by the Pashtun forces. At 4:15pm, the attacking forces withdrew with their dead and wounded. The <b>British</b> <b>had</b> lost {{a large number of}} officers wounded, and recorded 21 deaths amongst the sepoys.|$|E
5|$|Attacking and {{destroying}} the radar chain was also difficult. The stations were indeed vulnerable to dive bombers and low flying aircraft, however the <b>British</b> <b>had</b> mobile units {{which could be}} moved around to cover any gaps. Rapid repair services were also quick. Rarely were radar stations out of action {{for more than a}} few days.|$|E

50|$|Following the 1997 transfer, English {{is still}} {{widely used in}} law and business, {{and it is still}} taught in kindergartens, primary schools, {{secondary}} schools, and universities.

5|$|After the <b>British</b> <b>had</b> withdrawn, the Germans reoccupied {{the battery}} position. Steiner {{was unable to}} see Sword from his command bunker, so {{even though he was}} able to get two of his guns back in action, he was unable to direct {{accurate}} fire onto the landings. However, observers with the 736th Infantry Regiment, holding out at La Brèche, were able to direct his guns until that position was neutralised.|$|E
5|$|As dawn came, {{the army}} {{approached}} a stream called Stony Brook. The road the army took followed Stony Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the Post Road from Trenton to Princeton. However, {{off to the}} right of this road, there was an unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the <b>British</b> <b>had</b> left it undefended.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline (although they had only ruled for a very short duration, may be the reason was they never had {{intellectual}} capabilities and could only defeat Mughals when there was no great king left) The <b>British</b> <b>had</b> been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and Hindu Brahmin Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The <b>British</b> <b>had</b> an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister Trimbak Dengle was suspected of the crime.|$|E

5|$|Both fleets were {{at first}} {{hampered}} by light and changeable winds. When a consistent west wind appeared on 20June, Hughes {{lined up for}} battle and awaited Suffren's action. Lining up in a similar formation, Suffren gave the order to attack, and battle began shortly after four in the afternoon. The action lasted around three hours and resulted in no major damage to ships in either fleet, despite all ships being engaged. The <b>British</b> <b>had</b> 99 men killed and 434 wounded; French casualties amounted to 102 killed and 386 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Bénouville was the {{farthest}} forward {{point of the}} British advance on 6 June 1944. On 9 June, the German Air Force attacked the bridges with 13 aircraft. The <b>British</b> <b>had</b> positioned light and medium-sized anti-aircraft guns around the bridges and {{in the face of}} intense anti-aircraft fire the attack failed, although they did claim one of the bridges was destroyed by a direct hit.|$|E
5|$|Details of the {{forthcoming}} peace treaty arrived late in 1782. The Ohio Country, the land that the British and Indians had successfully defended, had been signed away by Great Britain to the United States. The <b>British</b> <b>had</b> not consulted the Indians in the peace process, and the Indians were nowhere mentioned in the treaty's terms. For the Indians, the struggle with American settlers would resume in the Northwest Indian War, though this time without the assistance of their British allies.|$|E

5|$|Following the attack, the German Ministry of Propaganda checked {{incoming}} {{reports from}} both London and the German Naval High command. Having {{been told by}} Kriegsmarine {{that there was not}} a single U-boat in the vicinity of Athenia on the day of her sinking, the Propaganda Ministry promptly denied all allegations that any German U-boat had sunk Athenia. They claimed instead that the <b>British</b> <b>had</b> torpedoed their own vessel in an attempt to bring the United States into the war on the side of the Allies.|$|E
5|$|For the new attack, Nelson was to {{take three}} ships of the line, three frigates, {{including}} Emerald, and 200 marines, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, a combination of strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and the <b>British</b> <b>had</b> to ask for an honourable withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|He {{was tried}} before Curiohaus war crimes court in Rotherbaum, in Court Number 5 on Monday, 11 October 1948. Knöchlein's defence hinged on {{the claim that}} he was not present at the massacre, {{although}} his lawyers did not deny that the event took place. They also claimed that the <b>British</b> <b>had</b> used dumdum bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce; all of which were vigorously denied by the prosecution. Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognising Knöchlein.|$|E

5|$|On January 21, 1757, Captain Robert Rogers and {{a band of}} his rangers were on a {{scouting}} expedition near Fort Carillon on Lake Champlain {{when they}} were ambushed by a mixed troop of French regulars, Canadien militiamen, and Indians. The fighting ended when darkness set in, with significant casualties on both sides. The French in their reports claimed the <b>British</b> <b>had</b> a distinct advantage due to their snowshoes.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, the French {{attacked}} the British Fusiliers redoubt. The skirmish lasted two hours, {{in which the}} French were repulsed suffering several casualties.

In the American camp, thousands of trees were cut down to provide wood for earthworks. Preparations for the parallel also began.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, the British Harwich Force, {{supported}} by the battlecruisers of Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, broke into the Heligoland Bight and attacked the II Scouting Group patrols. In the confused action, Mainz and Cöln were sunk, by light cruisers and battlecruisers, respectively. The majority of crewmen from Mainz were {{picked up by the}} British ships, but Cöln was lost with only one survivor. Kolberg was stationed in port during the attack, and steamed out to support the beleaguered German forces, but the <b>British</b> <b>had</b> departed by the time she reached the scene.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Albuera {{had little}} effect on the overall course of the war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together.
