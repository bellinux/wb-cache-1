40|$|Silicon carbide {{is a wide}} bandgap {{semiconductor}} that is {{well suited}} for high power, high temperature electronic devices due to its remarkable electronic and thermal properties. Photosensitive devices in the 6 H polytype of Sic have also been demonstrated, showing high sensitivity in ultraviolet wavelengths near 270 nm. Furthermore, the native oxide on Sic is silicon dioxide, meaning that SIC can be thermally oxidized to form a high quality gate dielectric, making metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices possible. These qualities make silicon carbide ideal for constructing UV sensitive CCD imagers. 2 ̆ 7 This work investigates the feasibility for developing imagers in Sic through the fabrication and demonstration of a <b>buried</b> <b>channel</b> CCD linear shift array. Several elements of the MOS field effect family were studied. With careful surface preparation and device processing techniques, SiC/silicondioxide interfaces have been ameliorated to achieve surface state densities below 2 el 1 per-centimeters-squared and electron surface mobilities above 40 centimeters-squared-per-volt-second. <b>Buried</b> <b>channel</b> MOSFETs were fabricated with ion implantation of nitrogen at elevated temperatures and have functioned with electron mobilities in excess of 180 centimeters-squared-pervolt- second, which shows an advantage of using the <b>buried</b> <b>channel</b> structure.

40|$|We {{report on}} a novel method for the {{fabrication}} of three-dimensional buried graphitic micropaths in single crystal diamond with the employment of focused MeV ions. The use of implantation masks with graded thickness at the sub-micrometer scale allows the formation of conductive channels which are embedded in the insulating matrix at controllable depths. In particular, the modulation of the channels depth at their endpoints allows the surface contacting of the channel terminations with no need of further fabrication stages. In the present work we describe the sample masking, which includes the deposition of semi spherical gold contacts on the sample surface, followed by MeV ion implantation. Because of the {{significant difference between the}} densities of pristine and amorphous or graphitized diamond, the formation of <b>buried</b> <b>channels</b> has a relevant mechanical effect on the diamond structure, causing localized surface swelling, which has been measured both with interferometric profilometry and atomic force microscopy.

40|$|The {{formation}} of the current Rhine-Meuse delta has mainly taken place during the Holocene (the last 12, 000 years). This period is characterised by avulsions that lead to sudden shifts in the location of river channels. The channel deposits left behind by abandoned rivers are often distinct sandy layers in the shallow sub-surface, called <b>buried</b> <b>channel</b> deposits. Knowledge of the location of <b>buried</b> <b>channel</b> deposits is interesting from a historical {{point of view and}} is essential for planning, constructing and maintaining structures that intersect these channels. Traditionally, <b>buried</b> <b>channel</b> deposits are traced using labour intensive soil drillings and visual interpretation. However, some <b>buried</b> <b>channel</b> deposits can also be detected by using local elevation differences (1 - 2 m) caused by differential compaction. Automating the detection process and using Digital Elevation Models could result in faster processing and a higher detailed, more objective map. This leads to the following research question: is it possible to automatically derive a detailed map of <b>buried</b> <b>channel</b> deposits from high resolution laser altimetry data? The dataset used for this purpose is a rasterized elevation model measured by the FLI-MAP system with the same specifications as AHN- 2. First, two filtering methods are applied to remove infrastructure and other objects using existing topographical data (GBKN) and terrain characteristics (variability and density). If these objects are not removed they cause errors in the final result. In the detection procedure four structural attributes are calculated using the elevation dataset: slope, curvature, relative elevation (TPI) and smoothed TPI. This is done to use as much of the available information in the detection procedure. With these attributes a multi-band image is formed. Classification is then performed using a Maximum Likelihood classifier were each point is assigned to a predefined class. A majority filter is applied on the result and empty areas are interpolated using a conditional dilation to get a full coverage of the area. Processing speed is increased by downsampling datapatches that are used for computational intensive algorithms. Additional automation of the detection process is performed by developing a method to resolve edge effects on tiled datasets. Validation is performed by comparing the detection result to two independent datasets. A palaeogeographic map is used to make a numerical and visual comparison. An analysis using shallow drilling measurements is performed to determine the depth of the detected sand layers. The results indicate that <b>buried</b> <b>channel</b> deposits (between 4, 620 and 1, 700 years old) can be mapped roughly in a fully automatic way. The probability that these channels are within a certain depth can be calculated. Validation shows that this new method is strongly hampered due to human intervention in the landscape. Further research is recommended to improve the filtering and detection method. Mathematical Geodesy and PositioningAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{fabricating}} channels having widths {{of tens of}} nanometers in silicon substrates and <b>burying</b> the <b>channels</b> under overlying layers of dielectric materials has been demonstrated. With further refinement, the method might be useful for fabricating nanochannels for manipulation and analysis of large biomolecules at single-molecule resolution. Unlike in prior methods, <b>burying</b> the <b>channels</b> does not involve bonding of flat wafers to the silicon substrates to cover exposed channels in the substrates. Instead, the formation and <b>burying</b> of the <b>channels</b> are accomplished in a more sophisticated process that is less vulnerable to defects in the substrates {{and less likely to}} result in clogging of, or leakage from, the channels. In this method, {{the first step is to}} establish the channel pattern by forming an array of sacrificial metal nanowires on an SiO 2 -on-Si substrate. In particular, the wire pattern is made by use of focused-ion-beam (FIB) lithography and a subsequent metallization/lift-off process. The pattern of metal nanowires is then transferred onto the SiO 2 layer by reactive-ion etching, which yields sacrificial SiO 2 nanowires covered by metal. After removal of the metal covering the SiO 2 nanowires, what remains are SiO 2 nanowires on an Si substrate. Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is used to form a layer of a dielectric material over the Si substrate and over the SiO 2 wires on the surface of the substrate. FIB milling is then performed to form trenches at both ends of each SiO 2 wire. The trenches serve as openings for the entry of chemicals that etch SiO 2 much faster than they etch Si. Provided that the nanowires are not so long that the diffusion of the etching chemicals is blocked, the sacrificial SiO 2 nanowires become etched out from between the dielectric material and the Si substrate, leaving <b>buried</b> <b>channels.</b> At the time of reporting the information for this article, channels 3 m long, 20 nm deep, and 80 nm wide (see figure) had been fabricated by this method...|$|R
