40|$|Based on the {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} method, the basic characters of road engineering reinforced with <b>back</b> <b>berm</b> are studied. It is {{found that there}} is no influence on maximal vertical settlement and distribution of vertical settlement in the scope of original embankment by <b>back</b> <b>berm,</b> only the vertical settlement of foundation under <b>back</b> <b>berm</b> enlarged by <b>back</b> <b>berm.</b> The lateral displacement of embankment could be reduced by <b>back</b> <b>berm,</b> which reduced further by width of <b>back</b> <b>berm</b> enlarged. The stability of embankment increased rapidly with the width of <b>back</b> <b>berm</b> enlarged. But when the width of <b>back</b> <b>berm</b> reach a critical value, the stability of embankment is no more increased with the width of <b>back</b> <b>berm</b> enlarged. In order to utilize land effectively, the width of <b>back</b> <b>berm</b> should not be bigger than the critical value. The critical value of width of <b>back</b> <b>berm</b> could be calculated with the corresponding parameters of road engineering. There is almost no influence on stability of embankment by gravity of <b>back</b> <b>berm.</b> It is suggested to fill the <b>back</b> <b>berm</b> by the soil with big cohesive strength and big internal friction angle...|$|E

40|$|The {{immobilization}} {{potential of}} Sb(III) and Sb(V) by freshly crushed steel slag fines (SSF) media was evaluated. The SSF media was characterized as USCS SP type soil with < 5 % passing the No. 200 (0. 075 mm) sieve. Despite its granular nature, the mineralogy and residual lime content make the SSF media quite reactive {{and there is}} interest in potentially using SSF media in firing range <b>back</b> stop <b>berms.</b> Accordingly, the SSF media was individually spiked Sb(III) and Sb(V) solutions having target doses equivalent to 100 mg/kg to 10, 000 mg/kg to gauge {{the ability of the}} SSF media to immobilize antimony, an alloy used in munitions. After 30 days of mellowing, all samples were air-dried and tested for pH, total metal concentrations, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) leaching performance.

40|$|Processes of {{founding}} {{and expanding}} cities in coastal areas have undergone great {{changes over time}} driven by environmental conditions. Coastal settlements looked for places above flood levels and away from swamps and other wetlands whenever possible. As populations grew, cities were extending trying to avoid low and wet lands. No city {{has been able to}} limit its growth. The risk of flooding can never be eliminated, but only reduced to the extent possible. Flooding of coastal areas is today dramatically attributed to eustasic sea level rise caused by global climate change. This can be inaccurate. Current climate change is generating an average sea level upward trend, but other regional and local factors result in this trend being accentuated in some places or attenuated, and even reversed, in others. Then, the intensity and frequency of coastal flooding around the planet, although {{not so much as a}} unique result of this general eustasic elevation, but rather of the superposition of marine and crustal dynamic elements, the former also climate-related, which give rise to a temporary raising in average sea level in the short term. Since the Little Ice Age the planet has been suffering a global warming change leading to sea level rise. The idea of being too obeying to anthropogenic factors may be attributed to Arrhenius (1896), though it is of much later highlight after the sixties of the last century. Never before, the human factor had been able of such an influence on climate. However, other types of changes in sea levels became apparent, resulting from vertical movements of the crust, modifications of sea basins due to continents fracturing, drifting and coming together, or to different types of climate patterns. Coastal zones are then doubly susceptible to floods. Precipitation immediately triggers pluvial flooding. If it continues upland or when snow and glaciers melt eventually fluvial flooding can occur. The urban development presence represents modifying factors. Additional interference is caused by river and waste water drainage systems. Climate also influences sea levels in coastal areas, where tides as well as the structure and dynamic of the geoid and its crust come into play. From the sea, waters can flood and break or push <b>back</b> <b>berms</b> and other coastline borders. The sea level, controlling the mouth of the main channel of the basin's drainage system, is ultimately what governs flood levels. A temporary rise in sea level acts as a dam at the mouth. Even in absence of that global change, so, floods are likely going to increase in many urban coastal areas. Some kind of innovative methodologies and practices should be needed to get more flood resilience citie...|$|R

50|$|Atrium designs have an {{increased}} risk of flooding, so the surrounding land should slope away from the structure on all sides. A drain pipe at the perimeter of the roof edge can help collect and remove additional water. For bermed homes, an interceptor drain at the crest of the berm {{along the edge of the}} roof top is recommended. An interceptor drainage swale in the middle of the berm is also helpful or the <b>back</b> of the <b>berm</b> can be terraced with retaining walls. On sloping sites runoff may cause problems. A drainage swale or gully can be built to divert water around the house, or a gravel filled trench with a drain tile can be installed along with footing drains.|$|R

5000|$|Before a {{skirmish}} line {{could be}} formed, an M163 Vulcan {{was destroyed by}} a 100 mm round. The gunner, Sergeant Jimmy D. Haws, died instantly. A Bradley IFV spraying 25 mm fire on Iraqi trenches was also hit; Sergeant Ronald Randazzo the BFV Gunner was killed and two other men were wounded as result. Another Bradley, commanded by Staff Sergeant Christopher Cichon, came forward to evacuate these casualties. While Sergeant Cichon and the soldiers from his Bradley were rescuing wounded personnel from the first Bradley, Sergeant Cichon's Bradley was struck in the turret by a round which shattered its TOW launcher. Private First Class Ardon Cooper covered the wounded man he was assisting with his own body and received several shrapnel injuries, and died later from heavy loss of blood. He was posthumously awarded the Silver Star. Sergeant Cichon's Bradley was still operational, and after picking up the wounded, its crew managed to withdraw it from the line of fire. Staff Sergeant Cichon was awarded the Silver Star for his exceptional leadership and courage while under enemy fire. [...] Specialist Adkins of Charlie Company was moved forward with the battalions medical officer {{in an attempt to}} reach Bradley Gunner Sergeant Randazzo but Specialist Phillip Adkins received a hit to his Humvee which caused him to withdraw with an Abrams tank shielding his withdraw. The battle raged for about an hour; after pounding the Iraqi positions with heavy artillery and A-10 air strikes, 1-5 fell <b>back</b> to the <b>berm.</b> During the pull-out, an Abrams tank hit a mine and was heavily damaged. The Iraqi defenders lost five tanks and 20 artillery pieces. American casualties amounted to three dead and nine wounded. The wisdom of a full-daylight operation was the subject of some criticism, but the Iraqi army remained convinced that the Coalition invasion would take place from the south.|$|R
