40|$|The first-order phase {{transition}} of O(3) symmetric models is {{considered in the}} limit of high temperature. It is shown that this model supports a new <b>bubble</b> <b>solution</b> where the global monopole is formed {{at the center of the}} bubble in addition to the ordinary O(3) bubble. Though the free energy of it is larger than that of normal bubble, the production rate can considerably be large at high temperatures. Since a general theory of the decay of the metastable phase was developed [1, 2], the study of first-order {{phase transition}}s have attracted the attention due to their possible relevance to the physics of the early universe. The semiclassical expression of the tunneling rate from false vacuum to true vacuum is given by the <b>bubble</b> <b>solution</b> of lowest (Euclidean) action both for the first-order phase transitions at zero temperature field theories [2] and those at finite temperature [3, 4]. However, the above case does not include the possibility that there exist various decay modes between two given classical vacua.

40|$|We study a non-Abelian Chern-Simons {{system in}} R^ 2, {{including}} the simple Lie algebras A_ 2 and B_ 2. In a previous work, we proved {{the existence of}} radial non-topological solutions with prescribed asymptotic behaviors via the degree theory. We also constructed a sequence of <b>bubbling</b> <b>solutions</b> with only one component blowing up partially at infinity. In this paper, we construct a sequence of radial non-topological <b>bubbling</b> <b>solutions</b> of another type via the shooting argument.

This improves upon a previous result where {{only two of the}} three fluxes were topologically non-trivial.
