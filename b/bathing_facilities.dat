The Satawalese people also raised chicken and pork and caught fish, their {{primary source of}} protein. A freshwater pond served as <b>bathing</b> <b>facilities.</b> Local materials were used to construct outrigger canoes called proa. The island's isolation helped preserve the lifestyle of the Satawalese people and Mau's role as a navigator. Even {{with the arrival of}} the Germans (1890) and the Japanese (1914) in Micronesia, Satawalese culture remained intact. American missionaries who arrived after World War II built the first church and school on Satawal.|$|E

25|$|The {{conditions}} affecting {{homeless people}} are somewhat specialized and have {{opened a new}} area of medicine tailored to this population.

The stone arches of this public bath have been incorporated into the shop at Living Coasts. Development of the site as a marine animal exhibit was first proposed in early 1999 in response to a call from Torbay Council for submissions from interested parties. The project, developed by Kay Elliott architects, included an exhibit to house marine birds, rather than fish, due to the need to avoid duplicating the exhibits at the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth. The project was subsequently taken on by Paignton Zoo Environmental Park and named Living Coasts.|$|E
