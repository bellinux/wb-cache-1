5|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that a well publicized debate over which daughter, Maria (according to Russian experts) or Anastasia (according to US experts), has been {{recovered from the}} second grave cannot <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> based upon the DNA results reported here. In {{the absence of a}} DNA reference from each sister, we can only conclusively identify Alexei – the only son of Nicholas and Alexandra.|$|E
5|$|Significantly, {{the treaty}} {{did not mention}} or {{institute}} any social reforms that Madero had vaguely promised on previous occasions. It also left the Porfirian state essentially intact. Additionally, Madero supported the unpopular idea that all land disputes were to <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> through the courts, staffed by the old judges, a decision that led to outbreaks of sporadic violence, particularly in rural areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlement}} of Madagascar {{is a subject}} of ongoing research and debate. Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000BC. Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between 350BC and 550AD, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250AD. In either case, these dates make Madagascar {{one of the last}} major landmasses on Earth to <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> by humans.|$|E
5|$|When Jenijoy La Belle, who {{had been}} hired in 1969 but refused tenure in 1974, filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Christy pressed for the case to <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> and La Belle to be given tenure. The EEOC ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding {{that she had been}} paid less than male colleagues. La Belle {{received}} tenure in 1979.|$|E
5|$|As {{the river}} {{frontage}} areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by planters {{who developed the}} cotton plantation economy {{with the use of}} slave labor, Mobile's population exploded. It came to <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.|$|E

5|$|Atlético de Kolkata {{qualified}} for the play-offs after they drew Goa at the Salt Lake Stadium 1–1 on 10 December 2014. Edgar Marcelino scored first to give Goa the lead before Fikru scored the equalizer for Kolkata. In the semi-finals, Atlético de Kolkata once again took on Goa. The first leg at the Salt Lake Stadium ended in a 0–0 draw. The second leg at the Fatorda Stadium also ended 0–0 and after the tie could not <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> in extra-time that meant the game went into penalty-kicks. Atlético de Kolkata won the shoot-out 4–2 after André Santos and Zohib Islam Amiri missed their penalties for Goa and Kolkata converted all four of theirs.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis that}} the personal injury claim had had to <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
5|$|Maroon: The university's {{official}} color {{used to be}} magenta, {{one which}} was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school could lay claim to magenta was to <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> {{through a series of}} baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to maroon. Maroon was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.|$|E

Diallo's attorney, Kenneth Thompson, described Diallo as a strong and courageous woman who had never lost faith in the American system of justice. Previous news reports emanating from Le Monde that Strauss-Kahn <b>was</b> <b>settling</b> for $6 million were denied by both parties.|$|R
5|$|Sabah {{has seen}} several {{territorial}} disputes with Malaysia's neighbours Indonesia and the Philippines. In 2002, both Malaysia and Indonesia submitted to arbitration by the ICJ on a territorial {{dispute over the}} Ligitan and Sipadan islands which were later won by Malaysia. There are also several other disputes yet to <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> with Indonesia over the overlapping claims on the Ambalat continental shelf in the Celebes Sea and land border dispute between Sabah and North Kalimantan. Malaysia's claim over {{a portion of the}} Spratly Islands is also based on sharing a continental shelf with Sabah.|$|E
5|$|The Tribune {{believed}} the situation would <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> quickly and was {{confident enough to}} begin developing a Dick Tracy live action television series with Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Robert Newmyer and Outlaw Productions. The TV show {{was to have a}} contemporary setting, comparable to Smallville, and Di Bonaventura commented that if the TV show was successful, a feature film would likely follow. However, an August 2005 ruling by federal judge Dean D. Pregerson cleared the way for Beatty to sue the Tribune. The April 2006 hearing ended without a ruling, but in July 2006, a Los Angeles judge ruled that the case can go to trial; Tribune's request to end the suit in their favor was rejected. The legal battle between Beatty and the Tribune continued to ensue.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the First World War left many issues to <b>be</b> <b>settled,</b> including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early interwar period, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered {{in its early years}} included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.|$|E

5|$|Two of {{the matches}} at SummerSlam 1993 were {{a result of}} Razor Ramon's loss to The Kid (later the 1-2-3 Kid) on the May 17, 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw. Following Ramon's loss to the newcomer, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) teased Ramon about the match. DiBiase offered Ramon {{a job as a}} servant, which Ramon angrily refused. Ramon began teaming with the 1-2-3 Kid for a series of matches against Money Inc. DiBiase asked for a singles match against the Kid, and the Kid {{accepted}} the challenge. Ramon helped the Kid win the match by distracting DiBiase. It was decided that the feuds would <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> in two singles matches at SummerSlam, with Ramon facing DiBiase and Schyster facing the 1-2-3 Kid.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler {{took control}} in Germany in 1933, Borah thought {{well of the}} new chancellor's {{repudiation}} of the war guilt and other clauses of the Versailles treaty, and saw much of value in his new social and economic programs. But he was utterly disgusted and alienated by the Nazi treatment of the Jews. This did not initially lead him {{to speak out against}} Nazi Germany, though many urged him to do so, as he felt that each nation had the right to run its own affairs. Borah opposed large-scale immigration by Jews from Germany, feeling that was impractical with millions of Americans unemployed. By 1938, Borah was speaking out against the continued persecutions, but still felt that the European issue could <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> if Germany's former colonies were returned. After the Munich Conference in September 1938, Borah issued a statement far more critical of Britain and France for deceiving Czechoslovakia into dismemberment, than of Germany for her aggression.|$|E
5|$|Aiming {{to reduce}} {{evidence}} of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse the refugees {{in various parts}} of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade. The government encouraged the refugees to settle in predominantly Hungarian areas of Vojvodina, and in Kosovo, which was largely populated by Albanians, leading to increased instability in those regions. Even though 20,000 were planned to <b>be</b> <b>settled</b> in Kosovo, only 4,000 moved to the region. After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of the refugees who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants. They were turned over to the VRS or the ARSK in eastern Croatia for conscription. Some of the conscripts were publicly humiliated and beaten for abandoning the RSK. In some areas, ethnic Croats of Vojvodina were evicted from their homes by the refugees themselves to claim new accommodations. Similarly, the refugees moving through Banja Luka forced Croats and Bosniaks out of their homes.|$|E
50|$|The area <b>was</b> <b>settled</b> by Turkmen from 1068 onwards and {{particularly}} following {{the battle of}} nearby Bolvadin, between the Byzantines and the Seljuk Turks.

50|$|Pomerania <b>was</b> <b>settled</b> {{from two}} directions.

The origins of the Usedom settlers resemble this pattern: Most came from Mecklenburg, the Hanover region and Brandenburg, the others came from Westphalia, Holstein, Friesland, Rhineland, and even Prussia and Poland.|$|R
