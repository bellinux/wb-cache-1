So, a reduction on plant scale and capital cost could change innovation and competitive dynamics. This point illustrates how the biobased industry, in its structuring process, allows new concepts in very consolidated issues, such as scale economy in the chemical industry.|$|E

For instance, various molecules like hormones, lipids, peptides and neurotransmitters exert their biological effects by binding to these seven-transmembrane receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-pro-teins, which are highly specialized transducers able to modulate diverse signaling pathways. Furthermore, numerous responses medi-ated by GPCRs are not dependent on a single <b>biochemical</b> <b>route,</b> but result from the integration of an intricate network of transduction cascades involved in many physiological activities and tumor development. This review highlights the emerging information on the various responses mediated by a selected choice of GPCRs and the molecular mechanisms by which these receptors exert a primary action in cancer progression.

Furthermore, we identify a phylogenetically conserved AP- 1 -responsive element in the promoter of the c-myc proto-oncogene that recruits in vivo the c-Jun and JunD AP- 1 family members and controls the PDGF-dependent transactivation of the c-myc promoter. These findings suggest the existence of a novel <b>biochemical</b> <b>route</b> linking tyrosine kinase receptors, such as those for PDGF, and c-myc expression through JNK activation of AP- 1 transcription factors.

40|$|Tumor {{progression}} requires cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and {{attraction of}} blood and lymph vessels. These processes are tightly regulated by growth factors and their intracellular signaling pathways, which culminate in transcriptional programs. Hence, oncogenic mutations often capture growth factor signaling, and drugs able to intercept the underlying <b>biochemical</b> <b>routes</b> might retard cancer spread. Along with messenger RNAs, microRNAs play regulatory roles in growth factor signaling and in tumor progression. Because growth factors regulate abundance of certain microRNAs and the latter modulate the abundance of proteins necessary for growth factor signaling, the two classes of molecules form a dense web of interactions, which are dominated by a few recurring modules. We review specific examples of the alliance formed by growth factors and microRNAs and refer primarily to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway. Clinical applications of the crosstalk between microRNAs and growth factors are described, including relevance to cancer therapy and to emergence of resistance to specific drugs...|$|E
40|$|New {{evidence}} suggests that physiological and damaging agents activate two different pathways of apoptotic signalling, which are mediated by protein-protein interactions and mitochondrial alterations respectively. The two pathways converge at the activation of caspase 3, the key effector of the execution phase of apoptosis, thus giving similar final results. The knowledge that different <b>biochemical</b> <b>routes</b> exist allows us to re-evaluate previous apparently contradictory results concerning the events occurring during apoptosis, and their respective roles. In particular, this applies {{to the role of}} oxidative stress and redox imbalance in the signal transduction events of apoptosis. It now appears that oxidative alterations are absent, or at least unnecessary, {{for the development of the}} physiological pathway. Instead, clear indications are emerging showing that redox imbalance is required for the damage-induced mitochondrial pathway. This is suggested by the finding that the depletion of glutathione, a common event in damage-induced apoptosis, is necessary and sufficient to induce cytochrome c release, the key event of this pathway. A model is proposed with GSH efflux as the backbone of the damage-induced apoptotic pathway...|$|E

The biomass conversion using bioprocess has great potential to be applied in Brazil due to its large agroindustry which can produce a variety of feedstocks and byproducts that can be converted into biofuels and chemicals. The production of first-generation ethanol using sugarcane is a conventional technology in Brazil. This ethanol is the most competitive in the world, and Brazilian production reached 23.64 billion L in 2012 / 2013 season. Sugarcane bagasse generated from ethanol production and other biomasses obtained from forest and wood industries, crop residues, and grasses can be deconstructed to obtain sugars.

30|$|The present world, {{with all}} its advancement, is not a {{sustainable}} world, simply because {{it is based on}} non-renewable raw materials (non-RRMs). Sustainable world is best expressed in terms of sustainable development and non-RRMs must be replaced by sustainable materials. The sustainable materials needed by modern society are very wide and the main pillars are biofuels and bioproducts. Both pillars are best related through integrated biorefineries (IBRs) formed of related concepts which are very important for the economic development and sustainability of all countries on our planet. Integrated biorefineries include the production of biofuels and bioproducts and utilizing novel technologies.

40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} and <b>biochemical</b> <b>route</b> to {{the synthesis of}} the 21 st amino acid in living systems, selenocysteine, is described. The incorporation of this rare amino acid residue into proteins is described with emphasis {{on the role of}} monoselenophosphate as selenium source. The role of selenocysteine moiety in natural mammalian enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), iodothyronine deiodinase (ID) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is highlighted and the effect of other amino acid residues located in close proximity to selenocysteine is described. It is evident from various studies that two amino acid residues, tryptophan and glutamine, appear in identical positions in all known members of the GPx family. Ac-cording to the three-dimensional structure established for bovine GPx, these residues could constitute a catalytic triad in which the selenol group of the selenocysteine is both stabilized and activated by hydro-gen bonding with the imino group of the tryptophan (Trp) residue and with the amido group of the gluta-mine (Gln) residue. The ID enzymes, on the other hand, do not possess any Trp or Gln residues in close proximity to selenium, but contain several histidine residues, which may play important roles in the ca-talysis. The TrxR enzymes also possess some basic histidines, but the most important amino acid residues are the cysteines which constitute the internal cofactor systems along with the catalytically active seleno-cysteine. The catalytic activity and substrate specificity of all three selenoenzymes are described. The re-activity of selenocysteine residues in selenoenzymes towards metal-base drugs such as goldthioglucose is also described...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} biochemical platform featuring {{enzymatic hydrolysis}} involves five key steps: pretreatment, cellulase production, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, and product recovery.

Pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and cellulase production is consolidated into one single step, {{referred to as}} consolidated aerobic processing, and sugar aldonates are produced as the reactive intermediates for biofuels production by fermentation. In this study, we demonstrate the viability of consolidation of the enzymatic hydrolysis and cellulase production steps in the new route using Neurospora crassa as the model microorganism and the conversion of cellulose to ethanol as the model system. We intended to prove the two hypotheses: 1) cellulose can be directed to produce cellobionate by reducing β-glucosidase production and by enhancing cellobiose dehydrogenase production; and 2) both of the two hydrolysis products of cellobionate [...] glucose and gluconate [...] {{can be used as}} carbon sources for ethanol and other chemical production. Our results showed that knocking out multiple copies of β-glucosidase genes led to cellobionate production from cellulose, without jeopardizing the cellulose hydrolysis rate. Simulating cellobiose dehydrogenase over-expression by addition of exogenous cellobiose dehydrogenase led to more cellobionate production. Both of the two hydrolysis products of cellobionate: glucose and gluconate can be used by Escherichia coli KO 11 for efficient ethanol production. They were utilized simultaneously in glucose and gluconate co-fermentation. Gluconate was used even faster than glucose.

At the same time, the availability of highly efficient probes and imaging systems has allowed cell biologists to obtain a deep insight into how extracellular signals are conveyed and translated in living cells. An example of this insight has been the demonstration that a variety of extracellular stimuli cause a rise in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration of high spatio-temporal complexity, that in turn is specifically decoded by intracellular effectors.

Although the saccharification yield was at a comparable level for both SE and OS at the lower enzyme dosage (20  mg of enzyme preparation/gsolids) for birch, significant differences could be observed at 80  mg of enzyme preparation/gsolids (69 % for SE vs. 93 % with OS) as seen in Fig.  3 a and b. In the case of spruce, the differences were less prominent. However, due to the differences in cellulose content between OS- and SE-pretreated woody biomass, the yield of glucose was higher following OS than SE (0.74 vs. 0.53, and 0.37 vs. 0.24 gglucose/gsolids, with 150  mg enzyme preparation/gsolids for birch and spruce, respectively). Thus, more glucose can be released per gram of OS-pretreated birch biomass upon hydrolysis. For example, with 20 wt% of OS-pretreated birch, the amount of glucose released would be ~[*] 150  g/L (compared to ~[*] 106  g/L with SE). Upon fermentation by yeast, this would give a theoretical ethanol yield of ~[*] 77  g/L (54  g/L with SE), demonstrating the potential for OS pretreatment over SE.

We show that mitogenic signal transduction pathways from three classes of receptors, the membrane tyrosine kinase receptors activated by serum mitogens or epidermal growth factor, estrogen receptors triggered by estradiol, and the cyclic AMP-dependent signalling from G-protein-coupled thyrotropin receptors, all converge and strictly require the cyclin D-cdk activity to induce S phase in human MCF- 7 cells and/or primary dog thyrocytes. Combined microinjection and biochemical approaches showed that whereas these three mitogenic cascades are sensitive to the p 16 inhibitor of cdk 4 / 6 and/or cyclin D 1 -neutralizing antibody and able to induce pRb kinase activity, their upstream <b>biochemical</b> <b>routes</b> are distinct as demonstrated by their differential sensitivity to lovastatin and requirements for mitogen-activated protein kinases whose sustained activation is seen only in the growth factor-dependent pathway. Taken together, these results support the candidacy of the cyclin D-cdk-pRb interplay for the convergence step of multiple signalling cascades and a mechanism contributing t...|$|E

Salisb. ethanolic extract) and diabetic conventional treated (treated with Glibenclamide). Diabetes was induced by administering streptozotocin (60  mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneal (i.p). The ethanolic extract was supplemented in different doses through oral <b>route.</b> <b>Biochemical</b> investigations were carried out according to previously reported methods.

30|$|Bioethanol {{referred}} to as 1 st generation (1 G) ethanol is produced from food-grade material that often contains easily accessible sugars, such as sucrose from sugarcane, or starch from corn or wheat kernels. In order not to compete with food production, biofuels {{can be made from}} lignocellulosic residues such as agricultural residues and other lignocellulosic feedstock. Bioethanol produced from lignocellulosic material is often {{referred to}} as 2 nd generation (2 G) bioethanol, and in this case, the fermentable sugars are extracted from cellulose-containing materials. To date, only one commercial-scale facility is producing bioethanol from cellulose via the <b>biochemical</b> <b>route.</b> The plant, which is located in Crescentino, Italy, was constructed by Beta Renewables, and was opened at the beginning of October 2013 [6],[7]. Some other commercial-scale facilities that are currently under construction, or planned for the near future are: the DuPont Biofuels Solutions’ plant in NV, USA utilizing corn stover [8], Poet-DSM Advanced Biofuels’ plant in Emmetsburg, IA, USA using corn cobs [9], Abengoa Bioenergy’s plant in Hugoton, KS, USA using unspecified biomass [10], Project Alpha by Beta Renewables in Clinton, NC, USA using energy grass [11], Canergy’s plant in The Imperial Valley of California, USA utilizing energy cane and straw [12], and the Iogen Corporation plant in s’o Paulo, Brazil using bagasse and straw [13]. To facilitate the introduction of and transition to 2 G bioethanol, various strategies for the integration of 1 G and 2 G ethanol plants can be considered. Integration can help to reduce the cost of downstream processing in the 2 G plant while the technology matures, and at the same time provide primary energy to the 1 G plant. Wheat is an abundant crop in Europe today, which generates a large amount of straw. Bioethanol production from wheat kernels and wheat straw is thus of considerable interest.|$|R
40|$|Emission fluxes for a {{range of}} C 8 –C 15 {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) were determined from the seaweed Fucus spiralis (spiral wrack) and an adjacent sand surface during low tide on the coastline of Mace Head, Ireland. These two surface types, assessed using dynamic flux chamber systems, are typical of the Mace Head inter-tidal zone. A range of n-alkanes and oxygenates were routinely identified in the measurement of chamber air. Examination of the odd/even n-alkane ratios and use of the carbon preference index (CPI) suggested a biogenic source for these compounds (CPIs > 2 in for all samples). Fluxes of n-pentadecane, the most predominant n-alkane, ranged from 0. 2 to 5. 1 μg m− 2 h− 1 (0. 9 – 24 nmol m− 2 h− 1), while oxygenates such as nonanal and decanal had fluxes ranging from < 0. 1 to 4. 4 μg m− 2 h− 1 (< 0. 1 – 31 nmol m− 2 h− 1) and < 0. 1 to 4. 6 μg m− 2 h− 1 (< 0. 1 – 30 nmol m− 2 h− 1), respectively. Seaweed emission rates for n-pentadecane were correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (rs= 0. 94) while emissions from sand showed correlation with temperature (rs= 0. 85). This suggests a possible <b>biochemical</b> <b>route</b> controlling the release of n-pentadecane from spiral wrack, and temperature-driven volatilisation from sand. Volatilisation from residual seawater trapped in the sand may explain the comparable flux of both n-alkanes and oxygenates from this surface. Unlike the n-alkanes, oxygenate fluxes from sand correlate with PAR, suggesting a photodependent production from organic carbon residues present in seawater. Comparison with previous flux estimates from coastal seawater indicates that the two source types (Fucus spiralis and bare sand) are significant but not dominant sources of these VOCs...|$|R
