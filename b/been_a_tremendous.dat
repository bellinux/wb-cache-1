25|$|The sectors which {{experienced}} {{the most severe}} declines in output were manufacturing, construction, and railroads. The railroads had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> engine {{of growth in the}} years before the crisis, yielding a 50% increase in railroad mileage from 1867 to 1873. After absorbing as much as 20% of US capital investment in the years preceding the crash, this expansion came to a dramatic end in 1873; between 1873 and 1878, the total amount of railroad mileage in the United States barely increased at all.|$|E
25|$|For {{the fifth}} {{edition of the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> amount of debate around whether the sexual and gender identity, which {{includes}} the GID, qualifies as a mental disorder. One of the most notable discussions for this occurred in 2003 during the annual APA meeting, where Darryl B. Hill, Ph.D., argued that the GID {{should not be considered}} a mental disorder. He explains that due to the limited amount of reliable and valid evidence, given the role of parents and therapies, for whether GID meets the conditions as a mental disorder among children and adolescents. Furthermore, other researchers have stated that the diagnosis does not give recognition to the individual’s discomfort with their biological sex which is completely detached from their gender assignment. This leaves patients susceptible to social changes for what acceptably feminine or masculine. Lastly, it does not provide evidence for nonconformity to traditional gender behaviours which varies between cultures, life stages, genders, and ethnic groups.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} season, Henry continued featuring predominantly at full-back, but {{appeared to}} {{have a much more}} attacking role in the side. He scored his third ever goal for Stevenage in a 2–0 win over Eastbourne Borough in September 2009, lashing the ball high into the net after good work on the overlap. The season proved to be a successful one for Henry, playing 48 times in total, scoring once – as Stevenage won promotion to the Football League {{for the first time in}} the club's history. At the end of the season, Henry signed a new two–year contract with the Hertfordshire club. At the Football Conference's Annual Presentation Dinner, he was named in the Conference Premier Team of the Year, alongside fellow Stevenage defenders Scott Laird and Mark Roberts. Henry made his 250th appearance in all competitions for Stevenage during the club's 0–0 draw at home to Torquay United, Stevenage's first clean sheet of the 2010–11 season. Manager Graham Westley said [...] "he's a stalwart. He's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> servant for the club over the years. He's helped the club from where it was all the way in to the Football League". Henry played a total of 51 games during the club's first ever season in the Football League, a season that witnessed Stevenage earn promotion to League One via the 2010–11 League Two play-offs. He was almost ever present at right-back during the campaign, playing a key role in the club having the best defensive record in the division.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} genre elements, Damon Lindelof has stated that, [...] "We sort of suckered people into this show [...] not {{presenting}} it {{as a science}} fiction show {{right out of the}} gate … Lost has really been about the long con, because {{by the time we get}} to season 6, it's going to be...crazy!"s Past and Future]", IGN. [...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox. [...] Paradox creates issues." [...] Actor Terry O'Quinn has divulged that [...] "it is revealed who Locke actually is. [...] Although that's still kind of a mystery of who is that. [...] But there's still a pretty big revelation there." ...|$|E
