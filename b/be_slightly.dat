5|$|In July 2015, {{after nearly}} {{ten years of}} Eris being {{considered}} the ninth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun, close-up imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> larger than Eris's, rather than slightly smaller as previously thought. Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun by volume, though not by mass.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club(AKC) and the Labrador's breed club {{have set}} the breed {{standard}} to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat. For instance, the AKC withers-height standards allow conformation dogs to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> taller than the equivalent British standard. However, dual champions, or dogs that excel in both {{the field and the}} show ring, are becoming more unusual.|$|E

5|$|The Phoenix lander {{returned}} data showing Martian soil to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> alkaline and containing {{elements such}} as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine. These nutrients are found in soils on Earth, and they are necessary for growth of plants. Experiments performed by the lander showed that the Martian soil has a basic pH of 7.7, and contains 0.6% of the salt perchlorate.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Terrier {{typically}} has a hard, wiry outer {{coat with}} a soft, dense undercoat. The coat should be trimmed and blended into the furnishings {{to give a}} distinct Scottish Terrier outline. The longer coat on the beard, legs and lower body may <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> softer than the body coat but should not be or appear fluffy.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{appearance}} of The Next Generation era Starfleet dress uniforms. They were based on those used by the Royal Navy in the 18th century but would <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> altered when they re-appeared during season two. One piece of a costume introduced in this episode which never returned was the surgical cap and eyepiece worn by Doctor Crusher.|$|E

5|$|A 2013 {{study found}} the {{electrical}} conductivity of Hull Creek {{to range from}} 179.50 to 679.00 micro-Siemens per centimeter, {{with an average of}} 283.45 micro-Siemens per centimeter. Only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range. The creek was found to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> alkaline, with a pH ranging from 6.82 to 8.07. The average pH of the creek was 7.60 and only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range. The concentration of total dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 490.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 167.81 milligrams per liter. Only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Rossi {{became the}} first American to drive in the United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas, {{returning}} to Manor Marussia after Roberto Merhi had raced for them in Russia. The Sauber team celebrated their 400th Grand Prix in Formula One. The weather was forecast to be wet all weekend, with especially treacherous conditions on Friday afternoon and Saturday, while the race day itself was expected to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> less wet.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{has long}} been {{suspected}} to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than both Rigel and Vega, which are also slightly variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, {{but it is still}} only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.|$|E
5000|$|Second position: {{arms are}} out to the sides, angled down and forward, with palms facing forward. Elbows <b>are</b> <b>slightly</b> lower than the shoulders, and wrists <b>are</b> <b>slightly</b> lower than the elbow.|$|R

50|$|The head appears round, but <b>is</b> <b>{{slightly}}</b> {{longer than}} broad. The nose <b>is</b> <b>slightly</b> concave curved when viewed in profile. The whisker pads are clearly pronounced, {{with a slight}} pinch. The chin is very firm. The eyes <b>are</b> <b>slightly</b> oval, large and slightly slanted. The cat may have any normal cat eye color. There is no relation between the eye and coat colors. Usually Arabian Maus have bright green eyes. The ears <b>are</b> large, <b>slightly</b> forward and sideward-placed, high-set on the skull.|$|R
5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet {{as a whole is}} thought to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the areas}} {{affected}} are exposed skin not usually protected by clothing; however {{it can also}} occur in areas covered by clothing. Areas constantly subjected to the sun's rays may only <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> affected if at all. People with extreme cases will also have reactions to light bulbs that emit a UV wavelength (any bulb {{that is not an}} LED). Parts of the body only thinly covered can also potentially be subjected to an outbreak.|$|E

5|$|Hugh Casey {{was educated}} at Manual Training High School from 1910 to 1914, graduating {{at the age}} of 15. He won a New York State {{scholarship}} and entered Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, where he studied civil engineering. After a year there, he took a competitive examination for the U.S. Military Academy at West Point held by Congressman Daniel J. Griffin, the chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs, ranking first out of 62 applicants for the appointment. To enter, Casey claimed to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> older, adopting his brother's 7 June birthday.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{began the}} 2008 {{season as the}} third starter in the Yankees' rotation. In his first six starts, he had an 0–4 record and a 9.00 ERA. On April 30, he {{was placed on the}} {{disabled}} list with a strained oblique and cracked rib. On a May 2 visit to an optometrist, Hughes was found to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> nearsighted; as a result, he started wearing glasses on the mound.|$|E
5|$|In the gas phase, and at {{very low}} {{temperatures}} in the condensed phase, the alkali metals form covalently bonded diatomic molecules. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Li2 to Cs2, but then decrease after that to Uue2, due to the aforementioned relativistic effects that stabilize the 8s orbital. The opposite trend is shown for the metal–metal bond-dissociation energies. The Uue–Uue bond should <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> stronger than the K–K bond. From these M2 dissociation energies, the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) of ununennium is predicted to be 94kJ·mol−1 (the value for francium should be around 77kJ·mol−1).|$|E
30|$|When using GA, the Combined {{strategy}} {{is better for}} the system AJHotDraw. And Incremental+ strategy <b>is</b> <b>slightly</b> better for the system AJHSQLDB. Regarding MSBA, for the algorithms NSGA-II, Incremental+ {{strategy is}} better for the system AJHotDraw and Combined strategy is better for the system AJHSQLDB. For PAES, Incremental+ <b>is</b> <b>slightly</b> better than Combined for AJHSQLDB and finally, for SPEA 2, the Incremental+ strategy <b>is</b> <b>slightly</b> better for AJHotDraw.|$|R

50|$|Hydrazine {{may also}} be mixed with monomethyl {{hydrazine}} (MMH). Because MMH <b>is</b> <b>slightly</b> denser, net performance <b>is</b> increased <b>slightly.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the holotype specimen, a female, {{the head}} and body length was 310mm (12.2in), the tail length was 210mm (8.3in), the {{hindfoot}} length was 66.8mm (2.63in), the ear length was 17.5mm (0.69in), and the body mass was 675g (24oz). In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, {{the head and}} body length was about 330mm (13in), the tail length was about 175mm (6.9in), and the body mass was 600g (21oz). Based on these limited data, S.durrelli may <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, {{due in part to}} the weather station being farther from the moderating influence of the lake and also because of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.|$|E
5|$|The G {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1933 Naval Construction Programme, the H class {{following}} in 1934. These ships were based on the preceding F class, but the elimination of cruising turbines and the development of more compact machinery allowed their dimensions and displacement to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> reduced. The H class were repeats of the G's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
50|$|On German and Scandinavian railways, {{the left}} buffer is flatter than the right one, which <b>is</b> <b>slightly</b> more rounded. This {{provides}} better {{contact between the}} buffers than {{would be the case}} if both buffers <b>were</b> <b>slightly</b> rounded.|$|R
