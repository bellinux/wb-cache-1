40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B virus X protein (HBX) {{is essential}} for the establishment of HBV infection in vivo and exerts a pleiotropic effect on diverse cellular functions. The yeast two-hybrid system had indicated that HBX could interact with two subunits of the 26 S proteasome. Here we demonstrate an association in vivo of HBX with the 26 S proteasome complex by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization upon sucrose gradient centrifugation. Expression of HBX in HepG 2 cells caused a modest decrease in the proteasome’s chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities and in hydrolysis of ubiquitinated lysozyme, suggesting that HBX functions as an inhibitor of proteasome. In these cells, HBX is degraded with a half-life of 30 min. Proteasome inhibitors retarded this rapid degradation and caused a marked increase in the level of HBX and an accumulation of HBX in polyubiquitinated form. Thus, the low intracellular level of HBX is due to rapid proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Surprisingly, the proteasome inhibitors blocked the transactivation by HBX, and this effect was not a result of a squelching phenomenon due to HBX accumulation. Therefore, proteasome function is possibly required for the transactivation function of HBX. The inhibition of protein <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> proteasomes may <b>account</b> for the multiple actions of HBX and may be an important feature of HBV infection, possibly in helping stabilize viral gene products and suppressing antigen presentation...|$|R
