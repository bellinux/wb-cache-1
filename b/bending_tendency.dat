40|$|BACKGROUND: Intracerebral drug {{delivery}} using surgically placed microcatheters {{is a growing}} area of interest for potential treatment {{of a wide variety}} of neurological diseases, including tumors, neurodegenerative disorders, trauma, epilepsy, and stroke. Current catheter placement techniques are limited to straight trajectories. The development of an inexpensive system for flexible percutaneous intracranial navigation may be of significant clinical benefit. OBJECTIVE: Utilizing duty-cycled spinning of a flexible bevel-tipped needle, the authors devised and tested a means of achieving nonlinear trajectories for the navigation of catheters in the brain, which may be applicable to a wide variety of neurological diseases. METHODS: Exploiting the <b>bending</b> <b>tendency</b> of bevel-tipped needles due to their asymmetry, the authors devised and tested a means of generating curvilinear trajectories by spinning a needle with a variable duty cycle (ie, in on-off fashion). The technique can be performed using image guidance, and trajectories can be adjusted intraoperatively via joystick. Fifty-eight navigation trials were performed during cadaver testing t...|$|E
40|$|The Kirchhoff elastic {{theory of}} thin {{filaments}} with spontaneous curvature is {{employed in the}} understanding of the onset of the kink transitions observed in short DNA rings. Dynamical analysis shows that when its actual curvature is less than some threshold value determined by the spontaneous curvature, a circular DNA will begin to buckle to other shapes. The observable and the dominant deformation modes are also determined by dynamical instability analysis, and the different effects of Zn 2 + and Mg 2 + ions on DNA configurational properties are qualitatively discussed. 1 This paper is motivated mainly by a recent experiment on short DNA rings. 1, 2 In this experiment, Han et al. synthesized a kind of DNA sequences known to have intrinsic <b>bending</b> <b>tendency</b> (in its undistorted state this kind of sequences will form an axial bend of at least 30 ◦ per helical turn. 3) They used these sequences to investigate whether DNA can actually be kinked (forming large bendings over only few base pairs) and, if kinks really turn up, what are the necessary conditions to produce them. 1, 2 Kink deformation has bee...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} electromechanical hardening of {{the steel}} parts surface, when in the contact area so called “white layer” is formed. The experiments were performed to show the influence of “white layer” on strength {{of the steel}} C 45 specimens under low cycle loading. This paper analyses monotonic and low cycle tension compression and pure bending characteristics of specimens with electromechanically hardened surface. The Performed experiments showed that under monotonic tension strength characteristics (σpr, σ 02, σu) are increasing and strain characteristics (eu, ψ) are decreasing. During cyclic stress limited tension compression at low loading levels both the width of plastic strain hysteresis loop and accumulated plastic strain are decreasing, therefore the lifetime is increasing. Under pure <b>bending</b> this <b>tendencies</b> persist, {{but in this case}} the lifetime at all loading levels is larger than the lifetime at tension compression...|$|R
40|$|Secondary circulations {{and their}} cross-channel {{components}} of velocity exist in straight reaches {{as well as}} in meander <b>bends.</b> The <b>tendency</b> is for two circulations cells to exist, rotating about axes parallel to the channel, with surface water converging at the channel centreline and near-bed water moving towards each bank. This situation results in a topographic ridge of the water surface down the channel centreline. This ridge has been mapped. But the two cells d o not usually remain of equal strength; rather they alternate in strength along a straight channel. The consequence is that the zone of bedload transport moves {{from one side of the}} channel to the other, resulting in alternating bars along a straight channel. The spacing of these bars (spacing of pool and riffle) is apparently related to the strength of the circulation cells. The water surface topography gives some insight into the nature of these cells. It also permits inferences concerning how a formerly straight channel becomes a meandering one. 13. 1 lNTRODUCTlON The occurrence of bars or rimes on alternating sides of a natural channel implies that there is also an alternation of direction of near bed streamlines. Under some circumstances the streamline direction can be observed directly but in others i...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{specimen}} size and mismatch {{on the possible}} transition from ductile crack growth to cleavage is studied for two different specimen geomtries by means of 2 D FE analysis. For homogeneous specimen the crack growth resistance is little influenced by specimen size. The stress level displays stronger size dependence resulting in increasing probability of cleavage fracture with increasing specimen size. For mismatch situations the crack growth resistance is only clearly reduced {{in cases where the}} crack grows along the interface between the two materials. When crack growth deviation occurs the detrimental effect of mismatch is reduced both with regard to crack growth resistance and susceptibility to cleavage fracture. The crack growth deviation for mismatch cases is mostly dependent on the specimen geometry, and specimens loaded in <b>bending</b> show stronger <b>tendency</b> for deviation than specimen loaded in tension...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{electrostatic}} bending response {{of a chain}} of charged particles confined on a finite helical filament. We analyze how the energy difference Δ E between the bent and the unbent helical chain scales with {{the length of the}} helical segment and the radius of curvature and identify features that are not captured by the standard notion of the bending rigidity, normally used as a measure of <b>bending</b> <b>tendency</b> in the linear response regime. Using instead Δ E to characterize the bending response of the helical chain we identify two regimes with qualitatively different bending behaviors for the ground state configuration: the regime of small and the regime of large radius-to-pitch ratio, respectively. Within the former regime, Δ E changes smoothly with the variation of the system parameters. Of particular interest are its oscillations with the number of charged particles encountered for commensurate fillings which yield length-dependent oscillations in the preferred bending direction of the helical chain. We show that the origin of these oscillations is the non-uniformity of the charge distribution caused by the long-range character of the Coulomb interactions and the finite length of the helix. In the second regime of large values of the radius-to-pitch ratio, sudden changes in the ground state structure of the charges occur as the system parameters vary, leading to complex and discontinuous variations in the ground state bending response Δ E.

Instantaneous level of received power fluctuates {{as a result of}} small-scale fading effects due to multipath propagation in underwater environments. In shallow water, multipath occurs due to signal reflections from the surface, bottom and any objects in the water. In deep water, the multi path phenomenon occurs due to ray <b>bending,</b> i.e., the <b>tendency</b> of acoustic waves to travel along the axis of lowest sound speed. Even though, there is no general consensus on an appropriate statistical model for received signal amplitude in underwater acoustic channels, the small-scale fading effects are often modeled as Rayleigh or Rician fading [41 – 43] while some studies suggest K-distribution [44] or Weibull distribution [45]. In [46], Urick proposes Rician model to describe the amplitude fluctuations in ocean environment. In [47], Bjerrum -Niese et al. propose a turbulent shallow water channel model that follows Rician distribution. In this paper, we consider both Rayleigh and Rician fading models for the analysis of minimum transmit power. The analysis can be easily extended to other fading models as well.|$|R
