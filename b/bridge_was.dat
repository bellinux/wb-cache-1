5|$|Construction of {{the second}} <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{interrupted}} several times by strikes, {{as well as by}} an algal bloom in the Swan River. The <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> finally opened to traffic on 26 February 2001, and officially opened by new Transport Minister Alannah McTiernan (a strident critic of the project) on 30 May 2001. The bridge had originally been planned to be opened in August 2000, and was expected to carry 80,000 cars per day.

5|$|In 1999, {{the town}} closed the bridge {{as it was}} deemed unsafe and badly deteriorated. It was {{estimated}} that $72,000 {{would be needed to}} relocate the bridge. In February 1999, an eight-member committee was tasked with planning a municipal park on the site. First Selectman Paul Brycki, hoped that the pending nomination to the National Register of Historic Places would help obtain grant money to repair the bridge.
