5|$|According to British filmmaker Tony Rayns the film's {{presentation}} of the vanity of a man, neglecting his family, is a critique of historic men in feudal Japanese culture. In his relationship with Wakasa, Genjurō is insignificant and is seduced by something greater, that he can never comprehend. However, by neglecting his family, Genjurō failed to appreciate he has already <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> a good life, and in the process, loses it.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe has <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> many {{world-class}} rugby players {{over the}} years. Despite limited facilities and coaching, {{the country has}} been competitive up to high school level. However, there is little incentive for most players to play beyond high school level, and consequently the club rugby pool for adult players is very diluted. There is little to choose from at national level and this has been the reason for Zimbabwe's rugby decline.|$|E

It is the {{privilege}} only of those that are chosen, to <b>be</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> ALL spiritual blessings, and to have ALL the good pleasure {{of the goodness of}} God fulfilled in and upon them. Those who <b>are</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> ALL spiritual blessings must needs <b>be</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> eternal life; and those in whom the Lord, not only works all his good pleasure, but fulfilleth all the good pleasure of his goodness upon them, they must needs be preserved to his heavenly kingdom (Eph 1:4,5; 1 Thess 1:10); but none of the non-elect have these things conferred upon them; therefore the grace bestowed upon the one, doth differ both in nature and degree from the other.|$|R

25|$|In his {{commissioned}} portraits, van der Weyden typically flattered his sitters. He often idealised or softened their facial features, {{allowing them}} a handsomeness or beauty, or interest or intelligence {{they might not}} have <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> in life. He often enlargened the eyes, better defined the contours of the face, and gave a much stronger jaw than the subject may have possessed in life. Among his most celebrated portraits are those of Philip the Good, his third wife Isabella of Portugal and their son Charles the Bold.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} the first to {{prominently}} feature Ned Flanders {{and the rest of the}} Flanders family, and contained the first appearances of Maude and Rod Flanders. Maggie Roswell was given the role of Maude, Ned's loving wife, and became a regular cast member with this episode. She had previously played supporting parts in the show's first season. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart, commented on Roswell's acting: [...] "Maggie has <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> a skill in creating one of the hardest things to create: the 'normal sound,' whatever that is.

500|$|Though he {{believed}} that the historical Jesus was barely known, Keable nonetheless devoted much attention in The Last Galilean to trying to understand the figure. He emphasised the humanity of historical Jesus, who, he wrote, had shared humanity's ignorance – though had also <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> an extraordinarily undistorted mind. He wrote of a Jesus tolerant – even fond – of sinners, and one who, understanding the importance of love and sex to the average man, advocated love as the most important thing, above any church rule or regulation. This Jesus was a great prophet of free love, associated and in harmony with a [...] "spirit of all life".|$|E

500|$|In Portland, Meeker {{lost his}} {{remaining}} helpers (one {{refused to take}} a pay cut, the others for personal reasons). One stayed on for the boat voyage up the Columbia before leaving at The Dalles, [...] where Meeker hired a driver/cook, William Mardon, at $30 per month. [...] He remained with Meeker {{for the next three}} years. Meeker also installed an odometer on his wagon, calling The Dalles [...] "Mile Zero" [...] of his expedition. In The Dalles, Meeker engaged in activities which would set the pattern for his progress along the Trail: He showed off himself, his wagon and animals, to the public, and sold tickets for a lecture (fifty cents for adults, half that for children) he would give about the Oregon Trail, including images shown with a stereopticon. [...] He also met with members of civic committees to raise money for a local monument. [...] Often these monuments were erected after Meeker passed: he would position a post to designate its location. [...] According to reporter James Aldredge in his 1975 article on Meeker's trip, [...] "for a septuagenarian he must have <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> remarkable health and endurance... When the curious procession got underway, not the least impressive part of it was Meeker himself, with his face framed by his flowing white hair and his patriarchal beard." [...] According to reporter Bart Ripp in his 1993 article on Meeker, [...] "the first expedition east in 1906 {{was supposed to be a}} speaking tour, but people were more interested in seeing the old coot in a covered wagon. [...] It was the 20th century, and Americans wanted a show." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to her live action roles, Roswell did some voice acting in animated films and shows, including the voice of Teegra in Fire and Ice from 1983. This led to her being hired on the animated television series The Simpsons in 1989. Her first appearance was in the season one episode [...] "Homer's Night Out", in which she voiced the character Princess Kashmir (a belly dancer who seduces Homer). Out of the total thirteen episodes of the first season, Maggie Roswell appeared in four; however, they were only minor roles. Maggie Roswell did not become a regular cast member {{until the middle of}} the second season in the episode [...] "Dead Putting Society" [...] (1990), with the introduction of Maude Flanders (neighbor to the Simpson family and the loving wife of Ned Flanders). Maggie Roswell went on to voice other recurring characters on the show, such as Helen Lovejoy (the reverend's wife), Miss Hoover (an elementary school teacher), and Luann Van Houten (a housewife and mother), as well as several more one-time characters and background characters. Fellow Simpsons cast member Nancy Cartwright wrote in her autobiography that [...] "Maggie Roswell has <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> a skill in creating {{one of the hardest things}} to create: the 'normal sound,' whatever that is. So she can easily slip into the gal next door or any number of assorted reporters, medical students, jury members, accountants, scientists and moms." [...] Roswell was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on The Simpsons. She also received a 1997 Annie Award nomination in the category [...] "Best Individual Achievement: Voice Acting by a Female Performer in a TV Production" [...] for her role as Sharry Bobbins in the episode [...] "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious", but lost to June Foray.|$|E

Fortunato, as his name would seem to indicate, has <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> good fortune and wealth and is, therefore, viewed as unrefined by Montresor; however, this lack of refinement has not stopped Fortunato from surpassing Montresor in society, which could very well be the [...] "insult" [...] motive for Montresor's revenge.|$|E
2500|$|Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski criticized Khrushchev in 1978 {{for failing}} to make any {{analysis}} of the system Stalin presided over.

2500|$|Andrew R. Heinze {{was born}} on January 19, 1955 into a close-knit Jewish family in Passaic, New Jersey. His {{paternal}} grandmother (also born in Passaic) was one of eight children born to a self-made Polish Jew who had supplied coal {{to the city of}} Passaic. Heinze memorialized his grandmother in an article he wrote for The Jewish Daily Forward shortly after she {{died at the age of}} 101; he described her as a flamboyant, stylish, and impeccably dressed woman, and he recalled that after his grandfather (her husband of 60 years) had died, she [...] "kept on going, honestly confessing her loneliness but unflaggingly maintaining her enthusiasm for life and for us." [...] He quoted her as frequently giving him the reminder, [...] "We are 100% Americans, dear, always remember that!" [...] Heinze has a close relationship with his parents; in his acknowledgements of his second book, he wrote, [...] "I have <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> extraordinarily devoted parents who enabled me, as a child, to feel at home in the world." [...] His mother, he said, is a woman of [...] "gentle disposition, sensitivity to human qualities that others overlook, vivacious imagination, love of art, and whimsical sense of humor," [...] and his father he described as a man of [...] "great loyalty, heartfelt devotion, and frequent praise [...] helped me set my sights high and pick myself up when fallen low." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{may have}} been implied already, Abney Park Cemetery was the only garden {{cemetery}} of its era {{to be influenced by}} New World cemetery design ideas due to the strong links between its founders and New England; in particular Boston. The Stoke Newington cemetery reflects the design style adopted for Mount Auburn, for example in its use of an Egyptian Revival entrance and arboretum. However, though its [...] "model" [...] lay in the New World, it drew on different romantic landscape associations. Whereas Mount Auburn Cemetery celebrated the 'Sweet Auburn' of poetry, in particular the nature and woodland associated with the Auburn village area, it was the [...] "romance" [...] of religious and historical associations that primarily attracted the founders of London's first nondenominational garden cemetery, to Lady Mary Abney's estate which had served as an inspiration to the celebrated Isaac Watts. Nonetheless, on its opening, Abney Park was by far the most sylvan of all garden cemeteries in Britain; its many stately trees imbued the landscape with a uniquely well-timbered inheritance or [...] "green cloak", and plans were put in train to encourage this further with collections of trees arranged along, and set back from, path edges. Whereas the cemetery at Mount Auburn had <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> a natural woodland setting, well suited to its founders' ethos of creating an Elysian paradise, Abney Park would take some time to more closely reflect its predominantly woodland style of cemetery design and a more transcendental view of nature as proposed by Emerson, and Thoreau in New England.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Hogan of The Telegraph {{noted that}} [...] "Capaldi {{is back to}} his charismatic best" [...] in [...] "The Pilot", stating [...] "devoted Whovian is keen {{to go out with}} a bang", and {{described}} his character as [...] "mercurial, magical and kind". Patrick Mulkern praised Sarah Dollard's writing of the Doctor in [...] "Thin Ice", noting how she [...] "examines his moral code; the ideals he aspires to and the crimes and misdemeanors he's prepared to indulge". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Extremis" [...] received praise, with Alasdair Wilkins stating [...] "Peter Capaldi is perilously close to becoming my unqualified pick for favorite Doctor, he underplays the moment, making small choices to signal both his compassion and his heartbreak". He also praised the interactions between him and Missy, noting how they recall [...] "a more emotionally complex version of the repartee that Jon Pertwee’s Doctor and Roger Delgado’s Master had during their many encounters". Patrick Mulkern praised Capaldi’s performance in [...] "The Lie of the Land" [...] proclaiming [...] "he wavers between downright nasty and at best disconcerting. He’s world-weary — specifically, Earth-weary. You can almost believe he’s working for the dark side, so great is his disenchantment with the human race". After the broadcast of World Enough and Time, Steven Moffat paid a special tribute to Capaldi, “Peter only has to think at the screen and you know what he’s thinking,” he said. “He only has to move his face and I know the particular blend of Scottish torment he’s feeling right now. Despite trying to fight his emotions, he has given us the most emotional Doctor.” [...] Capaldi received overwhelming praise for his performance in [...] "The Doctor Falls" [...] with Patrick Mulkern noted the episode as a story dedicated to the character and how he [...] "stands tall", along with Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror highlighting the twelfth Doctor, praising how he [...] "simply shines". Flickering Myth stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is a magnificent Doctor, a person who captures the wisdom, madness, caring and frustration of a two-thousand year old Time Lord". Digital Spy praised Capaldi's [...] "Where I stand is where I fall" [...] speech, noting it as quite possibly the actor's finest moment to date. Simon Brew of Den of Geek heavily praised the actor's performance stating: [...] "The majestic, wonderful, brilliant Peter Capaldi. If you needed a reminder of just how much he’s going to be missed when he finally departs Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} year, his outstanding work here was precisely that. When he was blasted, apparently mortally, and he kept holding off his regeneration I found myself saying out loud “I don’t want you to go”". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine agreed, admitting that [...] "the man’s been a revelation. I love Peter Capaldi. He has without a doubt been my Doctor for this new incarnation of Doctor Who that’s wrapping up its tenth season, and we have been nothing short of fortunate to have <b>been</b> <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> his talents. I don’t want you to go either, Peter".|$|E
