5|$|Across the German Empire nagelfiguren, war {{memorials}} {{made from}} iron nails embedded in wood, became popular, particularly in Austria. These took various forms, including knights, shields, eagles and crosses, {{as well as}} submarines. This practice had medieval origins, and the memorials were reinforced by the promotion of burgfrieden during the war, a medieval pact in which disparate German communities would put aside their differences during a conflict. In some cases, relatives of the deceased were encouraged to hammer memorial nails in {{as part of the}} ceremonies, while children might <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> read out poems in a medieval style. At some nagelfiguren a charge was made for each nail used, with the revenues donated to charities supporting soldiers, orphans and others affected by the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Candidates for Freemasonry {{will have}} met most active {{members of the}} Lodge they are joining before they are initiated. The process varies between jurisdictions, but the {{candidate}} will typically have been introduced by a friend at a Lodge social function, or at some form of open evening in the Lodge. In modern times, interested people often track down a local Lodge through the Internet. The onus is on candidates to ask to join; while candidates may <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> ask, they are never invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, an interview usually follows to determine the candidate's suitability. If the candidate decides to proceed from here, the Lodge ballots on the application before he (or she, depending on the Masonic Jurisdiction) can be accepted.|$|E
5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E

5|$|Later in 711, al-Hajjaj ordered Qutayba {{to march}} against the Hephthalite kingdom of Zabulistan, whose ruler, titled Zunbil, had long {{remained}} an indomitable {{thorn in the}} Arabs' side and menaced their province of Sistan. Repeated expeditions against him had failed, and a truce had been agreed in exchange for tribute. In addition, {{the existence of a}} free Zabulite kingdom was a threat to the security of Muslim control over the Hephthalite principalities of Tokharistan, who might <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> seek support from it. Thus Qutayba led a large army south, but the Zunbil readily offered his submission and the payment of tribute. Satisfied with this easy success, and unwilling to hazard a campaign in the mountains of Zabulistan, Qutayba departed. No garrisons were installed, {{and as soon as the}} Arab army had departed, the Zunbil ceased the payment of tribute. Qutayba's victories, parallel with the conquests of Muhammad ibn Qasim in northwestern India, awoke such enthusiasm and hopes among the Muslims that al-Hajjaj is reputed to have offered the governorship of China to whomever of the two first reached it.|$|E
