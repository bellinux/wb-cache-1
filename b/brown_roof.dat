60|$|The snail had now {{considered}} every possible method of reaching his goal without going round the dead leaf or climbing over it. Let alone the effort needed for climbing a leaf, he was doubtful whether the thin texture which vibrated {{with such an}} alarming crackle when touched even by {{the tip of his}} horns would bear his weight; and this determined him finally to creep beneath it, for there was a point where the leaf curved high enough from the ground to admit him. He had just inserted his head in the opening and was taking stock of the high <b>brown</b> <b>roof</b> and was getting used to the cool brown light when two other people came past outside on the turf. This time they were both young, a young man and a young woman. They were both in the prime of youth, or even in that season which precedes the prime of youth, the season before the smooth pink folds of the flower have burst their gummy case, when the wings of the butterfly, though fully grown, are motionless in the sun.|$|E
60|$|There it was, spread {{largely on}} both banks, the Oriental capital which had as yet {{suffered}} no white conqueror; {{an expanse of}} brown houses of bamboo, of mats, of leaves, of a vegetable-matter style of architecture, sprung out of the brown soil {{on the banks of}} the muddy river. It was amazing to think that in those miles of human habitations there was not probably half a dozen pounds of nails. Some of those houses of sticks and grass, like the nests of an aquatic race, clung to the low shores. Others seemed to grow out of the water; others again floated in long anchored rows in the very middle of the stream. Here and there in the distance, above the crowded mob of low, <b>brown</b> <b>roof</b> ridges, towered great piles of masonry, King's Palace, temples, gorgeous and dilapidated, crumbling under the vertical sunlight, tremendous, overpowering, almost palpable, which seemed to enter one's breast with the breath of one's nostrils and soak into one's limbs through every pore of one's skin.|$|E

60|$|All {{the scene}} was but a great light and a great solitude. Her gaze {{travelled}} over the lustrous, dark sheet of empty water to a shore bordered by a white beach empty, too, and showing no sign of human life. The human habitations {{were lost in the}} shade of the fruit trees, masked by the cultivated patches of Indian corn and the banana plantations. Near the shore the rigid lines of two stockaded forts could be distinguished flanking the beach, and between them with a great open space before it, the <b>brown</b> <b>roof</b> slope of an enormous long building that seemed suspended in the air had a great square flag fluttering above it. Something like a small white flame in the sky was the carved white coral finial on the gable of the mosque which had caught full the rays of the sun. A multitude of gay streamers, white and red, flew over the half-concealed roofs, over the brilliant fields and amongst the sombre palm groves. But it might have been a deserted settlement decorated and abandoned by its departed population. Lingard pointed to the stockade on the right.|$|E
60|$|As {{the days}} went forward he passed from one extreme to another; now pluming {{himself on the}} {{strength}} of his determination, now despising his timid and silly caution. The former was, perhaps, the true thought of his heart, and represented the regular tenor of the man's reflections; but the latter burst forth from time to time with an unruly violence, and then he would forget all consideration, and go up and down his house and garden or walk among the fir-woods like one who is beside himself with remorse. To equable, steady-minded Will this state of matters was intolerable; and he determined, at whatever cost, to bring it to an end. So, one warm summer afternoon he put on his best clothes, took a thorn switch in his hand, and set out down the valley by the river. As soon as he had taken his determination, he had regained at a bound his customary peace of heart, and he enjoyed the bright weather and the variety of the scene without any admixture of alarm or unpleasant eagerness. It was nearly the same to him how the matter turned out. If she accepted him he would have to marry her this time, which perhaps was, all for the best. If she refused him, he would have done his utmost, and might follow his own way in the future with an untroubled conscience. He hoped, on the whole, she would refuse him; and then, again, as he saw the <b>brown</b> <b>roof</b> which sheltered her, peeping through some willows at an angle of the stream, he was half inclined to reverse the wish, and more than half ashamed of himself for this infirmity of purpose.|$|E

50|$|The Harroun motors {{corporation}} raised $10,000,000 {{in stock}} {{to begin a}} car company. Harroun bought the buildings and equipment of the former Prouty and Glass Carriage Company in 1916 for $40,000. The old carriage factory was 80,000 square feet and used for paint and upholstery, and in 1917 Harroun built a new 1,220,000 square foot factory next door for all other processes. The company operated for 12-18 months producing 200 cars per day. There were three models offered, a roadster and a touring car (each priced at $595) and a sedan ($850), each powered by the company's own four-cylinder engine. Cars were only available with a green body, <b>brown</b> <b>roof</b> and black fenders and upholstery. The roadster was only available in midnight blue. The goal {{was to get the}} price of cars below $500 to remain profitable. In 1918 Harroun also invented and patented a shock absorbing steering wheel to reduce driver fatigue.|$|E

5000|$|The Union Pacific Railroad's M-10000, {{delivered}} to the railroad on February 12, 1934, {{at a cost of}} $230,997, was the first internal combustion engine, lightweight streamlined express passenger train built in the United States. The M-10000 featured a turret cab, an inward-slanting Duralumin body with a nose formed of parabolic arches, and large nose air intakes {{on each side of the}} centerline. The prime mover was a [...] Winton 191-A V12 distillate engine. This engine design was unrelated to the later 201 or 201A Winton diesels. There were three cars: a driving, power and baggage car at the front; and two passenger cars. The 204 ft long, 85 ST train was fully articulated, with trucks shared between cars. The front truck carried one General Electric traction motor per axle, and was the only one powered. The train was painted in Armour Yellow with Leaf <b>Brown</b> <b>roof</b> and undersides. Later, the area around the front air intake was also painted yellow. Dividing lines of red separated the colors.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} conform {{with the rules}} for {{building}} on Metropolitan Open Land, the footprint of the new school building did not exceed that of the demolished buildings. The design includes a <b>brown</b> <b>roof,</b> climbing plants on walls, and areas of planted grassland, wild flowers and woodland. Bowlers Nursery moved into the new building in August 2012 and Ashmount School moved to the site in January 2013. Building operations at the Cape were finally completed in February 2013, two years and {{four months after the}} contract to carry out the work was signed by Islington Council. The Crouch Hill Project received a 2012 BREEAM award. Factors behind this award include the use of rain water harvesting, natural ventilation systems to keep the school building cool in summer and the setting up of an [...] "energy centre" [...] in the blockhouse which by means of combined heat and power provides district heating both for the whole site and for social housing near the site, as well as generating electricity. The main fuel used is gas, but there is also provision for the use of biomass in the form of woodchips. The Architects were Penoyre & Prasad and the Contractors were Willmott Dixon.|$|E

50|$|Brownfield {{sites are}} {{construction}} sites where an existing building or man-made structure have been before, {{as opposed to}} greenfield sites where man expands his building activities into natural areas. An interesting idea is brown-roofs: Here {{the idea is to}} use building waste to provide a new growth medium on a flat roof (e.g. rubble/bricks produced as a by-product when an existing structure is demolished). Advantages are that {{there is no need to}} transport rubble away from the site and that various flora and fauna species which thrive on rubble landscapes can prosper - there are numerous examples of these. Unfortunately, in the UK at least, the idea is not so easy to put into practice, as bureaucracy dictates that rubble be analysed and often small amounts of what may be 'technically' termed pollution which may have lain 'happily' for many years forbids that it be reused on the roof. If the architect of the building-to-be has specified a <b>brown</b> <b>roof</b> then sometimes rubble is specially brought in on trucks, which to some extent defeats the object of nature conservancy, landfill waste reduction, transport pollution reduction and transport volume reduction. These brown roofs do provide a successful wildlife habitat when planned and implemented correctly. They are either specially seeded with chosen plant types or allowed to self-seed and make an attractive and visually pleasing roof.|$|E
