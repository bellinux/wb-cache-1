25|$|A {{possible}} {{sequence of}} events in prehistory involves considering the structure of copper ore deposits, which are mostly sulphides. The surface minerals would contain some native copper and oxidised minerals, {{but much of the}} copper and other minerals would have been washed further into the ore <b>body</b> <b>forming</b> a secondary enrichment zone. This includes many minerals such as tennantite, with their arsenic, copper and iron. So the surface deposits would be used first, and with some work deeper sulphidic ores would have been uncovered and worked, {{and it would have been}} discovered that the material from this level had better properties.|$|E
25|$|The TARDIS is {{captured}} by the Daleks and transported to the Crucible—the Dalek flagship. The Doctor and his previous companions Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) and Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) leave the TARDIS, but Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) is locked in. The Dalek Supreme orders the TARDIS to be destroyed; in the process, Donna collapses by the Doctor's severed hand. The regeneration energy stored in the hand causes a reaction; the hand glows and grows into a full <b>body,</b> <b>forming</b> a new, cloned Doctor. The duplicate Doctor then saves the TARDIS from destruction. Concurrently, Torchwood employees Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) and Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) find safety in an impenetrable time bubble; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) is saved from a Dalek extermination by Rose's ex-boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and mother Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri) and surrender themselves to get aboard the Crucible; Jack is killed and disposed of by the Daleks; and Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) teleports to a castle near Nuremberg.|$|E

25|$|Scansoriopteryx fossils {{preserve}} {{impressions of}} wispy, down-like feathers around select {{parts of the}} <b>body,</b> <b>forming</b> V-shaped patterns similar to those seen in modern down feathers. The most prominent feather impressions trail from the left forearm and hand. The longer feathers in this region led Czerkas and Yuan to speculate that adult scansoriopterygids may have had reasonably well-developed wing feathers which could have aided in leaping or rudimentary gliding, though they ruled {{out the possibility that}} Scansoriopteryx could have achieved powered flight. Like other maniraptorans, Scansoriopteryx had a semilunate (half-moon shaped) bone in the wrist that allowed for bird-like folding motion in the hand. Even if powered flight was not possible, this motion could have aided maneuverability in leaping from branch to branch. Scales were preserved near the base of the tail, and the Epidendrosaurus specimen also preserved faint feather impressions {{at the end of the}} tail, similar to the pattern found in Microraptor.|$|E
2500|$|Another modern {{example of}} a [...] "sea monster" [...] was the strange {{creature}} washed up in Los Muermos on the Chilean sea shore in July 2003. It was first described as a [...] "mammoth jellyfish {{as long as a}} bus" [...] but was later determined to be another corpse of a sperm whale. Cases of boneless, amorphic globsters are sometimes believed to be gigantic octopuses, but it has now been determined that sperm whales dying at sea decompose {{in such a way that}} the blubber detaches from the <b>body,</b> <b>forming</b> featureless whitish masses that sometimes exhibit a hairy texture due to exposed strands of collagen fibers. The analysis of the Zuiyō Maru carcass revealed a comparable phenomenon in decomposing basking shark carcasses, which lose most of the lower head area and the dorsal and caudal fins first, making them resemble a plesiosaur.|$|E

As they looked, this lower mass moved, the glistening folds catching the moonlight, and they could see that the monster's progress was along the ground. It was coming towards them at a swift pace, so they turned and ran, taking care to make as little noise as possible, either by their footfalls or by disturbing the undergrowth close to them. They did not stop or pause till they saw before them the high dark tower of Doom.|$|E

40|$|Actions can be {{understood}} based on form cues (e. g., static body posture) as well as motion cues (e. g., gait patterns). A fundamental debate centers {{on the question of}} whether the functional and neural mechanisms processing these two types of cues are dissociable. Here, using fMRI, psychophysics, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), all within the same human participants, we show that mechanisms underlying <b>body</b> <b>form</b> and <b>body</b> motion processing are functionally and neurally distinct. Multivoxel fMRI activity patterns in the extrastriate body area (EBA), but not in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), carried cue invariant information about the <b>body</b> <b>form</b> of an acting human. Conversely, multivoxel patterns in pSTS, but not in EBA, carried information about the body motion of the same actor. In a psychophysical experiment, we selectively impaired <b>body</b> <b>form</b> and <b>body</b> motion discriminations by manipulating different visual cues: misaligning the ellipses that made up a dynamic walker stimulus selectively disrupted <b>body</b> <b>form</b> discriminations, while varying the presentation duration of the walker selectively affected body motion discriminations. Finally, a TMS experiment revealed causal evidence for a double-dissociation between neural mechanisms underlying <b>body</b> <b>form</b> and <b>body</b> motion discriminations: TMS over EBA selectively disrupted <b>body</b> <b>form</b> discrimination, whereas TMS over pSTS selectively disrupted body motion discrimination. Together, these findings reveal complementing but dissociable functions of EBA and pSTS during action perception. They provide constraints for theoretical and computational models of action perception by showing that action perception involves at least two parallel pathways that separately contribute to the understanding of others' behavior...|$|R

40|$|AIM: The {{relationship}} between changes in <b>body</b> <b>form</b> (limb reduction and body elongation) and geographical range size was investigated across 68 species of Lerista, a species-rich clade of Australian scincid lizards that exhibits extensive interspecific variability in both <b>body</b> <b>form</b> and range size. LOCATION: Lerista occurs {{across the entire}} Australian mainland, with diversity concentrated in arid and semi-arid regions. Methods Geographical range size was estimated directly from c. 14, 000 museum specimens using bioclimatic modelling in MaxEnt. <b>Body</b> <b>form</b> was quantified using principal components analysis of morphometric variables. Comparative analyses testing for a correlation between these two variables used a full Bayesian approach that accounts for uncertainties in trait optimization {{as well as in}} tree topology and branch lengths. RESULTS: A serpentine <b>body</b> <b>form</b> (elongated with reduced limbs) was significantly associated with smaller geographical range size, in both phylogenetically corrected and uncorrected analyses – but only if species from single localities (whose ranges could not be modelled using the above methods) were excluded. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a general predictive {{relationship between}} <b>body</b> <b>form</b> and geographical range size in lizards: elongate, limbreduced lizards tend to exhibit more restricted geographical ranges that may reflect reduced dispersal ability and may also predispose them to greater vulnerability of extinction.
