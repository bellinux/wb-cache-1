5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> classified {{according to the}} level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. These are not mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} it was {{considered}} that the two former Line E stations and tunnels {{should be used for}} Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.|$|E
5|$|If {{the bike}} and rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> divided into two groups: internal and external. The external forces are due to gravity, inertia, contact with the ground, and contact with the atmosphere. The internal forces are caused by the rider and by interaction between components.|$|E

5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> classified {{according to the}} level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.|$|E
5|$|The campus can <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> {{divided in}} two by the Jaime Garces B. Avenue that runs in an east-west direction. The {{northern}} part, {{which is also}} the largest, is mostly undeveloped. The developed area is enclosed by the Tulio Ramirez Avenue, and it is composed of more than 30 buildings, including the main administration building, the faculties of Science and of Engineering, part of the faculty of Integrated Arts, and the Mario Carvajal Library, which is the main library of the university.|$|E
5|$|The {{prediction}} that the CMB temperature was {{higher in the}} past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies does not depend directly on redshift. Observations have found this to <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.|$|E

5|$|Almost all of Josquin's motets {{use some}} kind of {{compositional}} constraint on the process; they are not freely composed. Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use canon can <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E
5|$|Because Missouri had {{run aground}} during {{an unusually high}} tide, Wallin {{required}} a date on which the tide would <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> comparable to {{the conditions under which}} Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time as a factor, Wallin took charge of the operation and put his five-point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Clementine cake is a cake {{prepared}} with clementine fruit {{as a primary}} ingredient and other typical cake ingredients. Additional ingredients can be used, and some preparation variations exist. It can be prepared using whole or peeled clementines that have been manually-seeded, or seedless fruit may be used. It may provide significant amounts of Vitamin D. It can be topped with a sweet glaze or sauce, powdered sugar, honey and clementines or candied clementines. Its origin may <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> based upon an orange cake developed by the Sephardi Jews. In popular culture, the cake played a minor part in {{the plot of the}} 2013 film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.|$|E

5|$|Gravitationally induced {{irregularities}} in Uranus's observed orbit led eventually {{to the discovery}} of Neptune in 1846, and presumed {{irregularities in}} Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later found to be a mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find Pluto in 1930. Initially believed to <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all. In 1989, Voyager 2 determined the irregularities to be due to an overestimation of Neptune's mass.|$|E
5|$|In service, Skylon could {{potentially}} {{lower the cost}} of launching satellites which, according to evidence submitted to the UK parliament by REL, is forecast to be around £650/kg; as of 2011, the average launch cost using conventional methods was estimated to <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> £15,000/kg. Amongst other prospective operations, Skylon would be capable of transporting payloads of up to 10-tonnes to the International Space Station. REL has also completed internal studies into the use of Skylon as a launch platform for a network of space-based solar power satellites, which have been historically unfeasible due to high launch costs. According to business publication Management Today, Skylon has been discussed as a possible replacement for NASA's Space Shuttle programme.|$|E
5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from the toe of the ridge was estimated to <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E

5000|$|In practice, this {{ratio is}} almost always {{extremely}} small. For example, the Schwarzschild radius rs of the Earth <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> 9 mm ( [...] inch); at {{the surface of the}} Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion. The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun <b>is</b> much larger, <b>roughly</b> 2953 meters, but at its surface, the ratio rs/r <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> 4 parts in a million. A white dwarf star is much denser, but even here the ratio at its surface <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> 250 parts in a million. The ratio only becomes large close to ultra-dense objects such as neutron stars (where the ratio <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> 50%) and black holes.|$|R
5|$|Motions of a bike can <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> {{grouped into}} those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|The US Army's basic wartime racial policy, {{established}} in 1937, dictated that both whites and African Americans {{were to be}} inducted into the Army in equal proportions and strength, but that they were to be assigned to segregated units. Black soldiers could be led by white officers, but not vice versa, and unit composition was to be strictly controlled by the War Department. The mix of combat and support service units was, in theory, to <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> equal between both groups. This caused tension between the Department and operational commanders, with the latter generally unwilling to provide places for black combat units. In practice, almost all combat units in the pre-war period were white.|$|E
5|$|Constructing a warship of {{the size}} of the Mary Rose was a major undertaking, {{requiring}} vast quantities of high-quality material. In the case of building a state-of-the-art warship, these materials were primarily oak. The total amount of timber needed for the construction can only <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> calculated since only about one third of the ship still exists. One estimate for the number of trees is around 600 mostly large oaks, representing about 16 hectares (40 acres) of woodland. The huge trees that had been common in Europe and the British Isles in previous centuries were by the 16th century quite rare, which meant that timbers were brought in from all over southern England. The largest timbers used in the construction were of roughly the same size as those used in the roofs of the largest cathedrals in the high Middle Ages. An unworked hull plank would have weighed over 300kg (660lb), and one of the main deck beams would have weighed close to three-quarters of a tonne.|$|E

As n {{approaches}} infinity, {{the probability}} Xn approaches zero; that is, by making n large enough, Xn can be made as small as is desired, and the chance of typing banana approaches 100%.|$|R

5|$|Hawaii's {{geographical}} isolation strongly influences its ecology. Remote islands like Hawaii have a {{large number}} of species that are found nowhere else (see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands). The remoteness resulted in evolutionary lines distinct from those elsewhere and isolated these endemic species from external biotic influence, and also makes them especially vulnerable to extinction and the effects of invasive species. In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture; an estimated third of the island's endemic species have already been wiped out. Because of its elevation, Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago. Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation. These ecosystems can <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> divided into three sections by elevation: alpine–subalpine, montane, and basal forest.|$|E
5|$|Identified world zinc {{resources}} total about 1.9–2.8 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, {{with the}} largest reserves in Iran. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) {{at the time of}} determination. Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use.|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to <b>be</b> <b>roughly</b> equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
