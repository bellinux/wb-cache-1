40|$|A simple {{asymptotic}} analysis {{dealing with}} the influence of specimen boundaries on quasi-brittle fracture of brittle heterogenous materials is presented. The influence of crack-length/specimen-size ratio (α-ratio) on fracture behaviour of finitesized specimens has been quantitatively determined by the asymptotic <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> model. Different to the common size effect study relying on two scaling parameters {{that can only be}} determined by curve-fitting to experimental results, the present <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> model is able to predict the quasi-brittle fracture behaviour using two fundamental material properties: the tensile strength ft and fracture toughness KIC. ft and KIC can be determined separately following the standard strength and fracture toughness tests, or estimated from the available data in the literature for most commonly-used materials. Alternatively, ft and KIC can be determined indirectly from quasi-brittle fracture results using the <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> model so that the stringent tensile and fracture toughness tests can be replaced by the simple quasi-brittle fracture tests. The <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> model showsthe two scaling parameters used in the size effect study are α-ratio dependent, and can only be taken as experimental constants for geometrically similar specimens of one single α-ratio. Furthermore, un-notched specimens containing small natural flaws have also been considered by the <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> model through linking the micro-flaws to equivalent shallow notches with a near zero α-ratio.

The recently-developed <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> {{concept and}} {{associated}} asymptotic model {{are used to}} explain the size effect phenomena in fracture of quasi-brittle materials.

To verify the <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> concept, fracture tests on a high strength concrete reported by Karihaloo et al are analysed and predicted using the asymptotic model.

50|$|Each of the SIFT keypoints {{specifies}} 2D location, scale, and orientation, {{and each}} matched keypoint {{in the database}} {{has a record of}} its parameters relative to the training image in which it was found. The similarity transform implied by these 4 parameters is only an approximation to the full 6 degree-of-freedom pose space for a 3D object and also does not account for any non-rigid deformations. Therefore, Lowe used broad bin sizes of 30 degrees for orientation, a factor of 2 for scale, and 0.25 times the maximum projected training image dimension (using the predicted scale) for location. The SIFT key samples generated at the larger scale are given twice the weight of those at the smaller scale. This means that the larger scale is in effect able to filter the most likely neighbours for checking at the smaller scale. This also improves recognition performance by giving more weight to the least-noisy scale. To avoid the problem of <b>boundary</b> <b>effects</b> in bin assignment, each keypoint match votes for the 2 closest bins in each dimension, giving a total of 16 entries for each hypothesis and further broadening the pose range.|$|E

40|$|The common {{size effect}} on quasi-brittle {{fracture}} of concrete-like materials is analysed {{by a simple}} asymptotic analysis based on a <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> model originally proposed for a large plate with a small edge crack. The large plate analysis considers exclusively {{the interaction of the}} crack-tip fracture process zone with the specimen front face and its influence on the fracture conditions. The new asymptotic model considers both the specimen boundary and size, and thus extends the <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> model to the size effect study on finite-sized specimens. The new <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> model shows that the specimen size alone is not sufficient in determination of the size effect on quasi-brittle fracture behaviour, the specimen boundary conditions have to be considered as well. It is shown that even very large specimens that normally do not show any size effect can still experience quasi-brittle fracture if they contain very shallow or very deep cracks. The new <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> model uses the two well-defined fracture criteria, the tensile strength and fracture toughness, as its two asymptotic limits, which allows the determination of the two important material constants from the quasi-brittle fracture results. The size effect issue in concrete specimens without initial notches is also studied by the asymptotic model after assuming the natural pre-existing defects in concrete as very shallow notches. The geometrically similar specimen condition can be satisfied by those assumed shallow notched specimens...|$|R

The open boundary condition often used in DMRG suffers from the <b>boundary</b> <b>effect</b> the most severely, which is directly reflected in the distinct spatial modulations of the local physical quantity. By contrast, the other boundary conditions such as the periodic one or the sin^ 2 -deformed interaction [A. Gendiar, R. Krcmar, and T. Nishino, Prog. Theor.
