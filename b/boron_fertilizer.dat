40|$|Boron in {{the soil}} {{is a native of}} erosion of primary or {{secondary}} minerals {{in the soil}}and of the process of mineralization (decomposition) of organic substance in the soil. As opposed to other microelements, boron is a semi-metal and it has a negative surfacecharge. It most often appears in the soil as boric acid B (OH) 3, whereas in the plants it appears in three forms of salts of boric acid H 3 BO 3, H 2 BO 3 - or HBO 3 2 -. Depending on conditions in the soil, there can be surplus or shortage of boron with different consequences on plants. Concentration of boron in the plants is variable because of its low mobility and effect of transpiration, and it also depends on the plant species. Boron plays an important part in synthesis of saharosis processes, metabolism of nucleine acids, photosynthesis, metabolism of proteins and stabilization of cell membrane. Boron regulates meristemic activity, so with its shortage irregular cell division appears, especially {{at the top of the}} growth, roots and tillers, and also a disorder of cambial activity. As a consequence of boron shortage, growth of plants is reduced, creating of embryos and fruits is underdeveloped, and a range of other imbalances is possible.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Several crops {{grown in}} the Willamette valley of western Oregon respond to {{applications}} of <b>boron</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> The acid, highly-leached soils of this area are naturally low in plant-available B. Application of B to the soil annually or at less frequent intervals is currently recommended, but the fate of applied B and the residual effect on plant growth has received little attention. In studying boron in these soils a more convenient and more accurate method for determining hot-water-soluble B based on the azomethine-H procedure was developed and adopted to replace the curcumin method. Substitution of 0. 02 M CaC 1 ₂ for distilled water for extraction of soil B resulted in clear, colorless solutions which permitted accurate colorimetric determination of B. A greenhouse experiment was established to investigate 1) the influence of soil properties on the mobility and plant-availability of B, 2) {{the magnitude of the}} loss of B from the surface soil by leaching, and 3) the residual effect of applied B on plant growth and the B supplying power of soils. Soil samples from sixteen locations representing five agriculturally important soil series were studied. The percentage of B from a 2. 0 mg B /kg application recovered in 25 cm of leachate decreased as soil organic matter, clay, and free iron and aluminum oxide content increased. The results clearly indicated the importance of organic matter in reducing the mobility of B, and suggested that free Fe and Al oxides, and perhaps clay, may also be important. Soil acidity over a pH range of 5. 4 to 7. 5 did not influence the mobility of B. Dry matter yields for three cuttings of New Zealand white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were not significantly affected by B soil test level or B applied at planting. Plant tissue concentrations of B were high compared to field-grown forage legumes and, while these concentrations were affected by extractable soil B level or B application, the correlations between soil test level of B and plant content of B were low. A balance-sheet approach, where the amounts of leachate, plant, and extractable soil B were tabulated, indicated a B supplying power for the soils studied. All sixteen soils released B to leaching and cropping with minimal decreases in hot-water-soluble B content. When B was applied to the soils, only those higher in organic matter and/or free Fe and Al oxides tended to "fix" B in a form not recoverable by leaching, cropping and hot-water extraction. The capacity of the soils to maintain soluble B levels under cropping depended both on the individual soil and the amount of B present (i. e., check vs. B applied). The results are in agreement with a small body of literature suggesting the importance of intensity/capacity relationships in the availability of B to plants...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{established}} to evaluate some methods of boron analysis and to select a suitable procedure for both plant and soil samples. Representative soils {{were taken from the}} potentially oron deficient area and used in a greenhouse study. The Carmine method was adapted for the determination of boron in soil and plant samples. The yields of corn and alfalfa were related to the amount of <b>boron</b> <b>fertilizer</b> applied for several soils studied. The level of boron in the whole plant was determined and was correlated with the amount of boron applied and the amount of hot water soluble boron in the soil. The conclusions drawn from this study may be applied only to soils of similar texture and of similar climatological factors. On the selected soils the soil boron level ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 31 ppm HWS boron. The critical level of boron in the alfalfa plant is approximately 15 ppm. The critical level of boron in the corn plant could not be accurately determined because existing soil boron levels seemed to be sufficient to grow and maintain corn for the short growing season used in this study. The level was estimated to be less than 10 ppm B. The hot water soluble boron level in the soil needed for the normal growth of alfalfa may be as high as 0. 30 ppm for certain conditions. The hot water soluble boron level in the soil for the normal growth of corn seems to be less than 0. 20 ppm, but the relative adequacy of boron for corn did not allow a more precise determination. The hot water soluble level of boron in the soil is directly influenced by the amount of boron applied. The texture of the soil affected the proportion of applied boron extractable by the hot water extraction procedure. When equal amounts of boron were applied, sand had a greater amount of measurable boron than loam. The organic matter content of the soil influences the amount of hot water soluble boron. Alfalfa removed more boron than corn, indicating a boron deficiency is likely to occur with alfalfa rather than corn. The levels of hot water soluble boron before and after cropping with two crops of alfalfa did not change greatly, indicating substantial release from chemical form of boron (mineral or organic) not extractable by hot water.

Experiments were conducted on four sites where the soil types were sandy, silty and clayey Inceptisols, and an Ultisol, located in the Zhejiang Province, Southeast China. Application of B fertilizer at rates of 1. 1, 1. 65 and 3. 3 kg B/ha {{in the first year}} showed a different residual effect on oilseed yield in successive years, but had only small positive effects on the rice grain yield at two sites. The residual effect of 1. 1 kg B/ha remained fully effective in correcting B deficiency in oilseed rape for 2 years in the Inceptisols, whereas the residual effect of 1. 65 kg B/ha continued to correct B deficiency for at least 3 years in both the Inceptisols and the Ultisol. Foliar application of B fertilizer generally corrected B deficiency for oilseed rape but showed limited residual effect in the following years after application. The decline in residual values of B from a single fertilizer addition was closely related to the soil and leaf B concentration. Soil available B also decreased dramatically with the advance of rotation, but a larger decrease was found at a depth of 20 – 40 -cm for the Inceptisols and the Ultisol. Thus, a more detailed understanding of the B cycling in the system is now needed to optimize management of B fertilizer...|$|R
40|$|Implication Soil and {{knowledge}} {{are the most}} important resources for agriculture. In order to create new knowhow on managing soils, collaboration between research, advisory services, product development and farmers is necessary. OSMO –project has provided these opportunities in farmer learning groups, workshops and field trials. Based on the first year of results it is clear that soil health is a complex system, where different aspects interact. Many of the problems observed as nutrient deficiencies can be sourced to compaction from machinery or lack of drainage. On the other hand problems in soil nutritional status may be behind compaction and weed problems. The current hypothesis is that each field has its own set of problems. Soil health can be improved only by identifying the crop yield reducing factors, determining their causes and planning for effective ways to remedy them. Simplified decision support tools are needed to couple the complexity of soil systems into the needs of farm management. Identifying and remedying soil problems have a large potential for increasing the productivity of organic and conventional agriculture. Background and objectives Agricultural soils are under increasing pressure. During the last decades crop rotations have simplified, annual crop areas have increased and machinery has gotten heavier. At the same time the progress in crop yields has stagnated. Compared to the yield potential which is theoretically possible from sunlight and water availability, crop yields are very low, especially in organic agriculture. At the same time, variability between farms, fields and field parts is high. It is unclear why some fields have low yields while other adjacent fields have very good yields. The concept of soil health is an emerging paradigm for looking at soil as a system. It appreciates the interconnections between components of soils and different views on problems (i. e. chemical, physical and biological). The objective of the project is to apply new knowledge on soil quality and health and to test their applicability in practice on farms. This is done through improving knowledge on soil testing, farmer know-how on soil health management and developing tools and study materials. Methods for analyzing and repairing soil problems are tested on 8 experimental problem fields, with adjacent good fields serving as the reference. The approach has been problem oriented, analysis methods and tested techniques have been tailored to each problem field. The aim is to identify and fix all barriers to better productivity and soil health and to test how (and if) the approach works. Key results and discussion The project has been running since 2016 and most of the work is still ongoing. Final results for the test farms will be available in 2018. For now, five regional learning groups are running, each with ca. 20 farms. These have included a six month intensive period of soil management education and application of skills to on-farm work. The separate tools for soil management have been assembled into a soil management planning toolbox, which is being refined based on user experience. Several problems have been identified in the test farms and trials have been run to test for potential solutions. Soil structure has been improved through vetch based cover crop mixes and subsoiling. Gypsum applications have been targeted to remedy Ca:Mg ratio problems and manganese, potassium and <b>boron</b> <b>fertilizers</b> have been tested to remedy common nutrient deficiencies. In 2017, new methods for identifying and solving drainage and compaction issues are being tested. The interaction between research and farmers has been valuable. In the intensive six month courses, researchers have applied new scientific information and converted it into calculators for farm use. Receiving rapid feedback on their applicability and being able to redevelop them into tools has provided useful tools for soil management. How work was carried out? The core of the project was five learning groups with ca. 20 farms in each. Each group held regular meetings and online lectures on the main aspects of soil health (chemical, physical and biological). The participants also had access and guidance on using tools for managing soil fertility, compaction, drainage and crop rotations. The participants filled an online soil management plan for their farm during the course and reported on their own trials and tested solutions for managing soil health. In addition several indepth workshops were arranged on special topics. The scientific work focused on the 8 test fields. Their status was quantified through different soil tests (ammonium acetate extraction, Mehlich 3, Soil Health Tool), physical soil evaluation (visual evaluation of soil structure, soil cover, earthworm counts, water infiltration) and plant nutrient analysis...|$|R

40|$|In {{less than}} 50 years Africa {{has changed from}} a food {{exporting}} region to being the largest importer of food worldwide. An increase {{in the use of}} fertilizers could help to rectify this situation but imported fertilizers are expensive to purchase and to transport to remote rural areas. The use of locally-available supplies, on the other hand, would transform the availability and cost of the much-needed plant nutrients. Throughout Africa crop production is constrained by low-fertility soils and even with adequate moisture soil nutrient levels are invariably insufficient for crops to express their full yield potential. Compost and manure can help maintain soil fertility but only by removing nutrients from elsewhere. Nitrogen-fixing plants can add nutrients to the soil, but even they contribute relatively small quantities of nitrogen and should be seen as a complement to fertilizer nitrogen rather than a substitute (see Spore No. 40 'Azolla for rice'). In addition to nitrogen, plants require a range of major and minor nutrients including phosphorus, potash, sulphur, calcium, magnesium, manganese and <b>boron.</b> A <b>fertilizer</b> demonstration programme organized by FAO over a decade ago showed that on traditional African farms nitrogen is almost always the nutrient which most limits crop yield; phosphorus is a close second. Potash deficiencies are more localized, but sulphur deficiency is now widely recognized as being as important as nitrogen and phosphorus in many areas. Several African countries have reserves of oil or natural gas which are sufficient to produce ammonia for nitrogen fertilizers, and some are using them for this purpose. Countries that have excess hydro-electric power can produce ammonia by the electrolytic hydrogen process. However, low rainfall has reduced water levels in major hydro-electric dams and they have had little surplus electricity after meeting the soaring industrial and domestic demand. Fertilizer resources in Africa According to the International Fertilizer Development Center - Africa, there are agromineral deposits throughout West Africa that may have potential as indigenous sources of plant nutrients. IFDC-Africa has launched a programme to start the long and arduous process of identifying these deposits and developing proposals for research projects to examine the agronomic and economic feasibility of using these materials (mainly phosphatic) as sources of nutrients for food production. IFDC-Africa will establish a database on West African deposits of phosphate, sulphur, lime, gypsum and dolomite. Phosphate deposits have been found in 36 African countries: the main producers are Algeria, Côte d'lvoire, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. Of the ACP countries, only Senegal and Zimbabwe produce sufficient phosphate for export. Several countries have indigenous ores which present processing problems, although some of those which prove unsuited to chemical processing might be suited to direct application. Fertilizer production Zambia is one country where locally-available phosphate rocks could, in theory, reduce the need for imported phosphatic fertilizers, the annual requirement for which is over 30, 000 t. A local company, Mining Exploration (MINEX), has carried out tests using acidulation on low grade areas to make Partially Acidulated Phosphate Rock (PAPR), which has been used successfully on maize and soya beans. MINEX has also shown that where residual brown soils, resulting from the weathering of carbonates, are washed the coating of iron oxide is removed and ores of 10 % grade can be enriched to 30 % phosphorus. This technique looks promising but the washing process requires large volumes of water: and water is in short supply in this region. There is virtually no production of potash in Africa although resources are reported to exist in more than ten countries. Solar evaporation of potash brines could provide a possible source in several countries. National options Faced with insufficient foreign exchange and transport difficulties almost all African ACP countries must develop whatever local resources are available for enhancing soil fertility. Preventing soil erosion and avoiding the burning of crop residues will reduce the loss of soil nutrients, and composting crop wastes and integrating nitrogen-fixing crops and trees into farming systems will go some way towards meeting crop requirements. Research is needed into simple, low-cost processing of low-grade rocks into utilizable fertilizers. Where deposits are too small for large-scale commercial exploration, they can still be useful regionally or locally. And where labour-intensive extraction and processing is the only alternative, this {{can be seen as a}} source of employment for rural people in slack seasons. In the final analysis government planning must recognize that the central position of food production in national economies demands that more resources be directed to all activities that can increase food production, including the utilization of all local resources for fertilizer production: oil and natural gas, hydro-electricity and native ore deposits.

An increase in the use of fertilizers could help to rectify this situation but imported fertilizers are expensive to purchase and [...] ...|$|R
