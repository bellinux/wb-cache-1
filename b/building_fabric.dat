5|$|In October 2014, Twitter {{announced}} Fabric, a {{suite of}} mobile developer tools built around Crashlytics. Fabric brought together Crashlytics, Answers (mobile app analytics), Beta (mobile app distribution), Digits (mobile app identity and authentication services), MoPub, and TwitterKit (login with Twitter and Tweet display functionality) into a single, modular SDK, allowing developers {{to pick and choose}} which features they needed while guaranteeing ease of installation and compatibility. By <b>building</b> <b>Fabric</b> on top of Crashlytics, Twitter was {{able to take advantage of}} Crashlytics' large adoption and device footprint to rapidly scale usage of MoPub and TwitterKit. Fabric reached active distribution across 1 billion mobile devices just 8 months after its launch.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} aestheticization of everyday life, {{the architecture of}} museums has taken on special significance since the 1980s. A striking number of exhibition structures have incorporated a vocabulary of postmodern and deconstructivist forms. In and around Basel, new buildings, additions or renovations have been constructed from designs by nationally and internationally renowned architects (Renzo Piano, Zaha Hadid, Frank O. Gehry, Wilfried and Katharina Steib, Herzog & de Meuron, Mario Botta) and celebrated as examples of avant-garde museum architecture. In other area museums, by contrast, the <b>building</b> <b>fabric</b> is old to very old, consisting of former residential and commercial buildings or monasteries and churches that have been converted for exhibition purposes.|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of moisture in <b>building</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{has been of}} interest for many years due to potentially devastating consequences of moisture problems within buildings. A range of potential techniques are available with which to measure the moisture content of <b>building</b> <b>fabrics</b> in situ and this paper focuses on two techniques which offer the potential for some significant advantages over approaches: (1) thermal dual-probe and (2) time domain reflectometry. The two approaches have been tested against measurements of moisture content using a laboratory-based X-ray measurement facility. As {{a result of the}} work that has been undertaken, the authors are very confident that the two measurement techniques are indeed applicable to typical <b>building</b> <b>fabrics...</b>|$|R

25|$|Colonial governments {{accepted}} {{a degree of}} responsibility for pauper patients who were not convicts. However, as convict numbers declined and the emancipated and free population grew, the government disengaged itself from direct responsibility for the 'respectable poor'. Meanwhile, the Sydney Dispensary had been created in 1826 to provide outpatient care for 'free poor persons, unable to pay for medical attendance'. It was conducted on traditional charitable lines and operated from several city premises before obtaining the south wing of the Rum Hospital in 1845 where it remained until 1848. This change in use of the South Wing required more repairs to {{the internal and external}} <b>building</b> <b>fabric</b> from 1843. At the same time, the Sydney Dispensary expanded to serve inpatients and changed its name to the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary, a title officially approved in 1844. Convict inpatients continued to be treated in the separately managed hospital in the centre wing, next door. With the dissolution of the convict hospital system, the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary gave up the south wing in 1848 in return for permissive occupancy of the entire middle section of the Rum Hospital complex.|$|E
500|$|Inside the house, the Palladian form {{reaches a}} height and {{grandeur}} seldom seen {{in any other}} house in England. It has, in fact, been described as [...] "The finest Palladian interior in England." [...] The grandeur of the interior is obtained with an absence of excessive ornament, and reflects Kent's career-long taste for [...] "the eloquence of a plain surface". Work on the interiors ran from 1739 to 1773. The first habitable rooms were in the family wing and were in use from 1740, the Long Library being the first major interior completed in 1741. Among the last to be completed and entirely under Lady Leicester's supervision is the Chapel with its alabaster reredos. The house is entered through the Marble Hall (though the chief <b>building</b> <b>fabric</b> is in fact pink Derbyshire alabaster), modelled by Kent on a Roman basilica. The room is over 50feet (15m) {{from floor to ceiling}} and is dominated by the broad white marble flight of steps leading to the surrounding gallery, or peristyle: here alabaster Ionic columns support the coffered, gilded ceiling, copied from a design by Inigo Jones, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The fluted columns are thought to be replicas of those in the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, also in Rome. Around the hall are statues in niches; these are predominantly plaster copies of classical deities.|$|E

The Conservation Plan outlines a three-phase program. Phase 1 focused on the salvage and restoration of Southampton Homestead and adjacent Bakery Cottage. This work was largely complete by 2002. The homestead is typical of mid-19th century constructions and no early restoration work {{appears to have been}} attempted.

2500|$|Many of the {{buildings}} in the Old Nichol contravened the Building Acts. Builders leasing land from owners who did not care what use {{was made of the}} acreage, so long as it was profitable, created an instant slum. The use of cheaper lime-based substances derived from the by-products of soap-making at local factories was {{the most important factor in}} the swift deterioration of the <b>building</b> <b>fabric</b> in the Old Nichol. Speculative builders used this cement, which was known as [...] "Billysweet", instead of traditional lime mortar, and it quickly became infamous for never thoroughly drying out, leading to sagging and unstable walls. Other architectural features that contributed to urban decay in the Old Nichol included the lack of foundation of most early 19th-century houses, which were built with floorboards laid on bare earth, cheap timber and half-baked bricks of ash-adulterated clay. The roofs were badly pitched, leading to rotting rafters and blooming plasterwork. The houses were permanently soggy, as damp from the roof and the earth seeped through {{the buildings}}. By 1836 the whole [...] of land which would form the Old Nichol had been built or rebuilt upon.|$|E

50|$|The thermal {{admittance}} of a material, {{such as a}} <b>building</b> <b>fabric,</b> is {{a measure}} of the ability of a material to transfer heat in the presence of a temperature difference on opposite sides of the material. Thermal admittance is measured in the same units as a heat transfer coefficient, power (watts) per unit area (square meters) per temperature change (kelvins). Thermal admittance of a <b>building</b> <b>fabric</b> affects a building's thermal response to variation in outside temperature.|$|E
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the use of}} an electromagnetic wave sensor to determine moisture content within <b>building</b> <b>fabrics.</b> <b>Building</b> materials that require a special mixing ratio such as concrete, mortar and membrane layers will be subject to significant effects when exposed to unpredictable weather changes owing to the excess of the acceptable moisture content. The acceptable moisture content level varies with various <b>building</b> <b>fabrics</b> and exceeding this level will affect the overall performance of building constructions. The project proposes using a novel electromagnetic (EM) sensor to monitor, in a non-destructive manner, the signal reflected from building structures in real time to determine exceeded moisture content level. This project involves the design and construction of an EM sensor operating at two frequency ranges: 2 GHz to 6 GHz and 6 GHz to 12 GHz at a power of 0 dBm. This research is a new approach for monitoring moisture in buildings which has not been investigated before. The simulation software High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) was used to model the microwave sensor. The pyramidal horn antenna was chosen as the preferred antenna for this work owing to higher gain, directivity and overall performance. Different building materials and structures have been made in a laboratory environment to determine the levels of moisture content, as well as to determine the modes of <b>building</b> <b>fabrics</b> failures owing to membrane failure, a pipe burst and ground source. Finally, a graphical user interface was developed and used to control the sensor parameters as well as frequency sweep, to capture the data from the sensor. Based on the findings of this project, the EM wave sensor could be used to determine the moisture content of <b>building</b> <b>fabrics</b> in a non-destructive manner...|$|R
