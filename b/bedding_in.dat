5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or <b>bedding</b> <b>in</b> which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E
5|$|The Thorne Moors Improvement Company {{was set up}} in 1848, {{authorised}} by the Thorne Moor Drainage and Improvement Act. They {{were charged}} with improving parts of the bog. Their activities increased in the 1880s, when they began to lease areas to companies who extracted the peat commercially for use as animal <b>bedding.</b> <b>In</b> order to do this, ditches had to be cut {{to begin the process of}} drainage. As the extent of the workings increased, a Dutch company cut canals in the peat. Horses pulled barges from canal paths alongside in order to remove the peat from the moors. Subsequently, a network of small railways were constructed along the canals to transport the peat.|$|E
25|$|Long kept as pets in {{addition}} to being shown, Booted Bantams are usually friendly and calm. They are good foragers, and are said to do less damage to garden plants because of their heavily feathered feet. However, most breeders keep their Booted Bantams confined and on soft <b>bedding</b> <b>in</b> order to maintain these feathers. Hens readily go broody, and lay very small eggs that are white or tinted in color. Their egg production is respectable for bantams, especially in summer.|$|E

25|$|Domesticated {{horses are}} also subject to {{inconsistent}} movement between stabling and work; they must carry or pull additional weight, and in modern times, {{they are often}} kept and worked on very soft footing, such as irrigated land, arena footing, or stall <b>bedding.</b> <b>In</b> some cases, management is also inadequate. The hooves of horses that are kept in stalls or small turnouts, even when cleaned adequately, are exposed to more moisture than would be encountered in the wild, {{as well as to}} ammonia from urine. The hoof capsule is mostly made from keratin, a protein, and is weakened by this exposure, becoming even more fragile and soft. Shoes do not prevent or reduce damage from moisture and ammonia exposure. Rather, they protect already weakened hooves. Further, without the natural conditioning factors present in the wild, the feet of horses grow overly large and long unless trimmed regularly. Hence, protection from rocks, pebbles, and hard, uneven surfaces is lacking. A balanced diet with proper nutrition also is a factor. Without these precautions, cracks in overgrown and overly brittle hoof walls are a danger, as is bruising of the soft tissues within the foot because of inadequately thick and hard sole material.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes, straw or chaff is fed to animals. However, this is {{roughage}} {{with little}} nutritional value other than providing fiber. [...] It is sometimes {{used as a}} filler; it can slow down horses who eat their grain too fast, or it can provide additional fiber when the horse must meet most nutritional needs via concentrated feeds. Straw is more often used as a <b>bedding</b> <b>in</b> stalls to absorb wastes.|$|E

2500|$|Even higher {{pressures}} and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and metamorphism of the rocks. This metamorphism causes {{changes in the}} mineral composition of the rocks; creates a foliation, or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress.

60|$|B. And then, {{even if we}} {{know what}} the quarry bedding is, how are we to keep it always in our building? You may lay the stones of a wall {{carefully}} level, but how will you lay those of an arch? You think these, perhaps, trivial, or merely curious questions. So far from it, the fact that while the <b>bedding</b> <b>in</b> Normandy is level, that at Carrara is steep, and that the forces which raised the beds of Carrara crystallized them also, so that the cleavage which is all-important in the stones of my garden wall is of none in the duomo of Pisa,--simply determined the possibility of the existence of Pisan sculpture at all, and regulated the whole life and genius of Nicholas the Pisan and of Christian art. And, again, {{the fact that you can}} put stones in true <b>bedding</b> <b>in</b> a wall, but cannot in an arch, determines the structural transition from classical to Gothic architecture.|$|E

6000|$|Look at {{any piece}} of slate. All know that slate splits or cleaves freely, in one {{direction}} only, into flat layers. Now any one would suppose at first sight, and fairly enough, that the flat surface--the [...] "plane of cleavage"--was also the plane of <b>bedding.</b> <b>In</b> simpler English we should say--The mud which has hardened into the slate was laid down horizontally; and therefore each slate {{is one of the}} little horizontal beds of it, perhaps just what was laid down in a single tide. We should have a right to do so, because that would be true of most sedimentary rocks. But it would not be true of slate. The plane of <b>bedding</b> <b>in</b> slate {{has nothing to do with}} the plane of cleavage. Or, more plainly, the mud of which the slate is made may have been deposited at the sea-bottom at any angle to the plane of cleavage. We may sometimes see the lines of the true bedding--the lines which were actually horizontal when the mud was laid down--in bits of slate, and find them sometimes perpendicular to, sometimes inclined to, and sometimes again coinciding with the plane of cleavage, which they have evidently acquired long after.|$|E

60|$|Now here is {{a little}} church in Lucca, of which {{the lower half of}} the façade is of the twelfth century, and the top, built by the Florentines, in the thirteenth, and sealed for their own by two fleur- de-lys, let into its masonry. The most {{important}} difference, marking the date, is in the sculpture of the heads which carry the archivolts. But the most palpable difference is in the Cyclopean simplicity of irregular <b>bedding</b> <b>in</b> the lower story; and the delicate bands of alternate serpentine and marble, which follow the horizontal or couchant placing of the stones above.|$|E
60|$|From his {{impressions}} of the berries, the cream, the toast, and the tea, {{as well as the}} steak, he decided that on the gastronomic side there could be no question but the Durgins knew how to keep a hotel; and his further acquaintance with the house and its appointments confirmed him in his belief. All was very simple, but sufficient; and no guest could have truthfully claimed that he was stinted in towels, in water, in lamp-light, in the quantity or quality of <b>bedding,</b> <b>in</b> hooks for clothes, or wardrobe or bureau room.

After loading there was a long delay before the horses were brought, these having been unharnessed during the ridding; but at length, about two o'clock, the whole was under way, the cooking-pot swinging from the axle of the waggon, Mrs Durbeyfield and family at the top, the matron having in her lap, to prevent injury to its works, the head of the clock, which, at any exceptional lurch of the waggon, struck one, or one-and-a-half, in hurt tones.
