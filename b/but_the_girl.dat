5|$|American trumpeter Chet Baker {{recorded}} the tune in 1987 for the documentary Let's Get Lost (1989) {{and it was}} released on the soundtrack album. He also covered it in concert on June 14, 1987, in Tokyo, creating an extended version totaling seven minutes and fifty-three seconds. After his death in 1988, it was released on his posthumous album Chet Baker in Tokyo (1988). At a 1998 benefit concert for the Walden Woods Project in Concord, Massachusetts, ska musician Gwen Stefani sang it alongside a jazz orchestra. It was later included on the accompanying promotional CD for AT customers, titled Stormy Weather (1998). Other renditions were made by Kate Dimbleby and Jimmy Scott for their 1998 albums, Good Vibrations and Holding Back the Years, respectively. The Reputation featured it on their eponymous debut album in 2002, followed with covers performed by Everything <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Girl</b> and Alison Moyet in 2003 and 2004, respectively.|$|E

25|$|This {{sophisticated}} form of hazing {{was played}} out {{each year in}} September. This elaborate hoax often gained the cooperation of faculty members {{and people in the}} town. During Freshman Week, the first-year students were informed about several student romances on campus through planned gossip. The story went that there was one ardent couple who were constantly together when not in class, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> had another upperclassman admirer. The couple argued over the love triangle and it ended in the girl walking off with her new boy. After that, there were public acts that involved the two boys fighting. The affair was all anyone would talk about. Then on a certain pre-arranged night, all freshmen were ordered to stay in their rooms by student governing bodies. At 10 pm, a drunk ex-boyfriend appeared at the men's dorm. He brandished a gun and staggered through the halls in search of his rival. He finally found him in one of the public archways of the building. Soon, several shots rang out and the victim fell to the floor with blood (ketchup) flowing from his mouth. Other upperclassmen took charge, sending confused and panicked freshmen in pursuit of the killer or for a doctor. A town physician would appear and call for an ambulance, only adding to the theatrics of the evening. Most other freshmen were rounded up and sent in groups to nearby hospitals to offer their blood for transfusion, but were left stranded. At the same time, the freshmen girls witnessed the girl in the triangle see the unconscious victim being taken away and go into a fit of hysterics. During the 1930s, a member of the staff was a Justice of the Peace. He presided over a fake hearing in a large classroom where freshman girls tearfully testified to what they thought they saw happen on campus that night. It was during that hearing that the truth was revealed when the three main actors walked into the room, arm in arm. The next day, the freshmen felt young and foolish, but were looking forward to the next year when they were able to play the same prank on new freshmen. The tradition died in 1946, when its last performance narrowly escaped tragedy when some ex-servicemen studying at LVC under the G.I. Bill threatened {{to take care of the}} villain causing trouble between the lovers.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{from both}} Rolling Stone and Blender made strong {{comparisons}} between Long Distance and the English musical duo Everything <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Girl.</b> The former stated that [...] "any fan of Everything <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Girl,</b> Saint Etienne or vintage Blondie should find plenty to swoon over", {{while the latter}} called the sound [...] "cloudy and distant, [...] takes tentative steps toward Everything but the Girl". In a more mixed review, a critic from SonicNet stated that [...] "Ivy specialize in nebulously oriented dream-pop: too ethereal for straight pop fans, too structured for the 4AD crowd." [...] In a divided review, Michaelangelo Matos of City Pages noted that he preferred Ivy's previous releases, but stated, [...] "If your band had spent four years getting dropped and picked up and dropped again by record labels, you'd sound tired too." [...] Similarly, a reviewer from Alternative Press was negative, expressing that [...] "the 13 tracks here are improbably edgeless, all love-me-do/love-me-don't plaints that evaporate on impact".|$|E

She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: [...] "You?" [...] The Tramp nods with an {{uncertain}} smile and asks, [...] "You can see now?" [...] The girl replies, [...] "Yes, I can see now" [...] and tearfully pulls his hand to her bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.|$|E

500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost, but a {{surviving}} synopsis {{of the film}} {{was published in the}} The Moving Picture World on June 11, 1910. It states: [...] "Turner, a man of bad character, conducts an inn in the country. His stepdaughter Grace is his trudge. When on an errand to the village she meets Jack, wealthy young man. He is much attracted by her. Jack goes to the bank and draws a large sum of money. Hank, a pal of Turner, sees him and tries to ambush him on the road, but fails. Then he goes ahead to tell Turner. Jack, on his trip, meets Grace. Nearly exhausted, he takes her home, and thus seems to play directly {{into the hands of the}} villains. They steal his revolver, and would drug him, were it not for the fact that Grace writes a warning on the wall with wine. Jack, aided by Grace, escapes <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> is wounded. Jack marries Grace." ...|$|E
500|$|Dawson {{described}} the prosthetics for the Klingon version of Torres as [...] "a forehead, nose, and teeth". She {{felt that the}} look was not as sophisticated as the character's normal appearance as a half-human/half-Klingon {{because of the lack}} of skin tones and nuances of the facial features. While Dawson's make-up typically took two hours to apply, the full Klingon prosthetics took around three hours. To save time reapplying the make-up and prosthetics repeatedly, each day's shooting would concentrate on one of the two characters, and switch the following day. Dawson compared the experience to repertory theatre. Despite the casting of the photo double, and attention to scheduling, Kolbe expressed disappointment in not being able to shoot more scenes with the two versions of Torres in the cave, but understood the frequent use of the split screen could negatively impact the production cost. After the episode had aired, Dawson called her parents to ask their opinions. They replied: [...] "ou were good, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> that played that Klingon was really great!" [...] Dawson took their remarks as a compliment.|$|E
500|$|O'Brien {{wrote that}} [...] "'Bedtime Story' was a vivid track that foreshadowed Madonna's move towards electronica". Author Victor Amaro Vicente {{wrote in his}} book, The Aesthetics of Motion in Musics for the Mevlana Celal Ed-Din Rumi, that the song's [...] "complex rhythmic texture" [...] made it a [...] "dance hall {{favorite}} in the mid-1990s". Rikky Rooksbywrote in The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, that the track {{was similar to the}} music of English alternative band Everything <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Girl,</b> and claimed that [...] "in contrast to most other songs of the album, this is one track that could have been longer and more trippy than it is". Writing for Idolator, Bianca Gracie calle d"Bedtime Story" [...] the highlight of the album, adding that [...] "It sucks you in with its quivering drum patterns taken directly from trance music, which creates an ethereal ambiance". Gracie commended the influence of UK dance music and Madonna's provocative vocals, finding the song to be a direct inspiration for singer Britney Spears' [...] "Breathe on Me", from her fourth studio album In the Zone (2003).|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Happiness" [...] starts at {{a train station}} (Roma Street railway station in Brisbane) with a boy and girl {{stepping}} off a train. As the pair leave the train, the boy turns and tries to reach for something, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> pulls him back. It is shown that he was reaching for a [...] slinky. The slinky leaves the train, and passes Middleton busking in the train station. The slinky ventures to find the boy, facing a range of challenges along the way; these include avoiding fruit falling on it and riding a skateboard. In {{the middle of the}} music clip, the slinky is shown making its way through a music room in which Powderfinger are performing [...] "My Happiness". It rests on the bar and the band finishes playing, while the background music continues. As Powderfinger leaves, the slinky is picked up by Haug. He gets into a car and places the slinky on the car's dashboard, but it falls out the window as the car turns a tight corner. It lands outside the gate of a house and is picked up and brought inside to the boy.|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World {{synopsis}} states, [...] "State Senator Jack Dare, one of {{the reform}} members of the legislature, starts to the state capitol to attend an important session of that body. That he took the midnight train from his home city is clearly proven, for his aged mother was a passenger on it, and besides the conductor and porter are certain that he retired for the night. In the morning, however, his berth is empty, although some of his garments are found there. The case puzzles the railroad officials and the police, and Violet Gray is {{given a chance to}} distinguish herself. She learns from the conductor and porter, who had happened to spend the night awake at opposite ends of the car, that the senator did not go by them. Consequently this leaves only the window as his means of egress, and she knows that he must have gone that way. Violet discovers that Dare is a hearty supporter of a bill that a powerful lobby is trying to defeat. The fight is so close that his is the deciding vote. Dare cannot be bribed, so his opponents spirited him away in a novel fashion. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> finds where he is hidden and brings him back, although he is much injured. He reaches his seat in time to cast the needed vote, and to astound and defeat the lobby." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Bioscope from December 22, 1910. It states: [...] "Max, an old musician, {{finds it hard to}} support his two motherless daughters, one of whom is blind, and the professor takes great pride in his daughter's musical education. The little one sings and the blind girl plays upon the violin. But sickness and death overtake the professor, and the orphans find themselves penniless and homeless. They are compelled to sing in the streets, and thus eke out a precarious livelihood. While walking through a fashionable street one day Marie sees the sign of the famous doctor. She calls her blind sister's attention to it, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> has no hope that the doctor will see penniless patients. Marie returns {{in time to see the}} doctor alight from his carriage, but the servant refuses to allow the ragged little girl to follow him. Marie conceives the idea of hiding in the doctor's carriage, and when he sets out on his rounds he discovers the terrified little girl. She pleads with him not to be angry, and tells of her sister's affliction. The doctor goes with her to see Violet, and has the stricken girl taken to a hospital, where he operates successfully upon her eyes. Mr. Grey brings Violet to the attention of some charitable women, who see that she does not lack professional engagements. While returning from one of her recitals, Dr. Grey offers to drive her home, and proposes to Violet, and is accepted. Marie is awakened by the sound of a kiss, and is told that she is to have a big brother." ...|$|E
