In the real world, there is sometimes a need to control a population at a reasonable level because otherwise this population may cause decrease or even extinction of other populations. With respect to the control of a biological system, the focus at present is on the state feedback control [23, 24] by changing {{the structure of the}} <b>biocenose</b> and by increasing the feeding pressure of the prey.

40|$|Since the {{extensive}} research during the 70 s, sequencing batch reactors (SBR) {{have become a}} quite common modification of activated sludge process. Additionally, the SBR can be combined with biofilm growth {{on the surface of}} a support material originating the Sequencing Batch Biofilm Reactors (SBBR). While several comparative studies between the two systems were done in terms of organic carbon and nutrients removal efficiency, a detailed comparison of their biocenoses is not documented in the literature. The present work aims to compare the biocenoses from SBR and SBBR. In order to reach this objective four reactors were operated in parallel. One reactor was operated just with suspended biomass (SBR 1) while the others combined suspended biomass with biofilm cultivation. The biofilm was formed on a new type of polyethylene support developed by University of Minho, called DupUM. The bed formed by these supports occupied 5 % (SBBR 2), 10 % (SBBR 3) and 20 % (SBBR 4) of the reactor volume. Microscopic inspection revealed that the quality of biocenoses from reactors started to differ very soon after the inoculation. The <b>biocenose</b> of SBR 1 and SBBR 2 was dominated by filamentous microorganisms, while in SBBR 3 and SBBR 4 the communities were clearly more complex.

Among the species, Balanus improvises and Mytilaster lineatus were the dominant, with relative abundance of 98. 69 and 94. 45 % in summer and winter respectively.

Incomplete {{knowledge of the}} ecological features of this marine diatom complicates its cultivation. More specifically, the ecology of bacteria surrounding H. ostrearia in ponds is what remains unknown. The structure of this bacterial community was previously analyzed by means of PCR-TTGE before and after isolating H. ostrearia cells recovered from 4 localities in order to distinguish the relative parts of the biotope and <b>biocenose</b> and to describe the temporal dynamics of the bacterial community structure at two time scales (2 weeks vs. 9 months). The bacterial structure of the phycosphere differed strongly from that of bulk sediment. The level of similarity between bacteria recovered from the biofilm and suspended bacteria did not exceed 10 %. On the other hand, similarities among the bacterial community structures in biofilms were above 90 % regardless of the geographic origin of the algal isolates, while the percentages were lower for suspended bacteria. The differences in bacterial structures of two H. ostrearia isolates (HO-R and HO-BM) resulted in specific metabolomic profiles. The nontargeted metabolomic investigation revealed more distinct profiles {{in the case of}} this bacteria-alga association than for the H. ostrearia monoculture. At the culture cycle scale under laboratory conditions, the bacterial community depended on the growth stage. When H. ostrearia was subcultured for 9 months, a shift in the bacterial structure was observed as of 3 months, with the bacterial structure stabilizing afterwards (70 %– 86 % similarities), in spite of the size reduction of the H. ostrearia frustule.
