5|$|In January 1915 Maunsell {{received}} {{authority to}} build six examples, but, {{as with the}} Nclass, production was delayed due {{to the use of}} the Ashford works for wartime armaments manufacture. Assembly began in 1917 and the first, No.790, emerged in July of that year. It was based at <b>Bricklayers</b> Arms depot, preceding the earlier Nclass design into service by one month. Further construction was deferred until after Ashford had caught up with the maintenance backlog caused by the war.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} built from bricks, with stone {{used for the}} detailing, such as doorways. The brickwork was decorated with patterns of darker bricks, called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as a jug and a ship. This style of decorative brickwork and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John Cowper, the master mason on the project, had been an apprentice. Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the brickwork at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the <b>bricklayers</b> cutting and shaping the kiln-fired bricks to produce spiral and domed vaulting.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} concerns vocabulary {{assessment for}} second language learners. Current assessment techniques generally focus either on breadth measures to estimate vocabulary size, or depth measures {{to see how}} well learners know a few words. A third type of assessment is the checkbox test, which allows learners to self-assess a large number of words; however, the checkbox test is insensitive to partial knowledge and shortcomings with respect to its reliability of results have been identified. A new paradigm is presented and operationalized in the computer program <b>Bricklayer.</b> <b>Bricklayer</b> allows learners to self-assess large numbers of words in a game rather than test format. It validates responses by presenting random quizzes for some of the words. Furthermore, the learners rank word knowledge, providing a mechanism for capturing partial knowledge. In a research study carried out with <b>Bricklayer,</b> 28 intermediate ESL learners were assessed on 72 words. A validity argument established a chain of reasoning to validate the tool. Two post-tests collected evidence for concurrent validity. A standard multiple-choice test for one set of 36 words determined that <b>Bricklayer</b> predicted 61 % of known words and 69 % of unknown words; results were better for words which were strongly predicted to be known or unknown. A semantic distance test captured incremental knowledge for the other set of 36 words. <b>Bricklayer</b> was sensitive to partial knowledge although its predictive power was weak. <b>Bricklayer’s</b> reliability investigation found 12. 5 % of the words exhibited poor fit to the predictive model, although there were too few such words to determine a cause. <b>Bricklayer’s</b> performance was found to be comparable to that of the checkbox test. These findings suggest that <b>Bricklayer’s</b> assessment paradigm is a way to build up models of students’ knowledge and behaviour in computer assisted learning environments. <b>Bricklayer</b> provides a first pass in identifying known and unknown words; the remaining words are good candidates for additional assessment or instruction. Several improvements to <b>Bricklayer’s</b> idiosyncrasies were noted. Most importantly, <b>Bricklayer’s</b> scoring represents seven levels of knowledge for each word, although such distinctions of knowledge were not captured. Also, <b>Bricklayer’s</b> forced-choice activity led to results which were highly context-dependent...|$|R
5|$|Sandgate was {{intended}} to defend a vulnerable point along the Kent cliffs, just west of Folkestone, where an enemy force could potentially land and make their way easily further inland. Sandgate's construction was supervised by the Moravian engineer Stefan von Haschenperg, and Thomas Cockys and Richard Keys acted as commissioners for the project. In {{the initial stages of}} the work in 1539, a team of 237 men were employed, with masons, quarrymen, limeburners and wood fellers preparing the site; the masons were drawn {{from as far away as}} Somerset and Gloucestershire. By the summer, over 500 were at work, including labourers, <b>bricklayers,</b> carpenters and sawyers. After a pause during the winter months, work picked up again in the summer of the next year, with 630 working on the castle that July.|$|E
5|$|From {{the opening}} of the line, {{passenger}} stock consisted of 4-wheel carriages. In 1845, there were eight passenger trains a day from Tunbridge Wells to London, with half that number on Sundays. On 23June 1849, the Royal Train took Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to Tunbridge Wells to visit Queen Adelaide, the Queen Dowager. The train, consisting of the Royal Saloon, two first class carriages and a brake van made the journey from <b>Bricklayers</b> Arms to Tunbridge Wells in 75 minutes. It was driven by James Cudworth, the Locomotive Superintendent of the SER. The return journey took 70 minutes. The Royal Train visited the line again on 18December 1849 conveying Queen Victoria and Princess Alice from Windsor, Berkshire to Tunbridge Wells on a visit to Princess Louise. The journey via Waterloo took 100 minutes. The train was driven by William Jacomb, Resident Engineer of the LSWR, and Edgar Verringer, Superintendent of the LSWR. At Waterloo, driving of the train was taken over by John Shaw, General Manager of the SER and Mr. Cockburn, Superintendent of the SER. The return journey took 105 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the Surrey Canal in 1811 changed the {{character}} of the road from rural to industrial. Tanneries were established along it and a soap processing plant was built. Older properties occupied by the upper and middle classes were converted into flats for the emerging working class population. By the time <b>Bricklayers</b> Arms goods station opened in 1845, the road was entirely built up and Old Kent Road had one of the highest population densities in Europe, with an average of 280 residents per acre. Sections along the road were commercial with various market stalls and sellers until the construction of the tramway in 1871. Camberwell Public Library No.1, which later became the Livesey Museum for Children was designed by Sir George Livesey in 1890. The road's southern section remained residential throughout the 19th century. Nos.864, 866 and 880–884 were constructed by John Lamb in 1815, and feature Ammonite capitals, ornamental features resembling fossils, a feature also used in contemporary architecture in Brighton.|$|E

25|$|The {{increasing}} congestion of {{the lines}} approaching London Bridge and dissatisfaction with the high tolls charged by the L caused the SER and the L {{to build a new}} terminus at <b>Bricklayers</b> Arms. This opened in 1844, transferring most of their services, and reducing their fares accordingly. This reduction in toll revenues brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy. Prior to the opening of <b>Bricklayers</b> Arms it had approached the SER with a suggestion that they should either buy or lease the L The SER took some time to respond, and in the meanwhile the company received a similar offer from the L and also negotiated reduced tolls with the L. Eventually the SER agreed to lease the L from 1 January 1845.|$|E

25|$|The University {{took action}} by {{selecting}} a new design by Willoughby J. Edbrooke, who drew the new plans by May 10. Architect Edbrooke, Brother Charles Borromeo (Patrick) Harding, C.S.C, and mathematics professor William Ivers marked off {{the dimensions of}} the construction {{on the day of the}} groundbreaking ceremony, May 17, and the first stone for the foundation was laid on the 19th. Railcars full of bricks arrived continuously to town and were brought to campus in a steady stream of wagons. By May 31, twenty-six stonemasons and <b>bricklayers</b> were working with their support crews on the walls of the new building. The construction required about 300 veteran tradesmen, including 156 skilled stonemasons and <b>bricklayers.</b> This exceeded the number of experienced workers in the South Bend area, and was also scarce in Chicago because of the rebuilding effort due to the great fire in October 1871. Hence, skilled workmen were brought into South Bend from great distances.|$|E
25|$|The Flemish {{house was}} built, in 1890, on the {{initiative}} of Pierre Dutrie, in the Gothic Revival style, because of his love {{of the city of}} Bruges where he had two friends. He employed the Bruges architect Stephen Timmery, who was known for restoring the monuments of Bruges, to draw the plans and manage the building of the house. All the craftsmen working for the building: <b>bricklayers,</b> stonemasons, carpenters came from this Belgian city.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Knights of Labor {{were growing}} tremendously in the 1884-85 period. A series of {{successful}} strikes swept the country, affecting textile workers, plumbers, <b>bricklayers,</b> stove molders, stonecutters, carpet weavers, shoemakers, glass molders and coal miners. The Knights struck the Union Pacific Railway, forcing {{the company to}} rescind a 10 percent wage cut in 1884 and another 10 percent wage reduction the company tried to introduce the following year. In July 1885, the Knights had 104,000 members; by July 1886, they had 703,000 members.|$|E

25|$|Montferrand's first {{decision}} {{was to use}} a slab foundation, rather than a perimeter of piles. The foundation work took five years. It {{took more than a}} decade to obtain the 48 granite columns for the main portico. Columns were roughly cut in Fredrikshamn, delivered by barge, and finished on site one by one, using a gigantic lathe of Montferrand's own design. The columns were raised in 1828–1830; polishing took four more years. In the same time, <b>bricklayers</b> completed the main walls and vaulted ceilings.|$|E
25|$|The main London goods depot was at 'Willow Walk', {{part of the}} <b>Bricklayers</b> Arms complex, {{where the}} LB {{established}} its facilities in 1849. These were enlarged in 1854 after it entered into {{an agreement with the}} LC to handle its goods traffic. Further extensions were built in 1865 and 1902. The LB constructed a marshalling yard to the south of Norwood Junction during the 1870s, extended in the early 1880s. Other goods facilities in London were at Battersea and Deptford Wharf. There was a separate goods station at Brighton, adjacent to the passenger station.|$|E
25|$|Because of San Francisco's {{relative}} isolation, {{skilled workers}} could make demands that their counterparts on the East Coast could not. Printers first attempted to organize in 1850, teamsters, draymen, lightermen, riggers and stevedores in 1851, bakers and <b>bricklayers</b> in 1852, caulkers, carpenters, plasterers, brickmasons, blacksmiths and shipwrights in 1853 and musicians in 1856. Although these efforts required several starts to become stabilized, they did earn better pay {{and working conditions}} and began the long efforts of state labor legislation. Between 1850 and 1870, legislation made provisions for payment of wages, the mechanic's lien and the eight-hour workday.|$|E

25|$|Cholesbury {{stands at}} the {{crossroads}} of several droving routes, the Commons providing a safe place to rest their animals. In turn this regular traffic supported local trades and several alehouses over the years. By 1753 The Castle, the Maidenhead (later the <b>Bricklayers</b> Arms), next door to it the Queen's Head and The Slip Inn were operating for at least a period. They were able to flourish due to the boost in trade between the 18th and {{the early part of the}} 20th centuries when they were also frequented by the growing numbers of brickyard and agricultural labourers. None of these public houses has survived to the present day.|$|E
25|$|Richards met Jagger {{on a train}} as Jagger {{was heading}} for classes at the London School of Economics. The {{mail-order}} rhythm & blues albums from Chess Records by Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters that Jagger was carrying revealed a mutual interest {{and led to a}} renewal of their friendship. Along with mutual friend Dick Taylor, Jagger was singing in an amateur band: Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys, which Richards soon joined. The Blues Boys folded when Brian Jones, after sharing thoughts on their joint interest in the blues music, invited Mick and Keith to the <b>Bricklayers</b> Arms pub, where they then met Ian Stewart.|$|E
25|$|The {{companies}} {{south of}} the Thames received the cross-London traffic at places such as Battersea Wharf and Norwood Junction on the LB, Herne Hill on the LC and <b>Bricklayers</b> Arms on the SER. Traffic from GNR to L used the Widened Lines to Clapham Junction or Brentford, or the North London and North & South Western Junction Railways, according to destination, but for traffic from MR to L the route via Acton Wells Junction and the North & South Western Junction Railway was more convenient, especially after the marshalling was done at Brent Sidings. The extensive marshalling yard at Hither Green SER was opened in 1899, while a new yard opened at Feltham on the L in 1917-21 largely replaced that company's existing yards.|$|E
