5|$|After {{her parents}} {{divorced}} {{when she was}} approximately four years old, Laurer had three different stepfathers and one stepmother. According to Laurer, her first stepfather threatened suicide at one point, and her biological father, who once accidentally stabbed her mother in the thigh with a <b>bread</b> <b>knife,</b> {{had a problem with}} alcoholism. From 1973 to 1983, she, her siblings and her mother moved several times.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{was moved}} to Maindiff Court Hospital on 26 June 1942, where he {{remained}} {{for the next three}} years. The facility was chosen for its added security and the need for fewer guards. Hess was allowed walks on the grounds and car trips into the surrounding countryside. He had access to newspapers and other reading materials; he wrote letters and journals. His mental health remained under the care of Dr Rees. Hess continued to complain on and off of memory loss and made a second suicide attempt on 4 February 1945, when he stabbed himself with a <b>bread</b> <b>knife.</b> The wound was not serious, requiring two stitches. Despondent that Germany was losing the war, he took no food for the next week, only resuming eating when he was threatened with being force-fed.|$|E
25|$|Together with Agatha, {{he begins}} investigating. They {{discover}} a viscous substance {{left behind by}} the killer that the Doctor identifies as morphic residue. He concludes that the murderer is an alien in human form. The Doctor and Agatha question the guests while Donna searches the bedrooms for clues. While searching, Donna hears a strange buzzing noise. Opening the curtains, she sees, instead of a harmless, trapped bee like she expected, there is a ridiculously gigantic wasp outside. It smashes through the window and attacks Donna, but she fights back with light from a magnifying glass and it embeds its sting in the door but escapes through the window before the Doctor and Agatha arrive. The Doctor examines the wasp's sting embedded in the door, and collects a honey like-substance from the sting. The alien kills the housekeeper, Miss Chandrakala, by crushing her with a gargoyle, and the Doctor, Donna, and Agatha chase it but it returns to human form before they catch it. When they regroup in the study, the Doctor deduces that the creature is a Vespiform, an extraterrestrial wasp species that lives in the Silfrax Galaxy. Suddenly, the Doctor is poisoned with cyanide in lemonade laced with bitter almonds. His Time Lord physiology allows him to detoxify, with Donna's help. The poisoning inspires him to add pepper to the dinner meal, since the piperine in it would act as an insecticide. As they eat, the guests hear the wasp but the lights in the room are blown out before the alien's identity is revealed. When the lights are restored, they discover that Lady Eddison's necklace has been stolen and that her son Roger has been stabbed in the back with a <b>bread</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bread</b> <b>knives</b> {{are used}} for cutting bread and are one of many kitchen knives used by chefs. The {{serrated}} blades of <b>bread</b> <b>knives</b> are able to cut soft bread without crushing it.|$|R

2500|$|In 2002, {{the school}} {{was at the center}} of a {{national}} zero tolerance debate when an honor student was expelled for having a non-serrated <b>bread</b> <b>knife</b> in his truck-bed. A combination of federal, state, and school district rules led the Texas Education Agency to advise that the student must be expelled for one year. The superintendent then reduced the expulsion to [...] "time served".|$|E
2500|$|A knife (plural knives) {{is a tool}} with {{a cutting}} edge or blade, {{hand-held}} or otherwise, with most having a handle. [...] Some types of knives are used as utensils, including knives used at the dining table (e.g., butter knives and steak knives) and knives used in the kitchen (e.g., paring knife, <b>bread</b> <b>knife,</b> cleaver). Many types of knives are used as tools, such as the combat knife carried by soldiers, the pocket knife carried by hikers and the hunting knife used by hunters. Knives are also used as a traditional or religious implement, such as the kirpan. Some types of knives are used as weapons, such as daggers or switchblades. Some types of knives are used as sports equipment (e.g., throwing knives). Knives are also used in agriculture, food harvesting etc.; the sickle, the scythe and even the combine harvester are knives.|$|E
60|$|He {{closed the}} lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on a <b>bread</b> <b>knife</b> which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bread</b> <b>knives</b> {{are usually}} between 15 cm and 25 cm (6 and 10 inches). An offset {{serrated}} knife uses an offset handle {{to ensure the}} cook's knuckles will not touch the cutting surface when the blade has cut all {{of the way through}} the food.|$|R
50|$|Serrations are not {{required}} to cut tomatoes - a sharp straight blade works - but the serrations allow the knife to cut tomatoes and other foods even when dull. The reason for this being most of the cutting takes place in the serrations themselves. Some knives have serrations on both sides allowing easy slicing for both left-handed and right-handed users. <b>Bread</b> <b>knives</b> and steak knives are similarly serrated.|$|R

For twenty-seven hours I had not tasted food: not a farthing IN BONIS [of principal or interest] to get bread with; I had waded twenty miles hither, in a sultry morning, through the sand. Not {{a difficult thing to}} keep down laughter in such circumstances!"--Poor soul; but the Royal mind is human too.--"In this tremor of my heart, there came a KAMMER-HUSSAR [Soldier-Valet, Valet reduced to his simplest expression] out of the Palace, and asked, 'Where is the man that was with my King (MEINEM KONIG,--THY King particularly?) in the Garden?' I answered, 'Here!' And he led me into the Schloss, to a large Room, where pages, lackeys, and Kammer-hussars were about. My Kammer-hussar took me to a little table, excellently furnished; with soup, beef; likewise carp dressed with garden-salad, likewise game with cucumber-salad: <b>bread,</b> <b>knife,</b> fork, spoon and salt were all there [and I with an appetite of twenty-seven hours; I too was there]. My hussar set me a chair, said: 'This that is on the table, the King has ordered to be served for you (IHM): you are to eat your fill, and mind nobody; and I am to serve. Sharp, then, fall to!'--I was greatly astonished, and knew not what to do; least of all could it come into my head that the King's Kammer-hussar, who waited on his Majesty, should wait on me. I pressed him to sit by me; but as he refused, I did as bidden; sat down, took my spoon, and went at it with a will (FRISCH)! ...|$|E

50|$|As {{several other}} young design {{firms in the}} early 1970s, assistive devices would become an {{important}} product area for Ergonomi Design Gruppen. In 1972 two of the founders, Maria Benktzon and Sven-Erik Juhlin, carried out deep-going ergonomic and physiological studies to investigate the grip of such as <b>bread</b> <b>knives</b> and saws. This led to pioneering achievements to raise the standards of facilities for the disabled. The result was {{a wide range of}} ergonomically designed objects that draw great international attention for RFSU Rehab, Bahco, BabyBjörn, Pfizer and many others. Many of the products are represented at the Swedish National Museum, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York and the Design Museum in London. One of the exhibits is the world's first angled kitchen knife designed for Gustavsberg in 1973.|$|R
60|$|Besides {{the benches}} by the fireside and the bed, the only piece of {{furniture}} {{in the room was}} a coarse wooden table, with a loaf of black <b>bread,</b> a <b>knife,</b> and a pitcher of cider placed on it. Old nets, coils of rope, tattered sails, hung, about the walls and over the wooden partition which separated the room into two compartments. Wisps of straw and ears of barley drooped down through the rotten rafters and gaping boards that made the floor of the granary above.|$|R

60|$|George Emerson {{thought it}} was a burglar. Ashe did not know what it was, but he knew he wanted to shake it off; so he insinuated a hand beneath George's chin and pushed upward. George, by this time parted forever from the tongue, the <b>bread,</b> the <b>knife,</b> the fork, the salt, the {{corkscrew}} and the bottle of white wine, and having both hands free for the work of the moment, held Ashe with the left and punched him in the ribs with the right.|$|R
6000|$|... "'The {{furniture}} of this Caravansera {{consisted of}} a large iron Pot, two oaken Tables, two Benches, two Chairs, and a Potheen Noggin. There was a Loft above (attainable by a ladder), upon which the inmates slept; and the space below was divided by a hurdle into two Apartments; the one for their cow and pig, the other for themselves and guests. On entering the house we discovered the family, eleven in number, at dinner: the father sitting at the top, the mother at the bottom, the children on each side, of a large oaken Board, which was scooped out in the middle, like a trough, to receive the contents of their Pot of Potatoes. Little holes were cut at equal distances to contain Salt; {{and a bowl of}} Milk stood on the table: all the luxuries of meat and beer, <b>bread,</b> <b>knives</b> and dishes were dispensed with.' The Poor-Slave himself our Traveller found, as he says, broad-backed, black-browed, of great personal strength, and mouth from ear to ear. His Wife was a sun-browned but well-featured woman; and his young ones, bare and chubby, had the appetite of ravens. Of their Philosophical or Religious tenets or observances, no notice or hint.|$|R
60|$|The {{recollection}} of that ordeal made {{the one he}} proposed to embark on now seem slight in comparison. All {{he had to do}} was to go to Aline's room on the other side of the house, knock softly on the door until signs of wakefulness made themselves heard from within, and then dart away into the shadows whence he had come, and so back to bed. He gave Aline credit for the intelligence that would enable her, on finding a tongue, some <b>bread,</b> a <b>knife,</b> a fork, salt, a corkscrew and a bottle of white wine on the mat, to know what to do with them--and perhaps to guess whose was the loving hand that had laid them there.|$|R

His expulsion was rescinded when media attention mounted against principal Jim Short and the school district.|$|E
5000|$|The common-known focaccia [...] is salt focaccia. Focaccia doughs {{are similar}} in style and texture to pizza doughs, {{consisting}} of high-gluten flour, oil, water, salt and yeast. It is typically rolled out or pressed by hand into {{a thick layer of}} dough and then baked in a stone-bottom or hearth oven. Bakers often puncture the <b>bread</b> with a <b>knife</b> to relieve bubbling {{on the surface of the}} bread.|$|R
5000|$|The comitative case (abbreviated [...] ) is a {{grammatical}} {{case that}} denotes accompaniment. In English, the preposition [...] "with," [...] {{in the sense}} of [...] "in company with" [...] or [...] "together with," [...] plays a substantially similar role (other uses of [...] "with," [...] like in the meaning of [...] "using" [...] or [...] "by means of" [...] (I cut <b>bread</b> with a <b>knife)).</b> In many languages, especially those in the Indo-European language family, comitative corresponds to the instrumental case or related cases and as such is generally indistinguishable from them.|$|R
40|$|Relational {{categories}} are notoriously difficult to learn {{because they are}} not defined by intrinsic stable properties. We studied the impact of comparisons on relational concept learning with a novel word learning task in 42 -month-old children. Capitalizing on Gentner et al. (2011), two, three or four pairs of stimuli were introduced with a novel relational word. In a given trial, the set of pairs was composed of either close or far pairs (e. g., close pair: knife 1 -watermelon, knife 2 -orange, knife 3 -slice of <b>bread</b> and <b>knife</b> 4 -meat; far pair: ax-evergreen tree, saw-log, cutter-cardboard and knife-slice of bread, for the cutter for relation). Close pairs (2 vs. 3 vs. 4 pairs) led to random generalizations whereas comparisons with far pairs gave the expected relational generalization. The 3 pair case gave the best results. It is argued that far pairs promote deeper comparisons than close pairs. As shown by a control experiment, this was the case only when far pairs display well known associations...|$|R

50|$|With {{the help}} of Lukas (Mon Confiado), Lolo Sinat and Sonny escaped, but were also caught the next day. Gina then tells Lolo Sinat that his death penalty will be served the next week. With that, the old man {{encouraged}} Gina to help Sonny appeal his case. Gabino tried to rape Sonny again, but the boy fought him. Sonny found a <b>bread</b> <b>knife</b> and stabbed Gabino several times, killing him instantly. Lolo Sinat covered up for Sonny.|$|E
50|$|Butter {{should be}} cut, not scraped, from the butter dish using a butter knife or side plate knife and put onto a side plate, not spread {{directly}} {{on to the}} bread. This prevents the butter in the dish from gathering bread crumbs as it is passed around. Bread rolls should be torn with the hands into mouth-sized pieces and buttered individually, from the butter placed on the side plate, using a <b>knife.</b> <b>Bread</b> {{should not be used}} to dip into soup or sauces. As with butter, cheese should be cut and placed on your plate before eating.|$|R
5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put <b>bread,</b> salt, a <b>knife</b> with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|R
2500|$|The {{concept of}} cunning folk {{locating}} criminals using magical means concerned {{some people in}} power in England, and there are records from London in the fourteenth century showing that certain cunning folk themselves were brought to trial because of their accusations against {{other members of the}} community: for instance, in 1382 a cunning man named Robert Berewold was brought to court after accusing a woman named Johanna Wolsy of stealing a drinking bowl from a house in St Mildred Poultry. In the trial, it emerged that Berewold had come to his conclusion through a form of divination known as [...] "turning the loaf" [...] where a wooden peg was stuck into the top of a loaf of <b>bread</b> with four <b>knives</b> then stuck into the sides. A list of names would then be spoken, and according to the theory, the loaf would supposedly turn when the name of the thief was spoken. Berewold was found guilty of making unsubstantiated and damaging claims, and punished in the pillory.|$|R
