5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} the way his {{collection}} The Round Table, issued in the same year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote his new book himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also <b>by</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> friend to publish the chapter on Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to notice it in that periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it directly to a publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James Ollier in collaboration, who brought it out on 9 July 1817. It was extremely successful, this first edition selling out in six weeks. A second edition was issued by Taylor and Hessey in 1818, and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in Boston by Wells and Lilly. No further editions appeared in Hazlitt's lifetime.|$|E

25|$|Boxing {{record books}} show Fitzsimmons officially began boxing professionally in 1883, in Australia. He beat Jim Crawford there <b>by</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> {{knockout}} in three rounds. Fitzsimmons {{had his first}} 28 definite professional fights in Australia, where he lost for the Australian Middleweight title to Mick Dooley (rumours spoke of a fixed bout) and where he also won a fight by knockout while on the floor: when Edward Starlight Robins dropped Fitzsimmons to the canvas in round nine of their fight, he also broke his hand and could not continue, therefore the referee declared Fitzsimmons the winner by a knockout.|$|E

His final major league appearance was in a 51 loss to the Chicago White Sox at Arlington Stadium on May 26, 1984. After replacing Dave Tobik to start the ninth inning, Bibby allowed a single to Joel Skinner, a double to Rudy Law and an intentional walk to Jerry Hairston, Sr. to load the bases with one out. He managed to not surrender any runs <b>by</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> groundout from Mike Squires and a flyout from Greg Walker. Bibby was released six days later on June 1.|$|E
25|$|Production {{of a new}} film, Scream 4 (2011) was {{announced}} in July 2008 by The Weinstein Company who approached Williamson about formulating a new script, {{with the intention of}} creating a new Scream trilogy if the fourth film proved successful. By late 2009, Williamson managed to develop an idea for the film and potential sequels and began work on the script. The film was given a budget of $40 million and the principal cast were signed to the film in September 2009 followed by Craven as director in March 2010. In May 2010, Cathy Konrad, producer on the original three films filed a $3 million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company accusing them of violating an agreement that her company, Cat Entertainment, be given first rights to produce all Scream films in order to cut costs <b>by</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> cheaper producer (Craven's wife Iya Labunka, not named in the suit). In April 2011, it was reported that the Weinsteins had settled out of court with Conrad, the details remaining confidential. The Hollywood Reporter however, claimed that Conrad received a cash payment and entitlement to a percentage of the profits derived from Scream 4. In addition, she was given an executive producer credit on the film. Williamson and Bob Weinstein came into repeated conflict with each other during production with Williamson citing the creative direction of the film as the cause while Weinstein blamed the time constraints on the film's development. Williamson and Weinstein did not speak to each other after Williamson left the production, claiming other responsibilities, and he had not seen the finished version of the film prior to its release.|$|E

500|$|Squab pie {{has been}} the subject of poetry. In [...] "The Squab-Pie. A Devonshire Tale" [...] {{published}} in 1827, John Taylor uses verse to tell of the captain of a ship in Plymouth who forgot to get meat for his trip. A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still having a big meal <b>by</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> baker to cook for you.|$|E
500|$|Ruth's {{penchant for}} hitting home runs altered how {{baseball}} is played. Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games <b>by</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the bunt, and the hit and run. Advocates {{of what was}} dubbed [...] "inside baseball", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it a blot on {{the purity of the}} game. According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon, after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, [...] "settled, for all time to come, that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star." [...] Bill James noted, [...] "When the owners discovered that the fans liked to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace , then there was no turning back." [...] While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.|$|E
500|$|There are two game modes: the Micro Machines Challenge, and head-to-head. In both modes, players {{select a}} character. In Micro Machines Challenge, players race against three {{computer-controlled}} opponents, and must finish in {{first or second}} {{to qualify for the}} next round. Players are given three chances: if all three are lost the game is over. Every three races, players compete in a time trial race to earn an extra chance. In head-to-head, players race against another vehicle. Players are colour-coded, and the goal is to get lights on the screen to show the player's colour <b>by</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> screen ahead of the other player, so the trailing player is no longer visible. When this happens, one light turns to the colour of the leading player. The game ends when all eight lights are one colour, or after three laps, in which case victory goes to the player with the most lights. If the game is tied, there is a [...] "sudden death play-off", where the next player to win a light wins. The game starts with four lights of each colour. Head-to-head can be played in either single-player mode or with two players. With two players, certain characters have a handicap to give the other player a better chance. The Game Gear version supports two players via link-up, or by players holding one end of the console each with one player using the buttons and the other the D-pad.|$|E
50|$|Many hip-hop remixes arose {{either from}} {{the need for a}} pop/R&B singer to add more of an urban, rap edge to one of their slower songs, or from the need for a rapper to gain more pop appeal <b>by</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> R&B singer to sing some lines here and there. When a song by a solo artist does not take off, a remix with {{additional}} performers can give the song a second chance.|$|R
