The {{results show that the}} cross-sectional deformation and the wall thickness variation during NC bending of TA 18 tubes using a small bending radius (less than 2 times of tube outside diameter) are clearly different from that using a normal bending radius (between 2 and 4 times of tube outside diameter). For bending with a normal bending radius, with or without a mandrel, the distribution of the flattening in the bending area resembles a platform and an asymmetric parabola, respectively. For bending with a small bending radius, with or without a mandrel, the flattening both distributes like a parabola, but the former has a stable peak which deflects toward the initial <b>bending</b> <b>section,</b> and the latter has a more pronounced peak with a bending angle and deflects slightly toward the <b>bending</b> <b>section.</b> The wall thickness variations with a normal bending radius, with and without a mandrel, both resemble a platform when the bending angle exceeds a certain angle. For the bending with a small radius, the distribution of the wall thickness variation without a mandrel follows an approximate parabola which increases in value as the bending angle increases. If a mandrel is used, the thickening ratio increases from the initial <b>bending</b> <b>section</b> to the <b>bending</b> <b>section...</b>|$|R

50|$|During the {{construction}} of the NSLS, two scientists, Renate Chasman and George Kenneth Green, invented a special periodic arrangement of magnetic elements (a magnetic lattice) to provide optimized bending and focusing of electrons. The design was called the Chasman-Green lattice, and it became the basis of design for every synchrotron storage ring. Storage rings are characterized by the number of straight <b>sections</b> and <b>bend</b> <b>sections</b> in their design. The <b>bend</b> <b>sections</b> produce more light than the straight sections due to the change in angular momentum of the electrons. Chasman and Green accounted for this in their design by adding insertion devices, known as wigglers and undulators, in the straight sections of the storage ring. These insertion devices produce the brightest light among the sections of the ring and thus, beamlines are typically built downstream from them.|$|R

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. There is {{currently}} no {{efficient way to}} quantitatively (precisely) remove material from work pieces in hard-to-reach cavities, such as turbine blades in a jet engine. There {{is a need to}} be able to smooth the cracks from the turbine blades with a controlled amount of material removal. Endoscopy is useful for navigating and inspecting features in internal cavities with a flexible body and a semi-rigid <b>bending</b> <b>section.</b> By turning control knobs on the endoscope, the <b>bending</b> <b>section</b> can access a workpiece on its lateral direction. In this research, it is hypothesized that an endoscope can be used to remotely grind a predetermined amount of material and smooth the cracks on a work piece. The research objectives are to set up a precise flexible machining operation and to measure the accuracy of the estimated amount of material that can be removed. Experiment results shows that a reasonable accuracy was achieved using a modified flexible medical endoscope. In this study, two models were built to estimate the pose (position and orientation) and force on a modified PENTAX ES- 3801 endoscope. The pose model was based on geometric analysis of the endoscope <b>bending</b> <b>section.</b> When the internal force was compensated in calculation, the average pose estimation error was less than 4 mm of distance and 5 degrees of bending angle. The force model was based on equilibrium analysis of the <b>bending</b> <b>section</b> and the average force prediction error was 0. 5 N in the range of 1 to 8 N. The experimental and estimated results prove that the pose and force of the flexible <b>bending</b> <b>section</b> can be predicted and monitored when subjected to varying loads from work piece. In grinding processes, self-excited vibration (chatter) will seriously degrade the geometric accuracy and surface finish of the workpiece. The proposed endoscopic machining tool is naturally vulnerable to chatter due to its high degrees of freedom and low structural rigidity. A dynamic model was built to study the self-excited vibration characteristics of the endoscopic machining tool. By analyzing the stability lobe diagram (SLD), optimized machining parameters were found to reduce the chatter. An on-line chatter detecting method is proposed to identify self-excited vibration in its early stage. Finally, a material removal rate (MRR) model was formulated to predict the amount of material removal in this endoscopic grinding process. By calculating the energy wasted by chatter and the effective energy spent on grinding, the MRR was predicted. Several machining experiments were conducted to validate the repeatability of the model and evaluate its accuracy. The average MRR prediction error is 22 % related to the measured MRR. Experiment results reveals that the current MRR prediction accuracy (in the scale of 0. 5 mg) is not high enough to meet industry requirement, which is believed to be 0. 004 mg for submillimeter size cracks. Recommendations of improving pose estimation and MRR prediction accuracies such as designing a more predictable endoscopic tool structure, using a sphere grinding tool head and adopting a pneumatic driving mechanism or tip mounted motor are proposed...|$|R

Flow characteristics of the bend with no vane are compared with those of bends having 1 or 3 vertical vanes. The size of the flow separation zone at the inner wall of the bend was determined from dye visualization data and confirmed using the mean streamwise velocity data. Results show that the vertical vanes are effective in considerably reducing flow separation, intensity of secondary flows and turbulence energy in the downstream channel. Furthermore, energy loss for bends with vanes is slightly less than for the no-vane case...|$|E

In this process, {{it is very important to}} control the thickness of the pipe to ensure its performance. The lower thickness usually turned out in outer <b>section</b> of <b>bended</b> pipe, even though controlling the thickness carefully by reverse moment. As the radius of pipe is smaller, especially, the thickness reduction is larger. The reduced thickness becomes a cause of deterioration of properties and confidence of bended pipe.

40|$|Abstract. Metal pipes have a {{long history}} as fluid conduits, and are {{commonly}} joined with components such as elbows to form bent transport paths. However, with the increasing demands for economy and energy saving, pipes with reduced joints and thinner walls are desired. The number of joints can be reduced by a drawing and bending process that forms a <b>bend</b> <b>section</b> at any position in the pipe. However, this approach incurs problems such as wrinkling and flattening, especially under conditions of large bending angle, decreased bending radius, and thin pipe walls. In this research, applying vibrations to the mandrel was trialed as an approach for controlling the wrinkle depth and flattening. First, processing experiments were performed on thin walled pipes (wall thickness = 0. 5 mm; outer diameter = 14 mm). The change of flattening and the number and depths of wrinkles were investigated in the presence and absence of vibrations. Next, simulations were performed using the commercial nonlinear finite element software. Through these simulations, the flatness and appearance of wrinkles were analyzed by modeling the behavior and distribution of stresses and strains in the processing process. The application of vibration to the mandrel appears to be a promising approach for controlling the wrinkling and flattening problems during pipe processing...|$|E
