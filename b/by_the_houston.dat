5|$|Houston {{is served}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Chronicle, its only major daily {{newspaper}} with wide distribution.

5|$|By 2005, 60% of Gulfton {{residents}} were not native born and represented citizenship from forty two countries. Many {{residents were}} illegal immigrants. More than 20% of the households did not own cars. Starting in the mid-1980s, the Gulfton population experienced increases in female and children populations. Peg Purser, an urban planner who directed a 1991 University of Houston Center for Public Policy study commissioned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Chronicle, identified that the Hispanic {{population growth in}} the Gulfton area was almost entirely from Central American countries. According to the study, between the 1980 and 1990 U.S. Censuses, Hispanic population density increased by 3,500 persons per square mile.

5|$|Following the trade, the Oilers {{assigned}} him {{to their}} AHL affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs, {{where he played}} the final 11 games of the regular season. Between Bridgeport and Hamilton, Torres recorded 18 goals and 40 points over 60 games in his second AHL campaign. For the second consecutive year, he appeared in the Calder Cup Finals and lost. He struggled in his second AHL playoff run, managing six goals and an assist over 23 post-season games as the Bulldogs were defeated in the finals <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Aeros in seven games. On August 1, 2003., Torres was re-signed by the Oilers to a two-year contract.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1994, Tolliver {{was signed}} to a {{contract}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Oilers. He was originally the third-string quarterback, but ineffectiveness by Bucky Richardson led Tolliver to relieve him {{in a game against}} the Cleveland Browns. Tolliver played well enough to be considered for the starting job the following week due to Cody Carlson dealing with injuries. Tolliver made his first start in a game against the Raiders, but played inconsistently over seven starts and was replaced by Richardson in the season finale against the New York Jets. After finishing the season, Tolliver became a free agent and left the NFL.|$|E

5|$|The Denver Nuggets are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Denver, Colorado. They {{play in the}} Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Nuggets were founded as the Denver Rockets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1967. In 1974, in anticipation of moving to the NBA, the franchise held a contest to choose a new trademarked name for the team, as Rockets was already in use <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Rockets and the name Nuggets won. In 1976, the ABA folded, and the NBA decided to admit four ABA teams into the league, including the Nuggets, the San Antonio Spurs, the Indiana Pacers and the New York Nets.|$|E

Fearful that the work might be challenged as defamatory or not in the public domain, Houston Grand Opera obtained insurance to cover such an eventuality. Before its stage premiere, the opera was presented in concert form in May 1987 in San Francisco, with intermission discussions led by Adams.

5|$|Yao, who {{was born}} in Shanghai, China, started playing for the Shanghai Sharks as a teenager, and played on their senior team for five years in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), winning a {{championship}} in his final year. After negotiating with the CBA and the Sharks to secure his release, Yao was selected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Rockets as the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft. He reached the NBA Playoffs four times, and the Rockets won a first-round series in the 2009 postseason, their first playoff series victory since 1997. In July 2011, Yao announced his retirement from professional basketball because of a series of foot and ankle injuries which forced him to miss 250 games in his last six seasons. In eight seasons with the Rockets, Yao ranks sixth among franchise leaders in total points and total rebounds, and second in total blocks.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 20–15 record, 14 complete games, threeshutouts, and 214 strikeouts in 291innings of work. At age 26, Richard became only the second pitcher in Astros' history (after Dierker in 1969) to record 20wins in a season, tying him for fourth in the NL that year. Richard also became the ninth member of the Black Aces, an organization founded by Mudcat Grant that consists of all African American pitchers who have won at least 20 major league games in a season. He was named the Most Valuable Player of the Astros <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Richard finished 17th in MVP Award voting and seventh in the NL's Cy Young Award voting. His 2.75ERA was the seventh-best among the league's starting pitchers, and he held hitters to a 0.212 batting average. He led the league in lowest number of hits allowed per nine innings and in walks allowed; Richard also {{finished the}} season second in batters faced, innings pitched and games started. In addition, he led all NL pitchers with 14 hits, two home runs, and nine runs batted in as a hitter. However, during the year he committed ten errors and finished with an 0.853fielding percentage, nearly 0.100 lower than the league average.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, at 20years of age, Richard {{was promoted}} to the Cocoa Astros of the Florida State League in high-A minor league baseball. Richard again compiled a low hits per nine innings (H/9IP) ratio by giving up only 67hits in 109 total innings pitched. Despite his 4–11 win–loss record, Richard finished {{the season with a}} 2.39ERA and even threw a no-hitter against the Daytona Beach Dodgers. During the season, Richard was able to throw an accurate fastball which occasionally exceeded 100miles per hour, and his slider 93miles per hour, faster than those of most major-league pitchers. During the 1970–71 off-season, the Astros again promoted Richard: this time to Class-AAA baseball, one step below the major leagues, with the Oklahoma City 89ers of the now-defunct American Association. Richard wore number50 and kept that number {{for the rest of his}} minor-league and major-league career. Richard started all but one of the games he pitched that season. He pitched eight complete games and led the league with 202strikeouts in 173innings of work. He ended the season with twelvewins and sevenlosses before being called up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Astros.|$|E

5|$|During Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Jeter {{broke his}} right ankle while {{attempting}} to field a ball. He {{was one of many}} Yankees to miss playing time during the club's 2013 campaign; 20 players were placed on the disabled list at least once. The team had an opportunity to win a wild-card playoff spot, but faded late in the season. It was only the second time since 1995 that New York did not qualify for postseason play. In the offseason, second baseman Robinson Canó departed New York for the Mariners in free agency, but the Yankees signed starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, who was coming off a 24–0 year with Japan's Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, to a seven-year contract. Rodriguez was suspended for the 2014 season by MLB for using performance-enhancing drugs. The 2014 Yankees, the last with Jeter in their lineup, fell four games short of a postseason berth with an 84–78 record. Despite signing several new hitters prior to the season, the team finished third from last in the AL in runs scored. The offense improved in 2015, ending the regular season with the second-most runs in MLB. New York gained a wild card berth with a second-place finish, but was defeated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Astros in a one-game playoff. The Yankees traded several veteran players during their 2016 season, and Rodriguez was released from his contract. The club had 84 wins, but missed the playoffs {{for the third time in}} four years. As the Yankees' on-field performance declined after 2009, their attendance and television ratings fell; revenue from ticket and luxury suite sales at Yankee Stadium decreased by more than 40percent from 2009 to 2016.|$|E
