50|$|The CBJ-MS {{is capable}} of being field-converted to fire one of two types of ammunition. For the purely {{military}} role, the weapon fires a new 6.5×25 mm CBJ cartridge; but by simply changing the barrel, it can fire 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition for police, training and other operations. The 6.5×25 mm CBJ cartridge has the same overall dimensions as the 9×19 mm cartridge and generates {{the same level of}} firing impulse. The projectile is a tungsten insert held in a plastic sabot, fired at a high muzzle velocity (815 m/s) with the ability to defeat current and future <b>body</b> <b>armours.</b> It is claimed to be effective against lightly armoured vehicles such as armoured personnel carriers (APCs). Advantages claimed for the 6.5×25 mm CBJ cartridge include a high impact velocity, a high hit probability due to the flat trajectory, high energy transfer to the target, and low levels of barrel wear and corrosion. The cartridge case is aluminium. Each 6.5×25 mm CBJ cartridge weighs 4.5 g and has an overall length of 29.7 mm. The projectile weight is 2 g. The combat range of the cartridge is stated to be up to 400 m.|$|R

5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E
5|$|Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, other starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters. Their first {{lines of}} defence are the {{saponins}} present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours. Some starfish such as Astropecten polyacanthus also include powerful toxins such as tetrodotoxin among their chemical armoury, and the slime star can ooze out {{large quantities of}} repellent mucus. They also have <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> {{in the form of}} hard plates and spines. The crown-of-thorns starfish is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright warning colours. Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities.|$|E

50|$|Syngnathids {{are found}} in {{temperate}} and tropical seas across the world. Most species inhabit shallow, coastal waters, but a few are known from the open ocean, especially in association with sargassum mats. They are characterised by their elongated snouts, fused jaws, the absence of pelvic fins, and by thick plates of bony <b>armour</b> covering their <b>bodies.</b> The <b>armour</b> gives them a rigid body, so they swim by rapidly fanning their fins. As a result, they are relatively slow compared with other fishes, but are able to control their movements with great precision, including hovering in place for extended periods.|$|R
5|$|During the Principate {{period of}} the Roman Empire (30 BC – AD 284), the all-mounted alae ("wings") {{contained}} the elite cavalry of the army. They were specially trained in elaborate manoeuvres, such as those displayed to the emperor Hadrian during a documented inspection in Numidia. They were best-suited for large-scale operations and battle, during which they {{acted as the primary}} cavalry escort for the legions, which had almost no cavalry of their own. Roman alares were normally armoured, with mail or scale <b>body</b> <b>armour,</b> a cavalry version of the infantry helmet (with more protective features, such as completely covered ears) and oval shield or hexagonal. Their weapons could be a lance, javelins, or bow and arrow but all Roman horseman had a sword called a (spatha) and the ubiquitous pugio. The elite status of an alaris is shown {{by the fact that he}} received 20% greater pay than his counterpart in an auxiliary cohort, and than a legionary infantryman.|$|E
5|$|Early on 25 September, Harald and Tostig {{departed}} their {{landing place}} at Riccall {{with most of}} their forces, but left {{a third of their}} forces behind. They brought only light armour, as they expected to just meet the citizens of York, as they had agreed the day before, at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald. Once there Harald saw Godwinson's forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald's. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald's army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle in a state of berserkergang, having worn no <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} affairs, {{the use of}} infantry with specialised roles increased. Along {{with the}} still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use {{partly because of the}} increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries. The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets, heavy <b>body</b> <b>armour,</b> as well as horse armour. Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304, although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon. Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s, and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{vehicles}} closely {{resembling the}} A7V tank (one of them named [...] "Hedi") were constructed {{after the war}} and used by government troops, or Freikorps, to quell civil unrest in Berlin in 1919.

40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) fluids {{were first}} {{developed}} over 70 years ago. These fluids are suspensions composed of three major components: a carrier oil, magnetisable particles and additives, which become a viscoelastic solid due to particle alignment {{under the influence}} of an external magnetic field. Since the 1990 s, new developments have started succeeding each other rapidly and a growing application within different domains has been observed. The first application can be found in automotive, more specifically shock absorbers installed in car suspensions. Future research points towards applications such as seismological dampers in the construction industry for protecting buildings against earthquakes, comfortable liquid <b>body</b> <b>armours</b> in military applications where the MR fluid serves as bulletproof material, optical polishing methods based on MR fluids to manufacture telescope lenses or joint brakes for medical devices such as exoskeletons and prostheses. Also in robotics this fluid has not remained unnoticed, especially in the emerging domain of soft robotics. This domain focuses on integrating soft, flexible materials and structures, often derived from biological organisms, in robotics. Unfortunately, soft manipulators and grippers can only excite low forces with low precision relative to conventional hard grippers. On the other hand, they offer the major advantage of infinitely many degrees of freedom and high compliance. Future research should therefore focus on combining the best of these two worlds: hard and soft grippers. Herein, MR fluids show great potential and can play an important role. By simply varying the strength of the applied magnetic field, the stiffness of the gripper can be changed within the continuous spectrum between non-rigid and rigid. In summary, this paper will look at the properties of magnetorheology and the accomplished designs. Subsequently the potential benefits and challenges of magnetorheology in robotics will be discussed, with a focus on robotic grippers and manipulators. status: submitte...|$|R

5|$|In the 4th century, the {{production}} of weapons and equipment was highly centralised (and presumably standardised) {{in a number of}} major state-run arms factories, or fabricae, documented in the Notitia. It is unknown when these were first established, but they certainly existed by the time of Diocletian. In the 2nd century, there is evidence of fabricae inside legionary bases and even in the much smaller auxiliary forts, staffed by the soldiers themselves. But there is no evidence, literary or archaeological, of fabricae outside military bases and staffed by civilians during the Principate (although their existence cannot be excluded, as no archaeological evidence has been found for the late fabricae either). Late fabricae were located in border provinces and dioceses. Some were general manufacturers producing both armour and weapons (fabrica scutaria et armorum) or just one of the two. Others were specialised in {{one or more of the}} following: fabrica spatharia (sword manufacture), lanciaria (spears), arcuaria (bows), sagittaria (arrows), loricaria (<b>body</b> <b>armour),</b> clibanaria (cataphract armour), and ballistaria (catapults).|$|E
5|$|Maya warfare {{was not so}} much {{aimed at}} {{destruction}} of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Xinca of the Pacific coast attacked the Spanish with spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. Maya warriors wore <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E
5|$|Swords and Sorcery is {{presented}} in a first person top-down perspective and contains elements of dungeon crawling, a common trait of role playing video games. The game {{is set in a}} fictional land called Zob, in which he main objective is to explore its catacombs and discover a large wealth of treasure, alongside collecting seven pieces of sacred Zob armour. The game begins with allowing the player to choose their player-character; the default protagonist is called Flubbit the Dull, however there is an option to allow the player to create and personalise their own character. Once a character has been created, a 14 in-game day training scheme will commence which gives the player an opportunity to improve their abilities such as lock picking, sword fighting and thieving. An in-game armoury is also accessible at any time, which includes utilities such as <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> and various weaponry. The form of currency in the game is dragon's teeth, which can be used to purchase items and equipment.|$|E

The 'keshla' gum-ring upon his head was severed in two places by sword-cuts, one just over the curious hole in his skull, and the blood poured down his face from the gashes. Also on the right side of his neck was a stab from a spear, inflicted by Agon; there was a deep cut on his left arm just below where the mail shirt-sleeve stopped, and on the right side of his <b>body</b> the <b>armour</b> was severed by a gash six inches long, where Nasta's mighty sword had bitten through it and deep into its wearer's vitals.|$|R

[...] The wearer remained highly agile and could jump, run and otherwise move freely as {{the weight of}} the armour was spread evenly throughout the <b>body.</b> The <b>armour</b> was articulated and covered a man's entire body completely from neck to toe. In the 15th and 16th centuries plate armored soldiers were the nucleus of every army. Large bodies of men-at-arms numbering thousands or even more than ten thousand men (approximately 60% to 70% of French armies were men at arms and the percentage was also big in other countries) were fighting on foot wearing full plate next to archers and crossbowmen [...] This was commonly seen in the Western European armies especially of France and England during the Hundred Years War, the Wars of the Roses or the Italian Wars.|$|R
50|$|Armoured {{car design}} and {{production}} ran through two distinct development cycles. Early armoured cars were {{built on the}} basis of <b>armouring</b> <b>bodies</b> to fit onto normal commercial car (light) and truck (heavy) chassis'. This involved some elements of compromise as the body had to fit an existing shape or size, while the weight shifted with heavy armour and weaponry. Immediately prior to the war, this changed with vehicles such as the Dingo designed from the start for armoured use. Such vehicles provided better handling, along with removing many compromises in design caused by the inherited chassis.|$|R
5|$|The {{enhanced}} A Company group—approximately 130 {{troops in}} total—arrived {{in the country}} in several groups and joined the SAS, who had already established a base in Hastings, a village 30 miles (50 kilometres) south of Freetown, where several of the paras recognised former colleagues among the troopers from D Squadron. At Hastings, the paras focused on live firing exercises and rehearsed various scenarios in a scale replica of Magbeni which had been constructed at the camp. As well as learning the layout of the village and refining battle technique, the rehearsals allowed the soldiers to acclimatise to the tropical heat, and led commanders to the decision that the paras would go into battle with minimal equipment {{to reduce the risk of}} heat exhaustion—excluding weapons and ammunition, they would carry only water and field dressings. Some officers feared that the weight of <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> would increase the risk of heat exhaustion, but commanders hoped that the cooler temperatures of the early morning (when the operation was planned to be launched) would mitigate the effects of the weight, and decided to order its use.|$|E
5|$|Maya armies {{were highly}} disciplined, and warriors participated in regular {{training}} exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male {{was available for}} military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; {{the needs of their}} crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E
5|$|Jovanović {{began working}} on the {{painting}} in 1900. In keeping with his usual approach, he spent {{a significant amount of}} time researching Dušan's life. He read medieval accounts of the proclamation, consulted experts on that historical period, and examined medieval paintings and illuminated manuscripts for insight into the architecture and weaponry of 14th-century Serbia. Jovanović also visited the monasteries of Gračanica and Lesnovo, the Field of Kosovo, and the cities of Prizren and Skopje. Since the church where the proclamation took place had long since been destroyed, he was forced to find an alternative, ultimately deciding to model it after the Visoki Dečani monastery given the similarities in their design. By his own admission, the hardest task Jovanović faced was achieving authenticity with regard to clothing, weaponry and medieval heraldry. He found the medieval clothing particularly difficult to reproduce because Serbs did not have their own national costume at the time. Instead, medieval Serbs, especially royalty and the nobility, wore clothing that was greatly influenced by neighbouring cultures, particularly the Byzantines. Jovanović styled the clothes seen in the painting on frescoes from the medieval monasteries he visited, sketched them, and then requested that the head costume designer of the Vienna State Opera recreate them based on those sketches. Upon receiving the costumes, Jovanović placed them in his studio and used them as models for the painting. Dušan's German mercenaries, who are shown lining the church doors church as he exits, wear Venetian <b>body</b> <b>armour.</b> Jovanović based this detail on a medieval correspondence that Novaković had discovered in the Venetian archives where Dušan is recorded having ordered 300 units of plate armour from Venice. Knights' swords and other weaponry were based on depictions from medieval frescoes. The heraldry depicted on the shields and the insignia of the various figures is based on examples from a medieval book titled Armaila Illyricorum. Jovanović had found the book in a Viennese library. It had been removed from Herzegovina's Žitomislić monastery several decades prior and brought to the Austro-Hungarian capital. The Proclamation of Dušan's Law Codex was painted outdoors, en plein air.|$|E

During the funeral games for Achilles, Odysseus competes once again with Telamonian Ajax. Thetis says that the arms of Achilles will go to the bravest of the Greeks, but only these two warriors dare lay claim to that title. The two Argives became embroiled in a heavy dispute about one another's merits to receive the reward. The Greeks dither out of fear in deciding a winner, because {{they did not want to}} insult one and have him abandon the war effort. Nestor suggests that they allow the captive Trojans decide the winner. Some accounts disagree, suggesting that the Greeks themselves hold a secret vote. In any case, Odysseus is the winner. Enraged and humiliated, Ajax is driven mad by Athena. When he returns to his senses, in shame at how he has slaughtered livestock in his madness, Ajax kills himself by the sword that Hector had given him after their duel.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{populations are}} at least {{partially}} adapted to local environmental conditions. The level of adaptation is promoted by divergent selection on ecologically relevant traits, but hampered by gene flow. The relative strength of both forces depends on genomic architecture as well as dispersal abilities, both of which might differ between species. In this study, we tested for divergent selection and gene flow in two coexisting and phylogenetically related species, the three- and nine-spined stickleback. Populations occur across very similar environmental clines in biotic and abiotic conditions (salinity, oxygen concentration, predation, parasites and prey), and were sampled within exactly the same spatial matrix. In each species we assessed gene flow between populations from contrasting environments and determined divergence in ecologically relevant traits (<b>body</b> shape, <b>armour,</b> spleen size, and trophic morphology). An analyses of genome-wide differentiation was used to identify the genomic basis of adaptation. Based on these data we compared the relative strength of divergent selection and gene flow in both species, {{as well as the}} biological functions of the genes under selection. We discuss how these relationships explain how both stickleback species maintain partially overlapping habitats. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|During {{the time}} of their use, this style of armour evolved and changed, the {{currently}} recognised types being the Kalkriese, Corbridge and Newstead types, named after their places of discovery. There was, however, a considerable overlap between these types in use and the Corbridge and Newstead types are often found at the same site (e.g. at Caerleon in Wales, Carnuntum in Austria, Carlisle in England and León in Spain). It is possible that there was a fourth type, covering the <b>body</b> with segmented <b>armour</b> joined to scale shoulder defences.
