5|$|During {{his final}} years, and {{especially}} {{after the death of}} Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having <b>boundless</b> ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.|$|E
5|$|In a {{parallel}} universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the terrible rule {{of a powerful}} coven of wicked witches. Their queen, who managed to surpass the rest in her <b>boundless</b> cruelty and depravity, frantically seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers {{from all the other}} witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in our world in the 1990s, an American young teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish in a flash of light. The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. But the boy soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who just might break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.|$|E

25|$|A {{story is}} told of a cricketer who had {{regarded}} Fuller Pilch as the final word in batting, being taken in his old age to see Mr. Grace bat for the first time.

25|$|Henri Bergson defined intuition as a simple, {{indivisible}} {{experience of}} sympathy through {{which one is}} moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it. The absolute that is grasped is always perfect {{in the sense that}} it is perfectly what it is, and infinite {{in the sense that it}} can be grasped as a whole through a simple, indivisible act of intuition, yet lends itself to <b>boundless</b> enumeration when analysed.|$|E
25|$|Gavin {{spent his}} spare time reading books from the library, notably Great Captains and a {{biography}} of Hannibal. He {{had been forced to}} quit school in seventh grade in order to help support his family, and acutely felt his lack of education. In addition, he made excursions in the region, trying to satisfy his <b>boundless</b> curiosity about everything. First Sergeant Williams recognized Gavin's potential and made him his assistant; Gavin was promoted to corporal six months later.|$|E
25|$|The same {{rational}} way {{of thought}} {{led him to}} introduce the abstract apeiron (indefinite, infinite, <b>boundless,</b> unlimited) as an origin of the universe, a concept that is probably influenced by the original Chaos (gaping void, abyss, formless state) of the mythical Greek cosmogony from which everything else appeared. It also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements. Origin, then, must be something else unlimited in its source, that could create without experiencing decay, so that genesis would never stop.|$|E
25|$|In Catholic teachings, {{the object}} of the devotion to the Heart of Mary is her {{physical}} Heart that burned so intensely with love for God. Because of the inherently close relationship of Mary and Jesus in the Catholic teachings on salvation, the Heart of Mary is associated with the Heart of Jesus. The Sacred Heart is viewed as the source of God's <b>boundless</b> love and charity, while the devotion to the Immaculate Heart stresses the nature of Mary's love and concern for all who call upon her.|$|E
25|$|Yogananda envisioned “World Brotherhood Colonies” {{as places}} where {{harmonious}} people could {{support each other}} in the balanced development of body, mind, and soul through the teachings of Yoga. He spoke of “plain living and God thinking,” a simple but effective formula to tap into the spiritual reality that flows like a deep river beneath the chaos of our times. Song of the Morning Ranch is the ideal location for such a colony, nested as it is within a state forest teaming with God’s <b>boundless</b> variety of life forms, and the deep quiet and peace conducive to inner revelation.|$|E
25|$|The Revolution {{opened the}} way for cataclysmic change in Persia, heralding the modern era. It saw a period of {{unprecedented}} debate in a burgeoning press. The revolution created new opportunities and opened up seemingly <b>boundless</b> possibilities for Persia’s future. Many different groups fought to shape the course of the Revolution, and all sections of society were ultimately to be in some way changed by it. The old order, which king Naser al-Din Shah Qajar had struggled for so long to sustain, finally died, to be replaced by new institutions, new forms of expression, and a new social and political order.|$|E
25|$|Attenborough, by then {{controller}} of BBC 2, {{wanted to}} make a strong statement on BBC's second channel of the <b>boundless</b> possibilities that colour television offered, and recognised that natural history was the obvious subject matter to choose. He commissioned a series called The World About Us (1969–1982) that would broadcast in a 50-minute Sunday evening slot. Because of the challenge of producing enough colour material, the commission was shared between the NHU and London's Travel and Exploration Unit. The extended opportunities offered by the 50-minute format and improvements in film technology and expertise finally allowed the NHU to begin showcasing its talent.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, Strasser and {{his brother}} joined the right-wing Freikorps led by Franz Ritter von Epp. The aim of the group was to {{suppress}} Communism in Bavaria. He established and commanded the Sturmbataillon Niederbayern ("Storm Battalion Lower Bavaria"), with the young Heinrich Himmler employed as his adjutant. Strasser was well known for his enormous stature, commanding personality, and his <b>boundless</b> organizational energy. By March 1920, Strasser's Freikorps was ready {{to participate in the}} failed Kapp Putsch, whereas his brother Otto had turned {{to the left of the}} political spectrum and helped combat this right-wing coup d'état.|$|E
25|$|To say the least, a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle. No man wants to take his eyes from it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the <b>boundless</b> enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E
25|$|These can be {{supported}} by Hesiod's account:Now all the gods were divided through strife; for at that very time Zeus who thunders on high was meditating marvelous deeds, even to mingle storm and tempest over the <b>boundless</b> earth, and already he was hastening to make an utter end of the race of mortal men, declaring that he would destroy {{the lives of the}} demi-gods, that the children of the gods should not mate with wretched mortals, seeing their fate with their own eyes; but that the blessed gods henceforth even as aforetime should have their living and their habitations apart from men. But on those who were born of immortals and of mankind verily Zeus laid toil and sorrow upon sorrow.|$|E
25|$|He goes on {{to explain}} that in Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, the rule that nothing can go faster than the speed of light, does not apply to galaxies in an {{expanding}} universe. He further explains that while that rule may apply in a preexisting static space, it does not apply in an expanding universe. In an expanding cosmic universe galaxies can travel away from each other at speeds in excess of the speed of light. As a result of this there are galaxies so far away that the light from them have not reached earth yet and therefore we don't even know they exist. Ferris refers to this phenomenon as a <b>boundless</b> steadily increasing and changing universe with a changing density.|$|E
25|$|Each hour of {{this day}} is the new {{suffering}} and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service – unique and incomparable both {{in the power of}} tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the <b>boundless</b> compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us {{to the foot of the}} cross of Christ erected on Golgotha, and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.|$|E
25|$|Jan van der Lans (1933–2002), a {{professor}} of the psychology of religion at the Catholic University of Nijmegen, wrote, in a book commissioned by the Netherlands-based Catholic Study Center for Mental Health, about followers of gurus and the potential dangers that exist when personal contact between the guru and the disciple is absent, such as an increased chance of idealization of the guru by the student (myth making and deification), and an increase of the chance of false mysticism. He further argues that the deification of a guru is a traditional element of Eastern spirituality, but, when detached from the Eastern cultural element and copied by Westerners, {{the distinction between the}} person who is the guru and that which he symbolizes is often lost, resulting in the relationship between the guru and disciple degenerating into a <b>boundless,</b> uncritical personality cult.|$|E
25|$|To {{promote the}} game in Europe, EA and Need for Speed {{conducted}} the 2011 Need for Speed European Spokesmodel Search. This continent wide search was set to discover two women with <b>boundless</b> energy, an outgoing personality and an edgy style fused {{with a passion for}} cars and gaming. The winners acted as Need for Speed ambassadors at events throughout 2012, including representing Need for Speed products at high-profile gaming events across Europe and the Team Need for Speed racing team in the prestigious FIA GT3 European Championship and Euro Drift program. Models searches were being conducted in five territories: France, Germany, Norway, Russia and the United Kingdom. Finalists was selected from each territory with the final two winners being announced in November 2011 in conjunction with the release of Need for Speed: The Run. To promote {{the game in}} US, Canada and UK, EA announced a competition, giving away one 2012 Porsche Carrera S. All the competitions had to do was enter by logging in with the EA account, or register for free.|$|E
25|$|He says {{religion}} has always stopped the philosophers and scientists from gaining knowledge because the Christian religion {{is opposed to}} any knowledge that differs from Biblical knowledge. Hedgel is indifferent to what the Bible says. He writes in his Philosophy of Religion If at the present day philosophy be an object of enmity because it occupies itself with religion, this cannot really surprise us {{when we consider the}} general character of the time. Every one who attempts to take to do with the knowledge of God, and by the aid of thought to comprehend His nature, must be prepared to find, that either no attention will be paid to him, or that people will turn against him and combine to oppose him. The more the knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that the extension of the sciences has become almost <b>boundless,</b> and all regions of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view impossible so much the more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become contracted.|$|E
25|$|That day was, I fear, {{the fatal}} term of local patriotism. On that day, I fear, {{there was an}} end of that narrow scheme of {{relations}} called our country, with all its pride, its prejudices, and its partial affects. All the little quiet rivulets, that watered an humble, a contracted, but not an unfruitful field, are to {{be lost in the}} waste expanse, and <b>boundless,</b> barren ocean of the homicide philanthropy of France. It is no longer an object of terrour, the aggrandizement of a new power, which teaches as a professor that philanthropy in their chair; whilst it propagates by arms, and establishes by conquest, the comprehensive system of universal fraternity. In what light is all this viewed in a great assembly? The party which takes the lead there has no longer any apprehensions, except those that arise from not being admitted to the closest and most confidential connexions with the metropolis of that fraternity. That reigning party no longer touches on its favourite subject, the display of those horrours, that must attend the existence of a power, with such dispositions and principles, seated in the heart of Europe.|$|E
25|$|From {{that time}} he dropped his first name and was always known as Stacy Waddy. After acting {{for a short period}} as curate to Bishop Stretch at Newcastle, New South Wales, he was given the {{difficult}} parish of Stockton, New South Wales {{on the other side of}} the harbour, then much overloaded with debt. Waddy tackled his task with enthusiasm, wrote his first book, a short one on confirmation, Come for Strength, published in London in 1904, and by the middle of the same year had succeeded in paying off the parish debts. His energy was <b>boundless,</b> as in this year he wrote various tracts, gave over 40 lantern lecture averaged over six services a Sunday in his own parish, travelling about 30 miles on his bicycle, became bishop's chaplain and secretary of the clerical society, and also managed to fit in some very successful cricket. In December 1903 at West Maitland against Plum Warner's English eleven which included such well-known bowlers as Hurst, Len Braund, Ted Arnold, Bernard Bosanquet and Fielder, he made 93 and 102. Had he accepted the suggestion that he should get a position in Sydney and play cricket, it is likely that he would have gained a place in the New South Wales eleven.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} {{of natural gas}} (about 1830); {{the building of the}} Pontchartrain Rail-Road (183031), one of the earliest in the United States; the {{introduction of}} the first steam-powered cotton press (1832), {{and the beginning of the}} public school system (1840) marked these years; foreign exports more than doubled in the period 1831–1833. In 1838 the commercially-important New Basin Canal opened a shipping route from the Lake to uptown New Orleans. Travelers in this decade have left pictures of the animation of the river trade more congested in those days of river boats, steamers, and ocean-sailing craft than today; of the institution of slavery, the quadroon balls, the medley of Latin tongues, the disorder and carousing of the river-men and adventurers that filled the city. Altogether there was much of the wildness of a frontier town, and a seemingly <b>boundless</b> promise of prosperity. The crisis of 1837, indeed, was severely felt, but did not greatly retard the city's advancement, which continued unchecked until the Civil War. In 1849 Baton Rouge replaced New Orleans as the capital of the state. In 1850 telegraphic communication was established with St. Louis and New York City; in 1851 the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern railway, the first railway outlet northward, later part of the Illinois Central, and in 1854 the western outlet, now the Southern Pacific, were begun.|$|E
