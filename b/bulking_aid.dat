40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a kinetic and {{transport}} model for diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC) with a satisfactory compromise between accuracy and computational demands for robust simulation of transient full-scale operation. Specifically the model accounts for surface concentrations of key species needed to capture transient features for typical lean exhaust conditions. In addition, the model accounts for transport limitations and distinguish them from reaction kinetics as well as apparent NO oxidation inhibition effects due to reactions. To achieve this, lab scale experiments were performed with DOCs with different platinum loadings and three different washcoat configurations of which two had an inert top layer. Both kinetic parameters for a detailed kinetic model and effective diffusivities were optimized for the experimental data using a single channel catalyst model. The experiments showed a clear effect of increased transport resistance for propene and CO and also that NO 2 plays an important role as an oxidizing agent for preferentially CO at low temperature (< 120 °C). The resulting model showed good agreement with measurement data using O, CO and NO 2 as the only surface species.

40|$|This thesis explores {{accountability}} in international {{aid to the}} Republic of Georgia in 2008 - 2009. Conceptualizing accountability as the obligation to manage the expectations of multiple stakeholders with often divergent interests, it challenges the common assumption that making aid more accountable per se will automatically lead to better aid. Instead, it argues that accountability relationships reflect power relationships; power influences which stakeholders' expectations are met, to what degree they are met, {{and what kinds of}} accountability demands by which stakeholders are viewed as legitimate and therefore entail an organizational obligation to respond. After discussing the links between power and {{accountability in}} international aid, with particular reference to donors, NGOs and the Georgian government, the thesis proceeds to explore how power and accountability relationships have influenced the allocation, management and implementation of international aid in Georgia, focusing on the aftermath of the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia. Based on extensive fieldwork in Georgia during 2008 - 2009, the thesis examines the influence of power and accountability relationships on emergency relief operations, the composition of an international aid package worth USD 4. 5 billion, donor involvement in formulating state policy on internally displaced persons and the subsequent donor-financed provision of housing to the displaced, and the provision of <b>bulk</b> food <b>aid</b> to conflict-affected Georgians. This thesis concludes that accountability relationships in international aid reflect power relationships. As aid recipients wield little or no power over donors and NGOs, these aid providers often can (and do) ignore the expectations generated by this stakeholder group, instead giving priority to managing the competing expectations of more powerful stakeholders. Therefore, the widely observed lack of effectiveness of international aid is not due to an overall lack of accountability within international aid, as is commonly believed. Rather, aid is often ineffective at relieving human suffering and generating pro-poor development because aid providers are primarily accountable to powerful stakeholders with little interest in making aid more effective.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to design systems that harvest solar light and convert this into {{chemical}} energy, the primary aim of the work presented in this thesis was to develop complex metal oxide materials that were active photocatalysts under visible light. The existing methods for visible light incorporation into photocatalytically active materials are reviewed. Of these, metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) between bimetallic surface- grafted assemblies was taken as particular inspiration. It was hypothesised that MMCT between metal centres within a bulk complex metal oxide could be similarly applied to yield photocatalytic ally active charge carriers. This approach {{takes advantage of the}} stability of bulk systems and the ability to tune the compositions of complex oxide materials. Moreover, it was proposed that MMCT between metal centres located on crystallographically distinct sites of a <b>bulk</b> material would <b>aid</b> charge separation and migration throughout the extended lattice. The optical properties of the RE 2 Ti 207 (RE = Y, La, Ce, Pr) and Ba 2 XTizM 3015 (X = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Bi; M = Nb, Ta) series, which include some novel cerium(III) titanates, revealed systematic changes in the electronic structures of these materials. These were rationalised with respect to the energy of Ln 4 f states. The proposed electronic structures present the partial achievement of the bulk MMCT hypothesis, with optical transitions from occupied Ce 4 f midgap states to the unoccupied primarily Ti 3 d conduction band. These Ce 3 + /rr" charge transfer materials were inactive photocatalysts, attributed to the presence the Ce 4 f-based midgap states that facilitate charge recombination. The double perovskite CaCu 3 T 40 IZ, with A-site Cu 2 + and B-site Ti 4 + cations and whose dielectric properties have been studied extensively in the past, is an ideal candidate for the two site MMCT strategy. Here, the optical and photocatalytic properties, rationalised with the aid of DFT calculations, present the partial achievement of the bulk MMCT hypothesis. Sol-gel derived Pt-CaCu 3 Ti 4012 is an active photocatalyst toward the visible light photo-oxidation of model pollutants methyl orange (MO) and 4 -chlorophenol (4 CP). Optical spectra and product analysis show that these reactions proceed via more selective routes than the typical reaction over TiOz P 25 under DV light. Interestingly, the products of 4 CP photo-oxidation were shown to be dependent on the wavelength of incident light. Cu-doping of BizTiz 07 was found to stabilise the pyrochlore structure with respect to the Aurivillius phase Bi 4 Ti 3012 and to impart significant visible light absorption. Sol-gel derived Pt-BiI. 6 Cuo. 4 Tiz 07 photo-oxidised MO under visible light via conventional band gap excitation, as determined by quantum efficiency measurements. In contrast, sol-gel derived Pt-B 4 Ti 3012 photo-oxidised MO via the excitation of adsorbed MO, and was also active toward 4 CP photo-oxidation under visible light. The excitation method, mechanisms and product distributions have been investigated for each of the photo-oxidation reactions presented in this thesis. In particular, the photo- oxidation of MO over some Pt-modified metal oxides has been shown to proceed via excitation of adsorbed MO and not of the semiconductor. Additionally, the mechanism and products of these processes are far more selective than the related DV reactions over TiOz P 25, and have been shown to depend to some extent on the semiconductor support.

We have studied the CO species generated from both fuel and CO-saturated media to observe site conversion of the CO species on polycrystalline platinum and platinum single crystal surfaces with respect to concentration, composition of electrolyte, and potential with electrochemical techniques and broad-band sum frequency generation spectroscopy (BB-SFG). In situ BB-SFG allows for the chemical analysis of electrode surfaces to examine details of surface electrochemical reactions. SFG is based on a second order nonlinear optical process that is forbidden in centrosymmetric media. Therefore, SFG is intrinsically interface-sensitive and enables surface chemical measurements without contribution from the <b>bulk.</b> With the <b>aid</b> of a femtosecond IR laser, we probe vibrational transitions of adsorbates in real time on the electrode surface as the potential at the surface is scanned at rates up to 5 mV/s. Studies of CO species, other reaction intermediates, and adsorbates will be discussed in relation to their poisoning of catalysis by single crystal Pt electrodes. These experiments demonstrate the sensitivity of the BB-SFG technique to the adsorbed species, and its capability to examine adsorption site conversions of the species on the electrode surface. In formic acid fuel solution, in situ BB-SFG was used to obtain vibrational spectra of CO adsorbates produced from formic acid oxidation on a Pt(100) electrode in sulfuric acid and perchloric acid media. The BB-SFG simultaneously monitored all forms of the CO intermediates, including steady-state, as the potential was scanned at 5 mV/s. Spectra were compared to those obtained from CO adsorbed from a CO-saturated electrolyte. While adsorbed from HCOOH, CO had a sharp atop transition near 2050 cm- 1 and a broader multiply-bonded transitions in the 1700 - 1900 cm- 1 range, which appear to result from bridge-like and higher-coordinated (possibly fourfold) CO. As the potential was scanned from - 0. 2 to 0. 3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the bridge-like CO disappeared and the amount of atop CO increased. At potentials above 0. 5 V, CO was in steady-state, being oxidized on the surface to CO 2 and replenished by CO from HCOOH. These measurements show that BB-SFG can observe potential-dependent interconversion of different CO forms on the electrode surface and can measure steady-state reaction intermediates on a surface in real time. In situ BB-SFG was also employed to study ethanol on platinum electrodes as a means to elucidate the mechanism of this reaction on catalyst surfaces for fuel cell applications. Recently, the interest in ethanol has increased, not only as a renewable resource, but especially as a fuel source due to its high theoretical yield of 12 electrons released upon complete oxidation. Incomplete oxidation, a major setback with ethanol oxidation, forms byproducts and intermediates slowing the oxidation reaction or prohibiting it from occurring further. Among the byproducts are acetic acid and acetaldehyde, where the C-C bond is not yet broken, or the intermediate CO, where the C-C bond has been broken and is further oxidized to CO 2. Using simultaneous electrochemical techniques and broad-band sum frequency generation, these byproducts and intermediates formed on platinum electrodes will be discussed in both acidic and basic media, as a function of electrolyte composition and ethanol concentration...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} my master thesis had {{manifold}} goals {{with the aim}} of learning different research approaches, techniques and expertises at this stage of my career. The studied area is the southwestern portion of the Tauern Window of the Eastern Alps exposing the metagranitoids and the derived mylonites forming the core of the Penninic basement nappe exposed beneath the Austroalpine unit. The study of the area has addressed different topics ranging from the regional tectonics of this part of the Eastern Alps to more process-oriented issues such as the nucleation of ductile shear zones and the processes of fluid-rock interaction during deformation. The thesis has involved 2 campaigns of field work addressed to the structural analysis in several selected areas and the characterization of samples in the lab by different methods. The Tauern Window is a major tectonic feature of Eastern Alps where the Alpine Pennidic tectonic unit (nappe) is exposed beneath the Austroalpine nappe. The sequence of Alpine deformation events should be recorded in the field by a series of overprinting fabrics including mylonites and faults with a different kinematics: (i) thrusting associated with the stage of nappe stacking; (ii) strike-slip associated with the component of lateral escape, and (iii) normal “faulting” associated with the unroofing of the exhuming nappe pile and with the activity of the Brenner Fault system (Goldny et al., 2008). The structural field work was mainly addressed to identify and map the structures associated with the different tectonic components described above in the southwestern border of the Tauern Window. The structural study followed the reference scheme given by previous works of Mancktelow and Pennacchioni (2005) and Pennacchioni and Mancktelow (2007) for the Neves area was extended during my master thesis (i) N-S to cover a complete traverse across the tectonic unit (from the Neves area to the Zillertal Valley) and (ii) E-W over a distance of ca. 8 km (from the Moosboden glacial cirque to the Hochfeiler area). The structural sequence includes a phase of ductile deformation, syn-kinematic to amphibolite facies conditions, and a later overprint by cataclastic faults. The ductile deformation is heterogeneously distributed and this partitioning is scale-independent. Within the low strain domain the ductile deformation is localized at the outcrop scale to a network of discrete (of as much as a few meters thick) shear zones. This structural evolution indicates a NNWSSE to almost N-S shortening during the Alpine deformation from the synmetamorphic (amphibolite facies: 550 – 600 °C, 0. 4 - 0. 7 GPa) mylonites to the brittle faulting during exhumation, respectively. Both the mylonites and the faults of the Neves area have a strike-slip kinematics. Both the ductile and the brittle deformation occurred under hydrous conditions as witnessed by the common occurrence of veins associated with deformation structures. An episode of fluidrock interaction postdated the main phase of faulting and is associated with the local development of episyenites. Structures linked to thrust and exhumation tectonics are missing from our are. Thrust structures are likely to have been overprinted by the following strike-slip lateral escape tectonics. Exhumation structures instead seems to be confined to a narrow deformation zone along the Brenner Line. The western zone have a homogeneous distribution of the strain, and the comparison between homogeneous deformation structures and partitioned structures has allowed us to define the zone as a purely constrictional transpression zone (Fossen & Tikoff, 1998). However, the partitioning in strain intensity over the region is not associated with a partitioning of components of thrusting, lateral escape and detachment in no stage of deformation, as is instead observed in other geological contexts (Fossen et al., 1994). The study area provides an ideal natural laboratory {{for the study of the}} process of ductile shear zone nucleation. It provides spectacular glacier-polished outcrops within metagranitoids that preserve all stages of incremental development of structures in a relatively simple and “isotropic” material. The field observations indicates: In contrast with numerical and rock-analogue models (e. g. Mancktelow, 2002; Mancktelow and Pennacchioni, 2014) shear zone nucleation never occurred within homogeneous metagranodiorites Almost any structural or compositional (rheological) surface heterogeneity (e. g. fractures, dykes, veins and lithological contacts) was capable of been exploited by localized shear deformation. The type of exploited precursor determined the type of shear zone and geometrical characters: (i) weak precursors compared to the host metagranodiorites (“unfilled” fractures; quartz veins; biotite-rich basic dykes) localized strain: shear zones have commonly a rather homogeneous strain distribution and a sharp boundary to almost undeformed host rock; (ii) strong layers (aplite dykes; alteration haloes surrounding veins) localized the deformation at their boundaries forming paired shear zoned at their selvages mainly developed within the metagranodiorite. Reactivation of original ductile shear zones can explain the controversial sense of shear of some paired shear zones exploiting the alteration halos surrounding epidote-filled veins. This contrasting sense of shears is interpreted as due to Alpine reactivation of original ductile shear zones developed in the pre-Alpine granitoid protolith as result of the original evolution during pluton cooling similar to what is described for some intrusions elsewhere (e. g. Pennacchioni, 2005; Pennacchioni and Zucchi, 2013). The latest episode of fluid-rock interaction, which has not been previously described, is responsible for the formation of local episyenites which postdated the main episode of brittle faulting. Episyenites are quartz-depleted, alkalimetasomatized granitoids (Cathelineau, 1986), strictly connected to either brittle or ductile shear zones (Rossi et al. 2005), and characterized by a conspiquous porosity. The field study has indicated that episyenites are associated to cataclastic faults but do not pervasively exploited the fault structure; fluid flow and alteration were not influenced by compositional and/or textural anisotropies of the host rock; no clear relation between fault slip and episyenite volume was observed. The composition of the host rock influence the spatial development, indeed quartz-poor lithologies commonly limit the diffusion of the fluid and of the alteration; in a similar way ductile textures of the host rock may limit or restrain the fluid diffusion. Mass-balance calculation from XRF <b>bulk</b> chemistry, <b>aided</b> with μ-CT volume evaluation, suggest that episyenites are due to a Na-metasomatism of parent rock and that have a particular paragnesis including: Plagioclase (Plg 2 :Ab 99 that overgrows Plg 1 :Ab 85) + Vermicular Chlorite + Adularia + Calcite ± Anatase ± Hematite ± Apatite.
