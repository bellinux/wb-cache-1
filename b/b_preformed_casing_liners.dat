40|$|Gas turbine axial {{compressor}} blades may encounter damage during service for various reasons. Debris from casing or foreign objects may impact blades causing damage near the rotor’s tip. This {{may result in}} deterioration of performance and reduction in the surge margin. Ability to assess the effect of damaged blades on the compressor performance and stability is important at both the design stage and in service. The damage to compressor blades breaks the cyclic symmetry of the compressor assembly. Thus computations {{have to be performed}} using the whole annulus. Moreover, if rotating stall or surge occurs, the downstream boundary conditions are not known and simulations become difficult. This paper presents an unsteady CFD analysis of compressor performance with tip curl damage. Tip curl damage typically occurs when rotor blades hit a loose <b>casing</b> <b>liner.</b> The computations were performed up to the stall boundary, predicting rotating stall patterns. The aim is to assess the effect of blade damage on stall margin and provide better understanding of the flow behaviour during rotating stall.

This may be achieved using an impingement cooling scheme on the external casing. Such systems can be optimized to increase the contraction capability for a given casing cooling flow. Typically, this is achieved by changing the cooled area and local casing features, such as the external flanges or the external cooling geometry. This paper reports {{the effectiveness of a}} range of impingement cooling arrangements in typical engine casing closure system.

The investigation is primarily numerical, however, a baseline case has been validated experimentally in tests using a transient liquid crystal technique. Steady numerical simulations using the realizable k-ε, k-ω SST, and EARSM turbulence models were conducted to understand the variation in the predicted local heat transfer coefficient distribution. A constant mass flow rate was used as a constraint at each engine condition, approximately corresponding to a constant feed pressure when the manifold exit area is constant.

40|$|Introduction When {{drilling}} an oil well, {{the well}} is lined by sinking a steel <b>casing,</b> or <b>liner,</b> into the drilling mud (see Figure 1). The {{inside of the}} liner forms a central pipe, and leaves an annular gap between {{the outside of the}} liner and the surrounding rock. The inside and outside of the liner are initially filled with drilling mud, which is displaced by pumping a sequence of fluids down inside the liner from the surface. Typically, a chemical wash is pumped down first, followed by a spacer, and finally a cement slurry. The wash, which is usually water based, is less dense than the spacer, a water-based suspension, which is itself less dense than the cement slurry. The scenario of a light wash being forced down a pipe by a denser spacer fluid is liable to instabilities of Rayleigh [...] Taylor type. The two fluids are miscible, so mixing between the wash and the spacer is likely to take place. This may impair the intended efficiency of the wash in displacing mud from the wall...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{electromagnetic}} (TEM) {{techniques are}} widely used {{in the field of}} geophysical prospecting. In borehole detection, the nondestructive inspection (NDI) of a metal pipe can be performed efficiently using the properties of eddy currents. However, with increasing concern for safety in oil and gas production, more than one string of pipe is used to protect wellbores, which complicates data interpretation. In this paper, an auxiliary sensor-based borehole TEM system for the NDI of multipipe strings is presented. On the basis of the characteristics of the borehole TEM model, we investigate the principle behind the NDI of multipipe strings using multiple time slices of induced electromotive force (EMF) in a single sensor. The results show that the detection performance of NDI is strongly influenced by eddy-current diffusion in the longitudinal direction. To solve this problem, we used time slices of the induced EMF in both the main and auxiliary sensors.

Migration takes place at a rapid rate, even during the vulcanisation of the composite. After 4000 hours ageing in nitrogen at 100 oC, there is {{a higher level of}} antidegradants in the casing than in the sidewall. An equilibrium distribution is not obtained. After 114 days at 50 oC in 95 % relative humidity, the level of solvent extractable 6 PPD fell to zero, but subsequent ageing for 2 years in 50 pphm ozone showed no evidence of sidewall cracking. It is suggested that the antidegradant is still active but linked to the polymer chain. An analytical method, for the type and amount of sulphenamide accelerators in vulcanised rubber compounds, has been developed. During the vulcanisation process, the accelerators decay, liberating specific amines which have been solvent extracted, derivatised with 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene and the yellow coloured zwitter ion analysed using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography. The decay of the accelerator and sulphur during the vulcanisation process, has been studied.

40|$|Drilling with <b>casing</b> and <b>liner</b> are {{unconventional}} drilling methods {{developed to}} reduce both the non-productive {{time spent on}} drilling operations and drilling time in general. A <b>casing</b> or <b>liner</b> string is used as the drillstring, {{and the number of}} operations is therefore reduced from two to one as drilling and casing of the wellbore are performed in one operation. Even though there are many benefits with this drilling method, there are also some drawbacks and operational considerations. Statoil and Baker Hughes have developed a rotary steerable liner drilling system, called the Steerable Drilling Liner (SDL). Two offshore test wells have been drilled with this system, and Statoil is now planning to utilize it on more wells in the North Sea. The Oseberg field is a candidate field for liner drilling due to stability problems in the Draupne and Ness formations. Two wells on the Oseberg field have therefore been chosen as the candidate wells for this thesis. The case histories of the test wells show that the limitation may be the low flow rate circulated through the liner, which may cause cuttings accumulation on top of the liner where the flow area suddenly expands. A flow diverter is therefore developed to have more flexibility in the choice of flow rate above the liner. The flow diverter and other solutions to improve the hole cleaning have been evaluated in this thesis. The high annular circulating pressure is another issue with the liner drilling technique. Many of the factors which improve hole cleaning also increase the annular pressure. The ECD must also be taken into consideration when optimizing the hole cleaning of the candidate wells. The simulations of hole cleaning and annular circulating pressure for the SDL system have been performed in WellPlan. The recommended flow rate for hole cleaning in the sections above the liner is at least 500 lpm higher than the maximum possible flow rate through the liner. By circulating this recommended rate through the liner, the equivalent circulating density increases. The circulating pressure exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation for the 7 ” SDL system. It is therefore not an alternative to come up with solutions to be able to circulate with a higher flow rate through the SDL system. A flow diverter above the liner is the best solution to increase the flow rate in the critical part of the well. With the flow diverter above the liner, the flow rate can be increased to the minimum required rate for hole cleaning {{and at the same time}} keep the equivalent circulating density at an acceptable level. The increased flow rate above the flow diverter will have minimal effect on the annular circulating pressure below the previous casing shoe. The simulations also showed that this minimum rate can be significantly reduced by changing the drilling fluid parameters. If the flow rate is kept constant, the bed height of cuttings can be reduced by optimizing the fluid parameters. Optimization of the drilling fluid is also important to make sure the cleaning in the annulus outside the liner is good. The required rate could be reduced further by increasing the rotation of the string and increasing the size of the drillpipe above the liner, and these solutions have been evaluated. Future work should include the development of a simulation program that can include all the downhole tools and components required for the Steerable Drilling Liner system, including two flow split components. The simulation program should also be able to handle the combination of a pilot bottom hole assembly and an underreamer to ream the hole to full size, and then calculate the correct amount of cuttings in the annulus. The drilling fluids should also be optimized to improve the hole cleaning in liner drilling operations further. </p...|$|R

In this study, we investigated the functions of two staphylococcal biofilm matrix polymers: poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide (PNAG) and extracellular DNA (ecDNA). We measured the ability of a PNAG-degrading enzyme (dispersin B) and DNase I to inhibit biofilm formation, detach preformed biofilms, and sensitize biofilms to killing by the cationic detergent cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) in a 96 -well microtiter plate assay.

Typically, the CMV genome remains dormant in infected cells, but a breakdown of immune surveillance can lead to re-activation of viral replication in the gut mucosa, which is not necessarily associated with viremia or changes in antibody titers. We hypothesized that the detection of CMV-specific CD 8 effector T cells should permit the distinction between dormant and active CMV infection. As CD 8 effector T cells, unlike memory CD 8 T cells, have perforin (PFN) and granzyme <b>B</b> (GzB) <b>preformed</b> in their cytoplasmic granules, we employed single cell resolution ELISPOT assays to measure the CMV antigen-triggered release of these molecules by CD 8 T cells isolated from subjects with IBD, and age-matched healthy controls. The frequencies of CMV-specific (GzB) and PFN-producing CD 8 T cells were increased in IBD patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, the increased CMV reactivity was associated with active IBD disease and with longer disease duration. Notably, PCR on serum frequently failed to detect CMV DNA during flares. The data show that during active IBD there is a flare of CD 8 T cell activity against CMV in a substantial proportion of IBD patients, suggesting CMV reactivation that serum PCR does not detect. While it remains open whether CMV reactivation is a cause or consequence of IBD, our data suggest that monitoring CMV antigen-specific effector CD 8 T cells with GzB and PFN ELISPOT analysis can provide novel insights {{into the role of}} CMV infection in IBD. Additionally, our data have implications for the fields of transplantation, HIV, cancer, and autoimmune diseases, in all of which patient care critically depends on sensitive and reliable detection of a reactivation of CMV infection...|$|R
