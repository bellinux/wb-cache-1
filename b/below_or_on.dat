25|$|It is, however, {{unlikely}} that a well-funded belligerent {{with nuclear weapons}} would waste their weapons with fuzing to explode <b>below</b> <b>or</b> <b>on</b> the surface, as both test shot Baker, and Castle Bravo were respectively. Instead, to maximize the range of city blast destruction and immediate death, an air burst is preferred, as the ≈500 meter explosion heights of the only nuclear weapons used on cities, Little Boy and Fat Man also attests to. Moreover, with air bursts {{the total amount of}} radiation contained in the fallout, in units of activity/Becquerel, is somewhat less than the total that would be released from a surface or subsurface burst, as in comparison, depending on the height of burst, little to no neutron activation or neutron induced gamma activity of soil occurs from air bursts.|$|E
2500|$|John Varley {{left his}} account of these {{sessions}} that took place almost nightly, recording some dates and circumstances of the evenings. He {{made a lot of}} detailed inscriptions <b>below</b> <b>or</b> <b>on</b> the back of Blake’s drawings that help to classify them. [...] He also created two lists known as “Varley’s lists of Visionary Heads” (A & B) where he specified about 90 titles (some of them repeated) [...] of [...] “Portraits Drawn by W. Blake from Visions which appeared to him & Remained while he completed them…” [...] John Linnell, who also was involved in these events and copied many of Blake’s [...] "Visionary Heads" [...] to engrave them later for Varley’s “Treatise”, wrote his own account and views on this subject in his “Journal” and “Autobiography” (fully cited by Gerald Eades Bentley Jr. in his “Blake Records”, see in the Bibliography below).

You can't see it from above, because it's a hollow, as if a bit of rock had fallen out. Of course, if you stood up you might be seen by someone <b>below,</b> <b>or</b> <b>on</b> the hill opposite; but it's so high it is not likely anyone would notice you. Anyhow, if you lie down there, no one would see you. I have been down there, often and often, since. When she gets too bad to bear, I go down there and take a sleep; or lie there and laugh, when I think how she is hunting about for me to carry down the pails to the stream, for water." ...|$|E
60|$|But he did {{not come}} in that evening; and, too upset to eat or do anything, she went up to bed at ten o'clock. When she had undressed, she stole across to the nursery; she had a longing {{to have the baby}} with her--a feeling that to leave her was not safe. She carried her off, still sleeping, and, locking her doors, got into bed. Having warmed a nest with her body for the little creature, she laid it there; and then for a long time lay awake, expecting every minute to hear him return. She fell asleep at last, and woke with a start. There were vague noises down <b>below</b> <b>or</b> <b>on</b> the stairs. It must be he! She had left the light on in her room, and she leaned over to look at the baby's face. It was still sleeping, drawing its tiny breaths peacefully, little dog-shivers passing every now and then over its face. Gyp, shaking back her dark plaits of hair, sat up by its side, {{straining}} her ears.|$|E
50|$|There {{had been}} some {{controversy}} about whether to build the rail through Tysons Corner <b>below</b> ground <b>or</b> <b>on</b> elevated tracks.

6000|$|From {{the top of}} {{the palace}} you may read if you please the Book of Ezekiel written in stone upon the hillside. Coming up, the Englishman had seen the city from <b>below</b> <b>or</b> <b>on</b> a level. He now looked into its very heart--the heart that had ceased to beat. There was no sound of men or cattle, or grind-stones in those pitiful streets--nothing but the cooing of the pigeons. At first it seemed that the palace was not ruined at all--that soon the women would come up on the house-tops and the bells would ring in the temples. But as he {{attempted}} to follow with his eye the turns of the streets, the Englishman saw that they died out in wood tangle and blocks of fallen stone, that some of the houses were rent with great cracks, and pierced from roof to road with holes that let in the morning sun. The drip-stones of the eaves were gap-toothed, and the tracery of the screens had fallen out so that zenana-rooms lay shamelessly open to the day. On the outskirts of the city, the strong-walled houses dwindled and sank down to mere stone-heaps and faint indications of plinth and wall, hard to trace against the background of stony soil. The shadow of the palace lay over two-thirds {{of the city and the}} trees deepened the shadow. [...] "He who has bent him o'er the dead" [...] after the hour of which Byron sings, knows that the features of the man become blunted as it were--the face begins to fade. The same hideous look lies on the face of the Queen of the Pass, and when once this is realised, the eye wonders that it could have ever believed in the life of her. She is the city [...] "whose graves are set in the side of the pit, and her company is round about her graves," [...] sister of Pathros, Zoan, and No.|$|E

5000|$|Each vowel has two forms, an {{independent}} form when {{not part of}} a consonant, and a dependent form, when attached to a consonant.

There are 54 brief forms for the most frequent words and syllables in the German language and rules for forming free abbreviations. These brief forms are distinguishable by size and position (three of them: above, <b>below,</b> <b>or</b> <b>on</b> the base line). Special endings and syllables can be omitted. There are more than additional 120 brief forms in Aufbauschrift II to write up to about 400 syllables per minute. It is possible to omit special consonants, vowels and syllables.|$|E
5000|$|Consonants in Boyd's {{system are}} shown, in the main, by {{orientation}} (horizontal, vertical, or 45° from those directions) {{and direction of}} writing. In Merrill, they are shown by position above, <b>below,</b> <b>or</b> <b>on</b> the writing line; also, in Merrill a syllable such as [...] "lad" [...] which starts and ends with a consonant is written on a slant which starts at the height associated with [...] "l" [...] and ends at the height associated with [...] "d." [...] This is the only situation in which strokes are made to slant.|$|E
50|$|The shorthand's form {{is based}} on {{borrowings}} from natural longhand, as opposed to geometric or elliptical systems, such as Gregg and Pitman. The strokes are distinguishable by size, proportion, position (three of them: above, <b>below,</b> <b>or</b> <b>on</b> the base line), and shading (variation of thickness of strokes). Shading, normally used for marking an /a/ vowel, is nowadays difficult to achieve with a ballpoint pen, {{but at the time}} of invention was convenient for marking, using the then-ubiquitous pencils. Nevertheless, ambiguity is close to none, even when thickness is not marked, because words are easily recognizable from the context.|$|E

5000|$|Note that {{nonlinear}} {{programs are}} hard to solve due {{to the possibility of}} being stuck at a local maximum. However, when the program is convex, any local maximum is the global maximum. A convex program is to maximize a concave function or minimize a convex function on a convex set. A set S is convex if , [...] where [...] That is to say, any point between two points in the set must also be an element of the set. A function f is concave if [...] A function f is convex if [...] Informally, a function is concave if the line segment connecting two points on the graph lies above or on the graph, while a function is convex if <b>below</b> <b>or</b> <b>on</b> the graph. Thus, by rewriting the objective function into an equivalent convex function, we can reformulate the program to be convex, which can be solved using optimization packages.|$|E
40|$|Using {{the method}} of paired comparisons, pairs of {{simultaneous}} horizontal or vertical lines, with one line above and one <b>below</b> <b>or</b> one <b>on</b> the left {{and one on the}} right of a fixation point, respectively, were presented tachistoscopically for length comparison. Space errors were found to have a pattern similar to that of time errors. The tendency to guess the comparative response from the absolute magnitude of stimuli is proposed as a basis for-time-and-space -errors. Manipulation of attentional scanning, which implies a more frequent usage of this guessing strategy for one of the two lines in a pair, was shown to affect space errors...|$|R
