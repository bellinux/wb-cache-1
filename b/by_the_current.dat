5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted {{to revisit the}} {{previous}} proposal to reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King wrote that he believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games {{and how it will}} impact the postseason, and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> format.|$|E

5|$|The James F. Byrnes Bridge {{was built}} in 1956. It was a two-lane toll swing bridge {{constructed}} {{at a cost of}} $1.5 million that opened the island to automobile traffic from the mainland. The swing bridge was hit by a barge in 1974 which shut down all vehicle traffic to the island until the Army Corps of Engineers built and manned a pontoon bridge while the bridge was being repaired. The swing bridge was replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> four-lane bridge in 1982.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1867, and {{originally}} included a drawbridge section at its north end for tall ships to pass, {{though this was}} later replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> swing bridge section. In 1980, woodworm threatened {{the safety of the}} bridge, which needed major repairs to avoid closure. Tolls were collected for foot and cycle traffic until 2013. The bridge is a Grade II* listed structure, and has one of the longest timber viaducts still in regular use in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} narrow and {{structurally}} unsound, leading {{the authorities to}} rename it Chelsea Bridge to avoid the Royal Family's association with a potential collapse. In 1926 it was proposed that the old bridge be rebuilt or replaced, due to the increased volume of users from population growth, {{and the introduction of}} the automobile. It was demolished during 1934–1937, and replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> structure, which opened in 1937.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the edge}} reduces {{the size of}} <b>the</b> eddy <b>current</b> on each side, since it interferes with <b>the</b> {{circular}} <b>current.</b> Moving <b>the</b> plate sideways increases <b>the</b> <b>current</b> on one side, since the edge is interfering less, and this pushes that side higher.

5|$|The ground has {{undergone}} several major changes since its original construction in 1905.

The new Main Stand was split into two: the upper tier contained wooden seats, {{so there was a}} ban on smoking in the stand; the lower tier, which became known as the Enclosure, was terracing.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of other}} species of caddisfly make nets rather than cases. These are silken webs {{stretching}} between aquatic vegetation and over stones. These net-making larvae usually live in running water, different species occupying different habitats with varying water speeds. There is a constant drift of invertebrates washed downstream <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>current,</b> and these animals, and bits of debris, accumulate in the nets which serve both as food traps and as retreats.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of decline, the Sheffield economy {{is going through a}} strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study {{revealed}} that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents {{during the second half of}} 2004. This can be seen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> surge of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul's Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment, the forthcoming NRQ and the recently completed Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and many projects under the Sheffield One redevelopment agency. The Sheffield economy grew from £5.6billion in 1997 (1997 GVA) to £9.2billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).|$|E

50|$|A Scanning SQUID Microscope is a {{sensitive}} near-field imaging {{system for the}} measurement of weak magnetic fields by moving a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) across an area.

30|$|Contributions due to {{external}} sources depend largely on latitude, local time and solar activity.

At these latitudes night-time currents are much weaker (around three orders of magnitude less) than those observed during the day; nonetheless, they produce still measurable contributions (e.g. Park et al. 2009). At the poles the most intense ionospheric contributions are given <b>by</b> <b>the</b> auroral electrojets and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> field-aligned <b>currents</b> (FAC).|$|R
