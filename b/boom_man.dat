5000|$|In 1976, Cooney {{started working}} as a <b>boom</b> <b>man</b> on the motion picture Roar {{considered}} to be the most dangerous film ever made then at Universal Studios. His first studio picture as production mixer was Blue Thunder for Columbia Pictures in 1981. Cooney was the first production mixer in history to have sound on his own web page. He had several animated items on his page as well, which had not been done at the time. The page has been taken down since his retirement. Cooney sat twice {{on the board of directors}} of the Cinema Audio Society is still a member of the motion picture academy of arts and sciences and the television academy of arts and sciences. Cooney was a producer on the movie the November Conspiracy. He also directed a few music videos, the most notable [...] "About Love" [...] with the singer Johnny Rivers. But one of his biggest works is for the movie Cliffhanger where he was nominated for an Academy Award.|$|E

60|$|The besiegers {{as well as}} the besieged saw {{the three}} ships advancing, and the former moved down to the shore, to repel the attempt. The {{batteries}} {{on either side of the}} <b>boom</b> were <b>manned,</b> and from them, and from the infantry gathered on the banks, a heavy fire was opened as the ships approached.|$|R

50|$|The Zendo Project {{conducted}} by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies uses principles from psychedelic therapy to provide safe places and emotional support for people having difficult experiences on psychedelic drugs at select festivals such as Burning <b>Man,</b> <b>Boom</b> Festival, and Lightning in a Bottle without medical or law enforcement intervention.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} hotelkeeper, {{accepting}} the proffered cigar with alacrity, [...] "we've struck quite a <b>boom.</b> There's a <b>man</b> clearing {{a lot of}} ground for a fruit ranch and putting up a smart frame house. Then they're cutting a couple of new trails. The boys are making good wages and they're all of them busy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] said he, [...] "that I {{see signs of}} {{weakening}} in the social <b>boom.</b> That <b>man</b> considers us exactly as we considered our lodging-house keeper in London. Now, it doesn't strike me that that sample person you was talking about, who is {{a cross between a}} rich farmer and a poor gentleman, would go into the lodging-house business." [...] I couldn't help agreeing with Jone, and I didn't like it a bit. The gentleman hadn't said anything or done anything that was out of the way, but there was a benignant loftiness about him which grated on the inmost fibres of my soul.|$|R
6000|$|The drum-sticks {{fell with}} a <b>boom,</b> and the <b>men</b> swung {{forward to the}} crash of the band. Dick felt the wind of the massed {{movement}} in his face, heard the maddening tramp of feet and the friction of the pouches on the belts. The big drum pounded out the tune. It was a music-hall refrain that made a perfect quickstep-- ...|$|R
6000|$|All the {{unengaged}} men sprang instantly to the forecastle, {{and their}} weight sank it slowly down, {{but it seemed}} inclined {{for a moment to}} remain balanced on the <b>boom.</b> Hereupon the <b>men</b> at the oars jumped up and also ran forward. The bow dipped at once, the good ship slid over with a plunge, and glided out upon the sea! ...|$|R
5000|$|Their society allowed polygamy. The Miskito {{population}} <b>boomed</b> as the <b>men</b> {{had more}} children with their slave women. These raids continued {{for many years}} after animosity between Britain and Spain ended at the international level. For a long time, the Miskito considered themselves superior to other indigenous tribes of the area, whom they referred to as [...] "wild". The Miskito commonly adopted European dress and English names.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{accounts}} {{agreed upon}} [...] "a lee-platform {{on the side}} opposite to the outrigger-frame, which also has a large platform of poles laid athwart its <b>booms,</b> whereon <b>men</b> are stationed to counterbalance any excessive heeling over toward the lee side when the wind increases in force". The windward float stabilizes the craft. This occurs [...] "by its weight rather than its buoyancy. When the float becomes submerged in a wave its increased drag swings the canoe slightly around into the wind, thereby relieving some of the wind pressure on the sail. The canoe slows down temporarily and allows the float to rise again." [...] This design feature also acts to reduce drift by tending to place the wind toward the beam or side of the craft.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of luxury}} {{purchases}} usually focus on high-end products targeting professionals. Thanks to an economic <b>boom,</b> working class <b>men</b> in mineral-rich regional Australia {{also have the}} financial wherewithal to purchase luxury items. This paper uses qualitative, convergent interviews to explore custom-crafted motorcycle purchases by skilled and semi-skilled workers in rural and remote Western Australia. The results suggest that key factors contributing to these luxury purchases are high income, relationship breakdowns, and the onset of middle age...|$|R
60|$|Of the lot, {{only one}} or two wore sarongs, the others having submitted--at least at sea--to the indignity of European trousers. Only two sat on the spars. One, a man with a childlike, light yellow face, smiling with fatuous imbecility under the wisps of {{straight}} coarse hair dyed a mahogany tint, was the tindal of the crew--a kind of boatswain's or serang's mate. The other, sitting beside him on the <b>booms,</b> was a <b>man</b> nearly black, not much bigger than a large ape, and wearing on his wrinkled face that look of comical truculence which is often characteristic of men from the southwestern coast of Sumatra.|$|R
25|$|Although World War II had {{interrupted}} {{production of}} the Ercoupe, general aviation manufacturers were enthusiastic about the prospects of a postwar aviation <b>boom.</b> Thousands of <b>men</b> and women were trained as pilots by the government, and the hope was that {{they would want to}} include flying in their civilian life. Production of the model 415-C resumed in 1945, and in 1946 alone 4,311 aircraft were produced and sold at a cost of US$2,665. This was the same price as in 1941. At its peak, ERCO was turning out 34 Ercoupes per day, operating three shifts per day. The aircraft was aggressively marketed through unconventional outlets such as the men's department of the Macy's department store chain.|$|R
50|$|Maricopaville {{developed}} {{south and}} west of the Wells, following construction of a railroad line from this terminus to Phoenix. In 1879, the Southern Pacific Railroad {{was in the process}} of building a railroad line from Yuma to Tucson, and a second railroad line was to be built from Maricopaville, wrapping around the western edge of South Mountain into Phoenix. With the railroad, Maricopaville took on the appearance of a gold rush California <b>boom</b> town, as <b>men</b> worked day and night building hotels, saloons, warehouses, restaurants, theaters, etc. One newspaper of the time reckoned that with its thousands of people and good location, Maricopaville would be an ideal choice for the location of the state capital.|$|R
2500|$|Yoon Do-hyun of {{rock band}} YB {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} see CNBLUE flourish into a [...] "true band" [...] and decided that [...] "it'd be great to give him [...] a hand". In conceiving [...] "Cruel Memories...", the pair sought to [...] "create a <b>boom</b> among Korean <b>men</b> so that they go to karaokes in duos and sing their hearts out with this song, facing each other". Jung first met JJ Lin in 2014 when he attended a CNBLUE concert in Taiwan. After meeting, they began to listen to each other's music and [...] "felt good about it"; they promised to collaborate. Jung invited him to collaborate, which Lin agreed upon. The two wrote [...] "Checkmate" [...] together, but recorded the song independently from one another.|$|R
60|$|Then I spied {{the mass}} of {{floating}} seaweed. I knew absolutely that my hook was going to snag it. But I tried to be careful, quick, accurate. I jumped my bait. It fell short. The hook caught fast in the kelp. In the last piece! The kite fluttered like a bird with broken wings and dropped. Captain Dan reversed the boat. Then he burst out. Now Dan {{was a big man}} and he had a stentorian voice, deep like <b>booming</b> thunder. No <b>man</b> ever swore as Dan swore then. It was terrible. It was justified. But it was funny, and despite all this agony of disappointment, despite the other boat heading into the tuna and putting them down, I laughed till I cried.|$|R

40|$|The Space Station Freedom Program is {{presently}} planned {{to consist of}} two phases. At the completion of Phase 1, Freedom's manned base will consist of a transverse <b>boom</b> with attached <b>manned</b> modules and 75 kW of available electric power supplied by photovoltaic (PV) power sources. In Phase 2, electric power available to the manned base will be increased to 125 kW {{by the addition of}} two solar dynamic (SD) power modules, one {{at each end of the}} transverse <b>boom.</b> Power for <b>manned</b> base growth beyond Phase 2 will be supplied by additional SD modules. Studies show that SD power for the growth eras will result in life cycle cost savings of $ 3 to $ 4 billion when compared to PV-supplied power. In the SD power modules for Space Station Freedom, an offset parabolic concentrator collects and focuses solar energy into a heat receiver. To allow full power operation over the entire orbit, the receiver includes integral thermal energy storage by means of the heat of fusion of a salt mixture. Thermal energy is removed from the receiver and converted to electrical energy by a power conversion unit (PCU) which includes a closed brayton cycle (CBC) heat engine and an alternator. The receiver/PCU/radiator combination will be completely assembled and charged with gas and cooling fluid on earth before launch to orbit. The concentrator subassemblies will be pre-aligned and stowed in the orbiter bay before launch. On orbit, the receiver/PCU/radiator assembly will be installed as a unit. The pre-aligned concentrator panels will then be latched together and the total concentrator attached to the receiver/PCU/radiator by the astronauts. After final electric connections are made and checkout is complete, the SD power module will be ready for operation...|$|R
50|$|Men in the Sun follows three Palestinian {{refugees}} {{seeking to}} travel from the refugee camps in Iraq, where they cannot find work, to Kuwait where they hope to find work as laborers in the oil <b>boom.</b> The three <b>men</b> each arrange with a clerk at a local store to be smuggled to Kuwait by a driver. The men are treated gruffly and are humiliated by the process. Once they finally arrange for travel, {{they are forced to}} ride {{in the back of the}} truck across the desert on their way to Kuwait. At several check points, the men hide in a large, empty, water tank in the stifling mid-day heat as the driver arranges paperwork to get through. After going through the last check point, within easy driving distance of the travelers' ultimate goal of Kuwait, the driver opens the tank to let the men out only to find they have died.|$|R
5000|$|On Christmas Eve, {{sometime}} after {{a woman is}} disemboweled in the woods of Christmastown, California by a man dressed as a pirate, a couple drive to a field, which the <b>man,</b> <b>Boom</b> Boom, claims is where Tommy [...] "Oneshoe" [...] McGroo buries his victims, the {{people who used to}} bully him. Boom Boom tells his girlfriend, Kitty, that Tommy acquired his nickname when one of his shoes was stolen, and he could not afford another due to his family's poverty. Tommy asked for replacement footwear for Christmas, but instead got an eyepatch with a Christmas tree on it, since he idolized pirates. Driven insane by this, Tommy began murdering his tormentors, though most consider him an urban legend. After telling Tommy's story, Boom Boom goes to urinate, and has his testicles ripped off by Tommy, who then wounds Kitty. Later, Tommy snaps the neck of man having kinky sex with his blindfolded wife, who Tommy then has sex with.|$|R
