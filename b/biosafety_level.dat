40|$|Aim: To {{detect and}} assess the {{activity}} of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes and to find differences in enzymograms between fungi isolated from wheat and rye samples and grown on Czapek-Dox Broth and Sabouraud Dextrose Broth enriched with cereal (wheat or rye). Isolated strains were also classified in the scale of <b>biosafety</b> <b>levels</b> (BSL). Material and methods: The study used 23 strains of fungi cultured from samples of wheat and rye (grain, grain dust obtained during threshing and soil) collected in the Lublin region (eastern Poland). API ZYM test (bioMérieux) was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Classification of BSL (<b>Biosafety</b> <b>levels)</b> {{was based on the}} current literature. Results : High enzymatic activity was found in strains cultured in media containing 1 % of wheat grain (Bipolaris holmi, Penicillium decumbens) and with an addition of 1 % of rye grain (Cladosporium herbarum, Aspergillus versicolor, Alternaria alternata). The total number of enzymes varied {{depending on the type of}} media, and in most cases it was higher in the culture where an addition of cereal grains was used. Conclusions : Isolated strains of fungi reveal differences in the profiles of the enzyme assay. It can be assumed that the substrate enriched in grains stimulate the higher activity of mold enzymes.

25|$|<b>Biosafety</b> <b>level</b> 1 (BSL-1) is {{suitable}} for work with well-characterized agents which do not cause disease in healthy humans. In general, these agents should pose minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. At this level, precautions are limited relative to other levels. Laboratory personnel must wash their hands upon entering and exiting the lab. Research with these agents may be performed on standard open laboratory benches {{without the use of}} special containment equipment. However, eating and drinking are generally prohibited in laboratory areas. Potentially infectious material must be decontaminated before disposal, either by adding an appropriate disinfectant, or by packaging for decontamination elsewhere. Personal protective equipment is only required for circumstances where personnel might be exposed to hazardous material. BSL-1 laboratories must have a door which can be locked to limit access to the lab, however it is not necessary for BSL-1 labs to be isolated from the general building.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biosafety</b> <b>level</b> 4 (BSL-4) is {{the highest}} level of {{biosafety}} precautions, and is appropriate for work with agents that could easily be aerosol-transmitted within the laboratory and cause severe to fatal disease in humans for which there are no available vaccines or treatments. BSL-4 laboratories are generally set up to be either cabinet laboratories or protective-suit laboratories. In cabinet laboratories, all work must be done within a class III biosafety cabinet. Materials leaving the cabinet must be decontaminated by passing through an autoclave or a tank of disinfectant. The cabinets themselves are required to have seamless edges to allow for easy cleaning. Additionally the cabinet and all materials within must be free of sharp edges {{in order to reduce the}} risk of damage to the gloves. In a protective-suit laboratory, all work must be done in a class II biosafety cabinet by personnel wearing a positive pressure suit. In order to exit the BSL-4 laboratory, personnel must pass through a chemical shower for decontamination, then a room for removing the positive-pressure suit, followed by a personal shower. Entry into the BSL-4 laboratory is restricted to trained and authorized individuals, and all persons entering and exiting the laboratory must be recorded.|$|E

30|$|Due to the infrequency of {{invasive}} anthrax infection in humans, AIG received approval based on studies showing it increased survival in an anthrax-challenged and antibiotic-treated rabbit model [11]. However, since these studies were conducted at high <b>biosafety</b> <b>levels</b> limiting animal contact, {{they did not}} determine whether AIG would improve outcome when combined with the titrated hemodynamic support patients with infection- and toxin-related shock receive. Experiences with AIG during systemic anthrax infection in 3 isolated inhalational cases and 15 cases from an outbreak due to contaminated heroin injection have also not answered this question [12 – 15]. In fact, in this outbreak, AIG did not improve outcome in the 15 patients receiving treatment compared to 28 non-recipients, although recipients were sicker [12]. Determining whether AIG adds to the beneficial effects of hemodynamic support would provide additional insight and confidence as to its clinical efficacy.|$|R
