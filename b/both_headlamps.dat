The Zuma has [...] "Bug-eyed" [...] dual headlights that come with one light wired to low beam and the other wired to high beam (both lamps have filaments for high and low beam functions, however, and many users install an inexpensive and simple wiring modification to make <b>both</b> <b>headlamps</b> light with both the high and low beams). The instrument panel has turn signal indicators, a high beam indicator, a low-oil indicator, a speedometer, a gas level gauge, and an odometer.|$|E

50|$|Active Lane Keeping Assist {{can detect}} {{oncoming}} traffic {{and when the}} adjacent lane is not clear, and prevent the vehicle from leaving its lane unintentionally by applying the brakes on one side. Intelligent Light System with Adaptive Highbeam Assist PLUS allows the main-beam headlamps to be kept on permanently without dazzling traffic by masking out other vehicles in the beams' cone of light. The mid-cycle refresh features <b>both</b> low-beam <b>headlamps</b> and daytime running lamps which make use of LED technology as standard.|$|R

50|$|The {{last time}} pop-up {{headlamps}} {{appeared on a}} volume-production car was in 2004 when both the Lotus Esprit and C5 Corvette ended production. Development of <b>both</b> projector beam <b>headlamps</b> — like those on the 1990 Nissan Z — and more efficient, bright LED headlamps of small size will most likely {{eliminate the need for}} concealed headlamps altogether, though composite headlamps containing small halogen bulbs offered enough freedom of styling have already replaced them to a mainstream scale.|$|R
40|$|This {{nighttime}} {{field study}} addressed the relative visibility of retroreflective pavement markings from trucks and cars. To do that, <b>both</b> low-beam <b>headlamp</b> mounting height and observer eye height were varied. The task involved detecting {{the presence of}} a strip of retroreflective pavement marking that was moved towards a stationary observer. The main finding is that headlamp mounting height had a statistically significant effect on detection distance. Increasing the mounting height from the lowest tested level (0. 6 m) to the highest tested level (1. 2 m) resulted in a 19 % increase in detection distance. On the other hand, there was no effect of eye height over the range tested (1. 2 m to 2. 4 m). Because truck headlamps are generally mounted higher than car headlamps, the present findings imply that retroreflective pavement markings are more visible (and thus more effective) for truck drivers than car drivers. Furthermore, these findings are in support of higher headlamp mounting height for all types of vehicles. However, higher headlamp mounting heights lead to more glare for both oncoming drivers and preceding drivers via rearview mirrors. Consequently, determining an optimal headlamp mounting height would require a complex weighing of both visibility and glare considerations...|$|R
5000|$|The February 2002 {{issue of}} HCI: Hot Compact & Imports {{magazine}} featured the Chevrolet Malibu Cruiser concept that GM Performance Division {{built for the}} SEMA show in 2001. The car was painted in [...] "Sublime Lime" [...] by BASF and featured a highly modified turbocharged 3500 SFI 60-degree V-6 (producing [...] at 5,000 rpm and [...] of torque at 2,900 rpm), a 4T65-E four-speed transmission with overdrive, a set of 19x8-inch wheels by Evo wrapped in Toyo Proxes T1-S high-performance tires. Numerous interior modifications included a full-length custom center console, four black leather Sparco racing seats, and a Kenwood entertainment center (with radio, CD, DVD, TV, 10-disc changer and numerous amps and speakers). Exterior modifications included custom HID <b>headlamps</b> (<b>both</b> low and high beams), [...] "Altezza" [...] style taillights, and a custom bodykit.|$|R
40|$|In 1997, the U. S. {{government}} {{introduced an}} option of having headlamps labeled as visually/optically aimable (VOA). To be so labeled, the vertical gradient {{of the light}} output needs to meet certain minimum requirements. A concern with VOA lamps is that they might provide less light above the horizontal than conventional U. S. lamps, thus reducing the effectiveness of retroreflective signs. This study examined 36 first-generation VOA lamps, to assess the reduction of light above the horizontal. Furthermore, this study addressed the possibility of maintaining the status quo of light for sign visibility, by supplementing light from VOA lamps with light from either parking lamps or an auxiliary lamp mounted just above the driver. A comparison of the first-generation VOA lamps in our sample with marketweighted U. S. low beams from 1997 indicates that, {{on the right side}} of the beam pattern, just above the horizontal, the mean deficit from VOA lamps can reach 1, 400 cd per lamp. Two considerations lead to the conclusion that parking lamps will not be able to make up for this deficit. First, current U. S. requirements limit the output of parking lamps above the horizontal to no more than 125 cd. Second, the retroreflective geometry for parking lamps (i. e., the resultant observation angle) provides either no advantage or only a marginal advantage over headlamps. A lamp mounted on the roof just above the driver would provide a substantial advantage over headlamps in terms of retroreflective geometry, because the observation angles for such a lamp are smaller than for either headlamp. Taking into account this advantage, a single such lamp would need to have a peak intensity between 1, 500 and 2, 000 cd to make up for the deficit created by <b>both</b> VOA <b>headlamps...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Gustave Trouvé next invented his “Photophore”, or {{battery-powered}} frontal headlamp, {{which he}} developed for a client, Dr Paul Hélot, an ear-nose-and throat specialist of Rouen. This wearable, direct shaft, lighting {{system could be}} oriented by head movements, so freeing the hands of its wearer. A file of correspondence between these two men enables one to place this invention during 1883. Trouvé soon modified their frontal <b>headlamp</b> <b>both</b> for use by miners, rescue workers, and later by speleologists, in dark surroundings, but also by tinting the light with various colors as theater jewelry for artiste troupes in Paris and Europe. The latter became known as “luminous electric jewels” and was the forerunner of today's wearable technology.In 1884, Trouvé fitted an electric boat with both electric horn and a bow-mounted frontal headlamp, the first time such electrical accessories had ever been fitted on any mode of transport. He developed a portable electric safety lamp. [...] In 1887, Trouvé, whose brand name was Eureka (Greek: εὕρηκα =“I have found”, translated into French “J’ai trouvé), developed his auxanoscope, an electric slide projector for itinerant teachers (1887).Around the same period, Trouvé, a confirmed bachelor uninterested in commercialization, turned his fertile mind skywards. Convinced that the future lay with heavier-the-air machines, he flew a tethered model electric helicopter, the ancestor of the Sikorsky Firefly. [...] He next built an ornithopter, the wings of which flapped using a rapid succession gun cartridges, enabling it to make a noisy {{but at the time}} unheard-of flight of 80 meters.|$|R
