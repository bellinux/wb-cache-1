However, if {{one or more of the}} conditions of a peace bond are broken, either by not obeying one of the conditions, or by getting charged with a subsequent criminal offence within the 12-month period of time in which it was signed, there could be very serious repercussions, as this may result in the person being charged with a separate criminal offence of [...] "breach of recognizance" [...] or [...] "disobeying a court order". The defendant may also be required to forfeit the entire cash surety that they pledged to pay to the court (usually $500 or $1000) when they entered into the peace bond.

50|$|Hydroxide is a {{diatomic}} anion {{with chemical}} formula OH−. It {{consists of an}} oxygen and hydrogen atom held together by <b>a</b> covalent <b>bond,</b> and <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> negative electric charge. It is an important but usually minor constituent of water. It functions as a base, a ligand, a nucleophile and a catalyst. The hydroxide ion forms salts, some of which dissociate in aqueous solution, liberating solvated hydroxide ions. Sodium hydroxide is a multi-million-ton per annum commodity chemical. A hydroxide attached to a strongly electropositive center may itself ionize, liberating a hydrogen cation (H+), making the parent compound an acid.|$|R
40|$|Many {{transition}} metal complexes accomplish or catalyze the oxidation of C{single bond}H, O{single bond}H, and other σ-bonds. Under aerobic conditions, metal complexes typically modulate an autoxidation radical chain. In anaerobic reactions, a metal complex {{can be the}} reactive species that attacks the σ-bond, in many cases by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the substrate. Examples described here include the oxidation of alkylaromatic compounds by ruthenium oxo complexes and reactions of deprotonated iron(III) complexes. In general, these reactions occur with addition of H+ to a ligand and e- to the metal center. Rate constants for such hydrogen-atom transfer reactions can, in many cases, be predicted by the Marcus cross relation. Autoxidation and metal-mediated radical mechanisms are so prevalent that proposals of non-radical oxidations of C{single bond}H <b>bonds</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> higher burden of proof. It is argued here that the oxidation of H 2 by OsO 4 occurs by a non-radical, [3 + 2] mechanism. OsO 4 oxidizes alkanes under similar aqueous conditions. For example, isobutane is oxidized to tert-butanol, and cyclohexane to adipate and succinate. The alkane oxidations {{do not have the}} hallmarks of a radical mechanism but sufficient questions remain that a radical pathway cannot be excluded at this time. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.

5000|$|A revenue bond is {{a special}} type of {{municipal}} bond distinguished by its guarantee of repayment solely from revenues generated by a specified revenue-generating entity associated {{with the purpose of}} the bonds, rather than from a tax. Unlike general obligation bonds, only the revenues specified in the legal contract between the bond holder and bond issuer are required to be used for repayment of the principal and interest of the bonds; other revenues (notably tax revenues) and the general credit of the issuing agency are not so encumbered. Because the pledge of security is not as great as that of general obligation bonds, revenue <b>bonds</b> may <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> slightly higher interest rate than G.O. bonds; however, they are usually considered the second-most secure type of municipal bonds.|$|R
