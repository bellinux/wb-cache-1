25|$|In ancient Iran musicians held {{socially}} respectable positions. We {{know that}} the Elamites and the Achaemenid Empire certainly made use of musicians <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know what that music was like. During the Parthian era, troubadours or Gosans were highly sought after as entertainers. There are theories in Academia that perhaps the early Dari Poets of Eastern Iran like Roudaki were in fact Gosans.|$|E

500|$|... 19th-century scholar Jacob Grimm {{proposed}} a potential etymological {{connection to the}} idisi. Grimm states that [...] "with the original form idis the goddess Idunn may possibly be connected." [...] Grimm further states that Iðunn may have been known with another name, and that [...] "Iðunn would seem by Saem. 89a to be an Elvish word, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> hear of any other name for the goddess." ...|$|E
500|$|The Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{has stated}} that {{according}} to their mission managers and orbit determination experts, the Cassini spacecraft is not experiencing unexplained deviations in its orbit around Saturn. William Folkner, a planetary scientist at JPL stated, [...] "An undiscovered planet outside the orbit of Neptune, 10 times the mass of Earth, would affect the orbit of Saturn, not Cassini ... This could produce a signature in the measurements of Cassini while in orbit about Saturn if the planet {{was close enough to}} the Sun. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> see any unexplained signature above the level of the measurement noise in Cassini data taken from 2004 to 2016." [...] Observations of Saturn's orbit neither prove nor disprove that Planet Nine exists. Rather, they suggest that Planet Nine could not be in certain sections of its proposed orbit because its gravity would cause a noticeable effect on Saturn's position, inconsistent with actual observations.|$|E
500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. We are very happy to win, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want to stop here. We want to keep improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League, which is our aim now." ...|$|E

500|$|Morale on the {{battlefield}} was poor. JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight. When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know {{who was willing to}} fight and who wanted to go home, the unit split in two; one conscript, unable to decide which side to take, shot himself on the spot. A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions, [...] "abandoning combat vehicles, discarding weapons, gathering on some flat ground, sitting and singing Give Peace a Chance by John Lennon." [...] In late October, an entire infantry battalion from Novi Sad in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled. Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge. A tank driver, Vladimir Živković, drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade, where he parked on the steps in front of the building. He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities. His treatment enraged his colleagues, who protested by taking over a local radio station at gunpoint and issuing a declaration that [...] "we are not traitors, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want to be aggressors." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{only reason}} {{there is not}} more mention of the Asiatic Prophets is because Their names seem to {{be lost in the}} mists of ancient history.

2500|$|In {{response}} to a 2014 city referendum prohibiting hydraulic fracturing (fracking) that passed with 59% of the vote, Texas enacted a law specifying [...] "the exclusive jurisdiction of this state to regulate oil and gas operations in this state and the express preemption of local regulation of those operations", though it allows some [...] "commercially reasonable" [...] rules.

2500|$|On 3 September 2014, Shadow Gallery {{responded to}} a {{question}} on their Facebook page regarding a new album with: [...] "There is movement, creation, there is collaboration, preparation- words spin into music freely given, voices for the stories told, passion to share with strokes so tender, so bold - a new dream born of old.

2500|$|On 8 October, the BBFC {{once again}} refused to {{classify}} the game. David Cooke stated [...] "We {{recognize that the}} distributor has made changes to the game, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> consider that these go far enough to address our concerns about the original version. The impact of the revisions on the bleakness and callousness of tone, or the essential nature of the gameplay, is clearly insufficient. There has been {{a reduction in the}} visual detail in some of the 'execution kills', but in others they retain their original visceral and casually sadistic nature. We did make suggestions for further changes to the game, but the distributor has chosen not to make them, and as a result we have rejected the game on both platforms." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (12 June 2008) We {{completed}} our 2008 {{effort to}} get definitive evidence for ivorybills in the Choctawhatchee River Basin in early May…. Team members had no sightings of ivorybills and only two sound detections in 2008.… So where does all this leave us? Pretty much {{in the same position}} as in June 2006. We have a large body of evidence that Ivory-billed Woodpeckers persist along the Choctawhatchee River in the Florida panhandle, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have definitive proof that they exist. Either the excitement of the ivorybill hunt causes competent birders to see and hear things that do not exist and leads competent sound analysts to misidentify hundreds of recorded sounds, or the few ivorybills in the Choctawhatchee River Basin are among the most elusive birds on the planet.|$|E
2500|$|The backstory {{of one of}} the {{surviving}} epistles, directed to Constantine I, recounts how the fame of Saint Anthony spread abroad and reached Emperor Constantine. The Emperor wrote to him offering praise and requesting prayers.

[...] Under the persistence of the brethren who told him [...] "Emperor Constantine loves the church", he accepted to write him a letter blessing him, and praying for the peace and safety of the empire and the church.|$|E
