2500|$|In {{the early}} morning of [...] December 27, 1985, Fossey was {{discovered}} murdered in the bedroom of her cabin located at {{the far edge of}} the camp in the Virunga Mountains, Rwanda. Her body was found face-up near the two beds where she slept, roughly [...] away from a hole that her assailant(s) had apparently cut in the wall of the cabin. Wayne Richard McGuire, Fossey's last research assistant at Karisoke, was summoned to the scene by Fossey's house servant and found her bludgeoned to death, reporting that [...] "when I reached down to check her vital signs, I saw her face had been split, diagonally, with one machete blow." [...] The cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture, with a 9-mm handgun and ammunition <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. Robbery was not believed to be the motive for the crime, as Fossey's valuables were still in the cabin, including her passport, handguns, and thousands of dollars in U.S. bills and traveler's checks.|$|E

Her body was found fully clothed, sprawled face down across the back seat of Griffin's car, with a gunshot wound to the back of her head.

60|$|The {{disappointed}} robber observed <b>her,</b> of course, <b>on</b> wading back to land, but {{passed her}} with contemptuous indifference, {{as if she}} had been merely an over-grown crab or lobster.

She also questions if her society values those men due to their virtues or simply {{due to the fact}} they were men.|$|R

6000|$|When Miss Thorne {{left the}} dining-room, Eleanor had formed no {{intention}} of revealing to her what had occurred, but when she was seated <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> hostess <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa, the secret dropped from her almost unawares. Eleanor was but a bad hypocrite, and she found herself quite unable to continue talking about Mr. Arabin {{as though he were}} a stranger while her heart was full of him. When Miss Thorne, pursuing her own scheme with discreet zeal, asked the young widow whether, in her opinion, {{it would not be a}} good thing for Mr. Arabin to get married, she had nothing for it but to confess the truth.

Once inside the car, she had a knife held to her throat, was tied up and told not to move. She was taken back to Moorhouse Street where David repeatedly raped her after she was gagged and chained to the bed. They had originally decided to murder her that same night, but David kept her prisoner in the house for three days and there were signs that he had developed an emotional attachment to Patterson. Quick to notice, a jealous Catherine made an ultimatum: David would have to kill Patterson or she would kill her herself. He immediately forced an overdose of sleeping pills down her throat and strangled her while she slept. They took her body to the forest, but buried it away from the others. Catherine reportedly got great pleasure in throwing sand in Patterson's face.|$|R
