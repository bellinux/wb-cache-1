40|$|Abstract- In all sugar {{industries}} {{the cane}} after processing {{is left with}} the waste product called “Bagasse”. The Bagasse produced in the mills {{is used as a}} fuel to boilers and the generation of steam. The steam thus produced is expanded in turbines and the power is generated. The excess bagasse is then stored in an open area. Lot of human health hazards is taking place due to loading of bagasse. Nowadays, the industries are using the crane systems to load the bagasse into the tippers, which is a very slow task and causing more dust. The <b>bucket</b> <b>conveyors</b> are used to move bulk materials in a vertical or inclined path. Buckets are attached to a cable, chain, or belt. Buckets are automatically unloaded {{at the end of the}} conveyor run. The belt conveyor is used for transporting light- and medium-weight loads between operations, departments, levels, and buildings, providing considerable control over the orientation and placement of the load. The belt is roller or slider bed supported; the slider bed is used for small and irregularly shaped items...|$|R

50|$|The {{automatic}} {{flour mill}} built by Oliver Evans in 1785 {{was called the}} beginning of modern bulk material handling by Roe (1916).

The innovation spread to other mills and breweries.|$|R
25|$|In the mid 1780s Oliver Evans {{invented a}} fully {{automatic}} mill that could process grain with practically no human labor or operator attention. This was a revolutionary development in two ways: 1) it used <b>bucket</b> elevators and <b>conveyor</b> belts, which would eventually revolutionize materials handling, and 2) it used governors, a forerunner of modern automation, for control.|$|R

5|$|Born in Newport, Delaware, Evans {{received}} little formal education {{and in his}} mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked {{for over a decade}} designing, building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as <b>bucket</b> chains and <b>conveyor</b> belts. In doing so Evans designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power, and built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who built the first in the world a year earlier. Evans was a driving force in the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. Evans dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805. Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos, it was the first automobile in the country and the world's first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive to be a success as either.|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{operations}} in food industries where grains are handled, thus producing combustible dusts, are grinding, drying, transport in <b>bucket</b> elevators and <b>conveyors,</b> pneumatic transport, filtering, and storage in silos. Unfortunately, these operations {{all too often}} give rise to fires or explosions with catastrophic consequences. Spontaneous combustion must {{be considered to be}} a potential ignition source for a dust or gas explosion every time a large mass of combustible dust comes in contact with air. In this paper we present a methodological approach to the characterization of combustible products (grains, pellets, dusts, etc) with respect to self-heating and fermentation and give results for certain agricultural dusts. Our method includes the use of modeling and various laboratory tests such as Thermal Differential Analysis coupled with Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (DTA-TGA), Isothermal Oven Tests (at ambient pressure and elevated pressure), and Adiabatic Calorimetry. The objective of these tests is not only to rank the various products by order of reactivity but to determine under which conditions a given product will pose a threat of spontaneous combustion...|$|R
50|$|Conveyors {{are used}} when {{material}} {{is to be}} moved frequently between specific points over a fixed path and {{when there is a}} sufficient flow volume to justify the fixed conveyor investment. Different types of conveyors can be characterized by the type of product being handled: unit load or bulk load; the conveyor’s location: in-floor, on-floor, or overhead, and whether or not loads can accumulate on the conveyor. Accumulation allows intermittent movement of each unit of material transported along the conveyor, while all units move simultaneously on conveyors without accumulation capability. For example, while both the roller and flat-belt are unit-load on-floor conveyors, the roller provides accumulation capability while the flat-belt does not; similarly, both the power-and-free and trolley are unit-load overhead conveyors, with the power-and-free designed to include an extra track in order to provide the accumulation capability lacking in the trolley conveyor. Examples of bulk-handling conveyors include the magnetic-belt, troughed-belt, <b>bucket,</b> and screw <b>conveyors.</b> A sortation conveyor system is used for merging, identifying, inducting, and separating products to be conveyed to specific destinations, and typically consists of flat-belt, roller, and chute conveyor segments together with various moveable arms and/or pop-up wheels and chains that deflect, push, or pull products to different destinations.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} the teaching materials for an introductory lecture/chapter in a single semester final-year materials handling course for undergraduate and postgraduate mechanical engineers. The study of materials handling equipment and processes primarily involves the application of mechanical engineering design principles emanating from the mechanics of machine elements, structures, thermo-fluids and particle mechanics. The detail topics of our course are from two main areas: • Bulk materials handling by screw, <b>bucket</b> and belt <b>conveyors</b> as well as pneumatic and hydraulic conveyors. • Unit (discrete) materials handling of artifacts and manufactured (packaged) products. For undergraduate and early postgraduate students, we utilize this course to provide an opportunity for students to amalgamate and integrate their engineering knowledge and experiences, and solve complex, real world problems of the materials handling industries. Although the students are mostly fresh from their engineering sciences and hence have skills at applying basic principles, many have little or no practical experience in the materials handling industries. For this reason we start by discussing the significance of the industry and expose them to that fact that these industries have historically expanded from simple (manual) handling to large scale mechanical handling of goods and bulk solids. The particle mechanics aspect of the bulk handling component of the course is relatively unfamiliar to the students. For this reason, after giving our brief history and socio-economic perspective of the materials handling industry, we emphasize general principles related to the handling of particulate solids. We differentiate between design approaches where designers work from basic mechanics and the common empirical design procedures often outlined by manufacturers...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} options for moving grain from one {{location}} to another. Some of these options include conveyors such as belt conveyors, drag conveyors, screw conveyors, and pneumatic conveyors. Belt conveyors cause the least damage to grain {{due to the}} lack of contact forces, however, they cannot be used for steep inclines. Another commonly used conveyor is screw conveyors. Screw conveyors, also known as augers, are conveyors made from a helical blade with rotational motion to move grain. They are on many types of farm equipment, including combines and grain carts for example. Augers generally have a high power requirements, but are portable and low cost. In addition, augers tend to cause high levels of mechanical damage to the grain. Much research has been completed to quantify the amount of grain damage caused by various screw conveyors. The percentage of grain damage is decreased when the auger is operated at capacity because the grain cannot bounce around and strike surfaces as easily. In addition, grain damage increases with increased rotational speed. For this research with screw conveyors, the angle of the incline was found to have no significant effect on the grain damage.Pneumatic conveyors use a moving air-stream to propel grain, and are used in situations when the path of the grain is complex. Grain damage can occur especially at any changes in the tube path, but can be minimized when air speeds are kept below 25 meters per second. [...] It is shown that grain damage increases exponentially above air velociities of 20 meters per second. [...] In research by Baker et al. breakage levels of maize in pneumatic conveyors were found to be similar to those of <b>bucket</b> or drag <b>conveyors.</b>|$|R
