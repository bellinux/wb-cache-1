60|$|As I passed, last summer, for {{the first}} time, through the north of Scotland, {{it seemed to me}} that there was a {{peculiar}} painfulness in its scenery, caused by the non-manifestation of the powers of human art. I had never travelled in, nor even heard or conceived of such a country before; nor, though I had passed much of my life amidst mountain scenery in the south, was I before aware how much of its charm depended on the little gracefulnesses and tendernesses of human work, which are mingled with the beauty of the Alps, or spared by their desolation. It is true that the art which carves and colours the front of a Swiss cottage is not of any very exalted kind; yet it testifies to the completeness and the delicacy of the faculties of the mountaineer; it is true that the remnants of tower and battlement, which afford footing to the wild vine on the Alpine promontory, form but a small part of the great serration of its rocks; and yet it is just that fragment of their broken outline which gives them their pathetic power, and historical majesty. And this element among the wilds of our own country I found wholly wanting. The Highland cottage is literally a heap of gray stones, choked up, rather than roofed over, with <b>black</b> <b>peat</b> and withered heather; the only approach to an effort at decoration consists in the placing of the clods of protective peat obliquely on its roof, so as to give a diagonal arrangement of lines, looking somewhat as if the surface had been scored over by a gigantic claymore.|$|E

60|$|After {{about two}} miles’ ride we {{turned the corner}} of a slight rise, and there before us lay the camp. It is prettily {{situated}} {{on the side of a}} little valley, and faces the north. The 10th Native Infantry are encamped on the right wing; the Mountain Train occupy the centre; and the 3d Cavalry camp lies on the left. Behind the rise a plain stretches away, and upon this the troops will be encamped as they arrive. The soil of the valley-side and of the plain beyond is a mere sand, covered with grass and bushes, but in the hollow of the valley, where the stream runs, or rather used to run, it is a deep <b>black</b> <b>peat.</b> Wells are now being sunk in this peat, and these rapidly fill with water. There are still deep pools where the stream formerly ran, and dams have been formed, which will keep back a considerable supply of water. The troops are not, therefore, likely to fall short for some time, and if they should, there is plenty at a stream two or three miles farther on. The health of the troops is pretty good, but both officers and men are subject to slight attacks of fever, much more so than they were when encamped on the plain by the sea. This is singular, for except that the nights are rather cold, this feels the very perfection of climate. The horses and mules are doing much better up here, and although some died at first, it is probable that they had brought the seeds of the disease with them from the pass below. As it is, the cavalry have suffered terribly. The 5th Cavalry, out of five hundred horses, have lost one hundred and seventy, and the officers’ horses of the infantry and Mountain Train have been nearly exterminated.|$|E
60|$|Earth-worms {{abound in}} England in many {{different}} stations. Their castings {{may be seen in}} extraordinary numbers on commons and chalk- downs, so as almost to cover the whole surface, where the soil is poor and the grass short and thin. But they are almost or quite as numerous in some of the London parks, where the grass grows well and the soil appears rich. Even on the same field worms are much more frequent in some places than in others, without any visible difference {{in the nature of the}} soil. They abound in paved court- yards close to houses; and an instance will be given in which they had burrowed through the floor of a very damp cellar. I have seen worms in <b>black</b> <b>peat</b> in a boggy field; but they are extremely rare, or quite absent in the drier, brown, fibrous peat, which is so much valued by gardeners. On dry, sandy or gravelly tracks, where heath with some gorse, ferns, coarse grass, moss and lichens alone grow, hardly any worms can be found. But in many parts of England, wherever a path crosses a heath, its surface becomes covered with a fine short sward. Whether this change of vegetation is due to the taller plants being killed by the occasional trampling of man and animals, or to the soil being occasionally manured by the droppings from animals, I do not know. {9} On such grassy paths worm- castings may often be seen. On a heath in Surrey, which was carefully examined, there were only a few castings on these paths, where they were much inclined; but on the more level parts, where a bed of fine earth had been washed down from the steeper parts and had accumulated to a thickness of a few inches, worm-castings abounded. These spots seemed to be overstocked with worms, so that they had been compelled to spread to a distance of a few feet from the grassy paths, and here their castings had been thrown up among the heath; but beyond this limit, not a single casting could be found. A layer, though a thin one, of fine earth, which probably long retains some moisture, is in all cases, as I believe, necessary for their existence; and the mere compression of the soil appears to be in some degree favourable to them, for they often abound in old gravel walks, and in foot-paths across fields.|$|E

In our previous paper, we investigated adsorption of asphaltenes from toluene on rock components (quartz, dolomite, calcite, kaolin as well as pure iron and titanium oxides).

Main physicochemical properties of these soils were reported. Moreover, basic adsorption properties (nitrogen adsorption, adsorption of surfactants from water solutions, acidity, etc.) of several soil fraction were studied. We decided to use only certain mineral fractions with highest adsorption capacity, as other fractions have limited impact on total adsorption. Adsorption on soil fraction gives also some insight into relative importance of various soil components on summary soil properties. The results of adsorption measurements are described in terms of physical adsorption on heterogeneous solids...|$|R

40|$|A {{chronologically}} robust {{reconstruction of}} timing and dynamics of millennial time scale wet episodes encompassing the entire Atacama Desert {{during the last}} 15 ka has been constructed. To accomplish this, a new composite paleoclimatic record from Groundwater Discharge Deposits (GWD) in the Sierra de Varas (Domeyko Range, southern Atacama in Chile at 25 ºS) has been compiled and compared with other published paleohydrologic records from the Atacama region. In Sierra de Varas (SV), three millennial timescale wet climate phases have been characterized: around 14. 5 ka cal BP, 12. 2 - 9. 8 ka cal BP, and 4. 7 ka cal BP to the present day. These wet phases are interpreted from intervals of GWD facies formed during periods when the springs were active. GWD facies include: (1) <b>black</b> organic <b>peat,</b> rooted mudstones and sandstones formed in local wetland environments, and (2) gypsum-carbonate rich layers formed by interstitial growth. GWD intervals alternate with gravelly alluvial material deposited during arid phases. A trend towards less humid conditions during the Late Holocene wet episode characterizes GWD sedimentary series in Sierra the Varas, suggesting the onset of a dry episode {{over the last few}} centuries. Around 0. 7 ka BP a very short wet episode is recorded in {{the central part of the}} desert suggesting this was the time of maximum humidity for the entire late Holocene wet period. A brief arid phase occurred between 1. 5 and 2. 0 ka BP indicated by the absence of GWD in the Domeyko Range. The paleoclimatic reconstruction encompassing the entire Atacama region shows that both the intensity and occurrence of wetter conditions were governed mainly by the distance to the source of moisture, and secondarily by the elevation of the sites. In the northern Atacama (16 - 20 ºS), four wet phases fed by N-NE summer monsoon precipitations have been proposed: Tauca phase (18 - 14 ka cal BP) and Coipasa phase (13 - 10 ka cal BP) during the Late Glacial, followed by Early Holocene and Late Holocene phases. In contrast, southern Atacama records (23 - 28 º S) display only three pluvial periods which result from SE summer monsoon precipitation and outbreaks from the Westerlies during wintertime. The Early Holocene in the southern Atacama was a period of aridity, generating important landscape differences to those in the Northern Atacama where conditions were wetter. The core of Atacama (20 - 23 ºS) is the overall driest part of the desert because it is located in the distal limits of both N-NE and SE sources of moisture, the Amazon Basin and Gran Chaco areas, respectively...|$|R

This thesis describes organic soils on Mt. Sprent, a 'typical' mountain, in south west Tasmania and analyses their relationships with climate, vegetation and topography. Climate data were collected using data loggers which recorded maximum and minimum air and surface temperatures, and relative humidity over a 30 month period. Rain gauges were located close to the data loggers. The climatic equipment was at four sites, at different altitudes ranging from 509 m to 1059 m. Vegetation data were collected along altitudinal and topographic gradients, using a cover/abundance measure for 25 m 2 quadrats. The altitudinal data were collected for every 10 m increase in altitude, while the topographic data were collected along a grid system of transects laid out at four sites on the mountain. Soils data were collected along the same topographic transects as the vegetation data. Soil depths were determined in the field, while physical properties were determined {{in the field and}} the laboratory. Other environmental data were collected along the altitudinal and the topographic gradients. A total of 34 water table wells were located on the mountain, at each of the four topographic study sites and at the climatic stations. Peat soils in south west Tasmania are shallow, with an average depth of 30 cm. Three types of peat were recognised: fibrous, intermediate and muck. These vary in their moisture content, organic content, degree of humification and depth. Where more than one peat type was found in a profile, shallow fibrous peats overlaid intermediate which in turn overlaid deeper muck peats. Peat depth, moisture content and organic content decrease with altitude inferring climatic influences on the processes of peat formation and decay. Rainfall and relative humidity were found to be more than adequate to support peat accumulation. The temperatures {{at the base of the}} mountain were higher than those reported in the literature for optimum peat formation. However, these temperatures were offset by very high rainfall and relative humidity values. By using evaporation data from a nearby village (12 km to the north east) and solar radiation values for the summit, evaporation rates for the mountain during summer were estimated. When compared to rainfall for the same period there was a moisture deficit at each station for February. Vegetation varies with altitude and along topographic gradients. Buttongrass moorland, alpine heathland and alpine sedgeland occur in an altitudinal sequence. The deepest soils are found under the lowland buttongrass moorland vegetation, and the shallowest soils occur under the alpine vegetation. The four vegetation groups coincided with the four soil groups. The amount of organic matter in the surface horizon was significantly related to vegetation type at two of the four sites, while soil depth related to vegetation type at three sites. Slope is an important correlate of peat depth at two of the four sites, while rock cover is important at three sites. The mean and modal water table depths are correlated with plant community distributions and the pH of the surface and lower soil horizons. Factors affecting peat formation viz, depth and physical properties are interrelated to such an extent that it is difficult to determine the affects of a single factor. On the mountain, deeper peats occur at lower altitudes, in waterlogged conditions, and under buttongrass moorland vegetation. Fibrous peats are found under moorland, woody and alpine vegetation types in relatively well-drained areas. Reddish-brown fibrous peats occur under woody vegetation while buttongrass tends to produce <b>black</b> fibrous <b>peats.</b> Muck peats are found in areas of impeded drainage. Higher temperatures experienced at lower altitudes may be offset to some extent by higher rainfall. A decrease in peat depth with altitude infers that climate affects the process of peat formation by affecting peat accumulation rates. A precipitation deficit during the summer months may be responsible for the shallow nature of the peats. Alternatively fire history and the relatively low productivity of the vegetation may also account for the shallow soils...|$|R
