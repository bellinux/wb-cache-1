5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{its life}} as a {{tropical}} cyclone, Ewiniar affected Yap and Palau, which fall under the warning jurisdiction of the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, Guam. Ewiniar caused coastal flooding in Yap of up to 5feet (1.5m), especially near the port and around the Colonia Bay area. Ewiniar also caused an island-wide power outage in Yap, although according to an NWS post-storm report, damage was minimised on Yap due to steadier structures after Super Typhoon Sudal of 2004 tore through the islands. Damage was also reported to agriculture due to salt spray. The total amount of damage caused was estimated to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> over $100 thousand (2006USD).|$|E

On August 6, 2007, the game {{was released}} on the Wii's Virtual Console. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, the Virtual Console release does not feature Kawasaki banners due to expired licensing deals. These were replaced by Wii and Nintendo DS advertisements. However, when the game was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016, the Kawasaki banners were restored. The Virtual Console versions of the game were generally very well received, with reviewers considering the game to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> {{as much fun as}} it was on the Nintendo 64.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, {{the normal}} diet {{includes}} rice and noodles {{as the main}} energy source, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians, will not eat root vegetables or avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as effective.|$|E

5|$|This {{eruption}} style {{can take}} the form of either lava flows, spreading across the floor of the paterae, or lava lakes. Except for observations by Galileo during its seven close flybys, {{it can be difficult to}} tell the difference between a lava lake and a lava flow eruption on a patera floor, due to inadequate resolution and similar thermal emission characteristics. Intra-patera lava flow eruptions, such as the Gish Bar Patera eruption in 2001, can <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as voluminous as those seen spreading out across the Ionian plains. Flow-like features have also been observed within a number of paterae, like Camaxtli Patera, suggesting that lava flows periodically resurface their floors.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the steady}} {{taxation}} of Edward III's reign, parliament – {{and in particular}} the Commons – gained political influence. A consensus emerged that in order for a tax to <b>be</b> <b>just,</b> the king had to prove its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present petitions for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This way the system was beneficial for both parties. Through this process the commons, and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at Petrograd's Finland Station, Lenin gave {{a speech}} to Bolshevik {{supporters}} condemning the Provisional Government and again calling for a continent-wide European proletarian revolution. Over the following days, he spoke at Bolshevik meetings, lambasting those who wanted reconciliation with the Mensheviks and revealing his April Theses, an outline of {{his plans for the}} Bolsheviks, which he had written on the journey from Switzerland. He publicly condemned both the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries – who dominated the influential Petrograd Soviet – for supporting the Provisional Government, denouncing them as traitors to socialism. Considering the government to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as imperialist as the Tsarist regime, he advocated immediate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, rule by soviets, the nationalisation of industry and banks, and the state expropriation of land, all with the intention of establishing a proletariat government and pushing toward a socialist society. By contrast, the Mensheviks believed that Russia was insufficiently developed to transition to socialism and accused Lenin of trying to plunge the new Republic into civil war. Over the coming months, he campaigned for his policies, attending the meetings of the Bolshevik Central Committee, prolifically writing for the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda, and giving public speeches in Petrograd aimed at converting workers, soldiers, sailors, and peasants to his cause.|$|E
