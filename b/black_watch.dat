5|$|John, the new Lord Sempill and Baronet, was a {{landowner}} and {{soldier who}} had served with the Lovat Scouts and then the <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> in the South African War. He would later command the 8th Battalion of the <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> during the First World War, {{in which he was}} wounded at the Battle of Loos. During the 1880s, he had met Gwendolyn Prodger at the fashionable German resort of Bad Homburg; the couple were married on 22 June 1892. The bride, from a Cornish background, had been brought up in Wales and was an accomplished harpist.|$|E

5|$|The German attacks {{convinced}} Lieutenant General John Crocker, {{commander of}} I Corps, {{to reinforce the}} 6th Airborne Division, and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was ordered {{to take over the}} southern sector of the Orne bridgehead. At the same time the 5th Battalion <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> was attached to the 3rd Parachute Brigade. The <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> were informed to prepare for an assault to capture Bréville and formed up {{to the rear of the}} 9th Parachute Battalion, ready to begin their attack the next day.|$|E
5|$|The current uniform for Year 11 and 12 was {{introduced}} in 1966. It was designed by the senior students of 1965 and consists of a <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> kilt, white blouse, green blazer, green jumper or vest, black stockings for winter and bottle green knee-high socks for summer, and black leather lace-up shoes. Girls of Scottish origin are permitted wear the kilt pin representing their family or clan name, rather than the standard school pin. A green and <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> Tam o' Shanter (known as 'the Beret') was also introduced for all grades a few years earlier.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June, the {{decision}} was taken to expand the bridgehead {{to the east of}} the River Orne, with 6th Airborne Division tasked with achieving this. However, the division was deemed not to be strong enough to achieve its objective; the 3rd Parachute Brigade was reinforced with the 5th Battalion, <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> (Royal Highland Regiment). On 11 June, the 5th <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> launched an attack on the town of Bréville, but was met with extremely heavy resistance and was repulsed after suffering a number of casualties. The next day, the 3rd Parachute Brigade's entire front was subjected to fierce artillery bombardment and assaults by German tanks and infantry, with the Germans particularly focusing on the positions held by 9th Parachute Battalion. Both the 9th Parachute Battalion and the remnants of the <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> defended Chateau Saint Come, but were gradually forced to retreat. However, after Lieutenant-Colonel Otway stated that his battalion would be unable to defend its position for much longer, Brigadier Hill gathered together a number of paratroopers from 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and led a counter-attack that forced the Germans to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|From the {{perspective}} of the Canadian 1st Army, the battle is remembered for its tactical and strategic miscalculations — the most notable being a highly controversial attack by the Royal Highland Regiment (<b>Black</b> <b>Watch)</b> of Canada on 25 July.

5|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> Tartan of {{the college}} was introduced in 1918. Senior girls wore heavy box-pleated skirts and white blouses; junior girls wore pinafore dresses. All girls wore a navy blazer and heavy woollen stockings. Prefects also wore a special hat badge with a ring of bright blue enamel. A black felt Breton was introduced for winter use, and no change was made until {{the introduction of the}} green beret in 1952.|$|E
5|$|At midday on 12 June {{the entire}} 3rd Parachute Brigade {{position}} came under artillery and mortar fire {{prior to a}} major attack scheduled to start at 15:00. A German battalion attacked the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, another supported by six tanks and self-propelled guns attacked the 9th Parachute Battalion and the 5th <b>Black</b> <b>Watch.</b> The battle for the Château cost the <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> nine Bren Gun Carriers and destroyed all of their anti-tank guns. Unable to resist {{they were forced to}} pull back to the Bois de Mont, joining the 9th Parachute Battalion, which was being attacked by the German armoured vehicles. One tank in front of 'B' Company was hit by two PIAT rounds, but remained in action. The tank destroyed two of 'B' company's machine-gun posts, when it was hit by a third anti-tank projectile and withdrew. The attack killed or wounded the last men in the Machine-Gun Platoon and the Anti-Tank Platoon was reduced to one PIAT detachment. The German infantry were in danger of over-running the battalion, when Otway contacted brigade headquarters, informing them they were not able to hold out much longer. Brigadier James Hill personally led a counter-attack of forty men from the Canadian battalion which drove off the Germans. By 20:00 the area defended by the two battalions had been cleared of all opposition and the front line restored.|$|E

5|$|Despite these setbacks, Simonds {{was adamant}} that Verrières Ridge {{should be taken}} and sent in the <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> and the Calgary Highlanders to {{stabilise}} the precarious Allied position. Minor counterattacks by both battalions on 21 July managed to contain Dietrich's armoured formations {{and by the time}} the operation was called off, Canadian forces held several footholds on the ridge, including a now secure position on Point67. Four German divisions still held the ridge. In all, the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1,300 Allied casualties.|$|E
5|$|On 19August 1942, while British {{commando}} units attacked bunker {{positions on}} the outskirts of Dieppe, forces of the 2nd Division landed on four beaches. The easternmost, Blue Beach, which was situated {{at the foot of a}} sheer cliff, presented the most difficulties; the Royal Regiment of Canada, with a company of the <b>Black</b> <b>Watch,</b> was held at bay by two platoons of German defenders. Only six percent of the men that landed on Blue Beach returned to Britain.|$|E

The other tanks were withdrawn being unable to deploy in the wooded ground around the Château.

5|$|The {{battle was}} brought to greater public {{attention}} in 1992 by a CBC television docu-drama, The Valour and the Horror, which {{made a number of}} controversial claims about senior leadership in the Second World War and devoted one of its three episodes to the <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> attack on Verrières Ridge.

5|$|The {{order by}} Allawi to attack Fallujah again came on 6 November, {{just four days}} after George W. Bush was reelected as president. 1st Marine Division {{commander}} General Richard F. Natonski assembled an ad-hoc force of six Marine battalions, three Army battalions, three Iraqi battalions, and the British <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> Regiment. The insurgents, loosely led by Zarqawi, Abdullah al-Janabi, and Zarqawi's lieutenant Hadid, had replaced their losses and reportedly now had between 3,000 and 4,000 men in the city. They planned to hinder the Marine advance with roadblocks, berms, and mines, while conducting attacks outside the city to tie down Marine units.|$|E
5|$|In {{early to}} mid-2009, several {{narcotics}} and bomb-making facilities were raided by British forces, supported by Apaches.

During the Summer of 2009, British Apaches were an integral component of Operation Panther's Claw, which was aimed at pushing insurgents out of civilian areas in the runup to the 2009 Afghan Elections. During this major offensive, Apaches from the UK routinely flew alongside US Cobra helicopters to provide air support to soldiers of 3rd Battalion <b>Black</b> <b>Watch</b> and the Royal Marines conducting ground operations. During the Summer 2009 operations, a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Mansur, and several accomplices were killed in a precision strike launched by an Apache.|$|E

5|$|Italian forces entered British Somaliland from Abyssinia on 4 August 1940, {{overcame the}} {{garrison}} at Hargeisa, and advanced north-east towards the capital Berbera. The British force, including {{a platoon of}} 43 Rhodesians in the 2nd Battalion of the <b>Black</b> <b>Watch,</b> took up positions on six hills overlooking the only road towards Berbera and engaged the Italians at the Battle of Tug Argan. Amid heavy fighting, the Italians gradually made gains and by 14 August had almost pocketed the Commonwealth forces. The British retreated to Berbera between 15 and 17 August, the Rhodesians making up the left flank of the rearguard, and by 18 August had evacuated by sea. The Italians took the city and completed their conquest of British Somaliland a day later.|$|E
5|$|Operation Spring was {{scheduled}} in four tightly timed phases. The Calgary Highlanders would attack Bourguébus Ridge and May-sur-Orne {{to secure the}} flanks of the main thrust, {{which was to be}} a move on Verrières Ridge by the <b>Black</b> <b>Watch,</b> along with armoured support from the British 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. The plan called for the offensive to start on 23 July but poor weather led to a postponement for 48 hours. Taking advantage of this respite, the I SS Panzer Corps reinforced the ridge with an additional four battalions, 480 tanks and 500 guns. Allied Intelligence learned of this reinforcement through Ultra signals intercepts and advised Simonds's headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Brigade {{attacked}} {{in the east}} with some success, taking Verrières village itself, but were repulsed at Tilly-la-Campagne by German counterattacks.

German counterattacks on 26 and 27July pushed Canadian forces back to Point 67. However, the situation eventually eased for the 2nd Canadian Division when US forces went on the offensive. Throughout {{the first week of}} August, significant German resources were transferred from the Anglo-Canadian front to that of the U.S. Third Army, under Lieutenant General George Patton, while reinforcements moved from Pas de Calais to the Falaise–Calvados area. By 7August 1944, only one major formation—the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend—faced Canadian forces on Verrières Ridge.|$|E
