40|$|Abstract A {{subset of}} the d-dimensional Euclidean space having nonempty {{interior}} is called a spindle convex body {{if it is the}} intersection of (finitely or infinitely many) congruent d-dimensional closed <b>balls.</b> The <b>spindle</b> convex body is called a “fat ” one, if it contains the centers of its generating balls. The core part of this paper is an extension of Schramm’s theorem and its proof on illuminating convex bodies of constant width to the family of “fat ” spindle convex bodies. Also, this leads to the spherical analog of the well-known Blaschke–Lebesgue problem...|$|R
50|$|The Qujialing culture (3400-2600 BC) was a Neolithic {{civilisation}} centered primarily {{around the}} middle Yangtze River region in Hubei and Hunan, China. The culture succeeded the Daxi culture and reached southern Shaanxi, northern Jiangxi and southwest Henan. Artefact types unique to the culture include ceramic <b>balls</b> and painted <b>spindle</b> whorls; the later was inherited by the succeeding Shijiahe culture.|$|R
50|$|Many cars of {{this period}} began to use {{independent}} front suspension, often a double wishbone. The upper wishbone could conveniently {{also be used as}} the lever of the shock absorber, reducing the mass and bulk of the suspension, and also avoiding at least one <b>ball</b> joint. The <b>spindle</b> of the shock absorber now became the upper suspension pivot, usually double-ended.|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} to improve a design quality of {{high-speed}} spindle units, {{we have developed}} mathematical models and software to simulate a rotation accuracy of <b>spindles</b> running on <b>ball</b> bearings. In order {{to better understand the}} mechanics of ball bearings, the dynamic interaction of <b>ball</b> bearings and <b>spindle</b> unit, and the influence of the bearing imperfections on the spindle rotation accuracy, we have carried out computer aided analysis and experimental studies. When doing this, we have found that the spindle rotation accuracy can vary drastically with rotational speed. The influence of bearing preload has a secondary importance. Comparison of the results of these studies has demonstrated adequacy of the models developed to the real spindle units...|$|R
40|$|An {{optical disk}} buffer concept can provide gigabit-per-second data rates and terabit {{capacity}} {{through the use}} of arrays of solid state lasers applied to a stack of erasable/reusable optical disks. The RCA optical disk buffer has evoked interest by NASA for space applications. The porous graphite air bearings in the rotary spindle as well as those used in the linear translation of the read/write head would be replaced by magnetic bearings or mechanical (ball or roller) bearings. Based upon past experience, roller or ball bearings for the translation stages are not feasible. Unsatisfactory, although limited experience exists with <b>ball</b> bearing <b>spindles</b> also. Magnetic bearings, however, appear ideally suited for both applications. The use of magnetic bearings is advantageous in the optical disk buffer because of the absence of physical contact between the rotating and stationary members. This frictionless operation leads to extended life and reduced drag. The manufacturing tolerances that are required to fabricate magnetic bearings would also be relaxed from those required for precision ball and gas bearings. Since magnetic bearings require no lubricant, they are inherently compatible with a space (vacuum) environment. Magnetic bearings also allow the dynamics of the rotor/bearing system to be altered {{through the use of}} active control. This provides the potential for reduced vibration, extended regions of stable operation, and more precise control of position...|$|R

50|$|The art of {{plaiting}} is diligently practised. For the coarser mats coco-nut fibre is employed; for the finer, pandanus {{leaves and}} rushes. An intelligent Fijian {{can always tell}} you from which island a mat came. The coarser kinds are used as floorcloths and hangings to the huts; the finer as sails, or sleeping-mats, or for children. Floor-mats are 5 to 8 yards in length, sail-mats 100 and more. Sleeping-mats are of two kinds - a thicker to lie on, and a thinner for covering; {{one of the most}} valued sorts has a pleat running through the middle of each strip of plaiting. Borders are worked on with designs in darker bands; white feathers and scraps of European stuffs are woven in. One of the prettiest productions of the art is the women's liku, a girdle woven from strips of the bast of the wau-tree (a kind of hibiscus), with the fibres of a root that grows wild, and blades of grass. Soft mats are made by plaiting the stalks of a fibrous plant into one, and removing the woody portions by bending and beating. Bags and baskets are admirably woven; fans, too, are made either of palm leaves strengthened at the edge and vandyked, or woven from bast. But superior to all these are the string and the cables - the best from coco-fibre, the inferior kinds from the bast of the wau-tree. In the Fiji Islands these are tastefully made up into <b>balls,</b> ovals, <b>spindles,</b> etc. Comparison with New Caledonia shows how high East Melanesia stands in this art. One has only to look at a New Caledonia fan beside one from Fiji. But in New Guinea, again, very elegant woven articles of all kinds are produced.|$|R
40|$|A five {{degrees of}} freedom {{analysis}} of a perfect precision grinding spindle supported {{by a pair of}} back to back angular contact ball bearings is performed. The ball to race contacts are simulated by a non-linear contact spring, representing the elastic deformation of the mating rolling members. Major frequencies associated with various {{degrees of freedom}} are observed and a number of design curves, suggesting the best zones of operation for the simulated spindle under radial/ axial loading are also presented. The gyroscopic contribution of an ideal precision spindle was found to be insignificant. The model was further expanded to study the response characteristics of the spindle under lubricated contact conditions. A regression formula is used to model the non-linear spring/ damper arrangement,corresponding to the contact elastohydrodynamic oil film thickness. It is noted that the presence of the oil film along the line of contacts do not significantly alter the position of the major modes of the system. However; its contribution in damping the amplitude of oscillation are found to be significant. Various graphs indicating the overall system response, subjected to varying oil film viscosity, number of <b>balls</b> and the <b>spindle</b> màss are also presented. Furthermore, experimental investigations are conducted to validate the employed methodology. Good agreement is observed between the results of the simulation and the experimental spectra for the fundamental modes of response. Although manufacturing anamalies are not simulated,the formulated models incorporate sufficient versatility to forsee various spindle/bearing configurations, different loading arrangement as well as various geometrical features of a system to be modelled...|$|R
