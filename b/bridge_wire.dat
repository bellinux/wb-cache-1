40|$|Streak cameras, either {{electronic}} or rotating mirror, {{are common}} diagnostic tools used to explore very fast phenomena. Often {{they are used}} to precisely time events or durations, and in most cases, {{it is important to have}} quality time marks on the film record. Many methods have been used to introduce time marks onto the film. Exploding <b>bridge</b> <b>wires</b> are frequently used, but they light up slowly and are difficult to read with consistent accuracy. It is also difficult to put more than a few <b>bridge</b> <b>wires</b> in the view of a camera slit, so there are only a few timing marks written to the film. In some cases the time scale on the film must be interpolated over long distances, creating a significant loss of accuracy. Interpolation is especially troublesome with those cameras that have a nonlinear sweep rate. Spark gaps located on the camera slit turn on a bit faster, but suffer from the same interpolation induced errors. A series of short duration laser pulses, accurately timed and introduced along the edges of the film, is a very fine solution. The problem with such a laser fiducial system is that the lasers are very expensive and difficult to maintain. There has been a need for many years for an inexpensive, very bright light source that can be repetitively pulsed accurately and with short duration. Various technologies have sufficiently developed over the past few years, allowing us to build a fiducial system based on light emitting diodes (LED) for the Cordin rotating mirror streak cameras...|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{blasting}} caps use electricity to heat a <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> rather than vaporize it, and that heating then causes the primary explosive to detonate.

5|$|<b>Bridging</b> <b>wires</b> are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the development of}} various printed metallic initiators. The purpose was to create an initiator that could easily be integrated with a printed energetic material, specifically, a liquid suspension of nanothermite. Printing the initiator allowed for precise control and easy manipulation of the geometry. Thus, the geometry could be custom made for various applications. ^ <b>Bridge</b> <b>wire</b> initiators were first investigated due to their presence in current initiation systems. A <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> is a thin wire that a high electrical current is sent through. The current causes the <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> to heat and can ignite an energetic material, if it reaches the material 2 ̆ 7 s critical ignition temperature. If the current heats the <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> faster than it can expand in response, the <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> will break and the resulting shock can ignite the energetic material. Bridge wires of various length were tested {{to determine how the}} length affects the breakage time. In addition, the bridge wires were tested under various voltages (between 7. 5 V and 13. 75 V). It was found that increasing the voltage decreased the break time. Finally, a nanothermite [nano-aluminum and nano-bismuth (III) oxide] was pipetted on to the bridge wires. Ignition of the energetic material from the breaking of the wire was achieved, but it proved unreliable due to various factors including, but not limited to, print quality. ^ The bridge wires were subsequently tested {{as a part of a}} circuit with a wireless trigger. The bridge wires were able to break through the energetic material at 15 V, but did not ignite the nanothermite [nano-aluminum and nano-copper (II) oxide]. This indicates that the <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> did not heat enough to ignite the nanothermite or that the shock produced from breaking the wire was not enough to ignite the material. Further investigation into the effect of the length of the <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> on ignition and the use of different nanothermites will be conducted in future work. ^ To explore alternative geometries, spark gap initiators of various sizes were also printed. A spark gap was created by printing two conducting electrodes close enough to each other to allow an electric spark to jump between them. The breakdown voltage for the spark gaps varied, but reliable spark over occurred under 5 kV and 50 μA. The ability to create a printed initiator integrated with printed energetic material was also demonstrated. Printed nanothermite [nano-aluminum and nano-copper (II) oxide] was placed in the center of a spark gap, covering both electrodes. The spark gaps required a much higher voltage to achieve ignition of the energetic material than the bridge wires, but for the utilized geometry, they achieved a significantly higher reliability. For ignition, 5 kV proved sufficient but the current required was 75 μA. ^ Overall, the successful printing of metallic initiators was demonstrated. <b>Bridge</b> <b>wire</b> and spark gap initiator geometries were created and tested. The ignition of energetic material for the different initiator types was demonstrated. ...|$|E
