She learned modern Greek, {{got to know the}} island, its people and culture and was known for her ability to get on with local workers on site. In this way, she {{can be seen as a}} pioneer of {{contemporary}} approaches to archaeological work, while she also fitted the early 20th century pattern of women assisting senior male archaeologists.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{observations}} and modeling are producing information {{not only about}} the present climate and atmospheric conditions on Mars <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> its past. The Noachian-era Martian atmosphere had long been theorized to be carbon dioxide–rich. Recent spectral observations of deposits of clay minerals on Mars and modeling of clay mineral formation conditions have found that there is little to no carbonate present in clay of that era. Clay formation in a carbon dioxide–rich environment is always accompanied by carbonate formation, although the carbonate may later be dissolved by volcanic acidity.|$|E
25|$|The table below {{shows the}} various {{proposals}} for how the frieze may have been originally designed to be displayed. There {{have been a number}} of ideas as to how the frieze should be arranged. The arrangement made by the British Museum follows that proposed by Peter Corbett, but others by the American scholar W.B.Dinsmoor and that proposed by Haller are amongst the conflicting theories shown below. In some cases the authors disagree not only about the order <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> which pictures were displayed on which wall. In this case the block positions are labelled E, W, S, and N to indicate the wall.|$|E

It is a {{culturally}} important zone within the Michoacan region, from lake resources exploitation evidence from pre-Hispanic times. There are few studies of this type paleolithic environment in the country, in spite of information offered to anthropology. These include testimonies of the nutritional and artisan products that have been obtained throughout history, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> the communication and transportation used by people.

25|$|Once {{she started}} experimenting with the gum-bichromate process, Hahn started {{stitching}} into her photographs. Printing onto canvas and other fabrics {{allowed her to}} use thread to highlight {{certain aspects of the}} photograph. In combining her photographs with conventional practices, Hahn successfully intertwines formal and conceptual aspects. Not only does she speak to the mundane tasks of everyday life, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> routine and normativity. In highlighting the ordinary in her work, Hahn elevates and revives that which has been lost in the practice of daily life. Embroidery references femininity, as Hahn underlines the feminist issue of the anonymity of women's handicraft. Her embroidery often emphasized flowers with its three-dimensionality, furthering the idea of femininity; she later on pursued this as a symbol and incorporated it in several of her other series.|$|E
25|$|According to {{sociologist}} Burton Clark, Reed {{is one of}} {{the most}} unusual institutions of higher learning in the United States, featuring a traditional liberal arts and natural sciences curriculum. It requires freshmen to take Humanities 110, an intensive introduction to the Classics, covering ancient Greece and Rome as well as the Bible and ancient Jewish history. Its program in the sciences is likewise unusual with its TRIGA research reactor making it the only school in the United States to have a nuclear reactor operated primarily by undergraduates. Reed also requires all students to complete a thesis (a two-semester-long research project conducted under the guidance of professors) during the senior year as a prerequisite of graduation with successful completion of a junior qualifying exam at the end of the junior year a prerequisite to beginning the thesis. Upon completion of the senior thesis, students must also pass an oral exam that may encompass questions not only about the thesis <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> any course previously taken.|$|E
25|$|Axel Martin Fredrik Munthe (31 October 1857 – 11 February 1949) was a Swedish-born {{physician}} and psychiatrist, {{best known as}} the author of The Story of San Michele, an autobiographical account of his life and work. He spoke several languages (Swedish, English, French, Italian fluently, and German at least passably), grew up in Sweden, attended medical school there, and opened his first practice in France. He was married to an English aristocrat and spent most of his adult life in Italy. His philanthropic nature often led him to treat the poor without charge, and he risked his life on several occasions to offer medical help in times of war, disaster, or plague. As an advocate of animal rights, he purchased land to create a bird sanctuary near his home in Italy, argued for bans on painful traps, and himself kept pets as diverse as an owl and a baboon, as well as many types of dog. His writing is light-hearted, being primarily memoirs drawn from his real-life experiences, but it is often tinged with sadness or tragedy, and often uses dramatic licence. He primarily wrote about people and their idiosyncrasies, portraying the foibles of both the rich and the poor, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> animals.|$|E
25|$|Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani {{condemned}} the cartoons <b>but</b> <b>also</b> commented <b>about</b> militants who discredit Islam by their acts. Sistani underlined how un-Islamic acts of extremism {{are used as}} justification to attack Islam.|$|R

500|$|With its chunky backbeat, gentle {{strings and}} funky guitar motif, 'Secret' is both languid and tense {{at the same}} time. The song has the air of quiet revelation and a {{relaxation}} of spirit. Madonna insisted later that the song wasn't just about love <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> spiritual self-empowerment.

500|$|In Berg's {{debut as}} a {{starting}} catcher, he had to worry not only about catching Lyons' knuckleball, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> facing the Yankees' Murderers' Row lineup, which included Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Earle Combs. Lyons beat the Yankees 6–3, holding Ruth hitless. Berg made the defensive {{play of the game}} when he caught a poor throw from the outfield, spun and tagged out Joe Dugan at the plate. [...] He caught eight more times during the final month and a half of the season.|$|E

For Paul Kelly: Stories of Me Declan recalled his feelings whenever he hears [...] "When I First Met Your Ma", which describes Kelly's courtship of Hilary.

500|$|Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: [...] "From [...] Handel {{learned not}} only {{a great deal about}} the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> those delicacies of {{instrumental}} colouring which he later perfected in his own style". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on the {{controversy}} the book generated, Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron Rosenbaum (author of Explaining Hitler) {{that he too}} was disturbed by it, adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him, [...] "golem- or Frankenstein-like". He said that {{it felt like the}} book [...] "wrote me". Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: [...] "My feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can." [...] In his 1997 memoir, Errata: An Examined Life, Steiner remarked that had he known what the response to The Portage and its stage interpretation would be, he would have made the novella [...] "my foremost business".|$|E
500|$|As {{they are}} the movie's [...] "central {{dramatic}} piece", the encoffining ceremonies in Departures have received extensive commentary. Mike Scott, for instance, wrote in The Times-Picayune that these scenes were beautiful and heartbreaking, and Nicholas Barber of The Independent described them as [...] "elegant and dignified". James Adams of The Globe and Mail wrote {{that they were a}} [...] "dignified ritual of calming, hypnotic grace, with sleights of hand bordering on the magicianly". As the film continues, Paul Byrnes of The Sydney Morning Herald opined, the audience gains an improved knowledge of the ceremony and its importance. Viewers see that the ceremonies are not simply about preparing the body, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> [...] "bring dignity to death, respect to the deceased and solace to those who grieve", through which the encoffiners are able to help repair broken family ties and heal damage done to those left behind.|$|E
50|$|In 1364, Marie married Robert I, Duke of Bar. Marie had an {{extensive}} library and obtained works about {{a variety of}} topics. She read romances and poetry, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> works <b>about</b> history and theology. Jean d'Arras dedicated his Roman de Mélusine to Marie.|$|R

500|$|When Adams {{appeared}} on The Early Show in 2008, {{he was asked}} about [...] "Summer of '69" [...] and its lyrical meaning. Adams said the song was about sex and making love in the summertime. [...] "69" [...] is a reference to the sexual position, 69. On the Reckless 25th anniversary, Adams told In the Studio that the song was built on the theme of nostalgia, such as the [...] "cultural revolution", the break-up of The Beatles, his discovery of music and the moon landing, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> a character who plays until his fingers bleed and sexual discovery. Vallance however has gone for the more conventional interpretation of the title being a reference to a year. He notes Jackson Browne's [...] "Running on Empty", which contains references to 1965 and 1969, as his own influence, and recalls Adams citing the film Summer of '42 as his.|$|E
500|$|Swedish critics {{generally}} expressed {{positive reactions}} to the film. In 26 reviews listed at the Swedish-language review site Kritiker.se it achieved an average rating of 4.1 out of 5. Svenska Dagbladet gave the film a rating of 5 out of 6 and hailed Alfredson {{for his ability to}} [...] "tell [...] through pictures instead of words about a society where hearts are turned to icicles and everyone is left on their own, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> love warm and red like blood on white melting snow". Göran Everdahl for SVT's Gomorron Sverige gave the film 4 out of 5 and described the film as [...] "kitchen sink fantasy" [...] that [...] "gives the vampire story back something it has been missing for a long time: the ability to really frighten us". Expressen and Göteborgs-Posten were less impressed and gave the film 3 out of 5. Expressen criticized it for being unappealing to those uninitiated in vampire films while Göteborgs-Posten believed the supporting characters had lost the emotional depth that made the novel so successful.|$|E
500|$|Sheen {{was raised}} in a {{theatrical}} family—his parents were both involved in local amateur operatics and musicals and, later in life, his father worked as a part-time professional Jack Nicholson look-alike. In his teenage years, Sheen was involved with the West Glamorgan Youth Theatre and, later, the National Youth Theatre of Wales. [...] "It was a brilliant youth theatre", Sheen has said, [...] "and it taught me not only a lot about acting, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>about</b> work ethic; it was very disciplined." [...] He was influenced by the performances of Laurence Olivier and the writings of theatre critic Kenneth Tynan—"the combination of those two things kind of blew my head off." [...] Sheen was educated at Blaenbaglan Primary School, Glan Afan Comprehensive School and, finally, Neath Port Talbot College where he sat A-levels in English, Drama and Sociology. He considered studying English at university but instead decided to attend drama school. He moved to London in 1988 to train as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), having spent the previous year working in a Welsh fast food restaurant called Burger Master to earn money. Sheen was granted the Laurence Olivier Bursary by The Society of London Theatre in his second year at RADA. He graduated in 1991 with a BA in Acting.|$|E
