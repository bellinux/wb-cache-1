5|$|According to Pope Benedict XVI, strong agnosticism in {{particular}} contradicts itself in affirming {{the power of}} reason to know scientific truth.

5|$|Aside from {{additional}} profanity, gore, {{and sexual}} content, {{and a few}} extra lines, the extended version features a few extra scenes. In one scene, Berringer <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> Mayor for the witches' attack and murders him in public. The scene where Berringer and his goons assault Gretel is also extended; it occurs in between the scene where Mina heals Hansel and has sex with him, and shows that the men plan to rape Gretel right before Edward kills them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the offenders, who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E

5|$|Dot and Abi make a rum {{cake for}} Patrick's {{birthday}} {{but as soon}} as Abi leaves the house for Exeter, Dot trips over Dave and nobody knows she is seriously injured until another step-granddaughter Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) finds her. Dot is then taken to hospital and Sonia <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> residents for not looking out her and scolds Sharon and Ian. Dot is left worried when the doctor tells her that she will need an operation after her fall has caused problems to her hip. Dot refuses physio and loses her temper with the doctors when they won't let her have a cigarette. Dot is heartbroken when Sonia and Robbie inform her that Dave has died but is relieved when Dave shows up at the hospital alive.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{survey the}} {{damage in the}} city, which {{appears to have been}} caused by an {{elephant}} even though none was seen. Ed Meecham, an animal handler at the zoo, recounts how he came to the elephant's locked cage to find it empty. His boss, Willa Ambrose, tells the agents that the zoo is in danger of closing due to other animal disappearances. She <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> zoo's decline on an animal rights group which is known to free captive animals. The group's leader, Kyle Lang, denies any involvement in the elephant's release. Lang tells them that Ambrose is being sued by the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla she took from their country ten years prior.|$|E
5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day, a brown bear strolls {{onto the streets}} of Springfield, frightening the town. The bear is eventually subdued by the police. Homer convinces Springfield that {{something needs to be}} done to protect them from bears, and the town takes their complaint to Mayor Quimby, who gives in easily. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created. Homer is then shocked to see taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the patrol, and this warrants another visit by the town to the Mayor's office. To appease them, Mayor Quimby <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> high taxes on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.|$|E
25|$|State {{authorities}} were also <b>blamed.</b> <b>The</b> state labor commissioner, John C. Brooks, blamed his department's failure {{to inspect the}} plant on shortage of money and staff, and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> federal government for not enforcing stricter standards.|$|R

The wife killed his favorite horse and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> sister. The brother said the dogs could eat it. Finally, the wife gave birth, cut off the baby's head, and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> sister. The brother took his sister and drove the carriage into a bramble. He told his sister to disentangle.

5|$|Receiving a {{broadcast}} of CIA agent Daniels being interrogated by the 33rd, the team chooses to interfere. Tracing the signal's origin, they find Daniels already {{dead and the}} broadcast was a trap set for fellow CIA agent, Gould. Gould helps Delta escape, but is later captured and killed while assaulting a location called the Gate. The team heads there and continues the attack. Finding it heavily guarded by the 33rd, the team employs white phosphorus to obliterate their opposition and advance further into the city. While walking through the aftermath, they realize they accidentally killed 47 civilians moved to the Gate for shelter by the 33rd. Walker <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> 33rd and vows revenge.|$|E
5|$|Shein's army {{retreated to}} its main camp, {{which was in}} turn {{surrounded}} by Commonwealth forces in mid-October. The besieged Russians waited for relief, but none arrived, as Commonwealth and Cossack cavalry {{had been sent to}} disrupt the Russian rear. Some historians also cite dissent and internal divisions in the Russian camp as responsible for their inaction and ineffectiveness (Jasienica <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> Russian warlords, and Parker the foreign mercenaries). The Tatar invasion threatening the south Russian borderlands was a contributory factor, with many soldiers and boyars from those regions deserting the Russian camp to return to protect their homes. Some foreign mercenaries also deserted to the Commonwealth side.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, however, critics often cite Atari's Pac-Man as a {{major factor}} in the drop of {{consumer}} confidence in the company, which contributed to the North American video game crash of 1983. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra stated that the game's poor quality damaged the company's reputation. Buchanan commented that it disappointed millions of fans and diminished confidence in Atari's games. Former Next Generation editor-in-chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari's quality to the disappointment he had from buying the game as a child. Calling the game the top video game disaster, Buchanan credits Pac-Man as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the 1980s. Author Steven Kent also <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> game, along with Atari's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, for severely damaging the company's reputation and profitability. Montfort and Bogost stated that the game's negative reception seeded mistrust in retailers, which was reinforced by later factors that culminated in the crash.|$|E

5|$|The High Sparrow chides Queen Margaery Tyrell {{that she}} needs to provide King Tommen Baratheon with an heir, and that she should try to convert her {{grandmother}} Olenna to the Faith, subtly remarking that Olenna's safety cannot be guaranteed otherwise. Margaery meets with Olenna, who attempts to convince her to leave King's Landing and return to Highgarden. Margaery refuses, stating that as Queen, her place is supposed to be at King Tommen's side. Margaery discreetly slips her a piece of paper with the sigil of House Tyrell drawn on it, indicating that she is still loyal to her family, upon which Olenna agrees to leave. Cersei Lannister then confronts Olenna, and tries to convince her to stay and fight the Sparrows. Olenna points out that they have already lost and <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> Sparrows' rise to power on Cersei's lack of foresight. Despite having no allies in King's Landing, Cersei decides to stay and fight.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{surviving}} Early Middle Ages sources, {{there are six}} that mention Helmichis by name. Of these, the only contemporary one is the Chronica of Marius of Avenches, written in the 580s. Marius was bishop of Aventicum, a town located in the western Alps in the Frankish Kingdom of Burgundy. Because of the small distance from Aventicum to the Italian peninsula, the chronicler had easy access to information regarding northern Italy. For this reason, historian Roger Collins considers the Chronica, though short, to be reliable on Italian matters. The remaining sources all come from Italy and were written in later centuries. Two of them were written in the 7th century, the Continuatio Havniensis Prosperi and the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, both anonymous. The Continuatio is a chronicle written around 625 that has reached us in a single manuscript. As its name suggests, it {{is a continuation of}} the 5th century chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine. Derived in considerable measure from the Chronica Majora of Isidore of Seville, it <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> Romans for their inability to defend Italy from foreign invaders, and praises the Lombards for defending the country from the Franks. This is the earliest surviving work to name Rosamund, the queen of the Lombards who plays a central role in Helmichis' attested biography. The other 7th century work, the Origo, is a brief prose history of the Lombards that is essentially an annotated king list, although it begins with a description of the founding myth of the Lombard nation. Giorgio Ausenda believes that the Origo was written around 643 as a prologue to the Edictum Rothari, and continued to be updated till 671. According to Walter Pohl, the author's motives are mostly political: the Origo serves to consolidate the Lombards' national identity by emphasising a shared history. Apart from the origin myth, the only more detailed account is the one concerning the death of Alboin, and thus Helmichis.|$|E

25|$|Cole {{lived in}} Beirut for several years, and was present {{for part of}} the 1975–1976 civil war. His {{overview}} of 20th century Lebanese history <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> CIA for rigging elections there in 1957, in order to allow president Camille Chamoun a second term. (Chamoun had apparently persuaded Dwight D. Eisenhower that the Druze leaned towards Communism.) This had the effect of forcing pro-Nasser Arab nationalists outside the political process. Cole additionally <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> influx of 100,000 Palestinian refugees in 1948—and the various later military actions against them by Syria and Israel—for the condition of Lebanese politics today.|$|E

50|$|Since {{most studies}} have found that people tend to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> victim of rape for the incident, a study called Gender Differences in Attributions of Blame for Male Rape Victims in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence focused on where <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> lies in rape cases. In cases of female rape victims, a higher {{proportion}} of males than females tend to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> victim for the sexual assault. In order to show whether male or female respondents <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> rape victim at a higher rate, this study utilized a story of a man being raped to see if <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> was placed on the victim or the assaulter. After performing the experiment, researchers found that a statistically significant proportion of males tend to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> victim, even when the rape victim is a male. This study implies that even in cases of male sexual victimization, the male victims are held responsible for the assault by the majority of the uninvolved population.|$|R
25|$|In the {{expulsion}} from Eden narrative a dialogue is exchanged between a legged serpent (possibly {{similar to that}} appearing on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon) and the woman (3:1–5). The serpent is identified in 2:19 as an animal that was made by Yahweh among the beasts of the field. The woman is {{willing to talk to}} the serpent and respond to the creature's cynicism by repeating Yahweh's prohibition from 2:17. The serpent directly disputes Yahweh's command. Adam and the woman sin (3:6-8). Yahweh questions Adam, who <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> woman (3:9–13). Yahweh then challenges the woman to explain herself, who <b>blames</b> <b>the</b> serpent, who is cursed to crawl on its belly, so losing its limbs.|$|E

40|$|Readers {{may choose}} their own villain in the story we have told.

Some will attach <b>blame</b> to <b>the</b> politicians who exploited antievolution sentiment to get into, or remain, in office. Others will <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> conservative Protestant clergy. Some may <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> whole educational system for failing to teach Americans how to evaluate evidence. And many will <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> evolutionists for bringing the matter up in the first place. But whatever the lesson one wishes to draw from the history of biology textbooks since the Scopes trial, we think the story itself is worth knowing. That the textbooks could have downgraded their treatment of evolution with almost nobody noticing is the greatest tragedy of all...|$|R
