25|$|While Kelly was in prison, his {{brothers}} Jim (aged 12) and Dan (aged 10) were arrested by Constable Flood for riding a horse {{that did not}} belong to them. The horse had been lent to them by a farmer for whom they had been doing some work, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> spent a night in the cells before the matter was cleared.|$|E
25|$|In September 1939 {{the school}} was {{evacuated}} to Easthampstead Park, near Crowthorne in Berkshire, where, under the then High Master, W. F. Oakeshott, it became solely a boarding school {{for the period of}} the war. Playing fields and some other facilities were borrowed from nearby Wellington College, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> and the teachers from the two schools remained entirely separate.|$|E
25|$|The boys stop a huge army of {{assorted}} enemies from {{destroying the}} town hall before a voice announces 'Game Over' and the game world collapses. After the boys are pulled out into a world beyond the Universe, the villain is revealed to be the Japanese Announcer (who provides voice-overs during gameplay), who has been manipulating South Park and using the boys as pawns. The Announcer then attacks South Park and attempts to storm {{the town hall}} himself, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> are able to defeat him. Without an ultimate villain controlling South Park, the evil forces disappear and everything returns to normal.|$|E

500|$|A new freshman, David Banks, wrote {{a letter}} to his mother about his {{experience}} in trying out for the football team in the fall of 1901:"I am not sure whether I ought to play football or not. ... I put on Tom's suit one night and went down to the field to meet Yost and a few other men. They made me run around the track a couple times to try my wind. Then they rolled me around the ground and sat on me a while. I did not understand the necessity of all they did to me, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> say every great player must begin that way." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Kankers return, {{they make}} {{multiple}} attempts to garner the Eds' attention, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> engrossed {{with what they}} are watching on the T.V., ignore them. Angry, and feeling unappreciated, the Kankers start bossing the Eds around, forcing them {{to clean up the}} house. Eddy quickly grows annoyed with the situation though, and loses his temper with the Kankers, sending them crying into their room. In a moment of regret, he attempts to apologize, but is told by May to leave and to never return. The Eds gladly accept this, but upon opening the front door, they find the Kankers blocking their way, holding self-made dolls styled to look like the Eds. Dubbing the dolls [...] "Eddy Junior", [...] "Ed Junior" [...] and [...] "Double D Junior", the Kankers try to guilt the Eds into staying. However, this only causes the boys to flee in terror. The Kankers look after the Eds longingly as they go and declare their love for them.|$|E
500|$|Upset by the {{national}} attention, Mayor McDaniels wants to resolve the situation, and the boys suggest getting the official dictionary definition updated. The town invites the English Dictionary Officiates, led by the head editor, former child actor Emmanuel Lewis, to review the proposal and consider making the definition change official. As the town celebrates the arrival of Lewis and the Officiates, the bikers suddenly crash the event and begin to riot. After inflicting damage to the town and scaring off the citizens, they corner the boys in an alley. The bikers demand they stop being called [...] "fags", <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> refuse to do so, asserting their behavior further justifies {{the application of the}} term. Butters steps between them and comes to the defense of the riders by expressing his admiration for the Harley-Davidson lifestyle. Confronted by gun-wielding residents led by Big Gay Al, the riders ultimately accept their new label, and Lewis (who was roughed up during the riot) is happy to declare the definition officially changed. The town rejoices and celebrates, and the episode cuts to an ending title card with an updated definition: ...|$|E

2500|$|The accuser and {{his brother}} both testified that on one brief occasion, they saw Jackson naked, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> {{described}} the incident differently. According to Star, the brothers were watching a movie on Jackson's bed and Jackson came in to fetch [...] "something." [...] Star testified that Jackson [...] "had a hard-on," [...] and that he told the boys, who were [...] "grossed out," [...] that nudity was natural. Star said Jackson stayed for two minutes {{and sat on the}} bed, but neither brother spoke a word during that time. According to Gavin, the boys were [...] "just laying there" [...] when Jackson [...] "ran up there and got something and went back downstairs," [...] without saying anything. Gavin did not describe Jackson as having an erection.|$|E
2500|$|The machine {{releases}} all of {{the lawn}} gnomes and they erupt onto the beach. The beach goers flee in panic of [...] "gnomeageddon" [...] and the beach is destroyed. Candace does not realize this as {{she is trying to}} convince her mother not to come in and ruin her good time, so when she tries to justify the beach's existence, she finds nothing but their normal backyard. Candace is depressed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> find the day to be a successful one. Candace is helped inside by Isabella and Linda. At the end, the DJ from the beginning congratulates Phineas and Ferb and also says that tomorrow will be hot and sunny too, but then Ferb adds [...] "with a slight chance of scattered lawn gnomes", to which Phineas (and probably a lot of viewers) laughs. Then there is a zoom-out and the gnomes that crashed into the Flynn-Fletcher household roof are seen.|$|E
2500|$|Next Dann {{drove the}} {{children}} {{back to their}} home and offered them some arsenic-poisoned milk, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> spat it out because it tasted strange to them. Once at their home, she lured them downstairs and used gasoline to {{set fire to the}} house, trapping their mother and the two children in the basement (they managed to escape). [...] She drove three and a half blocks to the Hubbard Woods Elementary School with three handguns in her possession. She wandered into a second grade classroom for a short while, then left. Finding a boy in the corridor, Dann pushed him into the boys' washroom and shot him with a [...]22 semi-automatic Beretta pistol. Her Smith & Wesson [...]357 Magnum revolver jammed when she tried to fire it at two other boys, and she threw it into the trash along with the spare ammunition. The boys ran out of the washroom and raised the alarm. Dann then re-entered the second grade classroom where students were working in groups on a bicycle safety test. She ordered all the children into the corner of the room. The teacher refused and attempted to disarm Dann, managing to unload the Beretta in the struggle. Dann drew a [...]32 Smith & Wesson from the waistband of her shorts and aimed it at several groups of the students. She shot five children, killing eight-year-old Nicholas Corwin and wounding two girls and two boys before fleeing in her car.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned to}} Harry, {{as if to}} {{ascertain}} whether he objected to this, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> laughed.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> Henry was troubled, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> Joe said, inaudibly, and gratefully, [...] "We're all honky, after all; and no {{postponement}} {{on account}} of the weather." ...|$|R

2500|$|Vasudeva Krishna's {{words to}} Princess Krishna (alias Draupadi, Panchali):- Those sons of yours, {{are devoted to}} the study of the science of arms, are well-behaved and conduct {{themselves}} on the pattern of their righteous friends. Your father and your uterine brothers proffer them a kingdom and territories; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> find no joy in the house of Drupada, or in that of their maternal uncles. [...] Safely proceeding to the land of the Anartas, they take the greatest delight in the study of the science of arms. Your sons enter the town of the Vrishnis (Dwaraka) and take an immediate liking to the people there. And as you would direct them to conduct themselves, or as the respected Kunti would do, so does Subhadra (their stepmother) direct them in a watchful way. Perhaps, she is still more careful of them. As Pradyumna is the preceptor of Aniruddha, of Abhimanyu, of Sunitha, and of Bhanu; so he is the preceptor and the refuge of your sons also! And a good preceptor, would unceasingly give them lessons in the wielding of maces and swords and bucklers, in missiles and in the arts of driving cars and of riding horses, being valiant. And he, Pradyumna, the son of Rukmini, having bestowed a very good training upon them, and having taught them the art of using various weapons in a proper way, takes satisfaction at the valorous deeds of your sons, and of Abhimanyu. O daughter of Drupada! And when your son goes out, in pursuit of (out-door) sports, each one of them is followed thither by cars and horses and vehicles and elephants.’ ...|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> thought otherwise, {{and in the}} end gave Martin Harris two dollars, {{with which}} the boatman was highly pleased.|$|E

50|$|As Alf {{enters the}} bilge, Molly slips in behind him, unseen. The three filthy orphans gather around Alf and his bucket of food. Prentiss, who {{identifies}} {{himself as the}} group’s leader, demands {{to speak to the}} Captain, while the food-obsessed Ted dives into to the bucket of food and gulps down several handfuls, only to realize he’s been fed worms. <b>The</b> third <b>Boy</b> asks Alf about their fate but he refuses to answer. Alf leaves and Molly appears, startling <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b> Prentiss again asserts his leadership, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> challenges him and captivates Molly. Molly coaxes names out of Ted and Prentiss, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> doesn’t have one. <b>The</b> <b>Boy</b> lashes out, <b>but</b> Molly challenges him, which sparks something new in him. Molly leads Ted and Prentiss to find real food, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> doesn’t follow. <b>The</b> <b>Boy</b> flashes back to St. Norbert’s Orphanage for Lost Boys, where Grempkin is lashing him. <b>The</b> <b>Boy</b> imagines having a family. Molly re-enters to fetch <b>the</b> <b>Boy,</b> saving him from his nightmare.|$|R
