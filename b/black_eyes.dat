5|$|Swannell {{returned}} to Britain with the touring team, and was reselected for the 1904 tour, this time taking in Australia and New Zealand. Swannell played in 15 games, including all four Test Matches, three against Australia {{and the final}} Test against New Zealand. In the third Test, Swannell scored his first and only international points, a try against Australia in Sydney. The British Isles were victorious over the Australians, but lost the New Zealand match, {{this was the first}} international game that Swannell had been on the losing side. In the New Zealand clash, Swannell's violent playing style, was targeted by countering with equally rough play. He left the field {{at the end of the}} match with two <b>black</b> <b>eyes,</b> and bleeding, but with his spirit undaunted.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and <b>black</b> <b>eyes</b> on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the various}} rooms, she meets men wearing vest tops with their faces painted white with <b>black</b> <b>eyes</b> {{staring at her}} as she passes down the corridor. Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko. Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is marcelled and blonde.|$|E

This is the criminal type that may be discovered as soon as observed. It sullies the name of Italian.|$|E

In the movie, the costume is considered common and easily purchasable making identifying the buyers difficult and creating the possibility for anyone to be the killer.|$|E
25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrel}} (Sciurus carolinensis) — {{the most frequently}} seen mammal in Connecticut and the largest squirrel found in the state. Acorn production can fluctuate greatly from year to year, affecting the squirrel population. Historically, {{there have been reports}} of large migrations of squirrels, including one in 1933 involving at least 1,000 {{gray squirrel}}s swimming across the Connecticut River between Hartford and Essex. Limited food supply probably causes these migrations, although the exact causes are unknown. In Stratford, white squirrels, a local variant of the species, had been seen for years as of 2010 in different sections of town. Many had some light gray or reddish color and <b>black</b> <b>eyes,</b> indicating they were not albinos.|$|E

50|$|A <b>black</b> <b>eye,</b> {{periorbital}} hematoma, or shiner, is bruising {{around the}} eye commonly {{due to an}} injury to the face {{rather than to the}} eye. The name is given due to the color of bruising. The so-called <b>black</b> <b>eye</b> is caused by bleeding beneath the skin and around the <b>eye.</b> Sometimes a <b>black</b> <b>eye</b> could get worse if not referring to a doctor after a few months, indicating a more extensive injury, even a skull fracture, particularly if the area around both eyes is bruised (raccoon eyes), or if there has been a prior head injury.|$|R

500|$|The {{progression}} of Anarky's abilities was also mirrored {{by the change}} in the character's costume. The design shift from an early suit intended to disguise Lonnie's age, to one that fit him more fully, was commented on by Norm Breyfogle, who wrote, [...] "…during his existence he's gained quite a few inches and pounds, filling out his costume! The change from <b>black</b> <b>eyes</b> to white may also be seen as indicating that Lonnie's real eyes now peer out of the mask. He's literally grown into the role!" ...|$|E

[...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post granted the film praise, [...] "Enchantment on the cutting edge, a dark yet heartfelt portrait of the artist as a young mannequin." [...] She too praised Depp's performance in stating, [...] "... nicely cast, brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright <b>black</b> <b>eyes</b> and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands.|$|E

500|$|Throughout her career, Paine {{generally}} made {{oil paintings}} on 1/2 inch wood panels {{of which the}} sides and back were washed in red, gray-green, or green-blue. The subjects of the paintings were often portrayed in a confident manner in half-length poses. Their accessories, hair, and clothing were often [...] "elaborately detailed". The placement of hands, tables, and other objects could be awkward. She {{had a tendency to}} paint the sitters with long hands, light flesh tones, doelike eyes and round faces. Paine was known to take liberties in the portrayal of her subjects; she once painted a gray-eyed man's portrait with <b>black</b> <b>eyes</b> because she thought they were more attractive.|$|E
500|$|Going to work bloodied {{and bruised}} {{would lead to}} execution. If a {{prisoner}} was beaten and sustained <b>black</b> <b>eyes,</b> open wounds and severe swelling, he was called a clepsydra (Greek for [...] "water clock", the Polish word [...] is a synonym for [...] "obituary") by the other prisoners and most likely shot that evening at roll call {{or the next day}} if the bruised cheeks began to swell up. Many Sonderkommando prisoners hanged themselves at night. Suicides in the Totenjuden barracks occurred at the rate of 15 to 20 per day. The work crews – usually unable to eat or sleep from fear and anxiety – were almost entirely replaced every few days; members of the old work detail were sent to their deaths except for the most resilient.|$|E
500|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of Ernest's childhood. When he was fourteen months old, a servant commented that Ernest [...] "runs {{around like a}} weasel. He is teething and as cross as a little badger from impatience and liveliness. He is not pretty now, except his beautiful black eyes". In May 1820, his mother described Ernest as [...] "very big for his age, as well as intelligent. His big <b>black</b> <b>eyes</b> are full of spirit and vivacity". Biographer Richard Hough writes that [...] "even from their infancy, it was plainly evident that the elder son took after his father, in character and appearance, while Albert strongly resembled his mother in most respects". Ernest and his brother often lived with their grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld until her death in 1831.|$|E

500|$|In the story's prologue, Sebastian Ballister is born in Devon to the 2nd Marquess of Dain and his Italian wife, Lucia Usignuolo. The Marquess is {{disgusted with}} the child, {{describing}} him as the [...] "Devil's spawn" [...] and a [...] "wizened olive thing with large <b>black</b> <b>eyes,</b> ill-proportioned limbs, and a grossly oversize nose". Eight years later, the tempestuous Lucia abandons her husband for her lover. Unloved by his father and told that his mother is an [...] "evil, godless creature", Sebastian is sent off to Eton where he is teased by his classmates over his appearance. The boy grows up learning to hide his feelings; given no inheritance by his father, Sebastian acquires clever ways to make his fortune and uses money to unscrupulously get his way.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the rules}} and banishments, there were {{incidents}} which {{made their way into}} newspapers. Billingsley associate Steve Hannagan believed that one [...] "good fight" [...] a year was permissible for a respectable night club. Johnny Weissmuller accused a Navy lieutenant of using a lit cigarette to burn the clothing of dancers as they passed his table. The lieutenant advised Weissmuller to get a haircut; his wife told Weissmuller to go back to Hollywood with the other ape-men. The Navy man suffered two <b>black</b> <b>eyes</b> and complained that Weissmuller's friends held him as he was punched by Weissmuller. [...] Ernest Hemingway once took issue with a stranger who slapped him on the back; knocking him into three chairs and a table as he brushed him away. Billingsley contended that many of the incidents that appeared in print were minor disagreements which were inflated by the press.|$|E
