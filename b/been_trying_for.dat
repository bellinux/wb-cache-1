25|$|On 9 July 1847 {{the railway}} {{merged with the}} Caledonian Railway and became their main outlet to the coast. The Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway opened its branch line on 13 May 1865 with its trains being {{operated}} by the Caledonian Railway, but its steamer operations were slow {{to live up to}} their promise and when in 1869 the Glasgow and South Western Railway opened its station at Princes Pier, Greenock, the Cathcart Street station was effectively bypassed and the Caley lost trade. They had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>for</b> some time to organise an extension to Gourock, and having gained Parliamentary approval in 1884 they spent three years in construction which involved extensive tunnelling, and opened Gourock railway station on 1 June 1889.

25|$|In 2016 {{the first}} climbers from Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Tunisia reached {{the summit of}} Mount Everest. Only two other people from North Africa have summited Everest, one from Algeria and the other from Morocco. The {{youngest}} Australian woman to summit Mount Everest was Alyssa Azar. She returned to Australia safely, but a bittersweet victory for Australia after the loss of another Australian woman who was also trying to summit that May with her husband. The youngest Japanese woman also summited (and returned alive) {{at the age of}} 19. Another woman record-breaker in 2016 was the first woman from Thailand to summit Mount Everest, Napassaporn Chumnarnsit, who was granted an audience with the Prime Minister of Thailand for her achievement. The first person with Cystic Fibrosis also summited Mount Everest on his third try. Also, a 61-year old summited with two artificial knees. He had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>for</b> several years and had lost his Nepali friend Sherpa Nawang Tenzing in the 2015 earthquakes. He was not alone in being grief-stricken, as many climbers connected with the Everest mountaineering community lost climbing buddies in two years of disasters.

500|$|Spedding and Wilhelm {{found an}} old wooden {{building}} on the southeastern edge of the campus. It had been a home economics building until 1926, and then {{had served as a}} women's gymnasium until a new one was built in 1941; by 1942 it was mainly used for storage. The building was handed over to the Ames Project, and the wooden floor replaced with a concrete one, much to the disappointment of the university architect, who had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>for</b> some years to get the place torn down. [...] The building officially became known as the Physical Chemistry Annex; local people called it [...] "Little Ankeny", after the nearby town of Ankeny, Iowa, where there was an ordnance plant. Looking for machine tools, Wilhelm found a machine shop for sale in Ames. The owner, Bill Maitland, had once made gardening tools, but could no longer obtain the metal he needed due to wartime rationing. Wilhelm bought it for $8,000. The Metallurgical Laboratory supplied two large 40-kilowatt s.|$|E
500|$|Cerium was {{originally}} {{isolated in the}} form of its oxide, which was named ceria, a term that is still used. The metal itself was too electropositive to be isolated by then-current smelting technology, a characteristic of rare-earth metals in general. After the development of electrochemistry by Humphry Davy five years later, the earths soon yielded the metals they contained. Ceria, as isolated in 1803, contained all of the lanthanides present in the cerite ore from Bastnäs, Sweden, and thus only contained about 45% of what is now known to be pure ceria. It was not until Carl Gustaf Mosander succeeded in removing lanthana and [...] "didymia" [...] in the late 1830s that ceria was obtained pure. Wilhelm Hisinger was a wealthy mine-owner and amateur scientist, and sponsor of Berzelius. He owned and controlled the mine at Bastnäs, and had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>for</b> years to find out the composition of the abundant heavy gangue rock (the [...] "Tungsten of Bastnäs", which despite its name contained no tungsten), now known as cerite, that he had in his mine. Mosander and his family lived for many years in the same house as Berzelius, and Mosander was undoubtedly persuaded by Berzelius to investigate ceria further.|$|E

2500|$|Veteran full-back Becky Easton {{had played}} in Cup final defeats with Everton in 2005, Liverpool in 1995 and 1996, as well as captaining Doncaster Belles in their 2002 defeat to Fulham.

He noted that the Afghan militants are always welcome in the country, although foreign insurgents are not. In September 2007, Karzai again offered talks with militant fighters after a security scare forced him to end a commemoration speech. Karzai left the event and was taken back to his palace, where he was due to meet visiting Latvian President Valdis Zatlers.

2500|$|On June 17, Nixon's Plumbers {{were caught}} burglarizing the DNC {{offices in the}} Watergate.

On June 26, Nixon's counsel John Dean ordered DCI Walters to pay the plumbers untraceable hush money.
