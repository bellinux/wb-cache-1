5|$|King {{stated that}} black Americans, {{as well as}} other {{disadvantaged}} Americans, should <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the T-10BM design {{outwardly}} {{resembles the}} Su-27 {{more than the}} Su-27M. During tests of the thrust-vectoring engines and the Su-27M's aerodynamic layout, Sukhoi had concluded {{that the loss of}} manoeuvrability due to the removal of the canards– the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe– could <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> by the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles. Industry progress in the fields of avionics and radars have also reduced the weight and size of such components, which shifted the centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward. Therefore, designers removed the canards (and the dorsal air brake) found on the Su-27M; the size of the vertical tails, aft-cockpit hump and tail boom were also reduced. With such changes, as well as the increased use of aluminium and titanium alloys and composites, designers had reduced the empty weight of the aircraft, while maintaining a similar maximum take-off weight to the Su-27M.|$|E
40|$|I {{explore the}} {{difference}} in hours of work and compensation between workers who <b>are</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> overtime hours {{and those who are}} not. I find that workers not paid for overtime work significantly more than workers who are. No previous research has tested whether or not salaried workers who are not paid for extra hours of work <b>are</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> their additional hours. My results indicate that these salaried workers <b>are</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> their additional work by receiving higher salaries in both current and future time periods. ...|$|R

30|$|Linear {{disturbances}} such as gravity <b>are</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> by the DOB while nonlinear {{static friction}} <b>is</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> by the FM. To avoid overcompensation of the integrator in the DOB, the update of the compensation value is suspended at low speeds. Then, designers can treat EHAs {{as if they}} are simple second-order systems without any disturbances resulting in an easy-to-tune controller.|$|R

25|$|The (latter mentioned) {{effect of}} {{overestimation}} can <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> by converting risks to odds, and relative risks to odds ratios.

25|$|The representatives {{discussed}} a possible alliance against France, the possible terms of surrender, {{the question of}} whether slavery might persist after the war, and {{the question of whether}} the South would <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> property lost through emancipation. Lincoln and Seward reportedly offered some possibilities for compromise on the issue of slavery. The only concrete agreement reached was over prisoner-of-war exchanges.|$|E

25|$|Simple lenses {{are subject}} to the optical aberrations {{discussed}} above. In many cases these aberrations can <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> to a great extent by using a combination of simple lenses with complementary aberrations. A compound lens is a collection of simple lenses of different shapes and made of materials of different refractive indices, arranged one after the other with a common axis.|$|E
25|$|The 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs {{reduced the}} Wyandotte lands drastically, leaving the people only small parcels in Ohio. In 1842, the Wyandotte lost {{all of their}} land east of the Mississippi River, under {{pressure}} of the United States government policy to remove the Native Americans to the West. They made a treaty with the U.S. government by which they were to <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> their lands.|$|E
25|$|The British authorities, unhappy to {{discover}} Ranjitsinhji was never adopted and {{impressed by his}} potential at the college, initially tried to persuade Vibhaji to retain Ranjitsinhji as his heir but the Jam Sahib insisted Jawatsinhji should succeed him. In October 1884, Jawatsinhji was recognised as Vibhaji's heir by the Government of India, but the Viceroy, Lord Ripon, believed that Ranjitsinhji should <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> losing his position.|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} problem in Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) imaging <b>is</b> <b>compensating</b> <b>for</b> unknown {{errors in the}} sonar path trajectory. Unknown deviations from the ideal sonar trajectory {{have the effect of}} blurring and smearing the sea-floor image. In typical operating conditions, the blurring can completely obscure details in the imaged scene. Techniques for estimating path deviations from the recorded data have been developed. Once estimated, the effects of deviations <b>are</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> and the blurring reduced. The process of estimating path-deviations and removing image blurring is called autofocus...|$|R

25|$|Just as {{mutations}} {{in two separate}} genes can be non-additive if those genes interact, {{mutations in}} two codons within a gene can be non-additive. In genetics this is sometimes called intragenic complementation when one deleterious mutation can <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> by a second mutation within that gene. This occurs when the amino acids within a protein interact. Due {{to the complexity of}} protein folding and activity, additive mutations are rare.|$|E
25|$|A muscular {{diaphragm}} helps mammals to breathe, {{especially during}} strenuous activity. For a diaphragm to work, the ribs must not restrict the abdomen, so that {{expansion of the}} chest can <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> by reduction in {{the volume of the}} abdomen and vice versa. Diaphragms are known in caseid pelycosaurs, indicating an early origin within synapsids, though they were still fairly inefficient and likely required support from other muscle groups and limb motion.|$|E
25|$|Years later, in 1783, North Carolina {{determined}} that Richard Henderson and Co. should <b>be</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>for</b> their efforts {{and with some}} portion of the grant lands that were nullified. A grant was made for 190,000 acres in the Powell Valley Curiously, this land grant by North Carolina to Henderson & Co was mostly {{in what is now}} Virginia. The grant made in two tracts did include acreage further west in what is now Anderson County Tennessee.|$|E
