5|$|In Grenada, Earl {{produced}} {{heavy rains}} and strong winds that caused moderate damage. On the main island, roofs were <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> twelve homes while three others were partially damaged; twelve trees and six power poles were also knocked {{down by the}} winds. The heavy rain associated with the tropical storm triggered nine mudslides and three rockslides on the island. Nearby, six homes had their roofs completely <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> while thirteen others were damaged. Flooding was also reported on both islands; however, no known damage resulted from them. During the storm, a nursing home had to be evacuated due to significant damage to the structure. On St Vincent and the Grenadines, at least two homes had their roofs <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> and banana crops sustained moderate damage. In Tobago, numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the island, cutting power to 90% of the island. The highest surface sustained winds in relation to Earl occurred {{on the morning of}} August 15 in Barbados and St. Lucia; winds were reported at 35mph (55km/h). One person was killed by the storm and nineteen others were listed as missing.|$|E

5|$|Due to Turkish {{government}} {{fears of}} a terrorist attack, security measures during the summit were tight. Demonstrators {{from around the world}} gathered to protest against NATO or the American foreign policy under the George W. Bush Administration, while the summit itself was <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> the front pages of the world press by the unexpected transfer of Iraqi sovereignty, coinciding with {{the first day of the}} NATO summit on June 28.|$|E

5|$|Leif and {{his crew}} {{travelled}} from Greenland to Norway in 999 AD. <b>Blown</b> <b>off</b> course to the Hebrides and staying {{for much of the}} summer, he arrived in Norway and became a hirdman of King Olaf Tryggvason. He also converted to Christianity and was given the mission of introducing the religion to Greenland. The Saga of Erik the Red and the Saga of the Greenlanders, both thought to have been written around 1200, contain different accounts of the voyages to Vinland. The only two known strictly historical mentions of Vinland are found in the work of Adam of Bremen c. 1075 and in the Book of Icelanders compiled c. 1122 by Ari the Wise. According to the Saga of Erik the Red, Leif apparently saw Vinland for the first time after being <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> course on his way to introduce Christianity to Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, {{moisture}} from Bonnie {{combined with a}} cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Arkansas, lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power {{to much of the}} city of Rison after striking a transformer. Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where awnings were <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> homes, structures sustained roof damage, and trees were felled. Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding, covering several highways. Throughout the state, storm damage was estimated at $356,000 (2010USD).|$|E
5|$|NIST {{found that}} the {{fireproofing}} on the Twin Towers' steel infrastructures was <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> by the initial impact of the planes and that, had this not occurred, the towers likely would have remained standing. A 2007 study of the north tower's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that, since the plane's impact had stripped off much of the structure's thermal insulation, the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless {{of the number of}} columns cut or damaged by the impact.|$|E

5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} {{so badly that}} almost every window, front and back, was blown in as the {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof {{of at least one}} house was <b>blown</b> <b>off.</b> Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, {{not only because of the}} smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E
5|$|The Butler Stand {{roof was}} <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> {{in a storm}} in January 1976. The ground damage meant the club's next home game against Middlesbrough had to be played at Vale Park, the home of local rivals Port Vale. The repair bill, {{in the region of}} £250,000, put the club in {{financial}} trouble, which was eased by the sale of Alan Hudson, Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff for a combined sum of £440,000. With the team depleted, relegation proved inevitable in the 1976–77 season. Waddington, after a spell of 17 years in charge, left the club after a 1–0 home defeat in March 1977.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler {{team has}} said that Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c are {{probably}} composed mostly of water with a thin hydrogen and helium atmosphere. In comparison to the outer planets of the system, which probably have large hydrogen and helium atmospheres, Kepler-11c's proximity to its star has <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> most of its atmosphere. Kepler-11 and its six-planet system form what NASA considers {{to be the most}} compact and flattest planetary system yet discovered. Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c orbit Kepler-11 with a phenomenon called orbital resonance, a gravitational tugging that keeps their orbit stable at a 5.4 ratio.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} account of Japanese contact in Palau occurred in 1820, when a coastal sailing ship was <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> course and eight surviving men {{spent five years}} in Palau until 1825. Japanese traders began to establish settlements from the mid-19th century onwards, and by 1890 two Japanese trading stations had been established. Many of these traders married the daughters of local chieftains and raised local families. When Japan annexed Palau from Germany in 1914, Japanese settlers and their descendants acted as state liaison officials and interpreters for the Japanese military administration.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{making its}} final {{landfall}} in Sinaloa, Paul produced hurricane-force winds recorded at 100mph (160km/h) in Los Mochis. The winds demolished numerous {{homes in the}} region, leaving 140,000 residents homeless and another 400,000 people isolated. The greatest damage occurred 70miles (110km) south of Los Mochis {{in the city of}} Guamuchil; some houses suffered total destruction, while many other had their roof <b>blown</b> <b>off.</b> A total of 24 people were killed by the storm, although it produced beneficial rains over the region.|$|E
5|$|While {{the freeway}} was under {{construction}} in 1983, {{it was discovered that}} it ran through Native American burial grounds in Deptford. This revelation led to unsuccessful lawsuits to cease construction of the route. After the lawsuits, a couple of incidents happened to construction workers, including a construction worker being run over by an asphalt truck, another being <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> a bridge by strong winds, and a van carrying five construction workers randomly erupting into flames.|$|E

50|$|The pre-war {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} two large inclined Ross-pop safety valves, {{mounted on the}} upper sides of the boiler {{just ahead of the}} firebox and aimed about 80 degrees apart. When these inclined valves <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> under a station canopy, bystanders often received a shower of slimy wet soot. After the war, they were replaced by four smaller Ross-pop valves at the highest point of the boiler that <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> straight up.|$|R

5|$|Cyclone Osea was {{extremely}} destructive {{to some of}} the islands in French Polynesia. Over 700homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Raiatea. Several roofs were <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> of buildings across the archipelago. On Maupiti, an island with a population of 1,100, about 95% of the infrastructure was destroyed. The town hall, twoschools, and an airfield were destroyed. The town hall was originally being used as an emergency shelter, but was later evacuated due to strong winds and was later destroyed. Furthermore, many roadways and highways were blocked due to flooding. In addition, 77homes on the island were destroyed. All but threehomes that belonged to Mormons on the island were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In early August, Lerch and U-12 set {{out from}} Pola for Venice to look for enemy ships to sink. On 6 August, the Italian {{destroyer}} Rosolino Pilo rammed U-12, probably by chance, at about 05:00 in the Lido inlet of the Venetian Lagoon. Two days later, when Italian workers were dredging to try to determine the object Rosolino Pilo had hit, they heard a heavy explosion. When divers {{went down in the}} area, they discovered the wreck of U-12 with her stern <b>blown</b> <b>off.</b> U-12s entire complement of 17 men was lost when she went down. U-12 was the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk during the war.|$|E
5|$|One of the French squadrons that {{operated}} in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 {{was the result}} of opportunity rather than strategy. After the Battle of Trafalgar, most of the French survivors had retreated to Cadiz, where they remained until Duckworth's blockade squadron abandoned the port in November 1805. Although Duckworth's ships were replaced by forces under Lord Collingwood, the replacements were inadequate and on 26 February 1806, while the blockade squadron, which had been pulled back in the hope of luring the French out of the port, had been <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> station, four frigates and a brig escaped. Chased by the British frigate HMS Hydra, Commodore Louis La-Marre-la-Meillerie refused battle and abandoned the brig Furet to the British in his haste to escape.|$|E

5|$|Strong {{winds were}} also {{reported}} in New England. The highest winds associated with Daisy were felt over coastal Maine, where winds of 70mph (115km/h) were commonly reported. Wind damage was severe and widespread; {{one person in}} Maine was killed when a fallen tree landed on, and crushed his car {{while he was in}} it. In the southeastern portion of the state, power outages were reported, due to fallen trees and tree limbs. In addition, some roof shingles <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> in Maine and Massachusetts, while other houses were completely unroofed. Daisy caused moderate to severe damage in eastern New England. Total wind damage in New England was estimated to have reached $500,000.|$|E
5|$|William mustered {{his forces}} at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, {{and was ready}} to cross the English Channel by about 12 August. But the {{crossing}} was delayed, either because of unfavourable weather or to avoid being intercepted by the powerful English fleet. The Normans crossed to England a few days after Harold's victory over the Norwegians, following the dispersal of Harold's naval force, and landed at Pevensey in Sussex on 28 September. A few ships were <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> course and landed at Romney, where the Normans fought the local fyrd. After landing, William's forces built a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. More fortifications were erected at Pevensey.|$|E
5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
