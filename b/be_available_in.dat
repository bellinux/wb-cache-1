5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.|$|E

5|$|The {{major problem}} was the weather. The monsoon caused rough seas that precluded {{the use of the}} small Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVPs) and {{restricted}} the operations of the larger LCMs. Because of the extremely rough seasâ€”the most difficult that the 532nd EBSR had ever encounteredâ€”most supply missions were by night when tidal conditions were most favourable. Wootten insisted that at least seven days' supplies <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> forward areas in case the weather prevented the LCMs from running. II Corps made available two trawlers, manned by the 1st Water Transport Group, to deliver rations. The Australian Army also moved supplies by DUKWs.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality.

Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E

5|$|On 6June, Wolfe {{received}} {{a message from}} Arnold informing him that the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted a raid to be conducted against Japan as soon as possible. The goals of this operation were to relieve pressure on Chinese forces which were being attacked by the Japanese and to support the invasion of Saipan. Arnold's message also asked how many B-29s could be dispatched on 15 and 20June. At the time, the first raid on Japan was tentatively scheduled for 23June, when sufficient supplies were expected to <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> China to support 100 B-29 sorties. Wolfe replied stating that 50 B-29s could be used on 15June and 55 if the operation {{was conducted on the}} 20th of the month. Arnold regarded these numbers as too low, and directed that a raid by at least 70 B-29s be conducted against Japan on 15June. Following this order, XX Bomber Command's B-29s and transport aircraft embarked on an intensive effort to move fuel to China. Further fuel supplies were made available to the heavy bombers by reducing the activities of USAAF fighter units based in China. During the same period the command's ground crews reconditioned as many B-29s as possible to improve their reliability.|$|E
5|$|Sir Nigel Gresley's {{independent}} {{report on}} the Kand K1classes during the mainline stability trials stated that they were well designed, mechanically reliable and capable of hauling expresses at high speeds on well-maintained track, which meant {{that they could have}} been useful additions to the Southern Railway's suburban commuter fleet. However, they were undoubtedly prone to rough riding and instability, and not only on the poorest quality tracks. The restricted water capacity also limited their use outside the Southern Railway's Central section. The impending electrification of the Brighton Main Line, scheduled for 1932 also meant that fewer duties suitable for heavy passenger tank locomotives would <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s. The lack of a suitable role for both classes was considered when {{the decision was made to}} rebuild them as U/U1 tender engines following the Sevenoaks disaster. In rebuilt form they continued to operate until the 1960s, and were capable of attaining speeds in excess of 70mph (110km/h) with a greater degree of stability.|$|E
5|$|The StarCraft II Editor is a campaign, map, and mod editor. It is {{far more}} {{sophisticated}} than StarCrafts StarEdit and s World Editor for creating custom maps and campaigns, {{and it is the}} first editor by Blizzard to feature built-in mod creation and usage support. Updated art and data from the original StarCraft that were not used, along with models and data that were scrapped during the development process (including those made as April Fools jokes) will <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the editor. Unlike previous editors made by Blizzard, it is the first to have Internet connectivity features such as map publishing, retrieval, and online activation of the editor client. Lead producer Chris Sigaty has stated that the editor gives players the ability to create role-playing, Hero-type units and structures resembling those from WarCraft III. At BlizzCon 2009, Blizzard demonstrated a build of the StarCraft II Editor showcasing its capabilities, such as the ability to customize the user interface to include features such as the Item system from Warcraft III.

5|$|Wooten {{initially}} {{wanted a}} night landing, {{which would give}} tactical surprise and maximise the time for unloading the landing ships before Japanese aircraft put in an appearance; {{but there would be}} no moon on 4 September, so Barbey was uncertain that {{he would be able to}} correctly locate the beaches. H-Hour was therefore set at 06:30, which was twenty minutes after sunrise. Because the air force had commitments to support the 7th Division's landing at Nadzab the following day, air cover would not <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon. Barbey therefore wanted the ships to depart at 11:00. This raised the question of whether the ships could be unloaded in just 4Â½ hours. Barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under Japanese air attack. For Australian officers with memories of the Tobruk Ferry Service, where the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had lost 25 ships keeping the port's garrison supplied, the US Navy's attitude was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, and also forming {{part of the}} collection, a mobile app titled Justice Monsters Five was developed. Based on an arcade-style mini-game from XV, it used {{gameplay}} similar to the Monster Strike series and incorporated classic Final Fantasy monsters. Justice Monsters Five was released on August 30 for mobile platforms, and eventually shut down on March 27, 2017, seven months after its initial release. A planned Windows 10 version was not released. A second promotional item was A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV, released through GameStop and EB Games in North America as a free pre-order bonus. Playing as an arcade-style beat 'em up, A King's Tale relates King Regis' exploits thirty years before the game's events, told to the young Noctis by Regis as fairy tales. A King's Tale was later made available for free for PS4 and Xbox One on March 1, 2017. In addition, another mobile game titled King's Knight: Wrath of the Dark Dragon is releasing in 2017. It is a remake of the 1986 game, and will also <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> XV as a game Noctis and his friends play. Square Enix and Machine Zone collaborated on a massively multiplayer online role-playing game for mobile devices based {{on the content of}} XV, first released on June 28, 2017. Titled Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire and developed by Machine Zone's subsidiary Epic Action, the game involves players taking the role of characters from Final Fantasy XV and fighting other player armies in real-time battles for control of the Crystal.|$|E
