40|$|In the {{aluminium}} and {{the copper}} industries, deep attentions {{are paid to}} the continuous casting， because of the good properties of the slab obtained and the cheapness of the casting costs. And so, the authors made a continuous casting apparatus: The special point of this apparatus is that the <b>bottom</b> <b>mould</b> has a cooling jacket so as to prevent the occurence of the inverse segregation. Using this apparatus, the authors made slabs of aluminium-copper (4 %) alloys, and investigated the distribution of copper. This experiment has shown that when the castig condition-casing temperature, casting velocity, cooling velocity and height of molten metal in the mould-are properly chosen, very sound slabs may be obtained by our apparatus above mentioned. 連続鋳造による鋳塊は押揚を必要とせず，人件費，諸経費の節約等種々の利点があるばかりでなく，組織が非常に緻密で良好な製品が得られるので近時斯界の注目する所となった。この連続詩造法は企業の合理化を叫ばれている今日Al, Cu合金関係業界の注目する所となっているが尚幾多改良さるべき点が残されている。著者は従来Al合金鋳塊の偏析及びその防止法について研究を続けて来たが層一層凝固する連続鋳造法を採用することが最も望ましいと云う結論に達したので従来の方法を参考にして本稿第 2 図の如き装置を製作，それによる鋳塊の性質を検討して見た...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} machining of miniature components {{is an interesting}} and very challenging task. Machining of miniature components will take long lead {{time to get the}} required size and tolerance due to the limitations of size of the machining tool and limited material removal rate. This paper presents the process of machining metal mould using aluminum- 2024 material in 3 -Axis CNC milling machine with enclosed wall of free form surfaces. The mini propeller mould is divided in to two halves namely top and bottom. The top mould has the twisted cavity contours of suction surface of the propeller blade airfoil. The <b>bottom</b> <b>mould</b> has the twisted cavity contours of pressure surface of the propeller blade airfoil. Smooth matching of leading and trailing edges over the span of the blade are also accomplished. To avoid the cutting tool interference during machining of the space between two blades, smooth contours in the mould is given and machined accordingly. The machining operations are divided in to ‘rough machining’ and ‘finishing operation’ to minimize the machining time. To avoid local gouging on the profile, sufficient allowance is kept in comparison to actual material to be removed by leaving extra material for finishing operation. During the finishing operation on the propeller blade profile which consists of free form surface, two boundaries were introduced instead of single boundary method to generate the tool path in span wise direction. The matching of two boundaries profile after finishing operation is within the accepted tolerance of + 0. 04 mm. The machined moulds were inspected and compared with the IGES model of the mould. New machining method adopted here has saved 40 % machining time without compromising in accuracy of machining top and bottom moulds of the propellers. The geometrical accuracies and surface finish of propellers blade obtained through this process are good in comparison to RPT process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, a 2 -pole linear {{electromagnetic}} stirrer (LEMS) is developed {{to study the}} effect of stirring during solidification of aluminium alloys. The stirrer design entails the placement of a stack of coils around the mold to generate a primary motion that recirculates along the longitudinal direction. The stirrer is first tested and validated by measuring the electromagnetic forces on solid aluminum cylinders of different diameters {{as a function of}} excitation current. The alloy to be stirred and solidified is placed in a cylindrical graphite mould located in the annulus of the LEMS. A suitable cooling arrangement is provided at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>mould</b> to extract heat from the melt, in order to produce a rheocast billet inside the mould.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a model allowing to produce SHIELDS diagrammes extended by certain parameters. This new concept of modification {{was employed to}} establish the onset of sediment transport with regard to various charges and bottom conditions. Detailed examinations were made to determine the risk of movement for a single-particle, the beginning of transport of sediment on a biologically stabilized or <b>moulded</b> <b>bottom</b> and due to a solitary wave with or without an underlying stationary current. Thus, in the cases evaluated, {{it is now possible}} to obtain critical shear stresses by means of analytic approximation. An existing test environment with a shear plate was modified and enlarged for the application of the model to solitary waves; detailed and extensive tests were carried out. For the first time the phenomena observed during these tests could be explained by a theory taking into account turbulent boundary layer conditions. The data thus gained allowed a novel interpretation of results found in literature and their incorporation into the modification concept. (orig.)

50|$|The {{raw sugar}} was refined {{by a series}} of boiling and {{filtering}} processes. When, at the final boiling, it was considered ready for granulation it was poured into a large number of inverted conical molds. These were usually made of either brown earthenware or sheet iron with an internal treatment of slip or paint respectively, and each stood in its own collecting pot. Over the next few days most of the dark syrup and noncrystalline matter drained through a small hole in the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>mould</b> into the collecting pot. To improve the whiteness of the sugar repeated applications of either a solution of white clay or of loaf sugar dissolved in warm water was applied to the broad end of the loaf. This slowly drained through the loaf readily uniting with any remaining molasses or other coloring matter and removing it to the collecting pot. The loaves were then tapped out of the molds, dried in a stove room that would have contained hundreds of loaves, trimmed to their final shape and wrapped, usually, in blue paper to enhance their whiteness.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that {{the better the}} control of the liquid aluminium allows obtaining of better properties. One of the most important defects that is held responsible for lower properties has been the presence of porosity. Porosity has always been associated with the amount of dissolved hydrogen in the liquid. However, it was shown that hydrogen was not the major source but only a contributor the porosity. The most important defect that causes porosity is the presence of bifilms. These defects are surface entrained mainly due to turbulence and uncontrolled melt transfer. In this work, a cylindrical mould was designed (Ø 30 x 300 mm) both from sand and die. Moulds were produced both from sand and die. Water cooled copper chill was placed at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>mould</b> in order to generate a directional solidification. After the melt was prepared, prior to casting of the DC cast samples, reduced pressure test sample was taken to measure the melt quality (i. e. bifilm index).

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{microwaves}} heat some minerals faster than others. This creates the opportunity to use microwaves to selectively heat minerals to enhance separation of valuable minerals from gangue minerals. This opportunity has been investigated by studying the heating process under controlled conditions. It involved creating synthetic samples of ore using pyrite grains suspended at known locations within a matrix made of quartz and poly(methyl methacrylate). Previous experiments used cement or plaster as the matrix however, these compounds are slow to set and allow the mineral grains to settle to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>mould</b> during the setting process. This disadvantage has been overcome by using a cost-effective mixture of quartz and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The experimental work presented in this paper has shown {{that it is possible to}} use this mixture to place mineral grains at precise locations within the matrix, and that the bulk dielectric properties of the matrix are similar to those of pulverised quartz sand. It was also determined that the optimum ratio of 10 % of PMMA (as adhesive) was the minimum mass proportion that can be used, to create the designed mineral texture without compromising mechanical properties of synthetic samples. The synthetic ore samples were resistant to breakage and could be used in multiple tests. The work in this paper demonstrates a method for creation of synthetic samples as well as their use in assessment of selective microwave heating in different types of microwave applicators...|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} that is {{described}} in this thesis we studied a new cast iron based composite material that was produced by a double casting technique using sedimentation sand casting. The material {{is based on the}} high Cr white cast irons (WCI) 15, 20 % Cr-Mo- LC and 25 % Cr matrixes, according to ASTM A 532 - 75 a and was designed to exceed the wear life of wear resistant materials that are used in cement, mining, coal extraction and chemical and process industries currently. The working region of the material extends to a depth of 5 - 8 mm below the surface and is an in situ and ex situ particle reinforced composite. WC particles of different sizes (1 - 3 and 3 - 5 mm) were selected as the ex situ reinforcements. Thus, the composite consisted of a WCI matrix, which was reinforced with WC and other transition metal carbide particles. A sand casting method was developed during which the WC particles were directed to a specific location in the ingot and were distributed uniformly in the near surface area of the composite (the working region of the material) during casting/solidification of the ingot. This ensured chemical bonding between the high Cr WCI and the particle reinforced composite (the working region) at a well defined interface parallel to the working surface. Solidification of the melt started from the WC particles around which three reaction zones were formed. Owing to partial dissolution of the WC particles and the resulting interdiffusion of elements such as W, Co, Fe, C and Cr, carbides containing Fe, Cr, W and Co were formed in the reaction zones. It is shown that current models for the interaction between a reinforcing particle and an advancing S/L interface in liquid route MMCs cannot describe the present case successfully because the solidification of the melt starts around the WC particles after the latter have settled in the near surface region of the casting. Two new approaches have been studied; in the first the WC particles travel through the iron melt and settle at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>mould</b> and in the second WC particles settled at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>mould</b> experience the forces of the liquid flow. The solidification paths of the three WCI matrixes and MMCs have been simulated with the Scheil-Gulliver model using the Thermo-Calc software for different iron based alloy systems, by changing the W, Cr and C concentrations. In the WCI, carbides solidify after the austenite. The increase in Cr from 14 to 25 wt. %, for fixed C (at 2, 2. 5 or 3 wt. %), causes the stabilization of phases according to cementite M 7 C 3 FCC (stable). Only for Cr up to 30 wt. % and C up to 2. 5 wt. % the cementite is replaced by the BCC phase. The increase in C content from 2 to 3 wt. % for fixed Cr (at 14, 20 or 25 wt. %) has the same effect. In the MMC, the increase in W from 15 to 25 wt. % causes the stabilization of M 6 C. As the C increases from 2. 5 to 6 wt. %, first the M 7 C 3 is stabilised and for C > 4 wt. % the MC phase is favoured. The increase in Cr leads {{in the formation of the}} M 23 C 6 while simultaneous increase in Cr and C promotes the M 7 C 3 phase and restrains the formation of the M 6 C that resulted from the increase of W. Finally the simultaneous increase of C, W and Cr stabilize the MC phase for > 4 wt. % C. The wear of the new materials was evaluated both in an industrial scale and in the laboratory (pin-on-disc). Segments of an industrial pulverising ash mill used in the cement industry were manufactured using the casting method and materials developed in this thesis. The results showed an improvement in the wear life of the component of several times compared to the standard high Cr WCI material used by the same industry to date...|$|R

Visiting the gallery in 1748, the Marchioness Grey described the gallery {{in a letter to}} a friend: [...] "Indeed there is a gracefulness and life in the figures beyond what I ever saw, they are quite animated and a strength of colouring that strikes you from one end of that gallery to the other. It is so beautiful that a picture which hangs by it is hurt by its situation." [...] Horace Walpole once wrote: [...] "Althorp has several very fine pictures by the best Italian hands, and a gallery of all one's acquaintances by Vandyke and Lely. In the gallery I found myself quite at home; and surprised the housekeeper by my familiarity with the portraits." [...] The portraits in the Picture Gallery are set in extravagant baroque gilded frames, designed by Robert Spencer, the Second Earl, which feature as [...] "cartouche at the top and a stylised mask at the <b>bottom,</b> with a <b>moulded</b> inner edge, which softens the line between frame and painting". Albert Spencer was so protective of War and Peace, once the most valuable item in Althorp, that he had the nearest tall window in the gallery converted into a door with hinges, so in case of a fire it could safely be lifted outside. There is also a small hidden door between War and Peace and [...] "The Windsor Beauties" [...] cut into the oak which leads to a staircase and the Pink Suite, a guest bedroom. Margaret Douglas-Home, sister of Albert Spencer, lived at Althorp from 1910, and the gallery was a favourite of hers. During the renovation of the 1980s, the old-fashioned celestial and terrestrial globes dating to the George II period were moved from the gallery back to the library.|$|R
40|$|Tissue-to-tissue {{interfaces}} {{are commonly}} {{present in all}} tissues exhibiting structural, biological and chemical gradients serving {{a wide range of}} physiological functions. These interfaces are responsible for mediation of load transfer between two adjacent tissues. They are also important structures in sustaining the cellular communications to retain tissueâ s functional integration and homeostasis. [1] All cells have the capacity to sense and respond to physical and chemical stimulus and when cultured in three-dimensional (3 D) environments they tend to perform their function better than in two-dimensional (2 D) environments. Spatial and temporal 3 D gradient hydrogels better resemble the natural environment of cells in mimicking their extracellular matrix. [2] In this study we hypothesize that differential functional properties can be engineered by modulation of macromolecule gradients in a cell seeded threedimensional hydrogel system. Specifically, differential paracrine secretory profiles can be engineered using human Bone Marrow Stem Cells (hBMSCâ s). Hence, the specific objectives of this study are to: assemble the macromolecular gradient hydrogels to evaluate the suitablity for hBMSCâ s encapsulation by cellular viability and biofunctionality by assessing the paracrine secretion of hBMSCâ s over time. The gradient hydrogels solutions were prepared by blend of macromolecules in one solution such as hyaluronic (HA) acid and collagen (Col) at different ratios. The gradient hydrogels were fabricated into cylindrical silicon moulds with higher ratio solutions assembled at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>mould</b> and adding the two solutions consecutively on top of each other. The labelling of the macromolecules was performed to confirm the gradient through fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, AFM was conducted to assess the gradient hydrogels stiffness. Gradient hydrogels characterization was performed by HA and Col degradation assay, degree of crosslinking and stability. hBMSCâ s at P 3 were encapsulated into each batch solution at 106 cells/ml solution and gradient hydrogels were produced as previously described. The hBMSCâ s were observed under confocal microscopy to assess viability by Live/DeadÂ® staining. Cellular behaviour concerning proliferation and matrix deposition was also performed. Secretory cytokine measurement for pro-inflammatory and angiogenesis factors was carried out using ELISA. At genomic level, qPCR was carried out. The 3 D gradient hydrogels platform made of different macromolecules showed to be a suitable environment for hBMSCâ s. The hBMSCâ s gradient hydrogels supported high cell survival and exhibited biofunctionality. Besides, the 3 D gradient hydrogels demonstrated differentially secretion of pro-inflammatory and angiogenic factors by the encapsulated hBMSCâ s. References: 1.

40|$|Polypropylene is in a {{category}} of thermoplastic polymer resin. It {{is a part of}} both the average household and is in commercial and industrial applications. This plastic is regularly used for food containers because it needs to be dishwasher safe. Although the thermoforming process has been developed for over two decades but there are still some unsolved problems found in this technology. In the development commercial polypropylene grades, there are several critical problems addressed such as sheet quality, part uniformity and wall thickness, regrind use and dimensional stability. This project starts with searching various types of journal that related to the topic of designing and fabricating thermoplastic container using polypropylene (PP) sheet via thermoforming process. Read and understand all the journals are the element in the effort to make this project. This study aims to design and fabricate plastic container using polypropylene (PP) sheet with thickness 1 mm via thermoforming process. CATIA P 3 V 5 R 21 software by Dassault Systemes was used to design the plastic container and its mould. Design consideration for the plastic product and its mould is important as to reduce the defects. For example fillet was added to avoid sharp edge. Draft angle also was used at the wall side of mould which is to ease the process of absorption. Round shape plastic container was selected to be design as it has smooth shape that allows the pliable polypropylene sheet to form according to the shape of the mould. An aluminum block with dimension 100 mm x 100 mm x 50 mm was used as the female cavity been cut using band saw machine. The aluminum blocks was machined using Makino KE 55 CNC Milling Machine located at the Machining Laboratory. High Speed Drilling machine was used to drill the hole {{at the bottom of the}} female mould. 1 mm and 6 mm diameter of drill bits was used to make the holes at the <b>bottom</b> of aluminum <b>mould.</b> Moreover, this project studies the effect of thermoforming temperature and number of mould vent hole to 1 mm PP sheet. Two types of vent holes used on the aluminum mould which are 1 vent and 5 vent holes. There were two parameters used to fabricate polypropylene plastic container. The first parameter is the different degree of temperature used to heat the 1 mm polypropylene plastic sheet. The degree of temperature used is 160 °C, 165 °C, 170 °C, and 175 °C. The second parameter that was used is different number of vent holes on the mould to fabricate the plastic container. The first one is 1 hole and secondly 5 holes, both ways was used same diameter of the vent hole which is 1 mm. Lastly the process to investigate the hardness property on the fabricated polypropylene plastic container was conducted using the Vickers Micro Hardness Tester to obtained the hardness value. Lowest value of HV range shows that the polypropylene plastic containers have uniform hardness. Based on the research conducted, the appearance of polypropylene plastic container at temperature 165 °C for 5 vent holes on mould almost goods compare to others temperature used.

40|$|In several {{applications}} of casting, dendritic microstructure is not desirable as {{it results in}} poor mechanical properties. Enhancing fluid flow in the mushy zone by stirring {{is one of the}} means to suppress this dendritic growth. Strong fluid flow detaches the dendrites formed at the solid-liquid interface and carries them into the mould to form slurry. When this slurry solidifies, the microstructure is characterized by globular, non-dendritic primary phase particles, separated and enclosed by a near-eutectic lower-melting secondary phase. This property represents a great potential for further processing in semisolid forming (SSF) by various techniques such as pressure die casting and forging. Among all currently available methods, linear electromagnetic (EM) stirring is considered {{as one of the most}} suitable routes for large scale production of semisolid feed stock. One of the biggest advantages of EM stirring is that the stirring intensity and direction can be modulated externally and in a non-intrusive manner. With this viewpoint, the primary objective of the present research is to investigate rheocasting using linear electromagnetic stirring. A systematic development of a linear electromagnetic stirrer (LEMS) is the subject of the first part of the thesis. The LEMS consists of a set of six primary coils displaced in space. These coils are excited by a three-phase power supply to produce an axially travelling magnetic field. The metal to be stirred is placed in the annular space of the stirrer. The travelling field induces secondary current in the molten metal. The current and magnetic fields interact to generate a net mechanical force in the metal, commonly termed as the Lorentz force. The molten metal is stirred under the influence of this force. Two prototype stirrers, one for low melting alloys and the other for aluminium alloys are developed. The stirrers are characterized by measuring forces on low melting point alloy and on solid aluminum cylinders placed inside the annular space of the stirrer. As an outcome of these tests, a non-intrusive method of detecting stirring of liquid metal is developed. The development of a rheocasting mould for the LEMS forms the second part of the work presented in the thesis. The mould design and cooling arrangement are such that solidification in the mould is primarily unidirectional. Heat from the solidifying metal is extracted at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>mould,</b> so that the axisymmetric EM stirring effectively shears the dendrites formed at the solid-liquid interface. The outer surface of the mould is cooled with water or air exiting from 64 jets, each of 4 mm diameter. Such an arrangement provides a high heat transfer coefficient and a wide range of cooling rate in the metal ranging from 0. 01 to 10 K/s. Temperature is measured at various depths in the solidifying melt and at other key locations in the mould to assess the various heat transfer mechanisms. The results from the rheocasting experiments using the above mould and LEMS are presented in the third and final part of the thesis. Such studies are required for understanding the solidification process in presence of electromagnetic stirring and for highlighting the important issues connecting solidification, fluid flow, dendrite fragmentation and the resulting microstructure. A series of experiments are performed with A 356 (Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg) alloy. Experiments are conducted with various combinations of operating parameters, and the resulting microstructures and cooling curves at various locations are examined. The key process parameters are stirring current, cooling rate, pouring temperature, and stirring current frequency. The parametric studies also include the case without EM stirring in which liquid aluminium is poured into the rheocast mould without powering the LEMS. It is found that stirring at high currents produces non-dendritic microstructures at all locations of the billet. For lower currents, however, dendritic microstructures are observed in regions outside the zone of active stirring. Stirring also enhances heat loss from the exposed top surface, leading to solid front advancement from the top as well. Without EM stirring, microstructures are found to be dendritic everywhere. The percentage of primary α-Al phase and its number density are found to increase with stirring intensity. With a decrease in cooling rate with air as the coolant, the average grain size of primary α-Al phase increases. Excitation frequency is found to be an important parameter, with lower frequencies generating a more uniform force field distribution, and higher frequencies enhancing induction heating. At higher frequencies, the effect of higher induction heating results in the formation of larger and coarser primary phase grains. This phenomenon has led to the development of a one-step process for rheocasting and heat treatment of billets...|$|R
