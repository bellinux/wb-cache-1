5000|$|<b>Backflush</b> {{accounting}} is {{a certain}} type of [...] "postproduction issuing", it is a product costing approach, used in a Just-In-Time (JIT) operating environment, in which costing is delayed until goods are finished. <b>Backflush</b> accounting delays the recording of costs until after the events have taken place, then standard costs are used to work backwards to 'flush' out the manufacturing costs. The result is that detailed tracking of costs is eliminated. Journal entries to inventory accounts may be delayed until the time of product completion or even the time of sale, and standard costs are used to assign costs to units when journal entries are made. Backflushing transaction has two steps: one step of the transaction reports the produced part which serves to increase the quantity on-hand of the produced part and a second step which relieves the inventory of all the component parts. Component part numbers and quantities-per are taken from the standard bill of material (BOM). This represents a huge saving over the traditional method of a) issuing component parts one at a time, usually to a discrete work order, b) receiving the finished parts into inventory, and c) returning any unused components, one at a time, back into inventory.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} methanizer variant that overcomes {{these limitations}} {{and allows for}} the direct injection of all compounds without <b>backflush</b> or heartcuts is a two-step oxidation and subsequent reduction reactor to convert nearly all organic compounds to methane.

In addition to increasing {{the sensitivity of the}} FID to particular compounds, the response factors of all species become equivalent to that of methane, thereby minimizing or eliminating the need for calibration curves and the standards they rely on.

50|$|The {{traditional}} way of issuing consumed materials is by using dual issues and returns against work orders. Components are counted when issued to a production order from Stores when the production order is opened. Produced parts and leftover components are counted when returned to stores when the work order is closed. In conjunction with a tightly controlled material Stores with discrete storage places, this can deliver very high inventory accuracy {{without the need for}} additional transactions to report scrap, material substitution, and non-standard usage separately. This obviously requires more transactions than <b>backflushing.</b> But these can be automated in a variety of ways, especially since most transactions take place in a limited area (Stores) and not throughout the plant. Accountability for component usage and operator time/efficiency at the work-order level by operator/shift/cell is greatly increased in this method over <b>backflushing.</b> Work orders also deliver higher lot-control quality measurement potential, substitution management (through a modified work-order BOM) and higher part and customer container bar-coding accuracy. The shop-floor stock in this case uses a discrete storage bin, identical to the number of the production order but no <b>backflushing</b> is required when the produced parts are counted. Leftover components are returned to the store and all the components from the discrete shop-floor storage bin are issued against that production order (postproduction issuing), in a similar way like backflusing, but not based on the bill of materials (BOM) but on the real stock which was consumed (transferred from the stores) for that particular production order.|$|R

This {{study was conducted with}} high concentration of activated sludge and divided into short-term and long-term experiments. In short term experimental runs, the optimum air <b>backflushing</b> and filtration cycle was investigated. 15 minutes filtration and 15 minutes air <b>backflushing</b> provided the best result in term of flux improvement and stability. Due to the membrane module stability limitation, the applied compressed air pressure of 1 bar was not sufficient to remove the clogging completely. However this cyclic operation provided higher flux stability compared to operation without air diffusion. In long-term experiments, the initial sludge concentration was 13, 000 mg/L. Three different hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 26, 18 and 10. 5 hour which corresponds to the permeate flux of 3. 08, 4. 44 and 7. 62 L/m 2. h were investigated. Here, it was noted that the filtration pressure related to the MLSS concentration. But the stable operation could be obtained at 26 and 18 hours. All experimental runs provided more than 90 % removal of COD, BOD and TKN with final MLSS of 40, 000 mg/L in the reactor.

5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{perpetual}} inventory, backflushing is automatic accounting of material consumed for production, {{at the time of}} confirmation of the production, e.g. when a 4-wheeler automobile is rolled out from assembly line, 4 wheels and tires are deemed to be consumed and issued to production order automatically by way of back flushing by the system. Typically the assembly line has its own limited stock of materials as work in process. This stock is replenished by transferring materials from a warehouse (store) into the assembly lines own designated location, e.g. a supermarket. At goods receipt the consumed materials are posted automatically from the location designated to the issuing production line. In other words, back flushing refers only to materials which are already withdrawn from the inventory of the warehouse (store) and were delivered to the shop floor. Parts are issued from stores to Work-In-Process inventory, but not based on a job order or for a specific production order. They are issued in quantities estimated to cover requirements of individual work centers and production lines. The issuing may be used to cover a period of time or to fill a fixed—size container. But unlike the traditional approach, also known as [...] "preproduction issuing" [...] where the costs are assigned to the product order at the withdrawal of materials from the stores and after completion of production any excess material is given back to the stores, backflushing delays that until the goods receipt of the finished product or assembly is issued. The remaining quantity of unused material left on the shops is still held in the system as floor stock and so material will not be ordered incorrectly through the Manufacturing resource planning (MRP). By eliminating work-in-process accounts, <b>backflush</b> costing simplifies the accounting process. However, this simplification and other deviations from traditional costing systems mean that <b>backflush</b> costing may not always conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Another drawback of this system is the lack of a sequential audit trail. The main advantage of postproduction issuing, not necessarily of backflushing, {{is that there is no}} need to update the store balances of inventory at the withdrawal of the materials from stores and recording the excess material through reverse posting (storno). This is especially useful in series or mass production where it is no need to give back excess material to the stores because it is used for the next production order. Even if excess material is given back to stores it does not involve any update to the inventory balance in the financial accounting (stock accounts). It involves only a stock transfer in the inventory management or warehouse management. Only the materials reported as consumed through the method of backflushing or by the MES imply an update to the inventory balance: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Backflush</b> {{accounting}} {{is inappropriate}} when production process {{is long and}} this has been attributed as a major flaw {{in the design of the}} concept. It may be also be inappropriate if the bill of materials contains not only piece goods but also many parts with more or less variable consumption. If the parts with variable consumption are just a few, like grease or the ink used to print product-labels, the consumed quantities can be assigned to product-independent cost centers at the withdrawal from stores (preproduction issuing) and can eventually be broken down afterwards to specific products or product groups, just like any other indirect or overhead expense. Difficulties maintaining correct inventories on shop floor may also appear if it is usual practice to use alternative materials and/or quantities without needing derogation.Therefore, in case of a more complex production system, it is a better approach to use a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) which gathers real production data and is able to deliver exact data to the accounting software or Enterprise resource planning-system where the goods issue is recorded. Thus, variances in consumption, in comparison to the standard bill of materials, are taken into account and assigned to the correct product, production order and workplace. Another advantage of using a MES is that it implements also the Production Track & Trace and the status of work in progress is also known in real time. A disadvantage of MES is that it is not suitable for small series or prototype production. Such type of production should be segregated from the series production and mass production.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{membrane}} filtration equipment for plate type ceramic membranes was developed based on filtration results achieved with {{different kinds of}} wastewaters. The experiments were mainly made with pulp and board mill wastewaters, but some experiments were also made with a bore well water and a stone cutting mine wastewater. The ceramicmembranes used were alpha-alumina membranes with a pore size of 100 nm. Some ofthe membranes were coated with a gamma-alumina layer to reduce the membrane pore size to 10 nm, {{and some of them}} were modified with different metal oxides in order to change the surface properties of the membranes. The effects of operationparameters, such as cross-flow velocity, filtration pressure and <b>backflushing</b> on filtration performance were studied. The measured parameters were the permeateflux, the quality of the permeate, as well as the fouling tendency of the membrane. A dynamic membrane or a cake layer forming on top of the membrane was observed to decrease the flux and increase separa-tion of certain substances, especially at low cross-flow velocities. When the cross-flow velocities were increased the membrane properties became more important. <b>Backflushing</b> could also be used to decrease the thickness of the cake layer and thus it improved the permeate flux. However, <b>backflushing</b> can lead to a reduction of retentions in cases where the cake layer is improving them. The wastewater quality was important for the thickness of the dynamic membrane and the membrane pore size influenced the permeate flux. In general, the optimization of operation conditions is very important for the successful operation of a membrane filtration system. The filtration equipment with a reasonable range of operational conditions is necessary, especiallywhen different kinds of wastewaters are treated. This should be taken into account already in the development stage of a filtration equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of how pulsatile flow affects flux behaviour in crossflow micro-filtration was investigated. The effects of pulsatile flow were sub-divided into shear effects and <b>backflushing</b> effects. A servo-valve hydraulic piston pump {{was applied to}} generate pulsatile flows in the membrane module with particular waveforms. Four types of fluid pulsation with specific flow-rate and pressure waveforms were produced for experimental tests. Two parameters, /dVcf/ maxand Pmin, were examined independently for their effect during pulsatile flow, which was estimated by comparing the cake resistance during steady flow and pulsatile flow at the same mean crossflow velocity, trans-membrane pressure and membrane resistance. Filtration tests for all the pulsatile flows with clean water confirmed that pulsatility only affects cake depositions. Without particles, no flux improvement was obtained. The results for the microfiltration of 0. 5 g/ 1 silica suspension showed that for pulsatile flows without <b>backflushing</b> (i. e. no negative transmembrane pressure peak), the fluid pulsation decreased cake resistance when the shear related parameter /dVcf/max exceeded a critical value for each given waveform. When the instantaneous transmembrane pressure reached negative values, i. e. back-flushing occurred, the cake resistance was reduced for all pressure waves tested. Cake resistance was reduced more for more negative P min. With two of the waveforms tested, the cake resistance was almost completely eliminated. In contrast, the shear affected cake resistance reduction differently for each waveform. Comparing cake reduction results for different pulsatile waveforms, it was found that, for the square wave, the cake resistance reduction was higher for both shear and <b>backflushing</b> effect tests, while for the short spike waveform, the cake resistance reduction was lower. The flux waveforms were seen to follow the variations in transmembrane pressure. The flux response time was longer than the time required for the pressure changes, but was not dependent on {{the direction of the}} pressure change...|$|R

Main {{focus has been}} on handling of floating debris for small hydropower plant in Norway, as well as sediment handling for run of the river-projects in sediment-carrying rivers. As a new way of cleaning intake screens clogged by debris, the concept of <b>backflushing</b> has been investigated. The intake screen, called trash rack, is then cleaned by a reveresed water flow over a short period of time, and the clogged material flushed out thorugh a flushing pipe. A physical test tank was developed to evaluate parameters for a successful flushing of trash racks with different degrees of clogging. A test device was developed to evaluate adhesion, i. e. the level of friction between clogged material and the trash rack. The required gross water velocity over a trash rack during flushing for detaching of the clogged material was found to be in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 2 m/s, with a typical value of 0. 12 m/s. The clogged material tend to resist a maximum limit of pressure difference over the trash rack before it detaches. Results are showing a pressure difference resistance in the range of 0. 05 - 0. 10 meterWater Column (mWC). The pressure difference prove hard to obtain as parts of the trashrack is cleaned. Hence, a flushing gate should be opened at a high rate to obtain the best flushing efficiency. A field trip to Nepal has been conducted to gain experience in sediment handling, and to work with physical models at HydroLab Pvt Ltd in Kathmandu. Observed intake solutions have been evaluated both against existing theory and results from a physical model study. It has been documented through a model test series that the flushing ability of an undersluice gate is limited to only a few meters upstream of the flushing gate.

Bilge water is a very {{challenging}} wastewater to treat due to large variations in production rates and the complex nature of the wastes in solution. Ever increasing regulations are being imposed on the treatment and release of bilge water to the environment. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a membrane process to remove oil and grease from bilge water to a level where it could be discharged into sensitive environments. This work focused on five elements of study: (1) Evaluation of feasibility and performance of bilge water treatment using a pilot scale microfiltration/ultrafiltration (MF/UF) hybrid membrane system; (2) Development of a pilot scale membrane cascade for selective removal of oil to 0 ppm or a non-detectable level from bilge water while minimizing concentrate production; (3) Establishment of an analytical method to extract and analyze organic species at very low concentration levels for the analysis of oil and grease content found in bilge water and membrane permeate; (4) Investigation of environmentally friendly membrane cleaning methods; and (5) Study of filtration mechanism in the treatment of bilge water using ultrafiltration and microfiltration. Pilot scale membrane cascade systems were designed and tested for the treatment of synthetic bilge water. Experimental results showed that the pretreatment of this oily wastewater using microfiltration, prior to ultrafiltration, is desirable as used oils and particulates can block the feed channels of UF spiral and hollow fiber modules. <b>Backflushing</b> is an effective technique to reduce fouling caused by "sticky" cakes in synthetic bilge water treatment using a microfiltration membrane. Membrane support structure was found to be critical in enhancing flux during <b>backflushing.</b> This work outlined the need for microfiltration membranes offering good particulate clearance to be used in <b>backflushing</b> coalescence applications. A pilot scale membrane hybrid system, consisting of a coalescing <b>backflushed</b> microfiltration membrane used as a pretreatment and an ultrafiltration membrane as a final polishing step, was found to be very effective in this application, producing permeate with oil and grease content well below the allowable discharge limit (15 ppm) for coastal waters. Another membrane cascade system using tubular MF and UF membranes in a first stage and flat sheet UF membranes in a second stage was found to be able to produce water containing below detectable levels of hexane extractable material. Permeates of various molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membranes from the cascade system were collected and analyzed using an extraction procedure followed by gas chromatography (GC). Analytical results showed that solid phase extraction using ENVI- 18 sorbent retained much of the organic matter found in the bilge water and could not preserve the molecular weight distribution in the oil mixture used to prepare synthetic bilge water. n-Hexane liquid-liquid extraction technique was found to be able to preserve the molecular weight distribution of diesel and lubricating oils separated by ultrafiltration. The effect of membrane MWCO in separation of oil and grease was also studied in this work. Environmentally friendly physical membrane cleaning methods, such as <b>backflushing</b> with hot water or steam followed by pressurized air, were found effective in regenerating membrane flux for large pore KOCH carbon membranes in the treatment of synthetic bilge water using a MF/UF hybrid system. The beneficial effects for steam cleaning were found to be evident. Optimal cycle times between physical cleanings were determined. Filtration mechanisms in the treatment of synthetic bilge water were studied using four classical filtration models and a combined model. Experimental results of the research conducted in this study suggested that it is possible to achieve the target of removing oil from bilge water to 0 ppm or non-detectable levels through the proper design of the membrane system, selection of appropriate membranes, determination of optimal operating parameters, and assessment of membrane performance...|$|R

In a pilot plant study for ultrafiltration of surface waters containing high NOM, turbidity and cation loads, the use of flow destabilization, or feed flow reversal (FFR) combined with cross-flow B/F was able to improve the normalised flux by 10. 7 ± 3. 4 %, compared with 3. 2 ± 1. 6 % improvement for BIF without FFR. When a second B/F included FFR, the flux improvement was 7. 0 ± 2. 0 % compared with 4. 3 ± 2. 5 % for a B/F without FFR. The hypothesis was proposed that the flow destabilization caused slight lifting of the oriented cake layer, while the cross-flow B/F was able to sweep the lifted cake out of the lumen. If the flow destabilization may be effected by a simple but effective and low-cost method, and if this flow destabilization may be combined with reverse flow for short durations, the "lift-and-sweep " approach will be the ideal method of maintaining proces...|$|R
