40|$|Core {{breakdown}} of 'Conference' pears (Pyrus communis L.) is characterised by softening and browning of tissue near {{the core and}} {{is associated with the}} development of cavities. The disorder causes large economic losses of 'Conference' pears in Belgium, stored under controlled atmospheres. Factors that influence development of the disorder, CO 2 and O- 2 concentration, the size and weight of the pear, the picking date and the storage temperature: were investigated. Multiple logistic regression was used to establish prediction and classification models for both internal browning and cavity development. Over-mature fruit was more susceptible to core breakdown during storage. It was also found that pears with a large weight had a higher probability of developing <b>brownheart.</b> R- 2 values from 0. 7 to 0. 92 were obtained between the predicted and measured percentages of <b>brownheart</b> and cavities. The models classified up to 86 % of the Fears correctly. In a final analysis, the time sequence of the symptoms occurring during core breakdown disorder development was modelled with a generalized logits model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.
