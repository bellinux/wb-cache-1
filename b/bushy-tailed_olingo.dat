50|$|The {{northern}} olingo (Bassaricyon gabbii), {{also known}} as the <b>bushy-tailed</b> <b>olingo</b> or as simply the olingo (due to it being the most commonly seen of the species), is a tree-dwelling member of the family Procyonidae, which also includes raccoons. It was the first species of olingo to be described, and while it is considered by some authors to be the only genuine olingo species, a recent review of the Bassaricyon genus has shown that there are a total of four olingo species, although two of the former species should now be considered as a part of this species. Its scientific name honors William More Gabb, who collected the first specimen. It is native to Central America.|$|E

The location where the animal was found had features similar to those where the species has been previously documented. We extend the known the species distribution to the western range of the Colombian Andes, both versants of the interandean valley of the Cauca River in Colombia and its elevation distribution up to 2200 m asl. Additional surveys are necessary to evaluate the conservation status of olingo populations into this protected area...|$|E
