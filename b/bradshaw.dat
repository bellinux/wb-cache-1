5|$|In {{the next}} match, the Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham) faced the Acolytes Protection Agency (<b>Bradshaw</b> and Farooq). After both teams {{performed}} {{a number of}} offensive maneuvers on each other, Shaniqua, the Basham Brothers' valet, struck <b>Bradshaw</b> with a club. Doug then covered pinned <b>Bradshaw.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{sporadic}} feuds through midway 2001, the APA {{were awarded}} a WWF Tag Team Championship match against the Dudley Boyz on the July 9, 2001 edition of Raw, where <b>Bradshaw</b> pinned D-Von {{to win the}} WWF Tag Team Championship. The following month on SmackDown!, however, the APA lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to Kanyon and Diamond Dallas Page. After their loss of the Tag Team Championship, Faarooq was briefly absent, while <b>Bradshaw</b> began to pursue singles championships, like on the September 27, 2001 edition of SmackDown!, where <b>Bradshaw</b> lost an WWF Intercontinental Championship match against Christian. On the October 22, 2001 edition of Raw, <b>Bradshaw</b> defeated The Hurricane to win the WWF European Championship. When Faarooq returned, <b>Bradshaw</b> lost the European Championship to Christian on the November 1, 2001 edition of SmackDown!. At No Way Out, the APA won a Tag Team Turmoil match to win a WWF Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania X8. The APA were unsuccessful in winning the Tag Team Championship on two occasions: on the February 28, 2002 edition of SmackDown! and at WrestleMania X8.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 2002, the APA {{were split}} {{up when the}} WWE roster was divided into the Raw and SmackDown! brands. <b>Bradshaw</b> was drafted to Raw, while Faarooq was drafted to SmackDown!. On the Raw brand, <b>Bradshaw</b> won the WWF Hardcore Championship {{eighteen}} times, while Faarooq had a brief stint with the SmackDown! brand, teaming with Reverend D-Von in a tournament to determine the newly created WWE Tag Team Championship.|$|E
25|$|Former British {{politician}} Michael Portillo used {{a copy of}} {{what was}} described as a <b>Bradshaw's</b> guide (the 1863 edition of <b>Bradshaw's</b> Descriptive Railway Hand-Book of Great Britain and Ireland) for Great British Railway Journeys, a BBC Two television series in which he travelled across Britain, visiting recommended points of interest noted in <b>Bradshaw's</b> guide book, and where possible staying in recommended hotels.|$|R
50|$|As the Victorian Railways grew, {{the size}} of <b>Bradshaw’s</b> did not increase. Rather, {{information}} other than that for the railways and postal services was dropped. The other striking characteristic of <b>Bradshaw’s</b> Guide to Victoria over the years was {{that the quality of}} the printing and layout did not improve - it deteriorated. By the late nineteenth century, <b>Bradshaw’s</b> had a poor appearance.|$|R
50|$|ESPNscrum states Harry <b>Bradshaw's</b> date {{of birth}} as being 17 April 1868, and date of death as being 31 December 1910, making him 42 {{at the time of}} his death. Whereas FreeBMD quotes Harry <b>Bradshaw's</b> age at death as being 41.|$|R
5|$|Woolwich Arsenal {{played in}} the Second Division for eleven seasons, and {{generally}} occupied mid-table before the appointment of Harry <b>Bradshaw</b> as manager in 1899; <b>Bradshaw</b> and his star signings, including goalkeeper Jimmy Ashcroft (Arsenal's first England international) and captain Jimmy Jackson, won promotion to the First Division in 1903–04. However, <b>Bradshaw</b> moved on to Fulham in May 1904, before the Gunners had kicked a ball in the top flight. Despite some strong performances in the FA Cup– the club reached the semi-finals in 1905–06 and 1906–07– Arsenal {{were never able to}} challenge for the League title, only twice finishing above tenth place in the First Division between 1904 and 1913.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham and Wotton {{were more}} {{reliable}} than the Aveling and Porter engines. With modern locomotives on the Brill–Quainton Road route (the Kingswood branch generally remained worked by horses, and occasionally by the Aveling and Porter engines), traffic rose. The figure for milk traffic rose from 40,000gallons carried in 1875 to 58,000gallons (260,000l; 70,000USgal) in 1879, and in 1877 the Tramway carried 20,994tons (21,331t) of goods. In early 1877 it appeared on <b>Bradshaw</b> maps and from May 1882 <b>Bradshaw</b> listed the timetable.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the duo {{was split}} during the brand extension, where Simmons went to SmackDown!, as <b>Bradshaw</b> went to Raw. As a singles competitor, <b>Bradshaw</b> had an {{extensive}} hardcore wrestling career, winning the Hardcore Championship on various occasions. The two reunited as a tag team in Ohio Valley Wrestling {{and then on}} SmackDown! in 2003. The team again split in 2004 when Simmons was on-screen released by WWE; Layfield continued his singles career before retiring in 2009.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bradshaw’s</b> Railway and General Guide to Victoria {{was first}} {{published}} in May 1856. It appropriated the name of the famed British <b>Bradshaw’s</b> Railway Guide. It {{was first published}} less than two years after the opening of Victoria's (and Australia's) first railway from Melbourne to Sandridge, but a number of other railways were in the course of construction, and the timetables were included as soon as the particular line opened. Nevertheless, the early editions of <b>Bradshaw's</b> contained numerous coach timetables and other miscellaneous material.|$|R

5|$|On the January 31, 2000 {{edition of}} Raw, the Mean Street Posse asked the Acolytes to protect them, which {{they refused to}} do, until the Posse offered to pay them. When they did, <b>Bradshaw</b> started the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA). In reality, the gimmick of the tag team was created by <b>Bradshaw.</b> To further enhance their gimmick, the APA began to appear weekly {{backstage}} in an office, dubbed the APA Office. After protecting many WWF superstars, the APA began a feud with Bull Buchanan and The Big Bossman. The feud began on the April 10, 2000 edition of Raw, where Buchanan and Bossman attacked the APA during a match, where they protected Kai En Tai. The APA, however, was unsuccessful in winning a tag team match against them at Backlash. On the May 18, 2000 edition of SmackDown!, the APA were hired to protect Crash Holly for an hour, {{to prevent him from}} losing his WWF Hardcore Championship. After the hour was up, the APA left, allowing Gerald Brisco to pin Holly for the Hardcore Championship. The situation resulted in Holly challenging <b>Bradshaw</b> in a Hardcore match, which <b>Bradshaw</b> won. Later that week on SmackDown!, Faarooq defeated Holly in a Hardcore match.|$|E
5|$|The Acolytes Protection Agency (APA) was a {{professional}} wrestling tag team that consisted of <b>Bradshaw</b> (John Layfield) and Faarooq (Ron Simmons). They wrestled for the American promotion World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) between October 1998 and March 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Steelers' first {{selection}} in the inaugural NFL draft was William Shakespeare, a halfback from Notre Dame. The Steelers have selected first overall three times, drafting Bill Dudley in 1942, Gary Glick in 1956 and Terry <b>Bradshaw</b> in 1970. The team has selected second overall once, and third overall four times. Through 2009, seven Steeler first-round picks {{have gone on}} to have playing careers deemed worthy of enshrinement into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Dudley, Len Dawson, Joe Greene, <b>Bradshaw,</b> Franco Harris, Lynn Swann and Rod Woodson. The team's most recent first-round selection was T.J. Watt, a linebacker from the University of Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|The third contest was a tag team match, {{in which}} The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) faced the APA (<b>Bradshaw</b> and Faarooq). At one point, <b>Bradshaw</b> {{performed}} a Clothesline from Hell on Haas. Benjamin then delivered a superkick to <b>Bradshaw</b> and pinned him {{to gain the}} win for his team. After the match, Goldberg was seen arriving at the arena and being escorted to his seat by arena security. In the ring, General Manager Paul Heyman gave a promotional in-ring segment on how SmackDown! was the better program over Raw. Lesnar would {{come down to the}} ring to promote his match and to insult Goldberg. As part of the storyline, Goldberg immediately jumped over the barricade into the ring, where Lesnar performed a spear on Goldberg however he recuperated and delivered a Jackhammer to Lesnar. Goldberg was then escorted out of the arena by security.|$|E
5|$|After {{sporadic}} feuds, the Acolytes won a tag team battle royal at Armageddon against {{seven other}} tag teams {{to win a}} WWF Tag Team Championship match. They were unable to win the championship at Royal Rumble, where the New Age Outlaws defeated them, after Billy Gunn performed a Fame-ass-er on <b>Bradshaw,</b> after interference from X-Pac.|$|E
5|$|Brady is {{the only}} player to have won four Super Bowl MVP awards; Joe Montana has won three and three others—Starr, Terry <b>Bradshaw,</b> and Eli Manning—have won the award twice. Starr and <b>Bradshaw</b> {{are the only ones}} to have won it in {{back-to-back}} years. The MVP has come from the winning team every year except 1971, when Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley won the award despite the Cowboys' loss in Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts. Harvey Martin and Randy White were named co-MVPs of Super Bowl XII, the only time co-MVPs have been chosen. Including the Super Bowl XII co-MVPs, seven Cowboys players have won Super Bowl MVP awards, the most of any NFL team. Quarterbacks have earned the honor 28 times in 51 games. Mark Rypien and Hines Ward are the only players born outside the United States to earn the Super Bowl MVP, having been born in Canada and South Korea, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Harry <b>Bradshaw,</b> {{appointed}} {{in the summer}} of 1899, was faced with several difficulties, not least falling attendances and limited funds to attract the best players. In his five years at Arsenal, he managed to steer the club away from bankruptcy by signing local talent such as Jimmy Ashcroft and Jimmy Jackson, and directed his team's promotion to the First Division in 1903–04. Phil Kelso replaced <b>Bradshaw</b> in the close season and succeeded in keeping the club afloat in the top division. He also steered Arsenal to the semi-final stage of the FA Cup in the 1905–06 and 1906–07 seasons. Kelso departed in February 1908, amid uncertainty over the club's finances, and was replaced by George Morrell, a fellow Scotsman. Morrell's time as manager coincided with Sir Henry Norris' takeover of Arsenal and the club's subsequent relocation to Highbury. Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division in 1913, though the move to North London brought about much larger attendances.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 the new railway {{opened and}} by the end of the year was {{carrying}} freight. <b>Bradshaw</b> immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of traffic carried by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade depression. However Bradshaw's tactics led to a sharp decline in profits. At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the Macclesfield Canal in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands. In November 1831 <b>Bradshaw</b> suffered a stroke, as a result of which he lost the use of his left arm and leg, and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round of the playoffs, the Giants {{defeated}} the Atlanta Falcons 24–2. After giving up an early safety in the first half, Eli Manning threw three consecutive touchdowns. Running backs Ahmad <b>Bradshaw</b> and Brandon Jacobs combined for 172 yards rushing, a season-high for the Giants. With the victory, the Giants advanced to the second round against the top-seeded Green Bay Packers.|$|E

MD7 continues northeast between industrial parks, intersecting Industrial Park Road (unsigned MD7J) before reducing to two lanes and crossing MD43 (White Marsh Boulevard). Westbound MD43 is accessed via a ramp east of the overpass. The state highway crosses Honeygo Run and passes through a mix of forest and residential subdivisions, intersecting Cowenton Avenue and Joppa Road before crossing Gunpowder Falls. MD7 passes through farmland and intersects <b>Bradshaw</b> Road in the hamlet of <b>Bradshaw</b> before crossing Little Gunpowder Falls and entering Harford County.|$|E
5|$|The Acolytes {{then began}} a feud with the Hardy Boyz, which began at King of the Ring where the Hardy Boyz {{defeated}} The Brood {{to become the}} number one contenders to the Acolytes' WWF Tag Team Championship. The feud intensified on the July 3, 1999 edition of Shotgun Saturday Night, where the Acolytes attacked the Hardy Boyz during a segment. On the July 5, 1999 edition of Raw, however, the Acolytes lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to the Hardy Boyz, after Jeff attacked <b>Bradshaw</b> with Michael Hayes's, the Hardy Boyz's manager, cane, and Matt delivered a Tornado DDT on <b>Bradshaw</b> into a pinfall. The Acolytes regained the WWF Tag Team Championship at Fully Loaded in a No Disqualification Handicap match against the Hardy Boyz and Hayes.|$|E
