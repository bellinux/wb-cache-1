5|$|All {{pleas for}} {{financial}} help are in vain, including {{a private school}} play performed in front of Mr. Burns at his mansion, until Jim Hope, {{the president of a}} company named Kid First Industries, buys the school and privatizes it. The school's staff is replaced, and classes now focus on toys and marketing. Lisa soon discovers that the company that bought Springfield Elementary is a toy company, using students for research to make a new popular toy in time for the Christmas shopping season. She is then frightened by the appearance of a robotic figure. When Bart and Lisa are back at home, watching television, they see an advertisement for a toy named Funzo. It has many features suggested by Springfield Elementary students during a <b>brainstorming</b> <b>session</b> at the school. They visit Jim Hope's office to complain, and he apologetically gives them a free Funzo toy. Bart and Lisa later discover that Funzo is programmed to destroy other toys.|$|E
5|$|Toy Storys {{script was}} {{strongly}} influenced by the ideas of screenwriter Robert McKee. The members of Pixar's story team—Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Joe Ranft—were aware {{that most of them}} were beginners at writing for feature films. None of them had any feature story or writing credits to their name besides Ranft, who had taught a story class at CalArts and did some storyboard work prior. Seeking insight, Lasseter and Docter attended a three-day seminar in Los Angeles given by McKee. His principles, grounded in Aristotle's Poetics, dictated that a character emerges most realistically and compellingly from the choices that the protagonist makes in reaction to his problems. Disney also appointed Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon found that the script wasn't working but had a great structure, and added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for Barbie. The story team continued to touch up the script as production was underway. Among the late additions was the encounter between Buzz and the alien squeaky toys at Pizza Planet, which emerged from a <b>brainstorming</b> <b>session</b> with a dozen directors, story artists, and animators from Disney.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the game {{came out of a}} <b>brainstorming</b> <b>session</b> in which it was decided that the game should allow the gamer to play as Kirk and Spock, and {{therefore}} should featuring co-op style game-play. During his E3 pitch, Steve Sinclair described the game's genre as [...] "bro-op". It was created by Digital Extremes, who had previously created video games such as Unreal and BioShock. The Evolution graphics engine was used for Star Trek, having previously been used for Dark Sector and The Darkness II.|$|E
500|$|Seeds of Evil was {{developed}} by Iguana Entertainment with a team roughly {{the same size as}} that of Dinosaur Hunter, which was composed of 18 people. However, as development progressed, more staff was brought on board to assist in completing the game. Development started before Dinosaur Hunter was released and preliminary work on level and enemy design finished by July 1997. The Cerebral Bore weapon was inspired by the Tall Man's weapons from the 1979 film Phantasm. The base idea for the weapon was conceived during a <b>brainstorming</b> <b>session</b> concerning weapon design. The original concept had the weapon [...] "being slow and agonizing". An artist suggested a Leech gun, but it was ultimately rejected by project manager David Dienstbier.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the <b>brainstorming</b> <b>session</b> was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. [...] Hipgnosis had designed {{several of the}} band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion {{when faced with the}} cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. [...] Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band. [...] For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them {{to come up with something}} [...] "smarter, neater – more classy". [...] The prism design was inspired by a photograph that Thorgerson had seen during a <b>brainstorming</b> <b>session</b> with Powell.|$|E
500|$|Solipskier is {{a sports}} video game for Adobe Flash, iOS, and Android {{developed}} {{and published by}} Mikengreg, a two-man independent development team consisting of Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. In Solipskier, the player draws the snowy slope for an on-screen skier to pass through slalom gates and tunnels. The character accelerates with downhill sections and can launch into the air to perform tricks and earn a higher score. The idea came from a <b>brainstorming</b> <b>session</b> about parallax scrolling with speedy action in the foreground and the ability for the player to [...] "paint" [...] the terrain. It was Boxleiter and Wohlwend's first game to receive public appreciation. It was released August 29, 2010 to generally favorable reviews and was a runner-up in the 2011 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival's Best Mobile Game category.|$|E
500|$|After {{six months}} of development, the team felt the game had not made enough progress. They {{examined}} other games and concluded that survival was a necessary component to implement. To achieve this, they devised enemies to present a threat, {{the first of which}} was the [...] "Lander". Jarvis enjoyed violent, action entertainment, and wanted the game to have those elements. However, he felt the action should have a reasonable objective. Inspired by the 1960s television show The Defenders, Jarvis titled the game Defender, reasoning that the title helped justify the violence. He added astronauts to expand on the space theme and give players something to defend while they shot enemies. The element of flying over a planetscape was added after a <b>brainstorming</b> <b>session</b> between Jarvis and Ritchie. The landscape is depicted as a line only a pixel wide, primarily because the hardware was not powerful enough to generate anything more detailed.|$|E

500|$|Their {{first game}} as Mikengreg was Solipskier, where the player's finger draws {{the ground for}} the {{on-screen}} skier to pass through a level filled with gates, tunnels, and walls. It {{was designed as a}} Flash game, which set the limitations for its mechanics. The game concept came from a <b>brainstorming</b> <b>session</b> about parallax scrolling, and was revised in fits of creativity. They paired the parallax scrolling with speed and began to prototype. Boxleiter first understood its potential when publishers fought for the bid to the game. They then decided to develop for iOS in addition to Flash, and to release both versions simultaneously. It was released on August 29, 2010 and became their first game to receive public appreciation. Solipskier for iOS made around $70,000 in its first two months (as compared to $15,000 from the Flash release), which gave them enough stability to branch out into non-Flash platforms.|$|E
500|$|Early in development, the game's {{team was}} {{screened}} {{a rough cut}} of the film. Afterward, they were sent to London by Lucasfilm management for a one-week <b>brainstorming</b> <b>session</b> with Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Adams had worked previously with Infocom, during the development of his book's 1984 video game adaptation. Also present at the meetings were writer Christopher Cerf (a friend of the film's director, Jim Henson) and Brenda Laurel of Activision, the game's publisher. The team worked extensively with Adams during this period. Laurel later wrote, [...] "Every day a fresh blast of his wild and intelligent humor stoked up the creativity of the team." [...] In her view, the pinnacle of the meetings was Adams' idea for the opening sequence. He suggested a reference to The Wizard of Ozs famous transition from black-and-white to color: a transition from a text-based format to a graphical one.|$|E
