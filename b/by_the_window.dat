5|$|The Creeper sneaks out and escapes while Donelly and Gates {{infiltrate}} his hideout {{and discover}} Jimmy's corpse. Donnelly also finds a newspaper clipping {{with a man}} named Hal Moffet {{and two of his}} friends, Clifford Scott (Tom Neal) and Virginia Rogers (Jan Wiley), during their college days. The police visit Clifford and Virginia, who are now married and wealthy. Clifford tells the officers during college, Hal was a handsome college football star who competed with Clifford for Virginia's affections. One day, while helping Hal prepare for a chemistry exam, a jealous Clifford deliberately gave him the wrong answers, resulting in Hal being asked by Professor Cushman to remain after class for extra work. While working on a chemistry experiment, Clifford walks <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> with Virginia to boast. Furious, Hal hurls a beaker to the ground, accidentally causing an explosion that disfigures his face. Donnelly speculates that Hal is the Creeper, and that he killed Professor Cushman and Joan because he holds them partially responsible for his accident.|$|E
25|$|In {{his older}} age Pissarro {{suffered}} from a recurring eye infection that prevented him from working outdoors except in warm weather. As {{a result of this}} disability, he began painting outdoor scenes while sitting <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of hotel rooms. He often chose hotel rooms on upper levels to get a broader view. He moved around northern France and painted from hotels in Rouen, Paris, Le Havre and Dieppe. On his visits to London, he would do the same.|$|E
25|$|The Painted Chamber is {{furnished}} with reproduction oak furniture {{to show what}} it looked like when new (not dark with age and polish). The painted panelling has a larger design than that the Great Parlour and is less decorative. It was discovered under layers of emulsion paint and thought to date from the 17th century. The room is displayed as the mistress's chamber; a small table <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> obtains the maximum light for sewing. The floorboards have been relaid in a 17th-century manner. In 1609, a floor was laid at a cost of five shillings and tenpence for seven days' work, as recorded in the account book. The painted panelling creates a three-dimensional effect imitating the grainy effect of wood. The wild 'squiggles' were intended to imitate walnut, a wood becoming more fashionable in the late-17th century. It was expensive so painting was used to imitate it. The paint had a linseed oil base, and feathers and combs were dragged over it to create the grained effect.|$|E
30|$|We {{have shown}} in Fig.  7 that {{windowing}} for GFDM lowers the out-of-band leakages, as it improves the spectral isolation between users. For the multi-user scenario, it is shown that <b>the</b> performance without <b>windowing</b> is better {{in case of}} low delay error value (as <b>the</b> interference introduced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowing</b> effect is not negligible), but that <b>the</b> performance with <b>windowing</b> is better when the delay error {{does not belong to}} the CP interval. This is due to the trade-off between <b>the</b> self-interference introduced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowing</b> and <b>the</b> isolation gain between users offered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowing.</b>|$|R

Grewal also reported that he witnessed Cho riding his bicycle in circles {{in the parking lot of}} the dormitory.|$|E
500|$|Drayton and Brown {{sat next}} to each other on the bus, Drayton by the aisle and Brown <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> When Officer Lang arrived at their row, he {{identified}} himself as a police investigator and showed his badge. In a voice [...] "just loud enough" [...] to hear, he said he was a police officer [...] "conducting bus interdiction , attempting to deter drugs and illegal weapons being transported on the bus". When Lang asked Drayton and Brown if they had any luggage on the bus, they both pointed to the same green bag on the overhead luggage rack. Lang asked, [...] "o you mind if I check it?", and Brown replied, [...] "o ahead". The officers inspected the bag and discovered no contraband inside.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{international}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Scott Lyon and Sophie Muller and premiered in August 2004. The video features several sequences. It opens with Bedingfield {{sitting at a table}} in her Spanish villa, in Málaga, frustrated by her inability to find inspiration to write a song, and she cuts the flowers off <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> She is then seen walking through the villa in colorful outfits, and sitting by the swimming pool, surrounded by dancing chairs, dancing radios, dancing books in the library, and multiple versions of herself. The video concludes with Bedingfield scribbling in her notebook on the roof of her villa. Her scribblings lead her boyfriend to the front of her home where she admits that she loves him and she goes to the balcony, asking him if her feelings are [...] "okay".|$|E

500|$|The video {{takes place}} in a large cathedral-like room, with large winding {{staircases}} on each side. Throughout the video, the scenery changes several times from a cloudy and sunny day, to a glowing sunset. These time shifts are seen through a large carved window in the cathedral. The video begins with Carey's hair in long golden curls, and her wearing a skin-tight black jumper. She sits on the large ledge <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> staring into the different colors in the sky. As the video progresses, Carey is joined by a small black cat, which accompanies her as she meditates on the large stairwell. After the song's second verse, a large microphone is seen {{in the middle of the}} room, where scenes of Carey singing and standing on the window's ledge interchange. The last scenes show Carey staring out into the meadow, smiling. According to author Chris Nickson, during the scenes of Carey by the large window, it is [...] "obvious" [...] that she is praying to God and connecting to her creator. He felt that alongside the song's lyrics of faith and prayer, the video's moments of meditation truly went [...] "hand in hand." ...|$|E

[...] He asks us to notice the map hanging {{over the edge of the}} table and says that with the help of opera glasses the ancient names of the towns may be read.|$|E
2500|$|Rickey {{was born}} on June 6, 1907 in South Bend, Indiana. At a 1985 {{retrospective}} show, he later recalled that as a very small child, he was fascinated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> latches in his home. These latches, {{which can be found}} in many historic South Bend homes, operate conically at counter-intuitive angles that are oblique to the [...] "apparent" [...] design of the otherwise rectilinear form of the latch. [...] "One expects the latch to open by pulling, but it's a conical crank, you see." [...] This conical, oblique design shows up in many of George Rickey's works, where the axes of motion give unexpected movement to the rectilinear forms of his work.|$|E
