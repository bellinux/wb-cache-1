5|$|Seven {{species of}} fish inhabit Messers Run. These include a highly {{substantial}} population of <b>brook</b> <b>trout.</b> Upstream of the Lofty Reservoir, there are two {{species of fish}} inhabiting the stream: <b>brook</b> <b>trout,</b> eastern blacknose dace. The 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white suckers and pumpkinseeds. Three species of fish inhabit the stream between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. These species are <b>brook</b> <b>trout,</b> brown trout, and blacknose dace. Six species of fish inhabit the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir: <b>brook</b> <b>trout,</b> blacknose dace, tessellated darters, brown trout, white suckers, and sculpins.

5|$|In 1975, a {{study found}} no fish {{species on the}} creek. However, <b>brook</b> <b>trout</b> have been {{observed}} at seven locations on Solomon Creek. <b>Brook</b> <b>trout</b> are especially common on the tributary Sugar Notch Run. Trout reproduce everywhere in the tributary Pine Creek and reproduce in the main stem as far downstream as southern Wilkes-Barre. Above of the South Wilkes-Barre borehole, {{a number of other}} fish species have been observed. These include eastern blacknose dace, bluegill, creek chub, fallfish, minnows, northern hog sucker, and white sucker. However, there are no species of fish downstream of the borehole. Out of 46 sites on the creek, 30 had sufficient macroinvertebrate concentrations to support trout. 2.6 stream miles in the watershed are home to <b>brook</b> <b>trout</b> fisheries. This area is in Hanover Township, Laurel Run, and Bear Creek Township.|$|E
5|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Spring Brook is {{designated as a}} High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its headwaters downstream to the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 476). From that point downstream to its mouth, the {{drainage basin}} of the stream is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in Spring Brook from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. A 2.4-mile (4-kilometer) section of the stream from the Watres Dam downstream to the Nesbitt Reservoir is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for both <b>brook</b> <b>trout</b> and brown trout.

5|$|There are a {{total of}} eight species of wild fish in West Creek. <b>Brook</b> <b>trout</b> and brown trout both inhabit West Creek, {{although}} <b>brook</b> <b>trout</b> are slightly more common than brown trout, with nine <b>brook</b> <b>trout</b> and only seven brown trout being observed in a 2010 or 2011 electrofishing survey. Trout are more common upstream of the Pennsylvania Route 239 crossing of the creek than downstream of it. The most common fish in the creek are sculpin, eastern blacknose dace, and cutlips minnows. In the aforementioned electrofishing survey, {{a total of}} 81 sculpin, 34 black-nosed dace, and 17 cutlips minnows were observed. Other species of fish in the watershed include johnny darter, white sucker, and creek chub.|$|E

40|$|<b>Trout</b> <b>Brook</b> in the Miesville Ravine County Park of Dakota County is {{the trout}} stream {{with the highest}} nitrate {{concentration}} in the karst region of southeastern Minnesota. Water quality data from 1985 and 1995 (Spong, 1995) and from 2001, 2002, 2006 and 2010 by the Dakota County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) (2010) document an increasing level of nitrate in <b>Trout</b> <b>Brook.</b> A karst hydrogeologic investigation was designed to measure nitrate levels at sampling points along the stream and to increase {{our understanding of the}} source and movement of nitrates throughout the length of <b>Trout</b> <b>Brook.</b> Eighteen springs and seeps have been located in the Main Branch and tributaries of <b>Trout</b> <b>Brook.</b> A previously unreported flowing section and stream sieve, Weber Sieve, were found above what had been thought to be the head of perennial flow in the East Branch of <b>Trout</b> <b>Brook.</b> Two new sinkholes developed after the 14 - 15 June 2012 flood in a field northeast of the East Branch of <b>Trout</b> <b>Brook.</b> This investigation included regular monitoring of major anions in the streams and springs, synoptic stream flow measurements, a dye trace of a sinking stream in the <b>Trout</b> <b>Brook</b> drainage, and continuous temperature monitoring at two springs. The initial assumption was {{that the majority of the}} baseflow of <b>Trout</b> <b>Brook</b> was from discrete springs. However, synoptic baseflow and nitrate measurements show that only 30 - 40 percent of the total flow in <b>Trout</b> <b>Brook</b> is from discrete springs, and the rest appears to be from distributed groundwater discharge directly into the stream. Both the discrete springs and the distributed recharge occur along reaches of <b>Trout</b> <b>Brook</b> that drain the significant high transmissivity zone near the bottom of the regionally important Shakopee aquifer. Dye traces have confirmed flow-paths from Weber Sieve to LeDuc and Bridgestone Springs and have begun to define springsheds for these head water springs. The temperatures of two springs were monitored for 7. 5 months. The observed small, seasonal temperature fluctuations at the springs seem to be due to the air temperature while storms that result in flooding and surface runoff cause larger, short-term temperature fluctuations. Nitrate concentrations and chloride/bromide ratios decreased systematically from the upstream springs to the downstream springs. The nitrate concentrations have been increasing at four springs from 1985 to 2012 and at two surface sampling points from 2001 to 2012. The nitrate concentration of another surface sampling point increased from 2001 to 2006 but decreased from 2006 to 2012. Snowmelt and rainfall runoff was sampled on 2 March 2012 and showed no detectable nitrate in the runoff from a watershed with no row-crop agriculture, but elevated nitrate was detected in an adjacent watershed with row-crop agriculture. All of these trends illustrate the dominance of agricultural sources of nitrate in <b>Trout</b> <b>Brook.</b> Legislative Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR...|$|R
