When Aguilera leaves the conversation, a black man {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and causing an argument between them. As she continues to sing, the nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and form their respective sides in the street. They perform their own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> and parodies the penis.|$|E
5|$|In The Girlie Show in 1993, {{the song}} was {{performed}} in an alternate version as the second to last song of the tour. It had a military theme to it. Halfway through the performance Madonna paused the song for a military drill with the dancers and the audience. The performance met with strong reaction in Puerto Rico, when Madonna rubbed the Puerto Rican national flag <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> in between the performance. For the Drowned World Tour in 2001 Madonna wore a fur coat, velvet fedora and a customised Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt which proclaimed 'Mother' {{in the front and}} 'F*cker' in the back painted in silver. This demonstrated her ghetto-girl appearance adopted for the song's performance.|$|E

25|$|Stewart {{was born}} in Syracuse, New York, to Brian and Heather Stewart and has a younger brother named Connor. Breanna began playing {{basketball}} at an early age; in fifth grade, she decided to improve her game. Now six feet four inches tall, {{she had always been}} tall for her age, which often meant coaches wanted her inside as a rebounder. However, her father thought it would help if she had ball handling skills and a perimeter shooting ability. Stewart started a routine of dribbling around her block, wearing headphones. She completed enough loops to cover a mile. She continued the routine almost every day, improving her ball handling to the point she routinely dribbled behind her back or <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs.</b> Even after heading off to college, she still did the routine at home.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} further {{promoted}} on her fourth concert tour, the Girlie Show World Tour, which visited Israel and Turkey, Latin America and Australia {{for the first}} time in 1993. The tour required 1500 costumes for the cast, and a 24-hour set up time for the stage. Madonna opened the show dressed as a dominatrix, surrounded by topless dancers of both sexes. Lighter moments included Madonna descending from the ceiling on a giant disco ball, wearing an Afro wig for [...] "Express Yourself", as well as the singer singing [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] in the guise of actress Marlene Dietrich and singing the word 'virgin' as 'wirgin'. She caused uproar in Puerto Rico by rubbing their national flag <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> on stage. Orthodox Jews protested to force the cancellation of the concert in Tel Aviv, Israel. However, the rallies were unsuccessful as the show went on as scheduled. The Girlie Show received positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{continued}} her provocative imagery in the 1993 erotic thriller, Body of Evidence, a film which contained scenes of sadomasochism and bondage. It was poorly received by critics. She also {{starred in the}} film Dangerous Game, which was released straight to video in North America. The New York Times described the film as [...] "angry and painful, and the pain feels real." [...] In September 1993, Madonna embarked on The Girlie Show World Tour, in which she dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix surrounded by topless dancers. In Puerto Rico she rubbed the island's flag <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit book, album and film, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. Critics and fans reacted negatively, who commented that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{released}} her second studio album [...] in April 2012. The album {{was preceded by}} the promotional singles [...] "Roman in Moscow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Hoe". Critics suggested that the latter song was directed at Lil' Kim, who said: [...] "If {{you have to make}} a song called 'Stupid Hoe,' you must be a stupid hoe." [...] Minaj and rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform their single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", on the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012. She was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, premiering [...] "Roman Holiday" [...] during the 2012 ceremony on February 12. Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with the American Catholic League criticizing Minaj for bringing a fake [...] "Pope" [...] to escort her on the red carpet. The [...] "exorcism" [...] scene that was performed during her appearance was criticized as well. According to the Catholic League president Bill Donohue [...] "Perhaps the most vulgar part was the sexual statement that showed a scantily clad female dancer stretching backwards while an altar boy knelt <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> in prayer. Finally, 'Come All Ye Faithful' was sung while a man posing as a bishop walked on stage; Minaj was shown levitating." ...|$|E
500|$|Upworth (Callie Hernandez) is a medic serving {{aboard the}} Covenant and Ricks' wife. She {{is the first}} crew member to imply a {{collective}} crew-hesitancy over returning to hypersleep after the ship's computer [...] "Mother" [...] locates the Denver song transmission's source. She stays aboard the Covenant with Tennessee and Ricks while the excursion team ventures down {{to the surface of}} the Engineer home world. When Tennessee takes the ship down to within eighty kilometers of the ionic storm, Upworth protests alongside her husband. After Tennessee receives word about the expedition's casualties and insists that the Covenant be brought down within forty kilometers of the ionic storm, putting the ship in jeopardy, Upworth protests again. However, she has a change of heart and cooperates with Tennessee by initiating the command override, allowing the ship to get dangerously close. After the survivors return to the Covenant, Upworth provides a rudimentary treatment for Lope's acid burns, though she admits he will need reconstructive surgery. Upworth and Ricks have sex in the shower, but are interrupted when a stowaway Alien prods Upworth <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> with its tail and kills Ricks, covering her in blood. The Alien kills her in the shower immediately afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|That evening Gabriel {{returned}} from {{his work in the}} gulch more than usually grave. To Olly's inquiries he replied shortly and evasively. It was not, however, Gabriel's custom to remain uncommunicative on even disagreeable topics, and Olly bided her time. It came after their frugal supper was over--which, unlike the morning meal, passed without any fastidious criticism on Gabriel's part--and Olly had drawn a small box, <b>her</b> favourite seat, <b>between</b> <b>her</b> brother's <b>legs,</b> and rested {{the back of her head}} comfortably against his waistcoat. When Gabriel had lighted his pipe at the solitary candle, he gave one or two preliminary puffs, and then, taking his pipe from his mouth, said gently, [...] "Olly, it can't be done." ...|$|R

500|$|When Leigh {{returned}} from the beach, she was bleeding <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> distressed, crying and seeking assistance. Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh {{and find out what}} had happened to her; Leigh [...] "asserted she had been raped", replying [...] " [...] fucked me" [...] and [...] "I hate him". After witnessing Leigh's complaints, Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys [...] "she's a bit of a slut and why don't all of us have a go". Nineteen-year-old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh, placed his arm around her and asked her for sex. Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused, and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh. They yelled abuse, kicked her, poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her. Several people witnessed the assault, yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police, her parents or other adults. The assaults continued for approximately five minutes; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys, missing them. Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left, which either hit her in the leg or missed, according to different witness accounts. The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge, and similar assaults continued. Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10:30pm. Leigh's stepfather arrived at the party to pick her up at 10:50pm. He and several of the party-goers searched for Leigh, but she could not be found. After repeated search attempts, Leigh's mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home, assuming she had gone to a friend's house for the night. Leigh's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning, aided by several youths from the party. Her body was found in the sand dunes about [...] north of the surf club. Leigh's invitation to attend the party was still in her pocket.|$|E

Inside the massive sculpture were a 12-seat cinema theater, a milk bar inside a breast, a fish pond, and a brain built by Tinguely, with moving mechanical parts. In addition, the sprawling Nana contained a coin telephone, a love-seat sofa, a museum of fake paintings, a sandwich vending machine, an art installation by Ultvedt, and a playground slide for children.|$|E

However, in order to be married, the couple must consist {{of a man and a}} woman. Hansel's mother, Hedwig, gives Hansel her name and passport and finds a doctor to perform a sex change.

The pods also explain why the seats on the ship have V-shaped indentations to accommodate the devices.

2500|$|In 1430 King Sigismund {{summoned the}} nobles of the Holy Roman Empire to a Reichstag {{in the city}} of Nuremberg and Oswald with his brother Michael {{immediately}} left Tyrol to meet the King, who instead of going directly to Nuremberg undertook a two-month detour to the South German cities of Überlingen and Constance to celebrate Christmas. During this period, Oswald wrote many songs of an erotic nature- the most famous being [...] "Ain Graserin" [...] (KL 76) about a bathing maid, whose [...] "frizzy hair" [...] <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> leads a man to rape her on the spot. In Nuremberg, Oswald {{became a member of the}} first rank of the Order of the Dragon - a rank King Sigismund awarded only to two dozen nobles. Along with the honor came the obligation to participate in Sigismund's disastrous expedition against the Hussites in Bohemia in 1431 (see also Hussite Wars).

2500|$|In another Verhoeven film—the erotic thriller Basic Instinct (1992)— {{she took}} on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, bisexual, alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required. In the film's most notorious scene, Tramell is being {{questioned}} by the police, and she crosses and uncrosses her legs, exposing her vulva, which is not covered by underwear. According to Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no underwear, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene {{from the beginning of}} production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be: [...] "I knew {{that we were going to}} do this leg-crossing thing and I knew that we were going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it in a room full of strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went into the booth and slapped him and left". Stone claimed in an earlier interview, however, that [...] "it was so fun" [...] watching the film for the first time with strangers. Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, [...] "As much as I love her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> which was a straight lie". Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who later befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir, Hollywood Animal, that the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved.|$|E

[...] This tests the horse's trust in the rider, as the horse must depend on the rider to guide it carefully and steer it to a solid landing. The horse must be taught to jump calmly through the brush, as attempting to jump over the brush could lead to a refusal, a run-out at the next fence, or a misstep and possible injury. Bullfinches must be approached positively, with lots of impulsion, in order to prevent stops.
