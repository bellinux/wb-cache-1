"On the 11th of February, lat. 60° 52' S., long. 80° 20' E., and March 3, lat. 53° 55' S., long. 108° 35' E., the {{sounding}} instrument came up {{filled with a}} very fine cream-coloured paste, which scarcely effervesced with acid, and dried into a very light, impalpable, white powder. This, when examined under the microscope, was found to consist almost entirely of the frustules of Diatoms, some of them wonderfully perfect in {{all the details of}} their ornament, and many of them broken up. The species of Diatoms entering into this deposit have not yet been worked up, but they appear to be referable chiefly to the genera Fragillaria, Coscinodiscus, Choetoceros, Asteromphalus, and Dictyocha, with fragments of the separated rods of a singular silicious organism, with which we were unacquainted, and which made up {{a large proportion of the}} finer matter of this deposit. Mixed with the Diatoms there were a few small Globigerinoe, some of the tests and spicules of Radiolarians, and some sand particles; but these foreign bodies were in too small proportion to affect the formation as consisting practically of Diatoms alone. On the 4th of February, in lat. 52°, 29' S., long., 71° 36" [...] E., a little to the north of the Heard Islands, the tow-net, dragging a few fathoms below the surface, came up nearly filled with a pale yellow gelatinous mass. This was found to consist entirely of Diatoms of the same species as those found at the bottom. By far the most abundant was the little bundle of silicious rods, fastened together loosely at one end, separating from one another at the other end, and the whole bundle loosely twisted into a spindle. The rods are hollow, and contain the characteristic endochrome of the Diatomaceoe. Like the Globigerina ooze, then, which it succeeds to the southward in a band apparently of no great width, the materials of this silicious deposit are derived entirely from the surface and intermediate depths. It is somewhat singular that Diatoms did not appear to be in such large numbers on the surface over the Diatom ooze as they were a little further north. This may perhaps be accounted for by our not having struck their belt of depth with the tow-net; or it is possible that when we found it on the 11th of February the <b>bottom</b> <b>deposit</b> was really shifted a little to the south by the warm current, the excessively fine flocculent débris of the Diatoms taking a certain time to sink. The belt of Diatom ooze is certainly a little further to the southward in long. 83° E., in the path of the reflux of the Agulhas current, than in long. 108° E.|$|E

We may connect the elevated level of Cu and Zn with natural (metals appearing in ground water run-off, ablation from iron ore, the reaction of interstitial water), anthropogenic (sewage disposals from communal households and manufacturing plants, agricultural run-offs), and hydrochemical (pH of water medium, methylation of non-organic metal compounds, metals release from the organic compounds composition, ingress from <b>bottom</b> <b>deposits)</b> factors. The high concentrations of vanadium in water as well as in <b>bottom</b> <b>deposits</b> are most probably induced by the leaching of elements from the regional volcanic rocks. The plumbum content did not exceed the higher-than-normal rates; however, significant element accumulation was detected in <b>bottom</b> <b>deposits</b> outside the city of Uzhgorod which {{may be the result of}} ecotoxicant ingress along with land runoff from the riverside highways laid parallel to the water course. In comparison with background measures, the highest chromium and nickel concentrations were detected near the streamlet Domoradzh and, therefore, it is assumed that the industrial wastewaters serve here as a source of heavy metals. The reservoir in the lowland is above all enriched by arsenic. Areas under agricultural use are significantly concentrated in lowlands. Runoffs from these areas are the main source of the ore supply. However, the impact of municipal domestic waste water which contains arsenic-containing detergents should not be excluded. Moreover, we found a relationship between the relief heterogeneity of the study area and distribution of heavy metals in the hydro-ecosystem.

The method of study involved the mixing of samples of bottom deposits with the overlying water to result in concentrations of suspended matter in the same order as observed in the estuary. Some samples were kept in a quiescent state as a control and the others mixed to concentrations of 30 to 50 mg/ 1 suspended matter. The effect of depth and the non-biological oxygen demand are presented with a discussion of the source of biochemical oxygen demand. Results of this study showed that: 1. Mixing has a pronounced effect on the oxygen uptake rate. 2. The results tend to confirm that the increase in oxygen uptake is due to the release of bio-degradable substances from the bottom. 3. The oxygen uptake of benthic gases appears to be small compared to the total oxygen uptake rate. 4, The depth of deposit has no effect on oxygen uptake between the depths of two and 12 inches. 5. The possibility of a material having a high decay rate coefficient being released from the <b>bottom</b> <b>deposit</b> warrants further investigation. 6.

The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the effect of bottom sediments on the {{selected}} properties of light soil as well as the content of trace elements in tested plants. The bottom sediments collected from the Besko reservoir were added to the soil in an amount of 5 %, 10 %, 30 % and 50 % of air-dried sediment, in relation to dry soil mass. The pot experiment was conducted on a light soil, with weak loamy sand grain size composition and slightly acid reaction, which was enriched with a supplement of bottom sediment. The test plant was a maize, Bora c. v. An applied <b>bottom</b> <b>deposit</b> revealed in its composition a considerable content of clay fractions, alkaline reaction and low total heavy metal content. Therefore, it may be applied as an admixture to light soils to improve their productivity. The addition of sediment to light soil resulted in the improvement of acidification in soil indicators: increased soil pH and reduced value of hydrolytic acidity, as well as improved sorption properties. A non-uniform effect of bottom sediment admixture on the content of trace elements in maize was determined. The sediment added to the soil increased the content of copper, nickel, chromium and, decreased the contents of zinc and cadmium in shoots. We did not find any excess of the permissible content of metals in plants used as animals forage in the maize biomass. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

This project is designed to examine how a change in field collection methods can improve the ability to recognize sedimentation/siltation impairments for wadeable, cobble and gravel dominated streams. The specific purpose of this project is to determine how well EPA's Western Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP-W) will accomplish {{the objectives of the}} New Mexico Environment Department's Surface Water Quality Bureau (SWQB) : to quantify substrate and channel conditions as a potential stressor to aquatic life and to quantify physical channel characteristics in order to provide ecological context for biological response variable data sets.

A <b>bottom</b> <b>deposit</b> formed of fine mud rich in humus {{is found to be}} the ideal {{condition}} for the penaeid prawns. Similarly the lobster is observed in large numbers at localised areas very near the coast in the crevices of rocks. Though it has been observed that prawns and lobsters exist in deep water as well under different conditions, our knowledge about these forms along the Indian coasts is very scanty, being restricted to the works of Spence Bate, Alcock, De Man and Ramadan. Recently, during the cruises of the University Research Vessel Conch off the Kerala Coast (1958 - 1963) two species of deep water prawns and one species of lobster were collected from depths 100 - 180 fathoms. Of these, Penaeopsis philippi is found in large numbers occupying an almost continuous bed extending from Anjengo to Mangalore, while P. rectacutus has a restricted appearance between Cochin and Calicut.

40|$|One of the {{practically}} important {{tasks of}} hydrophysics for sea coastal systems {{is the problem}} of modeling and forecasting bottom sediment transportation. A number of problems connected to ship safety traffic, water medium condition near the coastal line etc. depends on forecasting <b>bottom</b> <b>deposit</b> transportation under natural and technogenic influences. Coastal systems are characterized by a complicated form of coastline - the presence of long, narrow and curvilinear peninsulas and bays. Water currents and waves near the beach are strongly depend on complicated coastal line and in turn, exert on the bottom sediment transportation near the shore. The use of rectangular grids in the construction of discrete models leads to significant errors in both the specification of boundary conditions and in the modeling of hydrophysical processes in the coastal zone. In this paper, we consider the construction of a finite-element approximation of the initial-boundary value problem for the spatially two-dimensional linearized equation of sediment transportation using optimal boundary-adaptive grid. First, the linearization of a spatially two-dimensional nonlinear parabolic equation on the time grid is performed-when the coefficients of the equation that are nonlinearly dependent on the bottom relief function are set on the previous time layer, and the corresponding initial conditions are used on the first time layer. The algorithm for constructing the grid is based on the procedure for minimizing the generalized Dirichlet functional. On the constructed grid, finite element approximation using bilinear basis functions is performed, which completes the construction of a discrete model for the given problem. The using of curvilinear boundary adaptive grids leads to decreasing of total grid number in 5 - 20 times and respectively the total modeling time and/or it allows to improve modeling accuracy...|$|E

This area will be developed for industrial, commercial, and recreational use. The recreational development in the North Portland Peninsula area, including the Rivergate Industrial District, will be primarily water oriented. Development will take place on Smith and Bybee Lakes and Columbia Slough. The water recreation on the lakes could be harmed if an extensive algal "bloom" occurs in the lakes. This occurrence could result from nutrients, primarily phosphorus, in the bottom deposits of Columbia Slough. Samples obtained from the bottom deposits of the slough, along an area where numerous industrial and municipal outfalls exist were analyzed for orthophosphate and total soluble phosphate. Analyses show the concentration of orthophosphate was less in the interstitial water of the bottom deposits than the amount in the overlying water in all but that sample taken near the Associated Meat Packers, Inc. outfall. The total soluble phosphate was greater in the interstitial water than the amount found in the overlying water. When samples of the interstitial and overlying waters were inoculated with Selenastrum capricornutum less growth occurred in the interstitial samples than those samples containing overlying water. This lesser amount occurred only in those samples which were not obtained in the vicinity of any industrial outfalls. For the one sample obtained near the meat packing outfall, the growth of S. capricornutum was greater in the interstitial water. When S. capricornutum was inoculated in overlying water samples, with and without bottom deposits, less chlorophyll was extracted from the sample containing the <b>bottom</b> <b>deposit.</b> It appears the bottom deposits under laboratory conditions inhibit the growth of S. capricornutum.

40|$|International audienceThe geomorphological {{response}} of valley bottoms in eastern France to climatic fluctuations of the Little Ice Age (LIA) was investigated using sedimentological analysis together with {{optically stimulated luminescence}} (OSL) and radiocarbon dating. Diachronic mapping of land use {{since the beginning of}} the nineteenth century was also carried out. Since A. D. 1500, the valley bottoms experienced three cycles of aggradation and subsequent incision, each characterized by paired periods of high and low detritic activity. While the impact of human activity on the aggradation of the alluvial plain is observed, the vertical dynamics of the valley <b>bottom</b> <b>deposits</b> seemingly were also linked to the hydroclimatic fluctuations during the LIA. The sensitivity to these fluctuations was increased by human activity at the scale of the basin. Variations of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and solar activity from the last five centuries correlate with wet and cold phases during which valley bottoms accumulated, and dry and warm phases during which the streams incised into the valley floors. This fluvial sensitivity to the meteorological conditions induced temporal variations in sedimentary supply originating from either direct input from remnants of periglacial alluvial sheets or local rocky outcrops and/or from indirect input from the erosion of alluvial and colluvial deposits. These two components, combined with the sheet runoff over the ploughlands, express the complex coupling between hillslopes and valley bottoms in the headwater catchments. This caused a cascade-shaped transit of the sediments characterized by alternating phases of storage and removal.

This view, which was seen as arguing for a Catastrophic explanation for the geologic development, which ran counter the then prevailing view of uniformitarianism, and Bretz's views were initially decried. Bretz defended his theories, setting off a forty-year debate over the Missoula Floods before Bretz’s view of a catastrophic flood finally prevailed. Waitt extended Bretz's argument, arguing for a sequence of multiple Missoula Floods — 40 or more. Waitt's proposal was based mainly on analysis from glacial lake <b>bottom</b> <b>deposits</b> in Ninemile Creek and the Touchet Formation deposits in Burlingame Canyon. This represented a move away from a single catastrophic flood toward a series of catastrophic floods, but with the flood source still ascribed to Glacial Lake Missoula.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzed the}} degree of sedimentation in Cachoeira Dourada reservoir Brazil, belongingto the Paranaíba hydrologic catchment basin. Were evaluated bottom sediments of the lake, in an areaof 74 km 2. Were considered particle and bathymetric parameters. The results, presented on the maps,showed {{the distribution of the}} particles chacteristics and allowed to estimate the volume of sediments. The <b>bottom</b> <b>deposits</b> are essentially constituted of silt and clay in the portion near the dike; of fine andvery fine sandy material in the middle sector of the reservoir and, {{in the beginning of the}} reservoir, wehave since silt just large sand. By comparison of topographic data, since the construction of the reservoir,with present measured bathymetric data, the Cachoeira Dourada reservoir lost 38. 5 % of its originalstoring capacity. The expected reservoir useful life, estimated in this research, is of about 145 years,following this deposition rhythm...|$|R
