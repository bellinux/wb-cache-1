40|$|Storages of {{succulent}} {{agricultural produce}} are special biological systems. There proceed complex processes through which heat, moisture {{and carbon dioxide}} are released to the environment. They provide favorable conditions for micromycetes to develop. The employed means of microclimate control fa-cilitate the spread of micromycetes in the environment and into the deeper layers of <b>bulk</b> <b>piles.</b> In the paper data on the efficiency of technological protection means suppressing the dispersion and development micromycetes in storages are presented. Automatic control of ventilation systems, painting of storage walls and cleaning were found to reduce air contamination with micromycetes in a storage. Meanwhile, a suitable chemical composition of air {{is very important in}} tight storages, i. e. cold stores. In storages with active ventilation, biologi-cal activity of produce depends on ventilation mode. On the surface of stored vegetables, the development and spreading of micromycetes was most strongly favoured by temperature fluctuations in produce piles, which provoked air condensation processes...|$|R

5000|$|Level sensors {{detect the}} level of liquids and other fluids and {{fluidized}} solids, including slurries, granular materials, and [...] that exhibit an upper free surface. Substances that flow become essentially horizontal in their containers (or other physical boundaries) because of gravity whereas most <b>bulk</b> solids <b>pile</b> at an angle of repose to a peak. The substance to be measured can be inside a container or can be in its natural form (e.g., a river or a lake). The level measurement can be either continuous or point values. Continuous level sensors measure level within a specified range and determine the exact amount of substance in a certain place, while point-level sensors only indicate whether the substance is above or below the sensing point. Generally the latter detect levels that are excessively high or low.|$|R
60|$|The body of George {{the fourteenth}} baron, {{together}} {{with two or}} three others, all of more recent date than the great <b>bulk</b> of coffins <b>piled</b> there, had, for want of room, been placed {{at the end of the}} vault on tressels, and not in niches like the others. These it was necessary to remove, to form behind them the chamber in which they were ultimately to be deposited. Stephen, finding the place and proceedings in keeping with the sombre colours of his mind, waited there still.|$|R
40|$|Designing bulk {{material}} handling equipment requires {{a thorough understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour of powders and grains. Experimental characterization of granular materials is introduced focusing on flowability. A new prototype is presented which performs granular column collapse tests. The device consists of a channel whose design accounts for test inspection using visualization techniques and load measurements. A reservoir is attached where packing state of the granular material can be adjusted before run-off to simulate actual handling conditions by fluidisation and deaeration of the <b>pile.</b> <b>Bulk</b> materials on the market, {{with a wide range of}} particle sizes, can be tested with the prototype and the results used for classification in terms of flowability to improve industrial equipment selection processes...|$|R
40|$|Addition of an oily {{waste to}} a co-composting process of dairy cow manure with food waste, and the {{influence}} in the final product was evaluated. Three static composting piles with different substrates concentrations were assessed. Sawdust was also added to all composting piles to attain 60 %, humidity {{at the beginning of}} the process. In pile 1, the co-substrates were the solid-phase of dairy cow manure, food waste and sawdust as <b>bulking</b> agent. In <b>piles</b> 2 and 3 there was an extra input of oily waste of 7 and 11 % of the total volume, respectively, corresponding to 18 and 28 % in dry weight. The results showed that the co-composting process was feasible even at the highest fat content. Another positive effect due to the oily waste addition was the requirement of extra humidity, due to the hydrophobic properties of this specific waste, which may imply reduced need of a bulking agent. Moreover, this study shows that composting can be a feasible way of adding value to fatty wastes. The three final composts presented very similar and suitable properties for land application...|$|R
40|$|A {{rigorous}} {{laboratory and}} field study {{to measure and}} compare low sulfide waste rock and drainage characteristics at various scales has been designed and implemented. The field study was constructed at the Diavik diamond mine in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Three well-instrumented, 15 m high test piles and three sets of 2 m scale experiments were constructed from run of mine waste rock. Diavik waste rock is comprised of granite and metasedimentary biotite schist country rock. The biotite schist contains the sulfide minerals, principally pyrrhotite. Diavik segregates waste rock based on sulfur content. One test pile contains waste rock with 0. 035 wt. % S, within the operational sulfur target of 0. 08 wt. % S for the higher sulfur waste rock designation. The third pile contains a core of 0. 082 wt. % S waste rock which is within the operational sulfur target of > 0. 08 wt. % S for the higher sulfur waste rock. The third pile has been re-contoured and capped by a 1. 5 m of till and 3 m of lower sulfide waste rock as per the current reclamation plan for the higher sulfide waste rock pile. The test piles were built using standard end-dumping and push-dumping methods. Instrumentation was installed {{at the base of}} each pile and on four angle of repose tip faces, {{as well as in the}} covers of the third pile. Instrumentation was selected to measure matrix flow, pore water and <b>bulk</b> <b>pile</b> geochemistry, gas-phase oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, temperature evolution, microbiological populations, permeability to air, and thermal conductivity, and to resolve mass and flow balances. Instruments were designed to permit measurements at multiple scales. During pile construction samples of the < 50 mm fraction of waste rock were collected. The samples were analysed for sulfur content and particle size distribution. Particle size distributions for the lower and higher sulfur waste rock are similar but the higher sulfur waste rock has a higher proportion of fines. Particle size distributions for both waste rock types suggest the piles have rock-like characteristics rather than soil-like characteristics. Sulfur concentrations vary with the scale of measurement: concentrations of smaller size fractions are higher than larger size fractions. Acid-base accounting using standard methods and site-specific mineralogical information suggest that the waste rock is acid generating. However, when acid-base accounting is compared to effluent pH and alkalinity, the data suggest these calculations may be conservative. Drainage effluent from the higher sulfide test pile was measured for field parameters (pH, Eh, alkalinity) and dissolved cations, anions and nutrients. The geochemical equilibration model MINTEQA 2 was used to interpret potential geochemical controls on solution chemistry. The pH decreases to < 5, concomitant with the minimum alkalinity of < 1 mg L- 1 (as total CaCO 3), suggesting all available alkalinity is consumed by acid-neutralizing reactions. Sulfate concentrations reach 1995 mg L- 1. Calculated saturation indices of Al (oxy) hydroxides and Al hydroxysulfate species, and pH suggest Al oxyhydroxide dissolution is buffering pH at times. Concentrations of Fe (< 0. 37 mg L- 1), Fe (II) and calculated saturation indices of Fe(III) (oxy) hydroxide species suggests that Fe is predominantly Fe(III) and Fe is being controlled by secondary mineral precipitation. The dissolved trace metals Mn (< 19. 2 mg L- 1), Ni (< 10. 4 mg L- 1), Co (< 1. 8 mg L- 1), Zn (< 0. 9 mg L- 1), Cd (< 0. 015 mg L- 1) and Cu (< 0. 05 mg L- 1) show increasing trends in the effluent water. No dissolved trace metals appear to have secondary mineral controls. Elevated SO 4, Al, Fe dissolved metals Ni, Co, Zn, Cd and Cu, and depressed pH values suggest sulfide mineral oxidation is occurring in the test pile containing 0. 053 wt. % S...|$|R
40|$|Salford Archaeology was {{commissioned}} by Laing O’Rourke to undertake an archaeological evaluation on land at Daisy Mill, Stockport Road, Longsight, Manchester (centred on SJ 86242 96198) {{as part of a}} scheme to construct a new school. This report consists of the results from the first nine evaluation trenches. Although further evaluation is required within the yard {{to the rear of the}} mill and within the mill footprint following the demolition of Daisy Mill it was felt an interim report was necessary as Laing O’Rourke wish to progress the <b>bulk</b> excavation and <b>piling</b> work within the park prior to, or alongside, the demolition of the mill. An Archaeological and Heritage Assessment has shown that the study area had begun to be developed by 1848 with a small row of buildings labelled ‘Longsight Terrace’. By 1893 - 4 terraced housing covered most of the study area with larger building at the southeast labelled ‘Carriage and Tramways Depot’. By 1908 a laundry, club and billiard hall were built to the southeast of the Depot. The tramways depot was converted into a factory by 1922 with a mineral water works built immediately to its northwest. This layout then continued until the early 1960 ’s with the terraces and industrial buildings being cleared between 1963 and 1972. The area was subsequently landscaped into a park during the late 20 th century. The trenches within the current study area revealed that substantial remains of the terraced housing survives, at cellar level, across much of the site. Intact wall and floor remains of house ce 1 lars were uncovered within trenches 2, 3, 4, 5 6 and 8. The nature of the remains suggested that the buildings may be of a slightly earlier than generally thought for the large scale development of Longsight. Some very late remains survived from the mineral water works within trench 1 and very late structural remains relating to buildings in the southeast of the study area survived in trench 9. These remains were, in places, at depth due to the nature of the undulating landscaped surface...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{management}} of urban waste streams in developing countries is not optimized yet, {{and in many cases}} these wastes are disposed untreated in open dumps. This fact causes serious environmental and health problems due to the presence of contaminants and pathogens. Frequently, the use of specific low-cost strategies reduces the total amount of wastes. These strategies are mainly associated to the identification, separate collection and composting of specific organic waste streams, such as vegetable and fruit refuses from food markets and urban gardening activities. Concretely, in the Chimborazo Region (Ecuador), more than 80 % of municipal solid waste is dumped into environment {{due to the lack of}} an efficient waste management strategy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a demonstration project at field scale in this region to evaluate the feasibility of implanting the composting technology not only for {{the management}} of the organic waste fluxes from food market and gardening activities to be scaled-up in other developing regions, but also to obtain an end-product with a commercial value as organic fertilizer. Three co-composting mixtures were prepared using market wastes mixed with pruning of trees and ornamental palms as <b>bulking</b> agents. Two <b>piles</b> were created using different proportions of market waste and prunings of trees and ornamental palms: pile 1 (50 : 33 : 17) with a C/N ratio 25; pile 2 : (60 : 30 : 10) with C/N ratio 24 and pile 3 (75 : 0 : 25) with C/N ratio 33), prepared with market waste and prunings of ornamental palm. Throughout the process, the temperature of the mixtures was monitored and organic matter evolution was determined using thermogravimetric and chemical techniques. Additionally, physico-chemical, chemical and agronomic parameters were determined to evaluate compost quality. The results obtained indicated that all the piles showed a suitable development of the composting process, with a significant organic matter decomposition, reached in a shorter period of time in pile 3. At the end of the process, all the composts showed absence of phytotoxicity and suitable agronomic properties for their use as organic fertilizers. This reflects the viability of the proposed alternative to be scaled-up in developing areas, not only to manage and recycle urban waste fluxes, but also to obtain organic fertilizers, including added value in economic terms related to nutrient contents. This work was supported by a PhD scholarship to JJS of the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation SENESCYT of Ecuador and it was also developed in the framework of the project of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness co-funded by the EU through the Social Funds (ref.
