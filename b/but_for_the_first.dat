5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company. The filing came {{less than two weeks}} after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E
5|$|Operation Desert Storm {{began on}} 17 January 1991, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two weeks 3rd Battalion only {{conducted}} sporadic engagements with its Iraqi counterparts across the border. That all changed on 29 January, when several Iraqi divisions unexpectedly {{crossed the border}} and seized the Saudi town of Khafji, less than 15kilometers north of 3rd Battalion's position. During the attack the Executive Officer along with the Battalion Sergeant Major drove into the town on a rescue mission looking for two Army soldiers who had been captured. Although {{they were unable to}} find them, the Marines from 3rd Battalion did encounter an Iraqi patrol and exchanged rounds with them before escaping. While Saudi and Qatari units ultimately retook the town, 3rd Battalion played a vital role in both coordinating the attack and blocking further Iraqi advances southward. In addition, several heavy machine guns and forward air controllers from the battalion were shifted over to the Saudis and took place in the assault. From 19–21 February, 3rd Battalion moved from Al Mish'ab to the forward assembly areas that it would be using to launch its attack into Kuwait. It was also during this period that 3rd Battalion was given its assignment for the ground offensive. Lacking heavy armor or motorized transport, the battalion (along with 2/3) would infiltrate Iraqi positions along the Saudi border and provide flank security {{for the rest of the}} 1st Marine Division to make its assault into Kuwait. On the night of 22 February, 3rd Battalion crossed the border into Kuwait, infiltrating past Iraqi minefields, tank traps, and other obstacles. Like many American units, 3rd Battalion encountered no Iraqi resistance and the biggest threat to the Marines came from friendly fire. Throughout the ground war, the battalion advanced steadily northwards, encountering no resistance but taking plenty of prisoners. 3rd Battalion arrived outside the Kuwait International Airport around 27 February where a SCUD missile landed near the battalion's command post. Several months later, 3rd Battalion returned to Hawaii, having suffered no combat casualties.|$|E
5|$|Rodriguez again won the AL MVP {{award in}} 2007, as his 54 {{home runs and}} 156 RBIs topped the AL; he scored 143 runs, the highest single-season number by a player since 1985. After {{starting}} the year 21–29, the Yankees rallied to win the AL's wild card berth; {{it was the first}} time in 10 seasons that they did not win the AL East. New York's season ended in the first round of the playoffs; the Indians won the opening two games of the ALDS and finished the series in four games. Manager Torre did not re-sign after the season, and Joe Girardi took his place. Rodriguez, who used an opt-out clause in his contract to become a free agent, stayed with the Yankees by signing for $275million over 10 seasons, an MLB record. The 2008 season was the Yankees' last in which they played at the original Yankee Stadium. The club had sought a new stadium to increase revenues, following the example set by other MLB teams. It was also the first in which Hal and Hank Steinbrenner ran the team as general partners; though George Steinbrenner was still the principal owner on paper, he yielded operational responsibilities during the 2007 offseason. Yankee Stadium was the site of the 2008 All-Star Game, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in 14 years did not host playoff action. New York ended the year third in the AL East and failed to qualify for the postseason.|$|E
