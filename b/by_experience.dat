5|$|In the {{conclusion}} of his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified <b>by</b> <b>experience,</b> and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it.|$|E
5|$|The Irish and British {{authorities}} co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol. At {{the start of}} the war, Irish ships joined convoys protected by the Royal Navy. The advantages were protection and cheaper insurance. These advantages were not borne out <b>by</b> <b>experience.</b> So they chose to sail alone.|$|E
5|$|Dioscorides then {{describes}} {{how to tell}} a good from a counterfeit preparation.

But we find, <b>by</b> <b>experience,</b> that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others. They must be {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally driven out of their country. I believe if Detroit was demolished, it would be a good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E
5|$|Prostitutes are {{the lowest}} and meanest, so {{are they the}} basest, vilest, and wickedest of all Creatures. It is a trite Observation, that when a Woman quits her Modesty, she {{discards}} with it every other Virtue. To extend this to every frail Individual of the Sex, is to carry it too far; but if it be confined {{to those who are}} become infamous by public Prostitution, no Maxim, I believe, hath a greater Foundation in Truth, or will be more strongly verified <b>by</b> <b>Experience.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn <b>by</b> <b>experience</b> which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E

5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own {{character}} class, with that class determining a unit's range of movement, weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded <b>by</b> <b>experience</b> points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics. A Support system exists where characters who remain {{next to each other}} for a number of turns talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E
5|$|Roa Bastos' {{life and}} writing were marked <b>by</b> <b>experience</b> with dictatorial {{military}} regimes. In 1947 {{he was forced}} into exile in Argentina, and in 1976 he fled Buenos Aires for France in similar political circumstances. Most of Roa Bastos' work was written in exile, but this did not deter him from fiercely tackling Paraguayan social and historical issues in his work. Writing in a Spanish that was at times heavily augmented by Guaraní words (the major Paraguayan indigenous language), Roa Bastos incorporated Paraguayan myths and symbols into a Baroque style known as magical realism. He is considered a late-comer to the Latin American Boom literary movement. Roa Bastos' canon includes the novels Hijo de hombre (1960; Son of Man) and El fiscal (1993; The Prosecutor), as well as numerous other novels, short stories, poems, and screenplays.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of surface variation {{as a means}} of illusionism--"kenlijkheyt", or perceptibility--was understood by some of Rembrandt's contemporaries. Even so, the dramatic differences between the paint application in the face and passages of the drapery and background are unusual for a late self-portrait. The overall impression is that of a complete work, one that presents the subject as marked <b>by</b> <b>experience</b> yet ultimately resolute in dignity.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle of Stagira, {{the most}} {{important}} disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher {{the title of the}} greatest philosopher of antiquity. But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us <b>by</b> <b>experience.</b> Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of Greek philosophy from other founders during ancient times were Stoicism, Epicureanism, Skepticism and Neoplatonism.|$|E
25|$|Cave diving {{has been}} {{perceived}} {{as one of}} the more deadly sports in the world. This perception may be exaggerated because the majority of divers who have lost their lives in caves have either not undergone specialized training or have had inadequate equipment for the environment. Some cave divers have suggested that cave diving is in fact statistically much safer than recreational diving due to the much larger barriers imposed <b>by</b> <b>experience,</b> training, and equipment cost, but there is no definitive statistical evidence for this claim.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with his father's wishes, Luther enrolled {{in law school}} at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately, believing that law represented uncertainty. Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself <b>by</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E

25|$|Until recently, Hume {{was seen}} as a forerunner of logical positivism; a form of anti-metaphysical empiricism. According to the logical positivists, unless a {{statement}} could be verified <b>by</b> <b>experience,</b> or else was true or false by definition (i.e. either tautological or contradictory), then it was meaningless (this is a summary statement of their verification principle). Hume, on this view, was a proto-positivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate how ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are semantically equivalent to propositions about one's experiences.|$|E
25|$|The book {{argues that}} {{intuitive}} judgment is developed <b>by</b> <b>experience,</b> training, and knowledge. For example, Gladwell claims that prejudice can operate at an intuitive unconscious level, even in individuals whose conscious attitudes are not prejudiced. An example {{is in the}} halo effect, where a person having a salient positive quality {{is thought to be}} superior in other, unrelated respects. Gladwell uses the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo, where four New York policemen shot an innocent man on his doorstep 41 times, as another example of how rapid, intuitive judgment can have disastrous effects.|$|E
25|$|Like the Germans, the Soviets were {{influenced}} <b>by</b> <b>experience</b> showing most combat happens within 400 meters {{and that their}} soldiers were consistently outgunned by heavily armed German troops, especially those armed with the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifles. On July 15, 1943, a Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the People's Commissariat of Arms of the USSR. The Soviets were so impressed with the Sturmgewehr, that they immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber automatic rifle of their own, to replace the badly outdated Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifles and PPSh-41 submachine guns that armed most of the Soviet Army.|$|E
