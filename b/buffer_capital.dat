Using bank-level panel data from Norway, important hypotheses concerning {{the determination of the}} <b>buffer</b> <b>capital</b> is tested. Focus is particularly on the importance of: (i) The buffer as an insurance, i. e. banks hold excess capital to avoid costs related to market discipline and supervisory intervention if approaching or falling below the regulatory minimum capital ratio.

40|$|The paper {{undertakes}} a macroprudential {{analysis of}} the credit risk of Public Sector Banks during the liberalization period. Using the Vector Autoregression methodology, the paper investigates the dynamic impact {{of changes in the}} macroeconomic variables on the default rate, the Financial Stability Indicator of banks by simulating interactions among all the variables included in the model. Feedback effects from the banking sector to the real economy are also estimated. The impact of variations in different Monetary Policy Instruments such as Bank Rate, Repo Rate and Reverse Repo Rate on the asset quality of banks is examined using three alternative baseline models. Impulse Response Functions of the estimated models are augmented by conducting sensitivity and scenario stress testing exercises to assess the banking sector’s vulnerability to credit risk in the face of hypothetically generated adverse macroeconomic shocks. Results indicate the absence of cyclicality and pro-cyclicality of the default rate. Adverse shocks to output gap, Real Effective Exchange Rate appreciation above its trend value, inflation rate and policy-induced monetary tightening significantly affect bank asset quality. Of the three policy rates, Bank Rate affects bank soundness with a lag and is more persistent while the two short-term rates impact default rate instantaneously but is much less persistent. Scenario stress tests reveal default rate of Public Sector Banks could increase on an average from 4 % to 7 % {{depending on the type of}} hypothetical macroeconomic scenario generated. An average <b>buffer</b> <b>capital</b> of 3 % accumulated during the period under consideration could thus be inadequate for nearly twice the amount of Non-Performing Assets generated if macroeconomic conditions worsened. An important policy implication of the paper is that as the Indian economy moves gradually to Full Capital Account Convertibility, the banking sector is likely to come under increased stress in view of the exchange rate volatility with adverse repercussions on interest rates and bank default rates. In this emerging scenario, monetary policy stance thus emerges as an important precondition for banking stability. The study also highlights the inadequacy of existing capital reserves should macroeconomic conditions deteriorate and the urgency to strengthen the <b>buffer</b> <b>capital</b> position. ...|$|E

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} sell {{protection to}} policy holders against {{many types of}} risks: property damage or loss, health and casualties, financial losses, etc. In return for this risk protection, insurance companies receive a premium from the policy holder, {{which is used to}} cover expenses and the expected risk. For longer-term risk protections, part of the premiums are invested to get higher yields. Although the protection buyer mitigates the individual risk to the large and better diversified portfolio of the insurer, {{it does not mean that}} the risk is completely reduced since the insurer may default his obligations. Insurers need to have sufficient equity or <b>buffer</b> <b>capital</b> to meet their obligations in adverse conditions when their losses on the diversified portfolio exceed the expected losses. Ratings provide an assessment of the ability of the insurer to meet its obligations to policy holders and debt holders. In this paper, the relationship between financial ratios and the rating is analyzed for different types of insurance companies using advanced statistical techniques that are able to detect non-linear relationship. The resulting rating model approach is similar to the approach for a low default portfolio, which uses a common set of explanatory variables (such as capitalization, profitability, leverage and size) which is generally applicable for all insurance types, and is complemented with insurance type specific ratios. The resulting model is found to yield a good accuracy, with 75 % of the model ratings differing at most one notch from the external rating. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper employs an {{experimental}} model {{to provide additional}} insight into the effect explicit deposit insurance has on depositor behavior {{in the time of}} a bank crisis. The strength of the conjoint approach used in this study is that it combines the control of a laboratory experiment with the external validity of a field-based survey. Respondent samples are selected from banking markets with and without an established system of deposit insurance. Given an extensive amount of literature in this field, our core hypothesis is that the respondents from the latter market will exhibit more significant monitoring behavior even after allowing for insurance features. We use an empirical model with both demanded interest cost and percentage withdrawal rate as correlated dependent variables. The results first indicate that depositors in this study did not place importance on the varying deposit insurance components in their response to the banking crisis. The primary influence on their behavior is the magnitude of deposits at risk as defined by both the level of the insured limit {{and the size of the}} deposit relative to that limit. While the role of bank fundamentals, as measured by the level of <b>buffer</b> <b>capital,</b> was generally significant, there was no significant difference among the samples. These results raise questions about how explicit deposit insurance does affect the monitoring intensity of depositors given a credible implicit insurance system. Important differences in the subsamples also provide added insight into the motivations associated with variations in depositor monitoring. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis {{was to investigate the}} factors that determine capital structures of financial firms using two separate samples of banks and insurance companies. In the first instance, {{the results of the study}} showed that the financing behaviour of banks mirrors that of non-financial firms. It was also observed bank financing behaviour can be best explained by the pecking order theory. Risk and size variables were observed to be negatively related to the Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio, whereas the dividend variable was positively related. Similarly, risk and size were found to be negatively associated with <b>buffer</b> <b>capital,</b> while dividends were positively related. The 2007 – 2009 global financial crisis (GFC) was found to have negatively affected the financial structures of banks. Consistent with similar studies, it was observed that banks have a target capital structure, and adjust to this target at an adjustment speed of 44 %. With regard to insurance companies, it was observed that the firm-level determinants of capital structure explain insurer leveraging. Unlike banks, the 2007 – 2009 GFC positively affected the capital structure of insurance companies. Similar to banks, results showed that insurers have target capital structures which they seek to achieve in their financing and adjust to such targets at a rate of 21 %, which is lower than that of banks. The study contributes to the body of knowledge in four major ways. Firstly, it adds to the literature on the capital structure of financial firms, which area has not been extensively and conclusively studied. Using a different environment, it validates the ‘standard corporate finance view’ as has been observed in the few studies on financial firms. Secondly, it validates the ‘buffer view’ and ‘regulatory view’ of capital structures of financial firms that have taken prominence since the last GFC. Thirdly, the study recognises that banks and insurance companies are fundamentally different with regard to capital structure and regulation and therefore warranted separate treatment in studies. This is in contrast with recent studies that do not recognise the heterogeneity of the two types of firms. Fourthly, to the researcher’s knowledge this study is the first to examine the impact of business cycles/financial crises on the financing patterns of financial firms. Confirming the fundamental differences between banks and insurance companies, the study observed that financial crises have a negative impact on capital structures of banks (meaning that they deleverage during crises).

40|$|The Basel Accords, {{a set of}} {{recommendations}} for regulating the banking industry, have changed the strategies of financial institutions significantly. These accords allowed banks to use risk assessment {{based on their own}} models to determine the size of the <b>buffer</b> <b>capital</b> they need to hold against unexpected losses. This gave rise to a more model-based focus in the banking industry. With typically a major focus on basic regression techniques such as logistic regression for modelling ``good'' versus ``bad'' customers, growing interest in methods from other areas of statistics and machine learning was a result. One of these areas is survival analysis. Survival analysis deals with the analysis of the duration time until a certain event, such as the time of death in biological organisms. A typical property of survival analysis is the survival function S(t) =P(T>t), which is the probability that the time of the event of interest has not occurred by a stated time t. Defining loan “default” (or, by extension, “early repayment”) as the event of interest, the appropriateness of using survival analysis in the credit risk content becomes apparent. The advantage of using this method here, as opposed to more frequently used classification techniques, is that (1) It is possible to compute a ``probability of default'' or a PD-estimate at every point in time during the loan term. (2) One can predict the expected time of default. Despite {{the fact that there are}} certain analogies between medical survival and survival in a credit loan context, there are also differences that might make the standard survival approach inappropriate for the analysis of credit data. A basic assumption of survival analysis is that each subject will eventually experience the event of interest, but in reality, default will only take place for a small proportion of the population. To model a so-called ``insusceptible'' part of the loan population, mixture cure models can be used. In this thesis, we explain the mixture cure model in more detail in Chapter 1. As there is there is a missing data-issue since there is incomplete information on which part of the population is ``susceptible'' to default (or early repayment) and which part is not, an appropriate version of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) for variable selection is derived and applied to these models. Certain loan applicant characteristics that would affect the time of default or early repayment, might not be observed. In Chapter 2, this problem is addressed by incorporating ``unobserved heterogeneity'' in the mixture cure model. For model fitting purposes, a hierarchical expectation-maximization algorithm is derived. In Chapter 3, we take a step outside the mixture cure framework, and perform a benchmark study comparing several survival techniques (both mixture and non-mixture survival models). These survival analysis techniques are applied to ten different data sets from five Belgian financial institutions, and evaluated using three different types of evaluation metrics: receiver operating characteristics curves, default time prediction and expected future values of the loan. Chapter 4 extends the mixture cure model such that time-dependent covariates can be included. The method is applied to real life credit data including both personal (time-independent) information of the loan applicants and macro-economic factors that change over time, such as the unemployment and interest rates. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to shed some light on why Portuguese banks hold {{significant}} <b>capital</b> <b>buffers</b> above the required regulatory minimum, through the estimation of a dynamic panel data model. The main findings are that the <b>capital</b> <b>buffer</b> is positively influenced by several broad risk measures, suggesting that the introduction of the more sensitive regulation in Basel II might not affect Portuguese banks’ capital ratios as much as one could expect. Provisions and high and stable profitability are found to be substitutes for <b>capital</b> <b>buffers,</b> whereas larger banks seem to hold less excess capital. A negative business cycle effect is also found, and several other hypotheses are tested. ...|$|R

We build an incomplete panel of Spanish institutions from 1986 to 2000 –thus covering a complete business cycle– and estimate an equation for the behaviour of <b>capital</b> <b>buffers</b> that includes an indicator of the business cycle. Our findings are fairly robust and quite unequivocal. After controlling for other potential determinants of the surplus capital we find a robustly significant negative relationship between the business cycle and <b>capital</b> <b>buffers.</b> From a quantitative standpoint, an increase of 1 percentage point in GDP growth might reduce <b>capital</b> <b>buffers</b> by 17 %. This relationship is, moreover, asymmetric, being closer during upturns. Accordingly, there is a case for taking into account the so-called pro-cyclicality problem in the final design of Basel II. Pillar 2 seems to be the right place to address the issue. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} impact of the countercyclical <b>capital</b> <b>buffers</b> held by banks on the supply of credit to firms and their {{subsequent}} performance. Countercyclical ‘dynamic’ provisioning that is unrelated to specific loan losses was introduced in Spain in 2000, and modified in 2005 and 2008. These policy experiments which entailed bank-specific shocks to <b>capital</b> <b>buffers,</b> combined with the financial crisis that shocked banks according to their available pre-crisis buffers, underpin our identification strategy. Our estimates from comprehensive bank-, firm-, loan-, and loan application-level data suggest that countercyclical <b>capital</b> <b>buffers</b> help smooth credit supply cycles and in bad times have positive effects on firm credit availability, assets, employment and survival. Our findings therefore hold important implications for theory and macroprudential policy. ...|$|R
