They had a hundred things to tell each other of what had {{occurred}} in their lives. [...] "Arthur would perceive," [...] Smirke said, [...] "that his--his views on Church matters had developed themselves since their acquaintance." [...] Mrs. Smirke, a most exemplary person, seconded them with all her endeavours. He had built this little church on his mother's demise, who had left him provided with a sufficiency of worldly means. Though in the cloister himself, he had heard of Arthur's reputation. He spoke in the kindest and most saddened tone; he held his eyelids down, and bowed his fair head on one side. Arthur was immensely amused with him; with his airs; with his follies and simplicity; with his <b>blank</b> <b>stock</b> and long hair; with his real goodness, kindness, friendliness of feeling. And his praises of Blanche pleased and surprised our friend not a little, and made him regard her with eyes of particular favour.|$|E
5000|$|Paper roll tickets {{carry the}} Rail Settlement Plan form number RSP 3594: {{the same as}} on post-privatisation SPORTIS tickets, as SPORTIS used the same <b>blank</b> <b>stock.</b> Gatwick Express has {{frequently}} used dedicated stock, RSP 3594/GA, with a red colour scheme and security background (RSP 3594 is orange with a pale green background). Three types of card stock have been used: two versions with the form number RSP 3599, and one (used most often as of 2007) numbered RSP 9299. On {{the first version of}} RSP 3599, each ticket had diagonally cut-off corners, but this later changed to rounded corners as is standard on most other ticket issuing systems. Both of these types had pre-printed headings such as [...] "Class" [...] and [...] "Ticket Type". With the move to [...] "Common Stock" [...] ticketing, where all information is printed by the machine, RSP 9299 stock with no pre-printed headings was introduced. These tickets have always had rounded corners.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of {{corporate}} takeover defences {{on the extent of}} earnings management in the US. Theoretically, it is not obvious whether takeover defences alleviate or exacerbate earnings management. Four well-known corporate takeover defences are examimed: <b>blank</b> check preferred <b>stock,</b> poison pills, classified boards and dual class stock. In spite of their similarity as takeover defences, the empirical evidence indicates that they do not influence the degree of earnings management in the same way. Specifically, <b>blank</b> check preferred <b>stock</b> does not {{have a significant impact on}} earnings management. Poison pills and classified boards are found to reduce earnings management, on average, by 1. 9 % and 1. 5 % respectively. On the contrary, dual class stock exacerbates earnings management by increasing the degree of abnormal accruals by 2. 6 % on average. The results are robust even after controlling for firm size, profitability, financial distress, growth opportunities and information asymmetry. ...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} ways a bureau can move money from the client to the people whom the client must pay. The {{simplest}} way is when a bureau prints checks on <b>blank</b> check <b>stock,</b> printing the client's account number in MICR digits {{at the bottom of}} the check, resulting in the funds being drawn directly from the client when the check is cashed. Other bureaus initiate automated clearing house (ACH) transactions from the client, and remit payment either electronically or in the form of paper checks against the bureau's holding account. Because finance transactions can be enormous (thousands to hundreds of thousands per pay period per client), bureaus often consider the interest earned ("float") on those amounts in the interim to be a substantial source of revenue. The interim is the period of time between when the funds are collected from the employer (client), and either when the paper checks are cashed, or when electronic payments (in the case of taxes) become due on their due dates.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} methods to produce {{animation}} directly on film. One starts with <b>blank</b> film <b>stock,</b> the other one with black (already developed) film.

The frame borders may be observed or completely ignored, found footage may be included, any existing image might be distorted by mechanical or chemical means. A third method takes place in a darkroom, using unexposed film that is exposed frame by frame. The artists places objects onto the fresh stock and then uses a small light beam to create the images. This third category of work has to be sent to a lab and processed, just like films created with a camera.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between CEO pay-adjusted firm performance and firm-specific antitakeover amendments and state antitakeover laws is examined. The {{findings suggest that}} the potential entrenchment resulting from the reduced threat of external control provided by antitakeover provisions may allow the CEO to deliver a lower level of firm performance relative to their compensation. At first glance, the state antitakeover provisions appear to be insignificant in the presence of firm-specific amendments. However, further analysis reveals they can play an important role, in some cases reinforcing the effects of the firm-specific amendments. With respect to the firm-specific amendments, the negative relation is associated with the presence of <b>blank</b> check preferred <b>stock</b> and poison pill amendments.

These machines are characterized by being turnkey solutions for the machining of parts requiring multi-sided machining processes and precision turning operations, starting from <b>blanks</b> or bar <b>stock,</b> for medium or high volume batch sizes. Typical rotary transfer architecture relies on a rotary table turret, where pieces to be machined are placed, rotating from one “station” to another. Each station has a particular process. Transfer machines are designed {{for a wide range of}} applications while production rate is as maximum up to 12. 000 pieces/hour, with complete retooling in less than 1 h. It must be understood that in a typical application, each station can comprise 2 - 3 machining “units” with their own spindle and its translating housing. For standardization purposes, there are a limited number of possible basic designs in machining “units”, subsequently each of them is accessorized to be functional to its target operation. Among them, one of the most prestigious is the hydrostatic unit, in which spindle assembly is contained in a sliding tube supported by a set of hydrostatic bushings. In this paper we will detail the design of a “research & test” bench whose aim is to help in developing new hydrostatic bushing systems and check production units, for quality issues...|$|R

By 1930 it had been decided to remove the last of the regular RGA detachments, and to close all of the batteries except the Examination Battery at Saint David's Head, which the BMA assumed complete responsibility for operating. In 1930, a new voluntary unit, the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers, was raised. responsible for manning the search light detachment at Saint David's Head (and in 1940 it also absorbed the BVRC signals element, providing wireless communications for the garrison).
