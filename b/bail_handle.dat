25|$|A camping, cowboy, or chuckwagon Dutch oven {{has three}} legs, a wire <b>bail</b> <b>handle,</b> and a {{slightly}} concave, rimmed lid so that coals from the cooking fire can be placed on top as well as below.

2500|$|In South Africa, a potjie , {{directly}} translated [...] "pottle {{or little}} pot" [...] from Afrikaans or Dutch, is unlike most other Dutch ovens, {{in that it}} is round bottomed. Traditionally, it is a single cast, cast-iron pot, reinforced with external double or triple circumscribing ribs, a <b>bail</b> <b>handle</b> for suspending the pot, and three short legs for resting the pot. It is similar in appearance to a cauldron. It has a matching handled lid, which is recessed, and convex to allow for hot coals to rest on top, providing additional heat from above. When the vessel is to be stored long term, care must be taken to avoid rust forming by seasoning. [...] "Potjie" [...] can also refer to the technique of cooking potjiekos. Among the recipes which require a potjie, there is one for a type of bread called [...] "potbrood", which literally means [...] "pot bread".|$|E

These handles on drawers were rounded and hinged onto an escutcheon plate and hung down {{in the shape of}} a half moon or arch. Due to being hinged, they were able to move up and down and they were usually elaborately decorated.|$|R

5000|$|A {{drawer pull}} often {{includes}} a plate {{to which the}} handle is fastened. The handle may swing from one or two mounts ("drop handle" [...] or [...] "swing handle"), making a drop drawer pull. A <b>bail</b> <b>handle</b> {{is a kind of}} swing handle consisting of an open loop attached to two mounts. The handle may also be fastened to the plate with rivets, making it immovable. The plate may be ornamented by piercing, embossing, or both. The ornament may also be cut on the surface with tools, leaving it sunken into the metal.

60|$|So saying, Marco {{took up the}} bucket, {{lifted it}} gently over the side, and let it down slowly by the rope into the water. There was a knot {{in the end of}} the rope; and Marco held the knot firmly in his hand, so as to draw up the bucket by means of it, as soon as he should get it full. He found, however, that, {{although}} he could let the pail down easily enough, it was no easy matter to dip up any water into it; for the rope, being fastened to the <b>bail</b> or <b>handle,</b> kept the handle, and of course the open part of the pail, upwards, so that the water could not run in. If Marco let the rope down more, the pail, being light, would not sink, but skipped along upon the surface of the water, drawn by the motion of the steamboat.|$|R
