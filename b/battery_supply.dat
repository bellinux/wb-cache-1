50|$|Localizer, glideslope, {{and other}} {{instrument}} landing aids (such as microwave transmitters) are both high power consumers and mission-critical, and cannot be reliably operated from a <b>battery</b> <b>supply,</b> even for short periods. Hence, when absolute reliability is required (such as when Category 3 operations are in {{force at the}} airport) it is usual to run the system from a diesel generator with automatic switchover to the mains supply should the generator fail. This avoids any interruption to transmission while a generator is brought up to operating speed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>battery</b> <b>supplies</b> {{electrical}} power for starting when the engine has a starting motor system, and supplies {{electrical power}} when {{the engine is}} off. The <b>battery</b> also <b>supplies</b> electrical power during rare run conditions where the alternator cannot maintain more than 13.8 volts (for a common 12V automotive electrical system). As alternator voltage falls below 13.8 volts, the lead-acid storage battery increasingly picks up electrical load. During virtually all running conditions, including normal idle conditions, the alternator supplies primary electrical power.|$|R

50|$|Dickson {{multipliers}} {{are frequently}} found in integrated circuits (ICs) {{where they are}} used to increase a low-voltage <b>battery</b> <b>supply</b> to the voltage needed by the IC.

Consequently, the diodes in the Dickson multiplier are often replaced with MOSFETs wired to behave as diodes.|$|E

The batteries must be charged by an automatic charger, which is also required to be powered from the main and emergency generators.

5000|$|At low speeds the FCHV can run on battery alone, with a {{range of}} about 50 km.

The battery can also charge by regenerative braking, improving overall efficiency. There are currently five generations of the FCHV, beginning with preliminary prototypes FCHV-1 (1997) and FCHV-2 (1999). The FCHV-3 was presented at the [...] "International Symposium on Fuel-Cell Vehicles" [...] in March 2001 in Tokyo, and the FCHV-4 was the first production version, although Toyota did not plan a full-scale commercial hydrogen fuel cell vehicle launch until around 2015.|$|E
50|$|The WM-DD2 was {{introduced}} in 1984, {{and appeared to be}} a WM-DD that was available in same colors and had the addition of Dolby B noise reduction. In marketing terms this is exactly what it was, though technically the change was far from trivial. The innovation that made this change possible was the introduction of miniature Dolby ICs that could run directly from the 3V <b>battery</b> <b>supply</b> without the need for a DC-DC converter (as had had to be employed in the WM-7, for example). Even with these devices the changes made between the WM-DD and the WM-DD2 were far reaching and only possible because the printed circuit board was made with track work on both sides.|$|E

2500|$|MD-Tech {{offers a}} PHEV Kit for hybrid {{vehicles}} {{that acts as}} a hybrid battery re-charger. The kit supplies power to the hybrid battery without modifying the powertrain of the hybrid vehicle.

[...] The kit uses lithium iron phosphate cells in a <b>battery</b> <b>supplying</b> 4kWh of energy. This gives it a range of 30km in charge-depleting, EV mode and provides a boost of power in blended mode. The battery charger uses mains electricity and takes 4–5 hours to charge. [...] The <b>battery</b> <b>supplies</b> power to the DC to DC boost converter which regulates power to the hybrid battery. [...] The converter output can be adjusted to set voltage and current output. A proprietary battery management system uses active battery balancing to monitor the battery state of health.|$|R
