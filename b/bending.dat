5|$|In 2004, a {{pterosaur}} neck vertebra from Brazil with a spinosaurid tooth {{embedded in}} it {{confirmed that the}} latter were not exclusively piscivorous. A 2007 finite element analysis of CT scanned snouts indicated that the biomechanics of Baryonyx were most {{similar to those of}} the gharial and unlike those of the American alligator and more-conventional theropods, supporting a piscivorous diet for spinosaurids. Their secondary palate helped them resist <b>bending</b> and torsion of their tubular snouts. A 2013 beam-theory study compared the biomechanics of CT-scanned spinosaurid snouts with those of extant crocodilians, and found the snouts of Baryonyx and Spinosaurus similar in their resistance to <b>bending</b> and torsion. Baryonyx was found to have relatively high resistance in the snout to dorsoventral <b>bending</b> compared with Spinosaurus and the gharial. The authors concluded (in contrast to the 2007 study) that Baryonyx performed differently than the gharial; spinosaurids were not exclusive piscivores, and their diet was determined by their individual size.|$|E
5|$|Interestingly, {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This may represent a compromise between increasing <b>bending</b> strength and buckling strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved <b>bending</b> strength, but weaker buckling strength. To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} adaptations to improve buckling strength, namely the distinctive internal structures of the bones and the large articular joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E

25|$|The <b>bending</b> curve isn't easily {{described}} by terms. However, some rod & blank manufacturers try to simplify things towards their customers by describing the <b>bending</b> curve by associating {{them with their}} action. The term fast action is used for rods where only the tip is <b>bending,</b> and slow action for rods <b>bending</b> from tip to butt. In practice, this is misleading, as top-quality rods are very often fast-action rods, <b>bending</b> from tip to butt. While the so-called 'fast-action' rods are stiff rods (with absence of any action) which end in a soft or slow tip section. The construction of a progressive <b>bending,</b> fast action rod is more difficult and more expensive to achieve. Common terms to describe the <b>bending</b> curve or properties which influence the <b>bending</b> curve are: progressive taper/loading/curve/bending/..., fast taper, heavy progressive (notes a <b>bending</b> curve close to progressive, tending to become fast-tapered), tip action (also referred to as 'umbrella'-action), broom-action (which refers to the previously mentioned stiff 'fast action'-rods with soft tip). A parabolic action {{is often used to}} note a progressive <b>bending</b> curve, in fact this term comes from a series of splitcane fly rods built by Pezon & Michel in France since the late 1930s, which had a progressive <b>bending</b> curve. Sometimes the term parabolic is more specific used to note the specific type of progressive <b>bending</b> curve as was found in the Parabolic series.|$|E

5000|$|Or, if a smith {{needed to}} put a 90-degree <b>bend</b> in a bar and wanted a sharp corner {{on the outside of}} the <b>bend,</b> they would begin by {{hammering}} an unsupported end to make the curved <b>bend.</b> Then, to [...] "fatten up" [...] the outside radius of the <b>bend,</b> one or both arms of the <b>bend</b> would need to be pushed back to fill the outer radius of the curve. So they would hammer the ends of the stock down into the <b>bend,</b> 'upsetting' it at the point of the <b>bend.</b> They would then dress the <b>bend</b> by drawing the sides of the <b>bend</b> to keep the correct thickness. The hammering would continue—upsetting and then drawing—until the curve had been properly shaped. In the primary operation was the <b>bend,</b> but the drawing and upsetting are done to refine the shape.|$|R

40|$|Associate Editor Peter E. McHugh {{oversaw the}} review of this article. Abstract—The {{purpose of this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of the Reynolds number and the <b>bend</b> sweep angle on the blood flow patterns of S-shaped <b>bends.</b> The numerical simulations of steady flows in S-shaped <b>bends</b> with sweep angles of 45, 90, and 135 are performed at Reynolds numbers of 125, 500, and 960. Hemodynamic characteristics such as secondary flows, vorticity, and axial velocity profiles are analyzed in detail. Flow patterns in S-shaped <b>bends</b> are strongly dependent on both Reynolds number and <b>bend</b> sweep angle, which can be categorized into three groups based on the first <b>bend</b> secondary flow effects on the transverse flow of the second <b>bend.</b> For low Reynolds numbers and any sweep angles, secondary flows in the second <b>bend</b> eliminate the first <b>bend</b> effects in the early sections of the second <b>bend</b> and therefore the axial velocity profile is consistent with the <b>bend</b> curvature, while for high Reynolds numbers depending on the <b>bend</b> sweep angles the secondary vortex pattern of the first <b>bend</b> may persist partially or totally throughout the second <b>bend</b> leading to a four-vortex sec-ondary structure. Moreover, an interesting flow feature observed at the Reynolds number of 960 is that the secondary flow asymmetrical behavior occurred around the second <b>bend</b> exit and along the outflow straight section. This symmetry-breaking phenomenon which has not been reported in the previous studies is shown to be more pronounced in the 90 S-shaped <b>bend</b> as compared to other models considered here. The probability of flow separation as one of the important flow features contributing to the onset and development of arterial wall diseases is also studied. It is observed that the second <b>bend</b> outer wall of gentle <b>bends</b> with sweep angles from 20 to 30 at high enough Reynolds numbers are prone to flow separation.
