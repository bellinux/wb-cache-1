5|$|The {{station was}} reopened by the Great Western Railway in 1926, now called Long Ashton Platform; Ashton by then {{was the name}} of a station on the Teign Valley Line in Devon. Again, the exact date of opening is disputed: most sources state 12 July 1926, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> 20 September the same year. It was located on the same site as the first station.|$|E

500|$|First, various {{circumstances}} {{originating in}} [...] "Necropolis" [...] {{eventually led to}} the resignation of Chief Judge McGruder, whose rule had been marked by an unprecedented concentration of political power in her own hands. Responding to concerns about the way Mega-City One was governed, new chief judge Volt instituted constitutional reforms in 2117 designed to restore a limited measure of democracy to Mega-City politics. The Justice Department still retained supreme overall control, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> over decisions at the municipal level was delegated to a new elected mayor and City Council.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} date claimed {{for the existence}} of the Roper steam velocipede is 1867, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> the Michaux-Perreaux also could have been made in 1867. Motorcycling historians Charles M. Falco and David Burgess-Wise, and Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr date the Roper later, to 1868, and the Owls Head museum's example is of that year. The AMA Hall of Fame and motoring author Mick Walker put Roper's steam velocipede at 1869, in accordance with the date of the machine in the Smithsonian. Cycle Worlds Alan Girdler dates both at 1868, while Mick Walker also declares a tie, but in the year 1869. Classic Bike editor Hugo Wilson says the existence of an 1869 patent for the Michaux-Perreaux gives it [...] "the better claim to 'first'", even though the Roper was built around the same time. Though Sylvester Roper took out a number of patents for firearms, industrial machinery and other inventions, he did not obtain patents for any of his steam cycles or cars.|$|E
500|$|Skrepenak {{was drafted}} in the 1992 NFL Draft with the 32nd overall pick {{in the second round}} by the Los Angeles Raiders. [...] He stayed with the {{franchise}} for four seasons, which included a relocation from Los Angeles to Oakland. During training camp of the 1993 NFL season he was moving into the starting lineup due to an injury to Gerald Perry. [...] However, he was injured during his second preseason start when Charles Haley bull rushed him, which caused him to get tangled up between Jeff Hostetler and the turf and which resulted in a dislocated ankle joint that kept him out for the season. [...] Skrepenak did not become a starter for the Raiders until midway through the 1994 NFL season when he replaced Bruce Wilkerson. [...] He started the final 10 games of 1994 [...] and the first 14 games of the 1995 NFL season before being benched {{toward the end of the}} season in favor of Robert Jenkins. [...] Skrepenak was deactivated from the roster for the final two games of the season right before his contract expired. [...] Officially, the deactivation was due to a combination of a rib injury and the flu, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> it may have also been partially due to vocal play selection criticism. [...] However, head coach Mike White and assistant coach Joe Bugel said the benching was merely a function of the full strength depth chart upon the return of Gerald Perry. Skrepenak was a vocal detractor on the organization after leaving the Raiders. [...] Among the opinions Skrepenak expressed during his time with the Raiders was that the Raiders overemphasized slogans related to team history while setting penalty records as a team.|$|E

But after Narses' death that old man went to Constantinople to Tiberius the Caesar, and told him how he could not die with that secret on his mind; and so Tiberius got all the money, so much that it took many days to carry away, and gave it all to the poor, as was his wont.|$|E

You {{yourself}} are but tiny parts of a great machine, which will grind on in spite of you, though it grind you to powder; {{and there is no}} use in asking the machine to stop. So, they say, prayer is an impertinence. I would that they stopped there. For then we who deny that the world is a machine, or anything like a machine, might argue fairly with them on the common ground of a common belief in God.|$|E

6000|$|In {{proportion}} as {{the cannon}} and other necessaries gradually got in, the Fight flamed up from its embers more and more: and there ensued,--the Russians being now ranked again (fronting eastward now) [...] "in many lines," [...] and very fierce,--a second still deadlier bout; Friedrich furiously diligent on their front and right flank; Finck, from the Alder Waste, battering and charging (uphill, and under difficulties from those Flosses and single Bridges) on their left flank. This too, after long deadly {{efforts on the}} Prussian part, ended again clearly in their favor; their enemies broken a second time, and driven not only out of Kunersdorf and the Kuhgrund, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> almost {{to the foot of}} the Judenberg,--what can only be very partially true. Broken portions of the Russian left flank,--some of Finck's people, in their victorious wrath, may have chased these very far: but it is certain the general Russian mass rallied again a long way short of the Judenberg;--though, the ground being all obliterated by the rabbits and the winds, nobody can now know with exactitude where.|$|E

60|$|Thus did Bhartari Raja {{determine}} {{to abandon}} the world. But before setting out for the forest, he could not refrain from seeing the queen once more, so hot was the flame which Kama had kindled in his heart. He therefore went to the apartments of his women, and having caused Dangalah Rani to be summoned, he asked her {{what had become of}} the fruit which he had given to her. She answered that, according to his command, she had eaten it. Upon which the Regent showed her the apple, and she beholding it stood aghast, unable to make any reply. The Raja gave careful orders for her beheading; he then went out, and having had the fruit washed, ate it. He quitted the throne to be a jogi, or religious mendicant, and without communicating with any one departed into the jungle. There he became such a devotee that death had no power over him, and he is wandering still. <b>But</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> that he was duly absorbed into the essence of the Deity.|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> {{that capital}} {{punishment}} {{is inconsistent with}} the mild religion of Christ--the religion of mercy and love. [...] "The mild religion of Christ!" [...] Do these men know of Whom they talk? Do they know that, if the Bible be true, the God who said, [...] "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed," [...] is the very same Being, the very same God, who was born of the Virgin Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate--the very same Christ who took little children up in His arms and blessed them, the very same Word of God, too, of whom it is written, that out of His mouth goeth a two-edged sword, that He may smite the nations, and He shall rule them with a rod of iron, and He treadeth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God? These are awful words, but, my dear friends, I can only {{ask you if you}} think them too awful to be true? Do you believe the Christian religion? Do you believe the Creeds? Do you believe the Bible? For if you do, then you believe that the Lord Christ, who was born of the Virgin Mary, and crucified under Pontius Pilate, is the Maker, the Master, the Ruler of this world, and of all worlds. By what laws He rules other worlds we know not, save that they are, because they must be--just and merciful laws. But of the laws by which He rules this world we do know, by experience, that His laws are of most terrible and unbending severity, as I have warned you again and again, and shall warn you, {{as long as there is}} a liar or an idler, a drunkard or an adulteress in this parish.|$|E
60|$|And lo!--on Christmas day Roche {{came back}} so drunk that his nurse Mignan {{took him to}} his bedroom and turned the key of the door on him. But you must not do this to a Breton {{fisherman}} full of drink and claustrophobia. It {{was one of those}} errors even Frenchmen may make, to the after sorrow of their victims. One of the female 'Powers,' standing outside, heard a roar, the crash of a foot against the panel of a door, and saw Roche, 'like a great cat' come slithering through the hole. He flung his arm out, brushed the 'Power' back against the wall, cried out fiercely: 'La boîte--je ne veux pas la boîte!' and rushed for the stairs. Here were other female 'Powers'; he dashed them aside and passed down. But in the bureau at the foot was a young Corporal of the 'Legion Etrangère'--a Spaniard who had volunteered for France--great France; he ran out, took Roche gently by the arm, and offered to drink with him. And so they sat, those two, in the little bureau, drinking black coffee, while the young Corporal talked like an angel and Roche like a wild man--about his mother, about his dead brother who had been sitting on his bed, as he said, about 'la boîte,' and the turning of that key. And slowly he became himself--or so they thought--and all went in to supper. Ten minutes later one of the 'Powers,' looking for the twentieth time {{to make sure he was}} eating, saw an empty place: he had slipped out like a shadow and was gone again. A big cavalryman and the Corporal retrieved him that night from a café near the station; they had to use force at times to bring him in. Two days later he was transferred to a town hospital, where discipline would not allow him to get drunk or climb trees. For the 'Powers' had reasoned thus: To climb trees is bad; to get drunk is bad; but to do both puts on us too much responsibility; he must go! They had, in fact, been scared. And so he passed away to a room under the roof of a hospital in the big town miles away--la boîte indeed!--where for liberty he must use a courtyard without trees, and but little tobacco came to his cheek; and there he eats his heart out to this day, perhaps. <b>But</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> he had no heart--only the love of drink, and climbing. Yet, on that last evening, to one who was paying him for a little net, he blurted out: 'Some day I will tell you something--not now--in a year's time. Vous êtes le seul--!' What did he mean by that, if he had no heart to eat?... The night after he had gone, a little black dog strayed up, and among the trees barked and barked at some portent or phantom. 'Ah! the camel! Ah! the pig! I had him on my back all night!' Grandpère Poirot said next morning. That was the very last of Flotsam....|$|E
