25|$|<b>Coral</b> <b>snakes</b> are a {{large group}} of elapid snakes that can be {{subdivided}} into two distinct groups, Old World <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> and New World <b>coral</b> <b>snakes.</b> There are 16 species of Old World <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> in three genera (Calliophis, Hemibungarus and Sinomicrurus), and over 65 recognized species of New World <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> in three genera (Leptomicrurus, Micruroides, and Micrurus). Genetic studies have found that the most basal lineages are Asian, indicating that the group originated in the Old World.|$|R

2500|$|There is {{controversy}} about {{the classification of}} the very similar Texas <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> as a separate species.

In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> are mimics, whereas the false <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> are the model. It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{mnemonic}} rhymes to {{help people}} distinguish between the <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> and its nonvenomous look-alikes in the United States is [...] "Red on black, friend of Jack; Red on yellow, kill a fellow." [...] (Other variations include [...] "Red on yellow kills a fellow. Red on black venom lack." [...] and [...] "Yellow, Red, Stop!", referencing the order of traffic lights.) (For more, see milk snake.) It {{is important to note}} that both mnemonics apply only to <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> native to North America: Micrurus fulvius (Eastern or common <b>coral</b> <b>snake),</b> Micrurus tener (Texas <b>coral</b> <b>snake),</b> and Micruroides euryxanthus (Arizona <b>coral</b> <b>snake),</b> found in the southern and western United States. <b>Coral</b> <b>snakes</b> found in other parts of the world can have distinctly different patterns, have red bands touching black bands, have only pink and blue banding, or have no banding at all.|$|R

5000|$|Texas <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> venom is a {{powerful}} neurotoxin, causing neuromuscular dysfunction. Up until 2006, no deaths from <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> bites have been reported since the 1960s in the United States. The <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> resembles other, nonvenomous snakes {{as a form of}} Batesian mimicry. This resemblance of colors has resulted in the popular saying, [...] "Red on black, venom lack. Red on yellow, deadly fellow." [...] Because of the low profit yields, the production of <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> antivenin has been discontinued for several years. Prior to the availability of antivenin during production, the fatality rate of <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> envenomations is estimated at 10%, and death was primarily due to respiratory or cardiovascular failure as a result of paralysis induced by the neurotoxic venom.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Coral</b> <b>snakes</b> in North America {{are most}} notable for their red, yellow/white, and black colored banding. (However, several nonvenomous species have similar coloration, {{including}} the scarlet snake, genus Cemophora; {{some of the}} kingsnakes and milk snakes, genus Lampropeltis; and the shovelnose snakes, genus Chionactis.) In some regions, {{the order of the}} bands distinguishes between the non-venomous mimics and the venomous <b>coral</b> <b>snakes,</b> giving rise to quite a few mnemonics along the lines of [...] "Red and black, friend of Jack. Red and yellow, kills a fellow." [...] Another helpful mnemonic, is [...] "Yellow, Red, Stop!" [...] referencing the order of traffic lights. [...] In any case, remembering that yellow touches both other colors can indicate a cause for caution. However, this reliably applies only to <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> native to North America: Micrurus fulvius (eastern or common <b>coral</b> <b>snake),</b> Micrurus tener (Texas <b>coral</b> <b>snake),</b> and Micruroides euryxanthus (Arizona <b>coral</b> <b>snake),</b> found in the southern and western United States. <b>Coral</b> <b>snakes</b> found {{in other parts of the}} world can have distinctly different patterns, have red bands touching black bands, have only pink and blue banding, or have no banding at all.|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{documented}} death {{due to a}} <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> (Micrurus species) in the United States (U. S.) in over 40 years. The victim failed to seek medical care following the bite of an eastern <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> (Micrurus fulvius) and succumbed within hours. Post-mortem proof of envenomation was obtained using an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) developed specifically for this investigation. U.

50|$|A <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> (genus Micrurus) is proteroglyphous, {{meaning it}} has a pair of hollow, small, fixed fangs {{in the front of}} its upper jaw, through which the venom is {{injected}} and encouraged via a chewing motion. Due to this method of venom delivery, a <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> must bite and hold on for a brief time to deliver a significant amount of venom, unlike a viper, which can simply strike and introduce a large amount of venom at once. Many bites from <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> do not inject any venom at all, and the small size of <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> makes their ability to bite humans rather limited. However, a bite from any <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> should be considered extremely serious, and medical treatment should be sought immediately. This is because symptoms of envenomation are known to sometimes delay manifestation for as long as 12 hours, but once present, often progress rapidly.|$|R
25|$|<b>Coral</b> <b>snakes</b> are not {{aggressive}} or {{prone to}} biting and account {{for less than}} one percent of the number of snake bites each year in the United States. The life span of <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> in captivity is about 7 years.|$|R
5000|$|C. palarostris is cross-banded with black, yellow (or whitish), and red bands. Consequently, {{it resembles}} the Sonoran <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> (Micruroides euryxanthus). The {{mnemonic}} [...] "red on yellow kill a fellow, red on black, friend of Jack" [...] doesn't {{work with this}} snake. However, unlike the <b>coral</b> <b>snake,</b> which has a black snout, Chionactis palarostris has a yellow snout and is not venomous.
