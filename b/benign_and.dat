5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{a common}} condition characterized by the repeated formation of <b>benign</b> <b>and</b> non-contagious mouth ulcers (aphthae) in otherwise healthy individuals.

5|$|Esophageal strictures {{are usually}} <b>benign</b> <b>and</b> {{typically}} develop after {{a person has}} had reflux for many years. Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to base the creatures on real animals was made early on. To offer players variety, {{a mixture of}} <b>benign</b> <b>and</b> aggressive creatures was deemed necessary. The team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals, because their humanoid form evoked empathy, and credibility in their potential sentience. Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both <b>benign</b> <b>and</b> cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{protected}} by the skull, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier. However, the brain is still susceptible to damage, disease, and infection. Damage {{can be caused by}} trauma, or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke. The brain is susceptible to degenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dementias including Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and clinical depression, are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions. The brain can also be the site of tumours, both <b>benign</b> <b>and</b> malignant; these mostly originate from other sites in the body.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{characteristics}} of transvaginal color Doppler blood flow in patients with ovarian cancer and its evaluation value for malignancy of tumor. Methods: A total of 40 patients with ovarian cancer, 40 patients with <b>benign</b> ovarian tumor <b>and</b> 40 healthy volunteers were selected and enrolled in malignant group, <b>benign</b> group <b>and</b> control group respectively, transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography was conducted, and PI and RI were detected; serum specimens and tumor tissue specimens of malignant group <b>and</b> <b>benign</b> group were collected, and contents of HE 4 and VEGF were detected. Results: Both RI and PI of malignant group were {{lower than those of}} control group <b>and</b> <b>benign</b> group, <b>and</b> the higher the FIGO stage, the lower the RI and PI; MVD as well as HE 4 and VEGF expression levels in tumor tissue of malignant group were higher than those of <b>benign</b> group, <b>and</b> the higher the FIGO stage, the higher the MVD as well as HE 4 and VEGF expression levels in tumor tissue; serum HE 4 and VEGF contents of malignant group were higher than those of <b>benign</b> group, <b>and</b> the higher the FIGO stage, the higher the serum HE 4 and VEGF contents; RI and PI were negatively correlated with MDV, serum HE 4 and VEGF contents as well as HE 4 and VEGF expression levels in tumor tissue.
