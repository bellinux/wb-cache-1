2500|$|One of {{the first}} one handed devices was the {{automatic}} spring release, {{also known as a}} switchblade. An innovation to pocket knives made possible by the thumb-stud is the replaceable blade insert developed in 1999 by Steven Overholt (U.S. Patent no. 6,574,868), originally marketed by TigerSharp Technologies and as of 2007 by Clauss. Some systems are somewhat between assisted opening and the normal thumb stud. CRKT knives designed by Harold [...] "Kit" [...] Carson often incorporate a [...] "Carson Flipper", which is a small protrusion on the rear of the base of the blade such that it protrudes out the obverse side of the handle (when closed). By using an index finger and a very slight snapping of the wrist, the knife opens very quickly, appearing to operate like a spring assisted knife. When opened, the protrusion is between the base of the sharp blade and the user's index finger, preventing any accidental slipping of the hand onto the blade. Some designs feature a second [...] "Flipper" [...] {{on the opposite side of}} the blade, forming a small [...] "hilt guard" [...] such as a fixed <b>blade</b> <b>knife</b> has, which can prevent another blade from sliding up into the hilt in combat.|$|E
2500|$|Police {{encountered}} Freddie Gray on {{the morning}} of April 12, 2015, in the street near Baltimore's Gilmor Homes housing project, an area known to have high levels of home foreclosures, poverty, drug deals and violent crime. According to the charging documents submitted by the Baltimore police, at 8:39a.m Lieutenant Brian W. Rice, Officer Edward Nero, and Officer Garrett E. Miller were patrolling on bicycles and made eye contact with Gray, who proceeded to flee on foot [...] "unprovoked upon noticing police presence". After a brief chase, Gray was apprehended and taken into custody [...] "without the use of force or incident", according to Officer Garret Miller, who wrote he [...] "noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his [...] front right pocket". In the formal statement of charges, Officer Miller stated that Gray [...] "did unlawfully carry, possess, and sell a knife commonly known as a switch <b>blade</b> <b>knife,</b> with an automatic spring or other device for opening and/or closing the blade within the limits of Baltimore City. The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted one hand operated knife." [...] According to the state's attorney for Baltimore City, the spring-assisted knife Gray was carrying was legal under Maryland law, while a police task force said the knife was a violation of the Baltimore code under which Gray was charged.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A <b>knife</b> <b>blade</b> cutting {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} study the effect of clearance between two <b>knife</b> <b>blades</b> on cutting only one layer of a multi-layer thin film. The multi-layer thin films {{are made up of}} three major layers: a 0. 1 mm Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layer, a 25 ~ 50 µm elastic plastic layer, and a 0. 18 mm paper layer. The clearance between two <b>knife</b> <b>blades</b> is controlled by a micro manual stage. The cutting parameters are the clearance of <b>knife</b> <b>blades,</b> the edge of <b>knife</b> <b>blades,</b> and cutting speed. The relationships between layers to be cut and clearance between <b>knife</b> <b>blades</b> are measured using specific <b>knife</b> <b>blades</b> and a constant cut speed. Using the experimental results, several criteria for cutting paper layer are critically assessed. Through assessment of the criteria, the paper layer alone is practicably removed from multi-layer thin film. This experiment successfully provided a method to cut a specific layer but other layers of multi-layer thin film at once...|$|R

5000|$|Serrated <b>blade</b> <b>knives</b> have a wavy, {{scalloped}} or saw-like blade. Serrations {{help when}} cutting {{things that are}} hard {{on the outside and}} soft on the inside (such as bread or tomatoes); the saw-like action breaks the surface more easily than anything except the very sharpest smooth blade. They are also particularly good on fibrous foods such as celery or cabbage. Serrated knives cut much better than plain-edge <b>blade</b> <b>knives</b> when dull, so they do not require frequent sharpening (some serrated blades are claimed never to need sharpening), and are sometimes used to make steak knives which do not need frequent sharpening. However, they are not readily sharpened properly by a user, requiring specialized equipment, and may never be resharpened during their useful life. Serrations are often used to improve the cutting ability of a less-expensive blade not capable of taking and keeping a sharp edge, usually having a thin, polished blade designed to minimise friction. A serrated knife is more practical for a user who is not prepared to sharpen it frequently; a well-maintained and sharpened smooth edge is keener.|$|R
