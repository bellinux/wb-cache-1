Morgan was placed under substantial pressure by media commentary that regarded her as the weak link in the relay team.|$|E
5|$|He opened 2005 with {{a second}} win in the European Clubs' Cross Country Cup.

On the track, he recorded a 5000m personal best of at the Qatar Grand Prix in Doha, and qualified to compete at the World Championships in both the 5000 and 10,000m. At the 2005 World Championships, he broke the national record in the 10,000 m final, but his time of 27:12.82 was only enough for sixth. The 5000 m final held little reprieve for the Eritrean as he finished in second last position. He ended the season on a positive note, however, improving his 10,000m best to 27:04.70 at the Memorial Van Damme, and winning the Great North Run with a world <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 59:05 – which was only his second outing over the half marathon distance.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} from injury, Bolt {{appeared}} a reduced figure {{at the start of}} the 2015 season. He ran only two 100m and three 200m before the major championship. He opened with 10.12 seconds for the 100m and 20.20 for the 200m. He won the 200m in New York and Ostrava, but his season's <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 20.13 seconds ranked him 20th in the world going into the championships. Two 100m runs of 9.87 in July in London showed better form, but in comparison, Justin Gatlin was easily the top ranked sprinter – the American had times of 9.74 and 19.57 seconds, and had already run under 9.8 seconds on four occasions that season. Bolt entered the World Championships to defend his sprint titles but was not the comfortable favourite he had been since 2008.|$|E
5|$|As Patching {{had slipped}} {{earlier in the}} meet, Kerry decided to rub a sticky red {{substance}} onto {{the soles of his}} feet. The Soviet hosts had installed a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E

5|$|In June 1997, {{two months}} before the Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe {{required}} an appendix operation, which caused him to miss two weeks of training. Upon reaching Japan, Thorpe placed fourth in his heat of the 200m freestyle with a new personal <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 1min 51.46s. Thorpe's time was not enough to qualify for the final, but earned him selection in the 4×200m freestyle relay team. Along with teammates Michael Klim, Ian van der Wal and Hackett, Thorpe claimed silver, making him the youngest ever Pan Pacific medalist. In his first individual final at international level, Thorpe was fifth at the 300m mark, but fought back to claim silver in the 400m freestyle behind Hackett in a time of 3min 49.64s. His finishing burst was to become a trademark, and his time would have been enough to win silver at the Atlanta Olympics. In October 1997, a few days before his fifteenth birthday, Thorpe competed in qualifying trials in Brisbane for the 1998 World Aquatics Championships in Perth. Thorpe gained selection for the world championships by finishing fourth and second in the 200m and 400m freestyle respectively. He set new personal bests in both events.|$|E

Ericcson was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> one minute and 22.349 seconds was 1.208 seconds off Cecotto's pace. Ericsson paced Group B early on but was demoted as the session progressed. He was followed by Sergio Canamasas in 12th and Rossi in 13th place. Coletti was another Group B early pace setter but ended up starting from 14th position. Haryanto qualified in 15th but was demoted ten places on the grid for causing an avoidable accident at the previous round {{of the season in}} Catalunya. As a result Nathanaël Berthon inherited the place and was followed by Calado. Richelmi and Daniël de Jong filled the next two placings and 20th place qualifier René Binder was given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Canamasas during the session. Giovesi thus started from Binder's qualifying position with Daniel Abt joining him on the grid's tenth row. Simon Trummer and Jake Rosenzweig clinched the 22nd and 23rd positions. Lancaster started from 24th after spinning his car at Sainte Dévote turn necessitating yellow flags to be waved in the area. The final position in the field was taken by Adrian Quaife-Hobbs whose fastest time was 2.2 seconds slower than Cecotto.|$|E
5|$|Kerry {{found more}} {{success in the}} 100m backstroke, winning his heat in 57.99s to qualify third fastest for the {{semifinal}}s.

His time of 57.94s placed him seventh in the final, ahead of fellow Australian Mark Tonelli, but more than two seconds behind the victorious John Naber of the United States. In the 200m event, Kerry put in a personal <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 2m 3.58s in the first heat to qualify fourth fastest for the final, but swam slower in the decider to finish fifth in a time of 2m 4.07s, one place behind Tonelli and 2.72s away from bronze. Kerry combined with Paul Jarvie, Neil Rogers and Peter Coughlan in the 4100m medley relay, placing sixth. The quartet qualified in sixth place, and Kerry had them in fourth place after posting a time of 57.94s in the first leg, but his teammates were unable {{to keep up with the}} leaders and finished more than four seconds out of medal contention.|$|E
