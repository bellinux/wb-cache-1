Connor is {{directing}} his readers ’ attention to the appearance in the nineteenth century of the mannequin or puppet which today’s public commonly associates with the performance of ventriloquism. “Ask anyone to visualize a ventriloquist and the image forms instantly of a single figure, usually male, in colloquy with a single dummy perched, sometimes on a stand, most typically on the performer’s knee”(402), Connor writes. As public entertainment, ventriloquism has become passé, a quirky stage act that few people today have witnessed first-hand. Yet the <b>binary</b> <b>figure</b> of the ventriloquist and dummy persists in popular consciousness, a vaguely unsettling pair that embodies the phenomenon of a voice cast from a subject who speaks to one who is otherwise perceived as voiceless.

40|$|The most {{important}} classical Greek heroes {{were believed to}} suffer from a physical, mental, and spiritual illness shown negatively to alter their general state of being. Attributed to an excess of black bile in the body, the earliest documented form of this ailment {{came to be known}} as "melancholy;" paramount among its effects was the emergence of a severely split being sincerely pursuing Virtue, yet markedly susceptible to the Passions that threatened to veer him off his course. In the Middle Ages, traces of melancholy are found in the sin of acedia still today considered a rather "medieval" vice. Globally defined as a state of "general apathy," acedia was believed more egregiously to affect solitary religious figures devoted to prayer. The dawn of Humanism in Western Europe, however, saw this notion extended to the more general scholar, and featured as (arguably) its first protagonist, 14 th-century humanist Francesco Petrarca. The manifestations of this malady pervade his oeuvre as a whole: repeatedly in his immense repertoire, Petrarch - at least in his proliferation of an artistic or lyrical "io" or self [...] surfaces as a fragmented if not strictly <b>binary</b> <b>figure</b> both tormented by his incumbent passions and resolutely determined to overcome them. Petrarch's often autobiographical figures are ruled by conflicting inner forces which leave them paralysed, indecisive, and helpless before Fortune, in a new position foreshadowing the anthropocentric and, to a degree, "bipartite" "modernity" soon to flood the continent. Through a close reading of three of his most celebrated texts - the Secretum, De Remediis Utriusque Fortunae, and the Canzoniere, this study will seek to posit Petrarch as a fundamentally melancholic and "accidioso" writer whose condition of internal and social rupture more generally speaks to the emerging "crisis of modernity" which he perhaps first sets to the center stage of his period...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the {{emergence}} of eHealth, the importance of keeping digital personal health statistics is quickly rising in demand. Many current health assessment devices output values to the user without a method of digitally saving the data. This paper presents a method to directly translate the numeric displays of the devices into digital records using machine vision. A wireless-based machine vision system is designed to image the display and a tracking algorithm based on SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) is developed to recognize the numerals from the captured images. First, a local camera captures {{an image of the}} display and transfers it wirelessly to a remote computer, which generates the gray-scale and <b>binary</b> <b>figures</b> of the images for further processing. Next, the computer applies the watershed segmentation algorithm to divide the image into regions of individual values. Finally, the SIFT features of the segmented images are picked up in sequence and matched with the SIFT features of the ten standard digits from 0 to 9 one by one to recognize the digital numbers of the device’s display. The proposed approach can obtain the data directly from the display quickly and accurately with high environmental tolerance. The numeric recognition converts with over 99. 2 % accuracy, and processes an image in less than one second. The proposed method has been applied in the E-health Station, a physiological parameters measuring system that integrates a variety of commercial instruments, such as OMRON digital thermometer, oximeter, sphygmomanometer, glucometer, and fat monitor, to give a more complete physiological health measurement...|$|R

40|$|The intense {{interest}} surrounding asymmetrical microparticles originates from their unique anisotropic properties and promising applications. In this work, direct self-assembly of polymeric microspherical caps without {{the assistance of}} any additives has been achieved by using low-surface-tension methanol (MeOH) and high-surface-tension water as <b>binary</b> breath <b>figures</b> (BFs). With the evaporation of polystyrene (PS) solution containing low-boiling-point solvent in the binary vapors, the formed MeOH BFs could quickly diffuse into solution, while water BFs tended to remain at the solution surface. This {{led to the formation}} of a gradient nonsolvent layer at the vapor/solution interface, which induced the formation of nuclei and guided further asymmetrical growth of polymer particles. After the spontaneous removal of MeOH, water and residual solvent by evaporation, polymeric microspherical caps were left on the substrate. Through controlling the proportion of water introduced by adjusting the ratios of MeOH and water, polymeric microspherical caps with a range of controllable shapes (divided at different positions of a sphere) were successfully obtained. The formation mechanism was explained based on the difference of vapor pressure, surface tension and miscibility between the employed solvents and nonsolvents. A solvent possessing a high vapor pressure, low surface tension and good miscibility with MeOH contributed to the formation of microspherical caps.

Switches S 1 to SN represent the binary bits and connect either to ground or a reference voltage. Figure 1 shows switch S 1 connecting R to the reference voltage and all other switches connected to ground; but since point A is a virtual ground, there is no current through 2 R, 4 R, up to 2 N- 1 R.

30|$|The key {{observation}} in all experiments at 900  °C is {{the occurrence of}} two carbonate solids, aragonite, and dolomite in forward experiment SPT 5, and aragonite and (Mg,Fe)-calcite in sandwich experiment SPT 8, coexisting with the hydrous carbonatitic liquid. In this temperature region, phase relationships in the ternary region dolomite-ankerite-aragonite are complex. The solvus of carbonates with R- 3 C structure resembles that of feldspar, i.e., with large immiscibility field along {{only one of the}} three binaries, namely CaCO 3 -CaMg(CO 3) 2; such immiscibility coupled to the stability of aragonite over pure calcite at high pressure leads to the possible occurrence of three carbonates at 870  °C (Fig.  8 b) and high XMg, i.e., aragonite + Mg-calcite + dolomite. The composition of the hydrous carbonatitic liquids obtained at 900  °C, both for forward and sandwich geometries, projects in the upper portion of this compositional space, close to the Mg-calcite composition expected to be in equilibrium with aragonite and dolomite (compare Fig.  8 c and 8 b). Again, the phase diagram recalls that of ternary feldspar. As long as two carbonates coexist with the melt, the liquidus surface has to form a univariant line descending toward Fe-rich compositions. However, when the solidus assemblage in equilibrium with the liquid line of descent leaves the solvus, this univariant reaction degenerates to a minimum valley in the liquidus surface (schematically when the line becomes dashed in Fig.  8 c), as in feldspars close to the albite-K-feldspar <b>binary</b> (see <b>Figure</b> 10.28 in Philpotts and Ague, 2009).

Heaps are also crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm.In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. A heap is not a sorted structure and can be regarded as partially ordered. As visible from the heap-diagram, there is no particular relationship among nodes on any given level, even among the siblings. When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has a smallest possible height—a heap with N nodes always has log N height.

As it can be expected, sufficient improvement of local visual quality takes place mainly in homogeneous image regions.|$|R

40|$|This work investigates Bondi {{accretion}} to {{a rotating}} magnetized {{star in the}} "propeller" regime using axisymmetric resistive, magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In this regime accreting matter tends to be expelled from the equatorial region of the magnetosphere where the centrifugal force on matter rotating with the star exceeds the gravitational force. The regime is predicted to occur if the magnetospheric radius larger than the corotation radius and less than the light cylinder radius. The simulations show that accreting matters is expelled from the equatorial region of the magnetosphere and that it {{moves away from the}} star in a supersonic, disk-shaped outflow. At larger radial distances the outflow slows down and becomes subsonic. The equatorial matter outflow is initially driven by the centrifugal force, but at larger distances the pressure gradient becomes significant. We find that the star is spun-down mainly by the magnetic torques at its surface with the rate of loss of angular momentum L̇ proportional to -Ω_*^ 1. 3 μ^ 0. 8, where Ω_* is the star's rotation rate and μ is its magnetic moment. Further, we find that L̇ is approximately independent of the magnetic diffusivity of the plasma η_m.

Our orbital solution support eccentricities e~ 0. 4 and 0. 83 +- 0. 08 for MWC 656 and MWC 148, respectively.

40|$|Authors: Massmiliano Cavallini, Denis Gentili, Pierpaolo Greco, Francesco Valle & Fabio Biscarini ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{provides the}} instructions for designing and fabricating stamping tools with features ranging from nanometer to micrometer scale, including the fabrication using commercial tools such as compact disks or digital video disks. In particular the reported procedures are oriented towards the tools fabrication for lithographically controlled wetting and soft lithography. Because the versatility of these methods that has almost no restrictions concerning the materials used for the stamps, {{a wide range of}} methods are provided in this protocol including photolithography, electron beam lithography, replica molding, laser engraving and nanoimprinting. ### Introduction **GENERAL INFORMATION** **PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY** Presently the most common method to fabricate rigid stamps (usually in silicon) and masters required for replica molding of the soft stamps is photolithography (see the protocol in ref. (1)). This process, widely used for microfabrication, is based on the selective removing of parts of a film upon the exposition to light (usually UV). This is achieved thanks to some materials known as photoresists, that are light-sensitive, meaning that, according to their composition, they become soluble or insoluble to their developing solution upon illumination. The first family is called positive photoresist and the second negative. The light is sent through a photomask that shadows the parts of the film that, according to the kind of resist used, must be removed or preserved. Different kind of masks can be used but their common feature is the ability to shadow as much as possible some parts of the photoresist below (contrasting power), the most used are transparent foils with pattern drawn by an ink non-transparent to UV-light or highly reflecting foils (usually metallic) where some portion have been removed by laser engraving. The current limits of photolithography is approximately 250 nm and the minimum feature size is 100 nm (2). These values are important on the one hand to define the ranges of fabrication of soft stamps for LCW {{but on the other hand}} for the forthcoming comparison with the feature sizes and resolution that LCW can achieve. The masks are usually drawn using CAD software and then transferred either by common printers on transparent foils, where the marks will represent the shadowed areas, or by laser engraving of highly reflective metallic sheets where the removed part will corresponding to the illuminated path. The photoresist film, upon illumination is then developed in the appropriate solution leaving on the surface only the features that will be used as master for replica molding or directly as stamp. **ELECTRON BEAM LITHOGRAPHY** When the resolution limits required by the process are below those of photolithography (diffraction limit), electron beam lithography (EBL) is usually chosen for fabricating the masters. This technique is in fact able to achieve resolution of 20 - 30 nm in lateral size (see the protocol in ref. (1)), because it make use of an electron beam to locally alter the chemical properties of a material (resist) that will be then removed in a development step. Beside the illustrated resolution advantage one must remind that EBL is an expensive technology and it is a serial technique, thus it is much slower than photolithography. **REPLICA MOLDING** Replica molding (RM) is the most common way of fabricating the elastomeric stamp for soft lithography and LCW and it is one of the most important tools for these techniques. RM is based on the reticulation of the elastomeric precursors onto the master that is then removed, upon curing, by peeling it off. It is worth mentioning that the LCW is not limited to the elastomeric materials as other soft-lithographic methods and it makes wide use of rigid and metallic materials as it is shown other sections of this protocol. Nevertheless replica molding of the elastomeric materials still plays a crucial role because, making use of well known materials such as Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), it allows tuning the surface properties of the stamp by liquid or plasma chemical treatments. Elastomeric stamps made of PDMS are deformed easily under the effect of capillary adhesion. The attractive force, exerted by the solution trapped between the substrate and the stamp, may involve sagging of the PDMS stamp and poor patterning in the region where the PDMS displaced the solution. The capillary force may be estimated according to De Gennes,(3) and needs to be considered during the design of the spacer and the dimensioning of the full PDMS replica. In this case, an effective parameter is the aspect ratio AR, defined as the ratio of width over thickness of the window delimited by the spacer. If we put PDMS Young modulus E ≈ 460 kPa, contact angle of solution θ = π/ 6, and surface tension γ = 0. 02 N/m (organic solvents), we derived the critical value for AR that will induce sagging for various distances between the substrate and the PDMS replica, by finite element calculation (Figure 1). The empirical relationship can be summarized with a linear abacus for fast design, providing that the overall dimension of the stamp is exceeding the window defined by the spacer. **NANOIMPRINT LITHOGRAPHY** Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is another important technique useful to fabricate tools (i. e. master for RM and stamps) for LCW. NIL consists of a physical (morphological) deformation of a thermoplastic material in a temperature and pressure controlled printing process. A silicon stamp fabricated by a conventional lithography such as EBL or photolithography is usually employed. In NIL the thermoplastic material (usually a polymer) is deformed by pressing the stamp into the polymer at a temperature above the polymer’s glass-transition temperature. The polymer is then cooled down below the glass-transition temperature and the stamp is removed. **VACUUM SUBLIMATION OF METALS** One of the advantages of LCW is the versatility with respect to the material of the stamp used for patterning. In this frame, a role is played also by metallic stamps, some of them (gold for instance) can be functionalized using thiol based Self Assembled Monolayers (SAM) to tune their surface properties. These stamps are usually fabricated by vacuum sublimation of a thin metallic layer on a master previously realized by one of the above mentioned techniques. For some substrates such as silicon or mica an adhesive layer (usually made of chromium or titanium) has to be previously evaporated on the underlying material to favour the stability of the metallic film. **COMMERCIAL AVAILABLE MASTER/STAMPS** Commercial metallic grids commonly used for Electron Microscopy experiments have proven to be very suitable for as a stamp for LCW (See Fig 2). When the grid comes as a large sheet that must be cut, it is crucial to cut it with very sharp scissors to avoid large deformations of the areas near the cut. For the most kind of patterning inexpensive masters such as Compact Disc (CD) Digital versatile disk (DVD) or diffraction gratings are commercially available.

Specifically, we reconstructed two ancestral MADS-domain protein interaction networks (PINs) at different time points by use of phylogenetic and biochemical approaches. One network was reconstructed just before the ancient whole genome gamma triplication (γ triplication) which occurred at the origin of core eudicots, the largest group of flowering plants. A second one was reconstructed after the γ triplication and positioned at the Asterid-Rosid split. As a reference for comparison, present-day MADS-domain PINs in Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum, which are two model plants representative of Rosids and Asterids respectively, were set up by use of same methods. The chosen MADS-box gene subfamilies are major key regulators for plant reproductive development and the γ triplication has been long considered as the main force for driving the divergence of core eudicots. Through direct comparison among ancestral and present-day networks, we revealed a set of innovations driven by the γ triplication at the network level. The γ triplication generated a dramatically innovated network that strongly rewired through the addition of many new interactions. These new interactions displayed new redundancy that many of these interactions were established between paralogous proteins and a new interaction partner. The simulation models demonstrated that both node and edge addition through the γ triplication were important to maintain modularity in the network. Preferential attachment occurred only for the conserved interactions through triplication and was not observed in gained interactions. After triplication, the hubs gradually lost more interactions. Because the network density was observed to be almost constant, low degree nodes that became new hubs in the network gained these interactions lost by hubs. The protein hubs become more specific in comparison to the relative promiscuity at their ancestral state. This was the underlying mechanism behind the observed network rewiring. Furthermore, several putative MADS-domain protein complexes with novel protein interactions were observed originated through γ triplication, which are mainly involved in the regulation of inflorescence meristem specification, floral meristem specification and floral organ identity related to the increased robustness of floral development in core eudicots or Pentapetalae. During the second and third year of PhD, I was also involved in one interesting substudy contributing to understand the evolution of flower in which the experiments were designed by Dr. Philip Ruelens. The sudden radiation of angiosperms approximately c. a. 130 million years ago was considered by Charles Darwin as an “abominable mystery”. The gymnopserms, which are the closest angiosperm’ relatives, are morphologically different. Angiosperm flowers are bisexual while gymnosperm male and female reproductive organs develop separately. Because of the large morphological difference between gymnosperms and angisoperms and the absence of a fossil records with transitional plant species, the origin of angiosperm flower remains a mystery. However, one approach to understand this transition in evolution {{can be found in the}} evolution of several regulatory type II MADS-box gene subfamilies (mainly B-, C/D- and E-class genes), which are phylogenetically related between gymnosperms and angiosperms lineages. MADS-box genes encode MADS-domain transcription factors, which contain a highly conserved DNA-binding domains (the MADS domains). Over the recent two decades, studies demonstrate that the different combination of these transcription factors through forming quaternary complexes and binding the cis-regulatory CArG box of their target genes, specifies the identification of male and female reproductive organs in gymnosperms and angiosperms. Such quaternary complex are also known as “floral quartets” in flowering plants. Therefore, by reconstructing ancestral MADS-domain proteins of B-, C/D- and E-class genes, we can trace the evolution of “floral quartets” prior to the speciation of angiosperms. Our studies demonstrated that just before the origin of flowering plants, a compositional shift occurred in the floral quartets specifying male organ identity from ancestral complexes with two types of subunits through gene duplication to four types of subunits with the integration of SEPALLATA proteins. The protein interaction changes were the result of a gradual and reversible evolutionary trajectory. The simulation model shows that the compositional shifts can facilitate the evolution of the bisexual flower with the male organ in the basal regions and the female organ at the top regions. Our studies provided new insights in how the floral quartets evolved before the rise of angiosperms, which could lead to better understand the origin of angiosperm flowers. Furthermore, I also participated in another study to understand how SEPALLATA 3 (AtSEP 3), a protein with hub and glue properties in Arabidopsis, originated and evolved in network organization by use of reconstructed ancestral and extant plant MADS-domain transcription factors from the previous two studies. After γ triplication, many novel protein interactions were mediated and the network density and complexity were extended by SEP 3 due to its glue property. By swapping SEPALLATA 3 and its ancestors between networks of different ages, it was discovered that the protein lost the capacity of promiscuous interaction and acquired specificity. This was accompanied by constraints on conformations through proline residue accumulation in linker regions between domains, which made the protein less flexible. This suggests that the proteins can evolve towards increased specificity with reduced flexibility when the complexity of the protein interaction network requires specificity. During the last two years of my PhD, another main study concerned bio-molecular functions, different from the previous studies about evolution. In molecular biology, the complexity of RNA regulation is one of the current frontiers in animal and plant molecular biology research. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are characteristically involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTGR) through interaction with RNA. In plants, e. g. in the Arabidopsis genome, more than 200 RBP genes have been predicted based on well-defined sequence motifs. However, when compared to recent studies of mammalian RBPs, experimental evidence for most of these predicted plant RBPs is rather scarce. Recently, the mRNA-bound proteome of mammalian cell lines has been successfully cataloged using a new method called interactome capture. This method relies on in vivo UV crosslinking of proteins to RNA, purifying the mRNA using complementary oligo(dT) beads and identifying the crosslinked proteins using mass spectrometry. We mainly describe an optimized system of mRNA interactome capture for Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon leaf mesophyll protoplasts, a cell type often used in functional cellular assays. We established the conditions for optimal protein yield and demonstrated high efficiency of optimized interactome capture for plant cells. Furthermore, the discovered leaf mesophyll protoplast mRNA interactome provided in vivo experimental evidence for the first time for a number of candidate RBPs (non-classical RBPs) in plants, contributing a function for these candidate RBPs in the regulation of mRNAs.
