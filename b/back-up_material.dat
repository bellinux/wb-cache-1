40|$|During {{the winter}} of 1962 - 63, field {{observations}} in several locations in the Atlantic area revealed a higher than average occurrence of efflorescence on walls of clay brick masonry. The severity of the efflorescence seemed {{more closely related to}} specific bricks than to mortar composition, type of construction, etc. It was suggested that bricks were contributing to the problem either by providing (a) a source of soluble salts, or (b) satisfactory media for easy passage of salts in solution from mortar and/or <b>back-up</b> <b>material</b> through the walls. A study was, therefore, undertaken to investigate the efflorescing tendencies of clay bricks commonly used in masonry construction in the area. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|We give an orbifold Riemann-Roch formula {{in closed}} {{form for the}} Hilbert series of a quasismooth {{polarized}} n-fold X,D, {{under the assumption that}} X is projectively Gorenstein with only isolated orbifold points. Our formula is a sum of parts each of which is integral and Gorenstein symmetric of the same canonical weight; the orbifold parts are called "ice cream functions". This form of the Hilbert series is particularly useful for computer algebra, and we illustrate it on examples of K 3 surfaces and Calabi-Yau 3 -folds. These results apply also with higher dimensional orbifold strata (see [A. Buckley and B. Szendroi, Orbifold Riemann-Roch for 3 -folds with an application to Calabi-Yau geometry, J. Algebraic Geometry 14 (2005) 601 [...] 622] and [Shengtian Zhou, Orbifold Riemann-Roch and Hilbert series, University of Warwick PhD thesis, March 2011, 91 +vii pp. ], although the correct statements are considerably trickier.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to present iliac {{branched}} device (IBD) implantation in a fit 67 -year-old man with tortuous iliac anatomy after previous emergent open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient underwent open treatment for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in another hospital. The procedure was complicated by extreme blood loss which prevented concommitant treatment of two large iliac aneurysms. Later, the patient underwent stent-grafting of a right common iliac artery aneurysm (CIAA) with coil embolization of the internal iliac artery (IIA). He was then refferred to our institute for treatment of the left CIAA with preservation of the left IIA. An IBD was used to this purpose. The introduction system was inserted over a through-and-through wire, and the bridging stent-graft via a left axillary approach. An Excluder leg was used to mate the IBD with the surgical graft limb. Additional self-expanding stents were needed to keep the limbs of the surgical graft open. One year later the patient is doing well, without buttock claudication, and the aneurysm is well excluded. With challenging anatomy, endovascular repair with an IBD may require additional technical tricks but also <b>back-up</b> <b>materials</b> to achieve success...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2005 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the roles and skills needed by rural schools governors of the Mafikeng area project office of North West Province. Lack of uniformity, competency, skills and commitment are still encountered in the SGB structures. Little has been done to empower the rural school governors with relevant skills for effective job performance. An empirical investigation was employed to find ways of empowering the encountered incompetency of rural governors. Literature survey was employed to determine the nature and scope of roles and skills needed by rural schools governors. The subjects of the study were adults (teachers, parents, principals) and students. The responses of 220 respondents were analysed. The findings revealed that school governors in rural areas experience problems in areas like addressing parent's annual meetings, financial management, control and feedback in their job. Recommendations were made by respondents on how to empower rural school governors with the necessary skills. On the basis of the problems and skills identified, more emphasis was put on commitment of all stakeholders, training of governors to develop their management skills, financial skills, regular workshops by the Department of Education, and the old SGB members to train the new ones. The new SGBs should ask questions when they are not clear and translation of <b>back-up</b> <b>materials</b> into the SGB's home language and a certificate for course completion to be granted to the members who completed their office term.

40|$|This {{research}} centres on surface initiated damage on back-up rolls whereby rolling contact fatigue cracks can propagate into the rolls potentially reaching the internal stress fields and leading to catastrophic failure and {{has sought to}} establish design criteria for avoiding such failures. The project objectives have been achieved by examining field evidence, determining the loading and tribological conditions at the work roll/back-up roll interface and investigating both theoretically and experimentally the mechanisms involved in rolling contact fatigue in this case. The presented rolling contact, fatigue and fracture mechanics model includes criteria for crack branching either upwards (i. e. relative safety) or downwards (i. e. potentially catastrophic) and the link between these two cases is related, quantitatively, to {{the properties of the}} roll material. After linking mechanics to microstructure, the influence of work roll test disc surface roughness on both the surface wear of and the interaction between wear and rolling contact fatigue at the surface of back-up roll test discs has been quantified using the results obtained from experimental simulations carried out on a rolling–sliding testing machine. Finally practical quantitative recommendations are made for the mechanical and microstructural design of bainitic <b>back-up</b> roll <b>materials,</b> <b>back-up</b> roll redressing procedures and the surface roughness of both work rolls and back-up rolls presented to the mill...|$|R
40|$|The SUROS rolling-sliding {{testing machine}} at the University of Sheffield has been {{developed}} to examine the wear and early rolling contact fatigue performance of materials by laboratory simulation. This paper describes the construction, operation and capabilities of the twin disc testing machine and presents some of the results obtained during {{a study of the}} performance of a <b>back-up</b> <b>material</b> when run under conditions of water lubricated rolling-sliding contact with test discs manufactured from high speed steel to represent the work roll. In particular, the work presented was obtained from a test programme carried out to study the effect of work roll test disc surface roughness on the surface wear and early surface crack formation in back-up roll test discs manufactured form a cast back-up roll material. The results showed that under certain conditions, early surface cracks seen in the back-up roll test discs were similar to those seen in the surface of a sample taken from spalled material from a back-up roll. In addition the results showed that the roughness of the work roll test disc has a very significant effect on both the initiation and early propagation of surface cracks and also the surface wear rate of the backup roll test disc track...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} the first {{comprehensive}} review of church building and restoration in an English county between 1800 and 1914. Architectural trends and arrangements of furnishings and fittings receive the greatest attention, together with the setting of local events in the national context. The condition and appearance of churches in the pre-Ecclesiological era are considered and a rather more favourable picture built up than that inherited from the nineteenth century. The rise of Ecclesiology is examined {{and it is clear}} that Leicestershire follows rather than plays a leading part in national trends. Throughout emphasis is placed on statistical information to illuminate the points under discussion, for example, {{to assess the impact of}} the restoration movement on local churches; the claim that restoration was destruction is critically examined, particularly in relation to G. G. Scott. It is shown that from about 1870 there-was a great need for new churches in Leicester, and, although there were some notable buildings provided, there was a general tendency towards architectural simplicity which led back to the values embodied in the pre-Victorian buildings. This is also associated with changing stylistic fashions; after the flowering of the Gothic Revival, its waning is traced and examples given of the use of non-Gothic styles. The above themes are generally treated chronologically. They are followed by separate treatments of the processes of selecting architects (the clear evidence is limited), building materials and their application (Leicestershire has an excellent diversity of materials), and the methods of funding the work. <b>Back-up</b> <b>material</b> is provided in a series of Appendices. Of these the longest and most important are the ones summarising the work done at each church, the work of individual architects, and a review of the amount and timing of activity in other selected counties. The latter seems to show that not all counties follow the Leicestershire pattern, which peaks in the 1860 s...|$|E

40|$|The demands {{placed on}} back-up rolls in hot strip mills have been {{investigated}} {{by a combination of}} literature and industrial studies. The tribological operating conditions have been established and the maximum local loads and pressure distributions at the work roll/back-up roll interface have been obtained by processing mill and roll schedule data using a computer program (commercial software developed by V AI Industries (UK) Ltd) and applying the theories of contact mechanics. After a study of the responses of the rolls to these demands and possible failure mechanisms, research has centred on surface initiated damage whereby cracks can propagate into the roll substrate potentially reaching the internal residual stress fields and leading to catastrophic failure. A proposed qualitative contact and fracture mechanics model, for the rolling contact fatigue and spalling failure, has been quantified theoretically using published methods for determining the stress intensity factors at the tips of pressurised and water lubricated, inclined rolling contact fatigue cracks. The predictions of the quantitative model in terms of crack directions and lengths have been validated by microscopic observation of the morphologies cracks produced in test discs used in the "SUROS" Rolling-Sliding Testing Machine and also in a sample of material spalled from a back-up roll. The quantitative failure model includes criteria for crack branching either upwards leading to micro spalling or downwards (potentially catastrophic) and the link between these two cases has been related quantitatively to the value of the mode I threshold for the roll material. After linking mechanics to microstructure and quantifying the interactions between wear and rolling contact fatigue in this case, practical quantitative recommendations have been made for the design of bainitic <b>back-up</b> roll <b>materials,</b> <b>back-up</b> roll redressing procedures and the surface roughness of both the work rolls and back-up rolls presented to the mill...|$|R
40|$|Suppression or {{elimination}} of burr formation {{at the exit}} edge of the workpiece during drilling is essential to make quality products. In this work, low alloy steel specimens have been drilled to observe burr height under different machining conditions. Taper shank, uncoated 14 [*]mm diameter HSS twist drills are used in these experiments. Dry environment is maintained in experiment set I. Water is applied as cutting fluid in experiment set II. In the next four sets of experiments, the effect of providing <b>back-up</b> support <b>material</b> and exit edge bevel is observed on formation of burr at the exit edge of specimens under dry and wet conditions. It is revealed that an exit edge bevel of 31 degrees with water as the cutting fluid gives negligible burr at the exit edge of the drilled hole at certain machining conditions. Use of a back-up support can also reduce drill burr to a large extent. In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANN) are developed for modeling experimental results, and modeled values show close matching with the experimental results with small deviations...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis on}} "Passportisation of parents´ opinions on compulsory child vaccination" deals with child vaccination itself and subsequently it identifies and mutually compares social context with parents´ opinions and attitudes towards compulsory and non-compulsory vaccination. The thesis {{is divided into}} a theoretical and an empirical part. In the theoretical part I deal with theoretical observations of given problem and the practical part is focused straightaway on parents´ individual attitudes towards child vaccination. The goal of this thesis {{is to find out}} parents´ of up to 5 year-old´s opinions on the vaccination of older children. I extended my thesis in more goals that were trying to find out the relations between social questions and between supporters and opponents of compulsory and non-compulsory vaccination. To reach the set goals I used a quantitative research method and I picked a questionnaire survey among the parents of children of different ages, to be the method. I have come to that social status is not decisive for the decision of parents during the compulsory and non-compulsory vaccinations. I have found out that almost all parents of children up to the age of five years do agree with a compulsory child vaccination, but an absolute majority was against a non-compulsory vaccination. Almost half of all respondents who had children older than the age of 5 years voted for a compulsory vaccination. An interesting outcome of my research is that respondents who have disagreed with a compulsory vaccination have gained a secondary school diploma. The results have been processed into tables and summed up in a discussions where I compared some of them with similar research results from the years of 2012 and 2015. I included my own opinion within the discussion, as well as a solution proposal for the given problem. In the conclusion I have summed up the whole thesis. The research results may be published in magazines or may serve as an information source for experts, or even as a <b>back-up</b> <b>material</b> for respondents...|$|E

40|$|The Hybrid Photon Detectors (HPDs) adopted for LHCb's RICH {{detectors}} {{are required}} {{to operate in the}} fringe field of the 4 Tm LHCb dipole magnet. In fields in excess of 15 G, photoelectrons are lost from the active area of an HPD. Shielding the HPDs from the fringe field is therefore essential for the efficient operation of the RICH detectors. A primary magnetic shield has been designed that reduces the field at the photon detectors to < 20 G. This field is to be further reduced by a set of individual secondary magnetic shields around each HPD. This note describes the technique used to calculate the residual field inside these secondary shields. The size of the problem, together with the disparity in the geometric scales involved, make the calculations intractable using a finite element model of the entire magnetic environment. As a result, a sub-modelling method has been used together with a rectangular approximation to the circular cross-section shields. The model indicates that with a 89. 5 mm HPD pitch, 0. 9 mm thick, 140 mm long shields with a 1 mm air gap, the photon detectors will operate efficiently. Fields of < 8 G are predicted within secondary shields made of the baseline material MuMetal. The peak field inside the shield material is 3. 9 kG, half way from the saturation value. The <b>back-up</b> secondary shield <b>material,</b> Supranhyster- 36, gives identical shielding performance but the peak field is even further from saturation. Further margin could be achieved by extension of the shields...|$|R
