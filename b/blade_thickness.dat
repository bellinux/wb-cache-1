40|$|We provide {{experimental}} {{evidence that the}} liquid film remaining on a doctor-bladed gravure roll surface significantly influences the liquid transfer from the engraved roll surface to a moving substrate. The local free surface profiles of doctor-bladed liquid films were directly measured on both tri-helical grooves and lands (the nongrooved areas between grooves) at different roll speeds and <b>blade</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> The liquid film covered the roll surface with a finite thickness on the lands below the critical capillary number. An increase in the capillary number led to a transition from a fully filled to a starved configuration, in which the liquid barely remained on the lands and partly filled the grooves with a concave surface profile. The liquid transfer ratio monotonically decreased with {{a decrease in the}} liquid thickness on the gravure roll surface, obeying a single curve for different <b>blade</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> Furthermore, the decrease in liquid thickness promoted a flow instability transition from unstable dripping though a stable state with a uniform surface to a cascade.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of loading on ice class propellers, involving {{high levels of}} in- and out-of-plane bending as well as severe blade torsion, means that for final design a detailed numerical stress analysis must {{be done on the}} propeller blade structure.

The approach allows explicitly for both steady and unsteady loading components arising from ice and hydrodynamic loads and the structural response in the form of direct stresses, fatigue loadings and existing residual stresses. For initial design there is a requirement for sizing the <b>blade</b> <b>thicknesses</b> and a method to do this is described.

40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 24 The {{efficiency}} of compressor impellers, {{apart from the}} design, depends on some features linked with their manufacture. These features are the accuracy of geometry, the surface quality obtained, and the blockages which are inevitable with covered impellers and are attributable to the joining method applied, e. g., greater <b>blade</b> <b>thicknesses</b> {{in the case of}} riveting, or narrowed cross sections, due to weld seams, in the case of welding. As a result of the ever increasing importance of efficiency, efforts have been made to further improve the manufacturing process. The advantages and disadvantages of the various forming methods for high-quality impellers, such as milling with a relatively high accuracy, and involving high manufacturing outlay, are discussed. The various casting processes with a variety of possibilities to fulfill the requirements made with regard to the dimensional tolerances, process-dependent <b>blade</b> <b>thicknesses</b> and manual work for achieving certain specified accuracies are described. The {{efficiency of}} impellers with closed passageways, that is, with a cover or shroud disc, is superior to that of impellers with open passageways. This means that when no cast impellers are used, suitable methods must be available for joining the blades and the cover. For maximum accuracy and minimum blockage, the high-vacuum brazing method has become more and more accepted during the past few years. However, the manufacture of impellers applying the brazing method becomes problematic for large diameters. In addition to vacuum brazing, manual and machine welding processes continue to be applied, including slot welding for two-dimensionally curved blades. Diffusion welding and electron-beam welding have not found acceptance since high costs, unfavorable crevices, and sharp edges, along with possible deformations, have a negative influence on the behavior of such impellers during operation. It is true that the sophisticated riveting process of some manufacturers for two-dimensionally curved blades requires great wall thicknesses; but, {{it is also true that}} high-accuracy impellers can be produced by this method. In addition, the vibratory behavior of such impellers is favorable due to system-inherent dampening. Moreover, riveted impellers will tolerate high stresses when the Bauschinger effect is taken into account. The manufacture of highly stressed impellers for turbocompressors is based on the availability of suitable materials and adequate test methods...|$|R

5000|$|The finest and rarest logs {{are sent}} to {{companies}} that produce veneer. The advantage to this practice is twofold. First, it provides the most financial gain to {{the owner of the}} log. Secondly, and of more importance to the woodworker, it greatly expands the amount of usable wood. While a log used for solid lumber is cut into thick pieces, usually no thinner than 1/8 of an inch (3 mm), veneers are cut as thin as 1/40 of an inch (0.6 mm). Depending on the cutting process used by the veneer manufacturer, very little wood is wasted by the saw <b>blade</b> <b>thickness,</b> known as the saw kerf. Accordingly, the yield of a rare grain pattern or wood type is greatly increased, in turn placing less stress on the resource. Some manufacturers even use a very wide knife to [...] "slice off" [...] the thin veneer pieces. In this way, none of the wood is wasted. The slices of veneer are always kept in the order in which they are cut from the log and are often sold this way.|$|E
40|$|Research on the {{efficiency}} improvement of pump as turbine (PAT) is inadequate. <b>Blade</b> <b>thickness</b> {{is an important}} geometry parameter in blade design. To explore effects of <b>blade</b> <b>thickness</b> {{on the influence of}} PAT, numerical research on three different specific speeds of PATs with different <b>blade</b> <b>thickness</b> was carried out. Their performance changes with <b>blade</b> <b>thickness</b> were presented. Besides, the variations of hydraulic loss distribution with increasing <b>blade</b> <b>thickness</b> were performed. Theoretical analysis gives a reasonable explanation for the performance change. Results show thatPAT's flow versus efficiency curve (Q-η) is lowered; flow versus head (Q-H) curve and flow versus power (Q-P) curve are increased with increasing <b>blade</b> <b>thickness.</b> The increase of Q-P is mainly attributed to the increase of theoretical head caused by increasing blockage of impeller inlet area. Hydraulic loss distribution analysis indicates that the total hydraulic loss within PAT is increased with increasing <b>blade</b> <b>thickness.</b> The increase of Q-H curve is a combined effect of the increase in theoretical head and the total hydraulic loss. The decrease of efficiency with increasing <b>blade</b> <b>thickness</b> indicates that the <b>blade</b> <b>thickness</b> of PAT should be as thin as possible if its strength could be met...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of stainless steel stamping multistage pump, quadratic regression orthogonal test, hydraulic design, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are {{used to analyze the}} effect of pump geometric parameters. Sixteen impellers are designed based on the quadratic regression orthogonal test, which have three factors including impeller outlet slope, impeller blade outlet stagger angle, and impeller blade outlet width. Through quadratic regression equation, the function relationship between efficiency values and three factors is established. The optimal combination of geometric parameters is found through the analysis of the regression equation.

Since {{the temperature of}} combustion gases is very high sometimes reaching 2400 K, the turbine blade cannot sustain the resulting thermal stress. Moreover, for higher efficiency for advanced gas turbines, increase of inlet temperature is needed.

40|$|High cycle fatigue (HCF) plays a {{significant}} role in a bulk of turbine blade failures. During operation, periodic fluctuations in the steam force occur at frequencies corresponding to the operating speed and harmonics and cause vibration of the bladed disks. Digital prototyping and optimization become the most practical and economical means for turbine stages design and for identification and solving HCF-caused failures associated with resonant conditions. During fabrication, 2 - 3 % variation of <b>blades</b> <b>thickness</b> is considered acceptable. Such fluctuations can lead to deviation of the blades vibration from expected values within the range of 5 %. More drastic difference of blades’ dynamic properties during turbine operation could occur as a result of blades erosion.

These techniques are illustrated with analysis of gas turbine working wheel with 34 buckets. Mistuning was modeled by blade material density variation.
