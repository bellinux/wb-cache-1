30|$|Catalase (CAT), {{glutathione}} S-transferase (GST), and {{superoxide dismutase}} (SOD) activities, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were investigated in 24 -, 48 -, and 72 -h exposure groups and {{were compared to}} the control group. Muscle {{was chosen as the}} target organ since it occupies most of the body and is involved in energy-consuming movements by bivalve mollusks. The tissue was homogenized using a tissue homogenator (<b>Bioneer</b> <b>Corporation,</b> Daejeon, Republic of Korea) in four volumes of 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.6), containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sucrose, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.15 M KCl, and 0.1 M PMSF. The homogenate was centrifuged at 9, 000 [*]×[*]g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at - 80 °C. The quantities of proteins were determined according to the Bradford (1979) method using the Coomassie blue reagent. The CAT activity was assayed by the method of Claiborne (1985). The reaction mixture consisted of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.019 M hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), and 10 % phenazonium methosulfate (PMS) in a final volume of 3 mL. The change in absorbance was recorded at 240 nm. The CAT activity was calculated in terms of nanomoles of H 2 O 2 consumed per minute per milligram of protein. The GST activity was determined by the Habig method with some modifications (Habig et al. 1974). The reaction mixture consisted of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mM glutathione (GSH, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1 mM 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (CDNB, Sigma) and 10 % PMS in a total volume of 2 mL. The change in absorbance at 25 °C was recorded at 340 nm, and the enzyme activity was calculated as nanomoles of the CDNB conjugate formed per minute per milligram of protein using a molar extinction coefficient of 9.6 [*]×[*] 103 /M[*]·[*]cm. The SOD activity was determined according to the method described by Kono (1978) with some modifications. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.725 mL Tris-buffer (50 mM, pH 8.3, Sigma), 0.1 mL nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT, 500 mM, Sigma), 0.1 mL of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH, 780 mM, Sigma), and different volumes (0.025, 0.050, 0.075, 0.1, and 0.050 mL) of PMS (Sigma). The change in absorbance was recorded at 560 nm. The activity was reported by its ability to inhibit 50 % of the reduction of NBT, and the result is expressed as units per minute per milligram protein. LPO was determined according to the method described by Fatima et al. (2000) with some modifications. The tissue was homogenized in a chilled 0.1 M potassium chloride solution. The assay mixture contained 0.67 % thiobarbituric acid (TBA, Sigma), 10 % chilled trichloroacetic acid, and homogenate (10 %) in a total volume of 3 mL. The LPO rate was expressed as nanomoles of TBA-reactive substances formed of tissue using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.56 [*]×[*] 105 /M[*]·[*]cm.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In {{the field}} of {{leishmaniasis}} control, it {{is considered one of}} the most neglected tropical diseases in the world. At present, 98 countries are infected with various types of the disease. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an old endemic disease in Iran. The disease is observed in two forms of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) and Anthroponotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL). Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in 17 provinces of Iran. One of the major foci of the disease has been located in the northern Khorassan province, including rural areas of Esfarayen county. Despite the passing of half a century of knowledge on cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Esferayen and despite various interventions to control of the disease, its incidence has been remained in high level in the region. According to the Passive case finding was conducted during the year of 1389, more than 500 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported from this area. This study was carried out during the years of 1392 - 93 with emphazing to molecular determination of vectors, reservoirs and human infected cases. Relationship between IL- 4 polymorphism (promoter) and clinical aspects of disease was the other important objective of this study. Material & Methods: Sand flies were collected using sticky traps and its infection to leishmania parasites was determined by employing of molecular methods using the loci of kDNA, ITS 1. The identification of sand fly specimens was performed using validated keys. The extraction of Leishmania DNA from female sand flies was performed by Qiagene kit. Rodents were captured using Sherman live traps and their infection to leishmania were tested against the loci of kDNA, ITS 1. To investigate of human infection to Leishmania, parasites slides were prepared from 40 patients with acute wounds. Positive slides for leishmania were checked by molecular methods on loci of kDNA and ITS 1. In order to determine of polymorphisms of interleukin 4 promoter (IL- 4) in leishmaniasis cases with different clinical symptoms,Treatment time fifty human blood samples were prepared. All samples were tested by PCR and followed using restriction enzyme of Eco 47 I. The results of the study were analyzed using, SPSS software, Version 18 and χ 2 Non parametric test. To detection of the genetic diversity of the parasites, all samples were sequenced by <b>Bioneer</b> drawing <b>Corporation,</b> South Korea. Analysis of gene sequences and registration was done via the site of www. ncbi. nih. gov. org. Forof phylogram and cladogram, the software of CLUSTALw was used via www. ebi. ac. uk/clustalw site. Results: In determining the vectors of Leishmaniasis and its infection rate, among the 390 female sand flies, four specimens (1. 02...|$|R
