This tool would guide intelligence collection efforts and would support and facilitate comparative assessment of the cyber threat posed <b>by</b> <b>terrorist</b> organizations and individuals through the provision of a consistent method of assessment across time, amongst organizations and individuals, and between analysts. This study leveraged the professional experience of experts to engineer a new functional construct – a structured analytical technique designed to assess the cyber threat posed <b>by</b> <b>terrorist</b> entities and individuals. The resultant instrument was a novel structured analytical construct that uses defined indicators of a terrorist organization/individual’s intent to carry out cyber attacks, and their capability to actually do so as measures of an organization/individual’s overall level of cyber threat...|$|R
