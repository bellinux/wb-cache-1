5|$|Pennsylvania Railroad 4876 is a GG1-class {{electric}} locomotive {{located at the}} B Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It was built in 1939 and {{was involved in the}} only accident to befall a GG1. In 1953, the locomotive overran the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> and crashed into Union Station in Washington, D.C. after its brakes failed. A temporary concourse floor was erected over 4876 (which had broken through the original) for the upcoming inauguration of Dwight D. Eisenhower. After the inauguration it was shipped back to Altoona, Pennsylvania, for repairs and placed back into service.|$|E
5|$|Wood Siding {{initially}} had no {{facilities for}} passengers, {{not even a}} platform. In 1894 a low platform and small corrugated iron waiting room were built for passengers. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> for the siding, and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. While the original Aveling & Porter locomotive was slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before its arrival, later locomotives were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains. Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the new Chiltern Main Line. Wood Siding {{was removed from the}} timetable by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. While Wood Siding station was demolished shortly after closure, the abutments of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact. The porter's hut survives as a nearby garden shed.|$|E

40|$|Paper discuses {{reasons of}} {{building}} <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> and situations {{that may occur}} in railway station leading to build safety tracks. Also discusses parameters of <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> that enter its design, such as collision speed and kinetic energy absorbing capacity. Furthermore, presents categories of <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> depending on principles of absorbing the kinetic energy and points {{pros and cons of}} each structure...|$|R
50|$|Dead-end sidings {{are often}} fitted with <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> to prevent {{vehicles}} running {{off the end}} of the track. These may consist of a simple transverse beam fixed at buffer height but the <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> at passenger stations can be elaborate hydraulic installations capable of absorbing a considerable amount of energy.|$|R
25|$|The {{station was}} built by the {{contractor}} Philipp Holzmann with construction starting in 1883. The Central-Bahnhof Frankfurt was finally opened on 18 August 1888. Right {{on the evening of}} the opening day, a train ran over the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> and the locomotive was damaged. Over {{the course of the next}} few years, the area to the east of the new station, the Bahnhofsviertel, was built; it was completed around 1900. Until the completion of Leipzig Hauptbahnhof in 1915, Frankfurt station was the largest in Europe. As of today (2014), the 24 platforms with 26 tracks on one level probably make it the world's largest one-level railway hall.|$|E
25|$|On 20 November 2013, a Class 221 Super Voyager {{diesel-electric}} {{multiple unit}} from London Euston to Chester {{collided with the}} buffer stops on platform 1, riding up over them and smashing a glass screen. There were no injuries, although one passenger was taken to hospital for checks. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch report stated that the incident was due to exceptionally slippery rails, but that {{the consequences of this}} were made more severe by the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> being of an older design, which did not absorb the impact energy effectively. The report further stated that that particular stop had not undergone a risk assessment within the previous ten years, and was possibly not appropriate for class 221 units.|$|E
500|$|In 1894 {{the crude}} {{stations}} on the Brill Tramway were rebuilt {{in anticipation of}} the extension to Oxford. The other stations on the line were provided with buildings containing a booking office, waiting rooms and toilets, but Wood Siding station was equipped with a small corrugated iron waiting room [...] "with shelf and drawer" [...] for passengers. A low passenger platform was also built. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> for the siding, and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. The original Aveling & Porter locomotives were slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before their arrival, but the more advanced locomotives introduced by the Metropolitan Railway were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains.|$|E

500|$|At 8:38 AM on {{the morning}} of January 15, 1953, 4876 {{was the subject of a}} wreck, the only one to involve a GG1, while pulling {{southbound}} Federal Express #173 from Boston, Massachusetts, to Washington, D.C. Upon nearing an [...] "Approach" [...] signal about [...] outside of Washington, the engineer applied the brakes to slow the train down from [...] Noting that the train still was not slowing after passing the signal, the engineer engaged the emergency brake and sounded the locomotive's horn. Also observing the excessive speed of 4876 was an assistant train director in Interlocking Tower 'C', who radioed ahead to Tower 'K'. The train director in Tower 'K' had the switches changed to allow 4876 to enter Union Station on Track 16, its regularly assigned track. Having insufficient time to switch the runaway on to another track, the director alerted the station master's office which was situated at the end of Track 16. Still traveling at around , 4876 rammed the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> and continued into the concourse of Union Station, before partially falling through the floor into the baggage room below.|$|E
