5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1950s, {{the whole}} family seated around a set {{in the living room}} was the typical way of {{listening}} to radio. Stations tried to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> to all people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was pretty much the same.|$|E
500|$|Keith Waterhouse's Mrs Pooter's Diary of 1983 is an {{adaptation}} of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for Bridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The New York Times critic wrote that it [...] "captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> to all men." [...] This diary began as a weekly column in The Independent, and was later published in books which sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries. In the 1990s the satirical magazine Private Eye lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in [...] "The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with The Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} criticized for its {{large number of}} collaborations and producers. The Guardians Caroline Sullivan argued that although [...] "others lend a hand [...] it's very much Stefani's show"; however, most others disagreed. Jason Damas of PopMatters compared the album to a second No Doubt greatest hits album, and Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester felt that {{the large number of}} collaborators result in sacrificing Stefani's identity on the album. Anthony Carew of Neumu expressed that the album's fragmentation kept it from being [...] "a bright-and-shiny pop-music [...] ". Most reviewers held that the collaborations prevented the album from having a solidified sound. Eric Greenwood wrote for Drawer B that [...] "Stefani tries to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> to all people here", but that the result [...] "comes off as manipulative and contrived." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne shared this opinion, stating that the album [...] "is like one of those [...] retail magazines that resembles a catalog more than an old-fashioned collection of, say, articles." ...|$|E
500|$|Byzantine {{accounts}} of Thomas's rebellion state {{that he did}} not in fact claim the throne under his own name but assumed the identity of Emperor Constantine VI, who had been deposed and murdered by his mother, Irene of Athens, in 797. Most modern scholars follow Lemerle, who dismisses this as yet another later fabrication. If it contains any truth, it is possible that this story may originate from Thomas choosing to be crowned under the regnal name of [...] "Constantine", but there is no evidence for such an act. The possible appropriation of Constantine VI's identity is linked in some Byzantine sources with the statement that Thomas was a rumoured supporter of iconolatry, as opposed to Michael's support for iconoclasm: it was under Constantine VI that veneration of the icons was restored. Nevertheless, the ambiguous phrasing of the sources, the iconoclast leanings of many themes in Asia Minor, and Thomas's alliance with the Arabs seem to speak against any open commitment to icon worship on his part. Indeed, given Michael II's conciliatory approach during his early reign, the icon worship controversy {{does not seem to have}} been a major issue at the time, and in the view of modern scholars most probably did not play a major role in Thomas's revolt. The image of Thomas as an iconophile champion opposed to the iconoclast Michael II in later, Macedonian-era sources was probably the result of their own anti-iconoclast bias. Warren Treadgold furthermore suggests that if true, Thomas's claim to be Constantine VI may have been little more than a tale circulated to win support, and that Thomas pursued a [...] "studied ambiguity" [...] towards icons, designed to attract support from iconophiles. In Treadgold's words, [...] "Thomas could <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> to all men until he had conquered the whole empire, and then he would have time enough to disappoint some of his followers".|$|E
2500|$|Osbourne's co-hosts on The Talk, Leah Remini and Holly Robinson Peete were {{released}} from their contracts in 2011. Osbourne spoke of their dismissals in December 2011 on The Howard Stern Show, stating: [...] "Some people don't really {{know who they}} are, {{and you have to}} know who you are when you're in something like this. You can't pretend to be something you're not. You have to know your brand. You can't <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> to everyone."

He for instance noted that while in Pakistan she presented herself as a conservative Muslim [...] who always wore her head covered, while as a student in Oxford she adopted a more liberal lifestyle, tending to wear a T-shirt and jeans and occasionally drinking wine. Muñoz concurred, describing Bhutto as [...] "a woman of contradictions". As a politician, she was conscious of how her image was presented in Pakistan; she dressed modestly, was never photographed with a glass lest it be interpreted as containing alcohol, and would refuse to shake men's hands.|$|E

60|$|Mary's next {{patient was}} feminine, and James was again left to cool his heels in the road; but not alone, for Mr. Dryland {{came out of}} the cottage. The curate was a big, stout man, with reddish hair, and a {{complexion}} like squashed strawberries and cream; his large, heavy face, hairless except for scanty red eyebrows, gave a disconcerting impression of nakedness. His eyes were blue and his mouth small, with the expression which young ladies, eighty years back, strove to acquire by repeating the words prune and prism. He had a fat, full voice, with unctuous modulations not entirely under his control, so that sometimes, unintentionally, he would utter the most commonplace remark in a tone fitted for a benediction. Mr. Dryland was possessed by the laudable ambition to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> to all men; and he tried, without conspicuous success, always to suit his conversation to his hearers. With old ladies he was bland; with sportsmen slangy; with yokels he was broadly humorous; and with young people aggressively juvenile.
