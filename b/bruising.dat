40|$|Aims: The aims of {{this study}} were (A) to {{investigate}} whether the number of years of forensic experience affected the accuracy with which forensic experts (FEs) were able to age <b>bruises</b> and (B) to identify the properties and colours of a <b>bruise</b> that were utilized by FEs in their assessment of <b>bruise</b> age. The study then investigated the possibility of using a more objective technique. It was decided to use readily available digital photography and software to objectively assess changes in <b>bruise</b> colouration and to investigate if this can be used to age <b>bruises.</b> Methods: Twenty-three FEs were shown 25 photographs of <b>bruises</b> of varying but known ages and asked to estimate the ages. In part two of the study, <b>bruises</b> were inflicted on volunteers using a vacuum pump and photographs taken of the <b>bruise</b> daily from infliction to resolution. The images were analysed using Adobe Photoshopw. Red, green and blue (RGB) values were recorded for each <b>bruise</b> and analyses carried out comparing the values over time between subjects and within subjects. Results: This study both enhanced and supported a previous conclusion that visual assessment of photographs is an unreliable method for ageing <b>bruises.</b> Additionally, it found that the degree of forensic experience had no effect on accuracy. It also identified that colour (particularly yellow, red and purple) and intensity of colour were the most commonly used properties of a <b>bruise</b> in the assessment of its age. The RGB method proved to be a reliable technique with which to measure <b>bruise</b> colour, but its validity in the assessment of <b>bruise</b> age was poor...|$|R

5|$|Baorangia bicolor, {{also known}} as the two-colored bolete or red and yellow bolete after its {{two-tone}} coloring scheme of red and yellow, is an edible fungus in the genus Baorangia. It inhabits most of eastern North America, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains and in season during the summer and fall months but can be found across the globe in China and Nepal. Its fruit body, the mushroom, is classed as medium or large in size, which helps distinguish it from the many similar appearing species that have a smaller stature. A deep blue/indigo <b>bruising</b> of the pore surface and a less dramatic <b>bruising</b> coloration change in the stem {{over a period of several}} minutes are identifying characteristics that distinguish it from the similar poisonous species Boletus sensibilis. There are two variations of this species, variety borealis and variety subreticulatus, and several other similar species of fungi are not poisonous.|$|E

5|$|Most {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in red blood cell count (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of platelets can lead to easy <b>bruising</b> or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Bone <b>bruise</b> is {{a common}} finding in acutely injured knee {{examined}} by magnetic resonance (MR). The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the association of bone <b>bruise</b> frequency with postinjury lesions of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and menisci. Bone <b>bruise</b> involves posttraumatic bone marrow change with hemorrhages, edema and microtrabecular fractures without disruption of adjacent cortices or articular cartilage. MR imaging is a method of choice for detecting bone <b>bruises</b> which can not be seen on conventional radiographic techniques. Methods. A representative review of 120 MR examinations for the acute knee trauma was conducted. All the patients were examined within one month of trauma. All MR examinations were performed by using a 0. 3 T MR unit. Results. Posttraumatic bone <b>bruise</b> was seen in 39 (32. 5 %) patients out of 120. Three patients had fracture of the cortex, so-called “occult” fracture (not seen on plain radiography). We analyzed only bone <b>bruises</b> without these fractures of the cortex. Bone <b>bruise</b> was associated with the lesion of ACL in 27 (69 %) patients. In 28 (72 %) patients bone <b>bruise</b> was in combination with the lesion of menisci. Only two patients with bone <b>bruise</b> had neither ACL nor menisci lesions. There were 78 patients without bone <b>bruise</b> but 33 (43 %) of them had lesions of ACL and 49 (63 %) had lesions of menisci. Conclusion. Bone <b>bruise</b> is best seen in STIR (Short TI Inversion Recovery) images and is very often found in acute knee trauma. Very often it is associated with posttraumatic lesions of ACL and menisci, so attention must be paid to this when bone <b>bruise</b> is seen. The difference in frequency of internal structures of the knee lesions in patients with bone <b>bruise</b> is highly statistically significant as compared to patients with no bone <b>bruise...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Bruises</b> become {{spatially}} inhomogeneous {{during the}} healing process; a smaller red-blue core area, caused by hemoglobin, {{is surrounded by}} a larger yellow area, caused by bilirubin, which is enzymatically formed from hemoglobin.

40|$|<b>Bruises</b> {{can have}} medicolegal {{significance}} {{such that the}} age of a <b>bruise</b> {{may be an important}} issue. This study sought to determine if colorimetry or reflectance spectrophotometry could be employed to objectively estimate the age of <b>bruises.</b> Based on a previously described method, reflectance spectrophotometric scans were obtained from <b>bruises</b> using a Cary 100 Bio spectrophotometer fitted with a fibre-optic reflectance probe. Measurements were taken from the <b>bruise</b> and a control area. Software was used to calculate the first derivative at 490 and 480 nm; the proportion of oxygenated hemoglobin was calculated using an isobestic point method and a software application converted the scan data into colorimetry data. In addition, data on factors that might be associated with the determination of the age of a bruise: subject age, subject sex, degree of trauma, <b>bruise</b> size, skin color, body build, and depth of <b>bruise</b> were recorded. From 147 subjects, 233 reflectance spectrophotometry scans were obtained for analysis. The age of the <b>bruises</b> ranged from 0. 5 to 231. 5 h. A General Linear Model analysis method was used. This revealed that colorimetric measurement of the yellowness of a <b>bruise</b> accounted for 13 % of the <b>bruise</b> age. By incorporation of the other recorded data (as above), yellowness could predict up to 32 % of the age of a bruise—implying that 68 % of the variation was dependent on other factors. However, critical appraisal of the model revealed that the colorimetry method of determining the age of a <b>bruise</b> was affected by skin tone and required a measure of the proportion of oxygenated hemoglobin, which is obtained by spectrophotometric methods. Using spectrophotometry, the first derivative at 490 nm alone accounted for 18 % of the <b>bruise</b> age estimate. When additional factors (subject sex, <b>bruise</b> depth and oxygenation of hemoglobin) were included in the General Linear Model this increased to 31 %—implying that 69 % of the variation was dependent on other factors. This indicates that spectrophotometry would be of more use that colorimetry for assessing the age of <b>bruises,</b> but the spectrophotometric method used needs to be refined to provide useful data regarding the estimated age of a <b>bruise.</b> Such refinements might include the use of multiple readings or utilizing a comprehensive mathematical model of the optics of skin.
