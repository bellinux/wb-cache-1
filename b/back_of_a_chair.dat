5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left arm over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{substitute}} is the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b> The {{disadvantages of}} this is that the hank is not kept under tension, and thus the yarn has a tendency to get tangled, and one has to stop very often to untangle it.|$|E
2500|$|In The Schoolboy with Uniform Cap Camille {{seems to}} be staring off in space. His arm is over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> mouth gaped open, {{possibly}} lost in thought. [...] This was {{the larger of the}} two works made of Camille.|$|E

60|$|Renouard, {{his hand}} {{grasping}} the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> {{stared down at}} him dumbly.|$|E
60|$|He was {{steadying}} {{himself with}} his right hand upon the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> his foot suspended.|$|E
60|$|She tossed {{over the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> her <b>chair</b> <b>an</b> {{envelope}} to Thatcher. He opened it.|$|R
6000|$|Up to {{that moment}} I had been leaning against the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> garden <b>chair.</b> Something else now got {{between me and my}} chair. It stole round my waist--it held me gently--it {{strengthened}} its hold--it improved my temper--it made me fit to understand him. All done by what? Only an arm! ...|$|R
60|$|David {{took from}} the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his <b>chair</b> <b>a</b> crochet {{antimacassar}} with a lion rampant {{in the center}} and spread it over his knee.|$|R
60|$|George {{rose and}} turned rather gray in the face, {{as he leaned}} on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|Phipps {{leaned against}} the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b> He seemed to have aged ten years {{in the last few}} days.|$|E
60|$|Westerman as he spoke, stood {{leaning on}} the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> and Bourbotte also rose as he {{answered}} him.|$|E
25|$|Monsoon's {{disqualification}} {{win over}} Sammartino in NJ triggered <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> rematches at Madison Square Garden, {{and they would}} renew the feud again there in 1967. At {{the end of the}} Jersey City match as Monsoon was sitting on the mat a fan (not part of the show) jumped into the ring and broke the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wooden <b>chair</b> over Monsoon's head.|$|R
40|$|Color poster shows a sad {{cocker spaniel}} with its head resting on sailor's collar on <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blue <b>chair.</b> On {{the wall behind}} the <b>chair</b> hangs <b>a</b> "Gold Star" service flag with a red border, white center and yellow star in the middle. A gold star on a service flag signifies a family member who has died in war...|$|R
6000|$|... "Walton {{will have}} the orders inside of the next hour. Go with him, and he {{will tell you what}} to do." [...] Then came <b>a</b> bang <b>of</b> the curtain to a roller-top desk, <b>a</b> shoving <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{revolving}} <b>chair,</b> and in <b>a</b> twinkle Captain Line had disappeared from view. Truly, Uncle Sam and all under him were rushing things.|$|R
60|$|Mannering, who {{had been}} pacing the room, stopped short. He grasped the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> and turning round faced Borrowdean.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What do you say, Harold?' cried Ellen, {{putting her}} hands on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> quite interested. 'You going away, Paul?' ...|$|E
60|$|Annabel put {{her hand}} {{suddenly}} to her throat and steadied herself with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b> She looked stealthily at Anna.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of Father Grogan {{standing}} at the side door to the church of Mission San Buenaventura, California, ca. 1904. His right hand is grasping the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wooden <b>chair.</b> The heavy wooden door is behind him. At his feet is the wooden bell which hung in the tower for a long time. A cross is visible in a decorative sconce above the door...|$|R
60|$|It was then, perhaps, {{a quarter}} to six, and the blinds were closely drawn and the house quite silent. The landing was a spacious one, a broad, richly-carpeted {{staircase}} went down {{into the darkness of}} the hall below, and before me a door ajar showed me a writing-desk, a revolving bookcase, the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> study <b>chair,</b> and <b>a</b> fine array <b>of</b> bound books, shelf upon shelf.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of pioneer stage driver B. B. Burch (Curley Dan), ca. 1890.

His hands are thrust {{into the pockets of}} the coat. His left elbow rests on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wooden <b>chair.</b> He has <b>a</b> beard, mustache, and light curly hair...|$|R
60|$|It excited George so {{much that}} he climbed up on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> {{to get a better view}} of it.|$|E
60|$|The {{young artist}} {{advanced}} {{to the table and}} took up the sketch. Chalmers half turned away, leaning upon the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|If agony had {{not caused}} Mr. Pilkington to clutch for support at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> he would {{undoubtedly}} have wrung his hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Beroofen!" [...] said Jimmy, {{touching}} the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his <b>chair.</b> <b>As</b> he did so, he met McEachern's eye, and smiled kindly at him. The ex-policeman {{was looking at}} him with the gaze <b>of</b> <b>a</b> baffled but malignant basilisk.|$|R

40|$|I 2 ̆ 7 m {{drunk in}} the bar car, deep in the spirit, sitting across from a toothless old cripple {{at one of the}} yellow tables bolted into the floor. He wears a black cowboy hat {{on his way back to}} Colorado after burying his {{grandson}} in California. We 2 ̆ 7 re staring sideways out the long train window.

60|$|Sabatini lit his cigarette, and, leaning {{slightly}} {{against the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> stood {{with folded arms}} looking at the picture over the fireplace.|$|E
60|$|Sir John frowned. Anna was unimpressed. Elegant, {{a little}} scornful, she leaned {{slightly}} against the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> and looked him steadily in the eyes.|$|E
60|$|The clerk half {{closed his}} eyes and steadied himself by {{grasping}} the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b> There was a lump in his throat in earnest now.|$|E
60|$|Hank was not {{the sort}} of man who makes {{universal}} appeal. Also, he was no ladies' man. He was long and lean and hard-bitten, and his supply of conventional small talk was practically non-existent. To get the best out of Hank, as has been said, you had to let him take his coat off and put his feet up on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second <b>chair</b> and reconcile yourself to the pestiferous brand of tobacco which he affected.|$|R
60|$|Will {{followed}} {{her at a}} little distance, {{and leaned against the}} tall <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> leather <b>chair,</b> on which he ventured now to lay his hat and gloves, and free himself from the intolerable durance of formality to which he had been for the first time condemned in Dorothea's presence. It must be confessed that he felt very happy at that moment leaning on the chair. He was not much afraid of anything that she might feel now.|$|R
60|$|She had, however, quickly retreated as he approached, ensconcing herself {{behind the}} high <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large antique <b>chair,</b> on the cushion {{of which she}} knelt. I regret to add also that she slapped his outstretched fingers a little sharply with her {{inevitable}} black fan as he still advanced.|$|R
