5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a glassy material known as faience, which they treated {{as a type of}} artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> up and used as a pigment.|$|E
5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the electrode, tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E
25|$|The {{roasted coffee}} beans may <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> at a roastery, {{in a grocery}} store, or in the home. Most coffee is roasted and ground at a roastery and sold in {{packaged}} form, though roasted coffee beans can <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> at home immediately before consumption. It is also possible, though uncommon, to roast raw beans at home.|$|E
50|$|During the {{following}} years, the Libyan MiG-25 fleet <b>was</b> <b>grounded,</b> lacking maintenance. As MiG-25 air-frames <b>were</b> <b>grounded</b> for several years, NATO attacks spared {{them during the}} Libyan Civil War (2011).|$|R

25|$|Raw wheat can <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> into flour or, using hard {{durum wheat}} only, can <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> into semolina; germinated and dried {{creating}} malt; crushed or cut into cracked wheat; parboiled (or steamed), dried, crushed and de-branned into bulgur {{also known as}} groats. If the raw wheat is broken into parts at the mill, as is usually done, the outer husk or bran can be used several ways. Wheat is a major ingredient in such foods as bread, porridge, crackers, biscuits, Muesli, pancakes, pies, pastries, cakes, cookies, muffins, rolls, doughnuts, gravy, beer, vodka, boza (a fermented beverage), and breakfast cereals.|$|E
50|$|Blue cornmeal {{is light}} blue or violet in color. It <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> from whole blue corn {{and has a}} sweet flavor. The cornmeal {{consists}} of dried corn kernels that have <b>been</b> <b>ground</b> into a fine or medium texture.|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} {{standard}} is for pin 1 to <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> and pin 4 to be 12 volts (nominal), with pins 2 and 3 unused.

There are other non-standard arrangements, particularly found on older equipment.|$|E
25|$|The seeds can <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> {{and mixed}} with salt, to produce celery salt. Celery salt {{can be made}} from an extract of the roots or using dried leaves.

50|$|Doc Daneeka uses Orr as an example, when {{explaining}} the grounding of the insane and “Catch-22”. Orr is insane for not requesting to <b>be</b> <b>grounded,</b> {{even though he}} is shot down every mission he flies. If he did request to <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> he would <b>be</b> considered sane for realising the risks of continuing to fly. The “Catch-22” is that you can only <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> if you request it, but by requesting it you are considered sane.|$|R

25|$|Coffee beans may <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> {{in several}} ways. A burr grinder uses {{revolving}} elements to shear the seed; a blade grinder cuts the seeds with blades moving at high speed; and {{a mortar and}} pestle crushes the seeds. For most brewing methods a burr grinder is deemed superior because the grind is more even and the grind size can be adjusted.|$|E
25|$|De-icing {{chemicals}} and sand can run off into roadsides, contaminate groundwater and pollute surface waters; and road salts can be toxic to sensitive plants and animals. Sand applied to icy roads can <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> up by traffic into fine particulates {{and contribute to}} air pollution. Sand can alter stream bed environments, causing stress for the plants and animals that live there.|$|E
25|$|In milling, the {{incoming}} graphite products and concentrates can <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> before being classified (sized or screened), with the coarser flake size fractions (below 8 mesh, 8–20 mesh, 20–50 mesh) carefully preserved, {{and then the}} carbon contents are determined. Some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions, each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. Custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. If flake size is unimportant, the concentrate can <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> more freely. Typical end products include a fine powder {{for use as a}} slurry in oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds, carbon raiser in the steel industry (Synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser). Environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder spillages leading to heavy metal contamination of soil.|$|E

25|$|Analysis {{shows that}} the rocks have been {{slightly}} altered by tiny amounts of water. Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe bromine compounds. All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder rinds of material.

25|$|The river {{has been}} used to power a number of mills over the centuries. The {{buildings}} or remains of five are still visible, and some still contain original machinery. Narborough Bone Mill had no road access, and bones from the whaling industry and from cemeteries in Hamburg were delivered by barge, to <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> into bone meal. The mill closed when the river was taken over, and just the mill wheel remains on the bank.|$|E
25|$|Raw rice may <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> into flour {{for many}} uses, {{including}} making {{many kinds of}} beverages, such as amazake, horchata, rice milk, and rice wine. Rice does not contain gluten, so is suitable for people on a gluten-free diet. Rice may also be made into various types of noodles. Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by raw-foodist or fruitarians if soaked and sprouted (usually a week to 30 days – gaba rice).|$|E

25|$|Although {{the best}} source of ALA is seeds, most seeds and seed oils are much richer in an n−6 fatty acid, {{linoleic}} acid. Exceptions include flaxseed (must <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> for proper nutrient absorption) and chia seeds. Linoleic acid is the other essential fatty acid, but it, and the other n−6 fatty acids, compete with n−3s for positions in cell membranes and have very different effects on human health. There is {{a complex set of}} essential fatty acid interactions.|$|E
25|$|Astrictions (banrechten): Tenants were {{required}} {{to make use of}} the infrastructure (mill, smith, oven, etc.) that was operated by the lord of the manor more or less as a business. A typical example of these astrictions was thirlage (banmolen): grain could only <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> at the lord's water mill or windmill. A toll, known as multure, for grinding corn at the manorial mill was paid to the lord (or to the miller who leased the mill from the lord).|$|E
25|$|Oyu Tolgoi {{will use}} both {{underground}} and {{open pit mining}} techniques. Initially the mine will process 70,000 tonnes of rock per day, ramping up to 85,000 tonnes from both the open pit and the underground mine (underground mining {{is to be done}} by block caving). The yield from the first phase of mining will <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> through one semi-autogenous grinding mill (SAG mill). Expansion to new underground areas will result in an additional increase of up to 140,000 tonnes per day with a possible increase to 170,000 tonnes per day.|$|E
