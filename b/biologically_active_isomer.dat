An X-ray crystal structure analysis of (−) -α- 9 -O-desmethyldihydrotetrabenazine gave an absolute structure of that compound as the 2 S, 3 S, 11 b S isomer. Therefore, (−) -α-dihydrotetrabenazine also has the 2 S, 3 S, 11 b S absolute configuration. (+) -α-Dihydrotetrabenazine, the single <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>isomer</b> from the metabolic reduction of tetrabenazine, thus has the absolute configuration of 2 R, 3 R, 11 b R. For further in vitro and in vivo studies of the vesicular monoamine transporter, {{it is now possible}} to use the single enantiomer of radiolabeled α-dihydrotetrabenazine.

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{and density}} functional theory (DFT) {{were used in}} thiswork for the structural characterisation of lycopene, the antioxidant carotenoid, and its complexes with two synthetic thermotropic cholesteric polyesters. Both polyesters were employed successfully to encapsulate the carotenoid lycopene (Lyc). Besides protecting it from oxidation, they induced the trans–cis isomerisation of lycopene towards the more <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> and bioavailable <b>isomer</b> cis-Lyc. The Raman spectra revealed changes mainly concerning the band ν 1 and bands of methyl groups. This would explain the interaction mechanism between lycopene and cholesteric polyesters, inducing structural changes in the carotenoid by formation of a cis C=C bond in central positions of the isomer chain and hydrophobic interaction that affects the side methyl groups. DFT calculations confirmed that the isomerisation occurs at central positions of lycopene molecule. The analysis of ν 1 and ν 2 bands and those of methyl groups in the calculated spectra of lycopene indicates that the interactionwith the synthetic cholesteric polyesters could mainly lead to the 13 -cis-Lyc isomer. The analysis of marker structural bands of the polyesters revealed structural changes in the host which mainly affect the ester groups, most probably due to a restructuring of the polyester chain to better accommodate the ligand.

40|$|Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid (CLA) is biologically active and has altered body composition in experimental animals. Dietary supplementation with synthetic CLA reduced body fat in {{mice and rats}} {{in a number of}} studies. The CLA used in previously published research contained mixed isomers, the majority of which were 9 cl 1 t-CLA and 10 t 12 c-CLA. The <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>isomer</b> at the time of starting the trials described in this thesis was assumed to be 9 cl 1 t-CLA, due to the prevalence of this isomer in biological tissues. The two trials in this thesis were designed to investigate the effect of dietary CLA on energy balance. In the first (refer Abstract, section 2. 1), synthetic CLA reduced body fat in male BALB/c mice in a dose response manner, over the range 0. 25 to 1. 0 % w/w CLA in the diet. High levels (1. 0 % and 2. 0 %) caused a reduction in growth. In the second (refer Abstract, section 3. 1) dietary treatments supplemented with synthetic CLA, or bovine CLA in milk fat, at levels similar to the 0. 25 % w/w synthetic CLA treatment found to be effective in reducing body fat in mice, had no effect on energy balance in female Sprague-Dawley rats. The CLA in milk fat contains approximately 86 % of the 9 cl 1 t-CLA isomer while synthetic CLA contains approximately 37 %. 9 cl 1 t-CLA and 46 % 10 t 12 c-CLA. Results from these two trials support recent evidence from research demonstrating 10 t 12 c-CLA is the <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>isomer,</b> in relation to energy metabolism and body composition. 9 cl 1 t-CLA is the prevalent isomer of CLA found in the human diet. The CLA used previously published research was chemically synthesised and contained a considerably higher proportion of 10 t 12 c-CLA then found in human food sources.

40|$|ADP and ATP, in the 1 - 100 microM {{range of}} concentrations, {{increased}} {{the formation of}} inositol phosphates in bovine aortic endothelial cells. The accumulation of inositol trisphosphate in response to adenine nucleotides was rapid (maximum at 15 s) and transient. This material was identified as the <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>isomer</b> inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate {{on the basis of}} its retention time by high-performance liquid chromatography on an anion-exchange resin. AMP and adenosine have no effect on inositol phosphates. The action of ATP and ADP was mimicked with an equal potency and activity by their phosphorothioate analogs, ATP gamma S and ADP beta S, and with a lower potency by adenosine 5 '-(beta,gamma-imido) triphosphate, whereas adenosine 5 '-(alpha,beta-methylene) triphosphate, was inactive. In the same range of concentrations, ADP and ATP induced an efflux of 45 Ca 2 + from prelabeled bovine aortic endothelial cells and increased the fluorescence emission by cells loaded with quin- 2. Here, too, AMP and adenosine were completely inactive. The outflow of 45 Ca 2 + induced by ADP was partially maintained in a calcium-free medium. These data suggest that in aortic endothelial cells, P 2 -purinergic receptors, of the P 2 Y subtype, are coupled to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate by a phospholipase C. It is likely that the release of prostacyclin and endothelium-derived relaxing factor in response to ADP and ATP is a consequence of this initial event. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Trabajo presentado en Joint Annual Meeting American Dairy Science Association (ADSA),celebrado en Quebec del 21 al 25 de julio de 2002. Conjugated {{linoleic}} acids (CLA) are {{a mixture}} of positional and ge- ometrical linoleic acid isomers, the predominant ones are (c 9 t 11) and 18 : 2 (t 10 c 12) (t 9 t 11). At each position the double bond can be ei- ther in the cis- or the trans- configuration. However, it is the cis- 9, trans- 11 -octadecadienoic acid (18 : 2 c 9 t 11) that {{is considered to be}} the most <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>isomer.</b> It is a naturally occurring fatty acid, present mainly in foodstuffs from animal sources. CLA is produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids by rumen microorganisms during biohydro- genation. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the ability of dif- ferent cultures of lactobacilli isolated from human intestinal sources to produce CLA. Four different cultures, two strains each of Lactobacillus acidophillus and Lactobacillus casei were tested for their ability to pro- duce CLA from free linoleic acid. Different concentrations of linoleic acid (0, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 5 mg/ml) were added to MRS broth and sterilized skim milk inoculated with the cultures of the lactobacilli, and incubated at 37 ◦ C. Samples were taken at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h. For each sample the amounts of individual isomers of CLAs (9 c 9 t 11, t 10 c 12, t 9 t 11) and total CLA (conjugated linoleic acid) were quantitated by gas liquid chro- matography. Growth in media containing 0. 2 % linoleic acid for 24 h was most effective in CLA production. All the cultures were able to convert linoleic acid in conjugated linoleic acid in broth media and milk with a concentration range of (90. 74 - 165. 37 μ g/ml) and (79. 54 - 143. 73 μ g/ml) respectively. Conjugated linoleic acids have been reported to induce beneficial physiological effects incl uding anticarcenogenic, inhibition of arteriosclerosis and enhancement of immunological function in different species. The use of lactic acid bacteria able to deconjugate linoleic acid might enrich dairy products with CLA contributing to these beneficial effects. Probiotic bacteria, such as the ones in this study, also might produce CLA in the intestinal tract following their ingestion. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Fresh {{isolated}} erythrocyte ghost membranes and erythrocyte suspensions were incubated with {{an organic}} hydroperoxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, {{to establish the}} in vitro oxidative stress models. Circulating erythrocytes from normal individuals were fractionated into subpopulations of different ages by ultracentrifugation and used as an in vivo model. In these models, membrane iPF 2 alpha-III content accumulation was proportional to oxidative stress and correlated with decreased membrane fluidity. In circulating erythrocytes, membrane iPF 2 alpha-III increased with age and inversely correlated with membrane fluidity only in the core region. Oxidative stress {{is involved in the}} pathophysiology {{of a wide variety of}} human diseases. Isoprostanes, a family of prostaglandin derivatives, are mainly derived from free radical peroxidation of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Measurement of F 2 -isoprostanes (F 2 -iPs) or one specific <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>isomer</b> (iPF 2 alpha-III) is considered to be a reliable lipid peroxidation marker in human diseases. However, the association observed between increased plasma/urine F 2 -iPs and diseases does not necessarily reflect tissue oxidative damages. Circulating erythrocytes, a tissue with limited biosynthetic capacity and poor repair mechanism, would offer a number of advantages for assessment of in vivo oxidative damages. In this thesis, human erythrocyte membrane iPF 2 alpha-III content was investigated as a new marker for in vivo oxidative stress assessment. Membrane fluidity was used as an indirect marker of cellular function. To use membrane iPF 2 alpha-III in a human disease with known oxidative stress burden, 49 Chinese patients on long-term haemodialysis and 31 healthy Chinese subjects were recruited. Both plasma and membrane iPF 2 alpha-III showed that haemodialysis patients had increased oxidative stress. Only membrane iPF 2 alpha-III, but not the conventional used plasma iPF 2 alpha-III, correlated with membrane fluidity. Furthermore, the significant inverse correlation between membrane iPF 2 alpha-III and the core region of membrane fluidity was observed for this group of patients too. Since membrane iPF 2 alpha-III was shown to provide a link between oxidative stress and erythrocyte function, it would be considered as a new marker of in vivo erythrocyte oxidative stress assessment.
