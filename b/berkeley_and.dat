5|$|Governance of the Jerseys {{also created}} {{problems}} for Andros. James had awarded the territory {{west of the}} Hudson River to proprietors John <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> George Carteret, and Berkeley had then deeded the western portion (which became known as West Jersey) to a partnership of Quakers. Berkeley had not transferred his proprietary rights to this group, and {{the exact nature of}} the rights James had given both <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> Carteret was disputed, in part because James believed that the second patent granted to him in 1674 overrode the earlier grants he had made to <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> Carteret.|$|E

5|$|Suillus spraguei has had {{a complex}} taxonomic history. Although the first {{specimen}} was originally collected in New England in 1856 by Charles James Sprague, a formal scientific description was not published until 1872 when Miles Joseph <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> Moses Ashley Curtis called it Boletus spraguei. In a publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named the species Boletus pictus. <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> Curtis had also described what they {{believed to be a}} new species—Boletus murraii—although this was later considered by Rolf Singer to be merely a younger version of their Boletus spraguei. Although Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, the date stamp on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> Curtis publication, thus establishing nomenclatural priority under the rules of fungal naming. However, in 1945 Singer reported that the name Boletus pictus was illegitimate because it was a homonym, already being used for a polypore mushroom described by Carl Friedrich Schultz in 1806. The name was officially switched to Suillus spraguei in 1986 (Otto Kuntze had previously transferred the taxon to Suillus in 1898).|$|E

5|$|Three {{fundamental}} documents had governed {{the territory}} {{now known as}} New Jersey. The first was the Concession and Agreement, which was written in 1665 by the colony's proprietors Lord John <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> Sir George Carteret, and included a provision granting religious freedom. After <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> Carteret sold New Jersey to the Quakers, the colony was split into West and East Jersey. Each had its own constitution: the West Jersey Constitution (1681) and the East Jersey Constitution (1683). The two were reunited in 1702 by Queen Anne.|$|E
5|$|Ashurbanipal was {{designed}} by Fred Parhad, an Iraqi-born artist of Assyrian descent.

5|$|In 1887, English mycologists Miles Joseph <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> Christopher Edmund Broome {{described}} {{a species of}} fungus they named Tympanis toomansis, collected from dead infructescences ("cones") of Banksia growing {{on the banks of}} the Tooma River in southern New South Wales, Australia. Its generic placement was a result of its resemblance to Tympanis, a genus in the family Helotiaceae of the Ascomycota.|$|E

5|$|Mycena californiensis is {{a species}} of fungus in the Mycenaceae family. It is a common and {{abundant}} species in the coastal oak woodlands of California, where it grows saprobically, feeding on the fallen leaves and acorns of various oak species. First described in 1860 by <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> Curtis, the species was collected four years earlier during an exploring and surveying expedition. It was subsequently considered a doubtful species by later Mycena researchers, until a 1999 publication validated the taxon. Mycena elegantula is considered a synonym.|$|E
5|$|Proposals {{to simplify}} the fare {{structure}} abound. A flat fare that disregards distance has been proposed, or simpler fare bands or zones. Either scheme would shift the fare-box recovery burden to the urban riders in San Francisco, Oakland and <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> away from suburban riders in East Contra Costa, Southern Alameda, and San Mateo Counties, where density is lowest, and consequently, operational cost is highest.|$|E
5|$|Several {{varieties}} of M.rotula have been described. Miles <b>Berkeley</b> <b>and</b> Moses Ashley Curtis named var. fuscus in 1869 for its brown cap. In 1887 Pier Andrea Saccardo described var. microcephalus from Italy, with caps half the normal size. It is now understood, however, that fruit body morphology is variable and dependent upon environmental conditions. Joseph Schröter described var. phyllophyla in 1889, but that taxon is now treated as Marasmius bulliardii.|$|E
