5|$|Many Metro {{stations}} were designed <b>by</b> <b>Chicago</b> architect Harry Weese, and {{are examples of}} late-20th century modern architecture. With their heavy use of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs, Metro stations display aspects of Brutalist design. The stations also reflect the influence of Washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults. Weese worked with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based lighting designer Bill Lam on the indirect lighting used throughout the system. All of Metro's original Brutalist stations are found in Downtown Washington, D.C. and neighboring urban corridors of Arlington, Virginia, while newer stations incorporate simplified cost-efficient designs.|$|E

Two blocks west along State Street, the Chicago 'L' rapid transit services the street via its Red Line. Pedestrian traffic abounds along the broad sidewalks that are shielded by extensive, mature greenery that provides much of the friendly atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Some {{observers}} consider Millennium Park {{to be the}} city's {{most important}} project since the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. It far exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150million. The final cost of $475million was borne <b>by</b> <b>Chicago</b> taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270million; private donors paid the rest, and assumed roughly half of the financial responsibility for the cost overruns. The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and cronyism. Many critics have praised the completed park.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 EP Instant 0 in the Universe was {{recorded}} in France, and was Stereolab's first release following Hansen's death. According to music journalist Jim DeRogatis, the EP marked a return to their earlier, harder sound—"free from the pseudo-funk moves and avant-garde tinkering that had been inspired <b>by</b> <b>Chicago</b> producer Jim O'Rourke". That year, Sadier's side-project, Monade, released its debut album Socialisme Ou Barbarie: The Bedroom Recordings. Both {{the name of the}} group and the title of the album are references to the work of Greek-French intellectual Cornelius Castoriadis.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} sound film {{created a new}} job market for writers of screen dialogue. Many {{newspaper}} journalists moved to California and became studio-employed screenwriters. This resulted {{in a series of}} fast-talking comedy pictures featuring newsmen. The Front Page, later re-made as the much less cynical and more sentimental post-Code His Girl Friday (1940), was adapted from the Broadway play <b>by</b> <b>Chicago</b> newsmen, and Hollywood screenwriters, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. It was based on Hecht's experiences working as a reporter for the Chicago Daily Journal.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, Edler was re-signed to a four-year, $13 million {{contract}} extension on 9 October 2008. The contract, a raise from his 2008–09 salary of $550,000, took into effect the following campaign. The following month, he missed two games sidelined with the flu. Later in the season, he recorded a personal best four-point game (one goal and three assists) in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks on 7 February 2009. He finished with 37 points, including a career-high ten goals. In the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs, Edler led all team defensemen with seven points in ten games as the Canucks were eliminated in the second round <b>by</b> <b>Chicago.</b> In his first few seasons in the NHL, Edler was often paired with veteran blueliner and countryman Mattias Öhlund, who he considered a mentor for him (Öhlund left the Canucks to free agency in the 2009 off-season and signed with the Tampa Bay Lightning).|$|E
5|$|Bell {{assembled}} the Stanley Professionals in Chicago in 1920, but he disbanded it prior to playing any {{games because of}} negative publicity received <b>by</b> <b>Chicago</b> due the Black Sox Scandal. He joined John Heisman's staff at Penn {{as an assistant coach}} in 1920, and Bell would remain there for several years. At Penn, he was well regarded as a football coach, and after its 1924 season, he drew offers for, but declined, head-coaching assignments at other universities. At least as early as 1926, his avocation was socializing and frequenting Saratoga Race Course, where he counted as friends Tim Mara, Art Rooney, and George Preston Marshall. In 1928, Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in protest over the emphasis of in-season scrimmages during practices by Lud Wray, a fellow assistant coach. Bell's resignation was accommodated {{prior to the start of}} the 1929 season.|$|E

Star defenceman King Clancy was sold to Toronto for an {{unprecedented}} $35,000 and two players on October 11, 1930. The team fell into last place {{for the first time}} since 1898. In 1931, a potential deal arose with the owners of Chicago Stadium, including grain magnate James E. Norris, who wanted to move the team to Chicago, but the deal was vetoed <b>by</b> <b>Chicago</b> Black Hawks owner Frederic McLaughlin who did not want another team in his territory. Norris bought the bankrupt Detroit Falcons instead and turned them into the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E

5|$|Hutson's first catch as a {{professional}} was on an 83-yard touchdown pass from Herber on the first play from scrimmage against the Chicago Bears, {{in the second game}} of the 1935 season. It was the only score of the game as the Packers won 7–0. He caught six touchdowns total in his rookie season, which led the league. It was the first in a string of four straight seasons and nine seasons total that Hutson led the league in touchdown receptions. The next season the Packers won their fourth league title, with a 21–6 win over the Boston Redskins in the 1936 NFL Championship Game. Hutson scored the first touchdown of the game, on a 48-yard pass from Herber in the first quarter. Hutson completed the season with 34 receptions for 536 yards and eight touchdowns, which were all league records, and helped Herber set the NFL season passing yards record. Hutson's yardage record was broken the next season <b>by</b> <b>Chicago</b> Cardinals receiver Gaynell Tinsley, who challenged Hutson {{over the next few years}} for the title of best receiver in the NFL.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{building}} underwent an extensive $20million renovation directed <b>by</b> <b>Chicago</b> architect Gunny Harboe, whose restoration work included Loop landmarks the Rookery Building and Reliance Building. The project included {{restoration of the}} main lobby to emphasize the design features of the art deco era, elevator modernization, façade renovation and cleaning, and the continued renovation of upper floor corridors and hallways. Though impractically small for modern use, mailboxes in the lobby were restored to their original condition to follow the theme of vertical lines found throughout the complex. An improved electrical infrastructure, with ten main feeds from seven different Commonwealth Edison electrical substations, was added in addition to redundant cooling systems and upgraded telecommunications capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{the state}} {{passed a law}} authorizing the Illinois Torture Inquiry Relief Commission, to {{investigate}} cases related to convictions of people claiming to have been tortured by Burge and his officers and given coerced confessions, {{to see if there}} was evidence for judicial review and relief. It started to receive cases in 2011. Seventeen cases have been referred to the circuit court and three men freed by April 2016. Another 130 similar cases of torture <b>by</b> <b>Chicago</b> police have been claimed, beyond the scope of Burge and his cohort. The sponsors are trying to have the bill amended to accommodate these victims. In 2015 the City of Chicago announced that it has established a $5.5 million fund for reparations to victims of torture by Burge, and to aid their families. By that time, the city had paid more than $57 million to victims of Burge and his cohort, and another $50 million for defense of the officers.|$|E
