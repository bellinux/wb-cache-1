40|$|Before 1975 turbine <b>blade</b> <b>damper</b> {{designs were}} based on {{experience}} and very simple mathematical models. Failure of the dampers to perform as expected showed the need {{to gain a better}} understanding of the physical mechanism of friction dampers. Over the last 10 years research on friction dampers for aeronautical propulsion systems has resulted in methods to optimize damper designs. The first-stage turbine blades on the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) high-pressure oxygen pump have experienced cracking problems due to excessive vibration. A solution is to incorporate a well-designed friction dampers to attenuate blade vibration. The subject study, a cooperative effort between NASA Lewis and Carnegie-Mellon University, represents an application of recently developed friction damper technology to the SSME high-pressure oxygen turbopump. The major emphasis was the contractor's design known as the two-piece damper.

40|$|Turbomachinery blades {{are subject}} to {{aerodynamic}} forces {{that can lead to}} high-cycle-fatigue (HCF) failures. These failures will only increase as engineers begin to design blades without shrouds or as integrally bladed disks (blisks).

Also, it is difficult to design dampers for the engine environment with its extremely high centrifugal loads and high temperatures.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to conduct a parametric investigation on the aeromechanic stability of modern bearingless rotors. To ensure aeromechanic stability, modem bearingless; rotors use elastomeric dampers to augment the <b>blade</b> inplane <b>damping.</b> The augmented dampers are necessary to avoid aeromechanic instabilities such as air and ground resonance on soft-inplane rotors. The prevention of air and ground resonance depends largely on the damping level of the rotor-fuselage system during the critical frequency-crossing between the rotor and the fuselage inplane motions. The <b>blade</b> inplane <b>damping,</b> critical in ensuring aeromechanic stability of a rotor, depends {{not only on the}} damper sizes but also on the aeroelastic properties of the rotor blade.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the use of {{photogrammetry}} for the experimental identification of structural and inertial properties of helicopter rotor blades 4. The identification procedure is based upon theoretical/numerical algorithms for the evaluation of mass and flexural stiffness distributions which are an extension of those proposed in the past by Larsen, whereas the torsional properties (stiffness and shear center position) are determined through the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. The identification algorithms require the knowledge of the blade displacement field produced by known steady loads. These data are experimentally obtained through photogrammetric detection technique, which allows the identification of 3 D coordinates of labeled points (markers) on the structure through the correlation of 2 D digital photos. Indeed, the displacement field is simply evaluated by comparing the markers positions on the loaded configuration with those on the reference one. The proposed identification procedure, numerically and experimentally validated in the past by the authors, has been here applied to the structural characterization of two main rotor blades, designed for ultra-light helicopters.

40|$|Abstract—-Emerging blade {{technologies}} {{are finding it}} increasingly essential to correlate blade vibrations to blade fatigue {{in order to assess}} the residual life of existing blading and for development of newer designs. In this paper an analytical code for dynamic stress analysis and fatigue life prediction of blades is presented. The life prediction algorithm is based on a combination method, which combines the local strain approach to predict the initiation life and fracture mechanics approach to predict the propagation life, to estimate the total fatigue life. The conventional stress based approach involving von Mises theory along with S-N-Mean stress diagram suffers from the drawback that it does not make allowance for the possibility of development of plastic strain zones, especially in cases of low cycle fatigue.

Blade loading was accomplished in {{a new type of}} <b>blade</b> <b>damping</b> test rig and damping was evaluated in the lowest tangential and axial blade modes. The test environment was room temperature air. The damping rig concept and development is presented in detail as well as results of an intensive test program. The blade designs are designated as Types A, B, and C, where Types A and B were of a fir tree root design and Type C was a ball and shank design. A total of 86 blades were tested and the influence of vibration amplitude, applied axial (simulated centrifugal) load, and vibration mode on damping logarithmic decrement was studied. For the designs studied, the most important findings were: a) Logarithmic decrement was inversely related to blade centrifugal load. High centrifugal loads resulted in low damping ratios. b) Logarithmic decrements varied in an almost linear manner with vibration amplitude for most tests. Constant logarithmic decrement conditions were not observed. c) The damping test rig worked well in this test series. Long LP blades may cause problems without some design changes. d) Results were highly reproducable per each blade group tested. Typical scatter was observed when comparing the results of one blade group to another. e) Changing the initial excitation amplitude did not cause any changes in the vibration decay.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Fundamental Aeronautics program, {{researchers}} at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) are investigating new technologies supporting the development of lighter, quieter, and more efficient fans for turbomachinery applications. High performance fan blades designed to achieve such goals will be subjected {{to higher levels of}} aerodynamic excitations which could lead to more serious and complex vibration problems. Piezoelectric materials have been proposed as a means of decreasing engine blade vibration either through a passive damping scheme, or as part of an active vibration control system. For polymer matrix fiber composite blades, the piezoelectric elements could be embedded within the blade material, protecting the brittle piezoceramic material from the airflow and from debris. To investigate this idea, spin testing was performed on two General Electric Aviation (GE) subscale composite fan blades in the NASA GRC Dynamic Spin Rig Facility. The first bending mode (1 B) was targeted for vibration control. Because these subscale blades are very thin, the piezoelectric material was surface-mounted on the blades. Three thin piezoelectric patches were applied to each blade two actuator patches and one small sensor patch. These flexible macro-fiber-composite patches were placed in a location of high resonant strain for the 1 B mode. The blades were tested up to 5000 rpm, with patches used as sensors, as excitation for the blade, and as part of open- and closed-loop vibration control. Results show that with a single actuator patch, active vibration control causes the damping ratio to increase from a baseline of 0. 3 % critical damping to about 1. 0 % damping at 0 RPM. As the rotor speed approaches 5000 RPM, the actively controlled <b>blade</b> <b>damping</b> ratio decreases to about 0. 5 % damping. This occurs primarily because of centrifugal blade stiffening, and can be observed by the decrease in the generalized electromechanical coupling with rotor speed...|$|R
