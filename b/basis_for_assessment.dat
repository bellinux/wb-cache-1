40|$|Researchers {{and society}} devote {{increasing}} interest to environmental impact assessments. The study here discusses and questions current assessment models by relating them to inter-organizational network analyses, and demonstrates that single entities as the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> environmental impact <b>assessments</b> {{may not be}} {{in the best interests of}} society. Three case studies focusing on logistical solutions illustrate environmental effects on a single-entity and a network level. The paper concludes that considering environmental impacts on a single-entity level disregards indirect effects, which in turn has consequences for the environment. The paper points to the importance of identifying the appropriate level for analysis of environmental impacts since the single entity as the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>assessments</b> may undermine environmentally friendly intentions.
