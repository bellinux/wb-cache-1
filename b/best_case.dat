In a <b>best</b> <b>case</b> scenario using a 240 V charger on a 90 A circuit breaker, Tesla documents a recharging rate of -of-range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require just under 4 hours. The slowest charging rate using a 120V outlet on a 15 A circuit breaker would add -of-range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{consider}} the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort. This solves {{the problem of}} sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time O(n2) for this case. If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(n log n). The <b>best</b> <b>case</b> occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(n log n) time.|$|E
25|$|Holý's field {{experience}} among the Berti people of Pakistan {{allowed him to}} undertake an extensive study of cousin marriage in their culture. Holý believed {{that many of his}} findings could generalize to other Middle Eastern groups. He noted that stated reasons for cousin marriage could be both pragmatic and symbolic. Stated pragmatic reasons for cousin marriage might be stated in terms of advantages for the husband such as warmer relations with his father-in-law, quicker entertainment of the husband's family by the wife {{in the case of a}} visit due to them being her relations, greater loyalty and devotion of the wife, and the ease of regaining a wife after a serious quarrel where she has withdrawn to the house of her own family. Stated pragmatic reasons for the parents included gaining access to the labor of a daughter's children by marrying her to a kinsman and thereby keeping her family close by, increased attentiveness on the part of a wife to her aging in-laws if she is related to them, and the ease of marital negotiations if the parents are brothers, or in the next <b>best</b> <b>case,</b> if the mother of one child is the sister of the father of the other child.|$|E

25|$|The {{assault craft}} {{departed}} from Olterra {{during the early}} hours of 8 December. At 2:15 AM, the first human torpedo reached the area of the boom defences. The motor launches and sentries inside the British base were quietly active and alert, conscious of the danger of a potential attack on the fleet at anchor. One of the security measures taken by the Royal Navy after the summer incursions of combat swimmers was the deployment at Gibraltar of an underwater bomb disposal unit, under the command of Lieutenant Lionel Crabb. A pattern of depth charges was dropped by the motor barges at an interval of three minutes. The craft of Visintini and Magro was apparently hit by one of the charges and destroyed when they were trying to find a breach in the steel net protecting the harbour. Their bodies were recovered by the British some days later and buried at sea with full honors. The second “pig” also endured the strong response of British defences after being uncovered by a searchlight. After a long chase by anti-submarine boats, the Italian crew decided to scuttle their craft and took shelter on board an American freighter. They discarded their swimsuits before submitting themselves to Gibraltar authorities. The last manned torpedo was {{caught in the middle of}} the general alarm across the stronghold, but managed to slip beneath the waters and fool the submarine chasers. The copilot, Leone, became missing during the pursuit and was never found; Cella, meanwhile, abandoned the craft elsewhere, thinking that he was still near Gibraltar or, in the <b>best</b> <b>case,</b> stranded close to the Spanish coast. With the idea of becoming a prisoner of war or being arrested and interned by Spanish authorities in mind, Cella surfaced, only to find that he was just a few meters away from Olterra. His torpedo was recovered by the Italians the following day. The two divers captured by the British told their interrogators that the attack was launched by submarine, successfully deceiving Allied intelligence. Nevertheless, the first human torpedoes mission ended in failure.|$|E

They found an average reduction in the range at which the ship could be seen at night from another ship of around 25% using binoculars, 33% using the naked eye; the results from the air were less conclusive. The <b>best</b> <b>case</b> was on the exceptionally clear moonless night of 29/30 January 1942, when Largs could be seen from a surface ship with the naked eye at [...] unlighted, but only [...] with her diffused lighting, a 57% reduction.|$|E

By November 2014, initial capabilities still had not been decided on, with recommendations to be made across 2015.

500|$|On average, {{assuming}} that each element is equally {{likely to be}} searched, the procedure will most likely find the target value the second-deepest level of the tree. This is equivalent to a binary search that completes one iteration before the worst case, reached after [...] iterations. However, the tree may be unbalanced, with the deepest level partially filled. Equivalently, the array may not be divided exactly in half by the search in some iterations, half of the time resulting in the smaller subarray being eliminated. This cannot occur if {{the size of the}} array is one less than a power of two, but otherwise the actual number of average iterations is slightly higher, at [...] iterations.

Also note that a comparison sort cannot use less than [...] comparisons on average to sort [...] items (as explained in the article Comparison sort) and in case of large , Stirling's approximation yields , so quicksort is not much worse than an ideal comparison sort. This fast average runtime is another reason for quicksort's practical dominance over other sorting algorithms.|$|E

The achievable economic objective is highly uncertain due to the varying economic conditions and the limited knowledge of the reservoir model parameters.
