50|$|Magnetic {{particle}} brakes {{are unique}} in their design from other electro-mechanical brakes {{because of the}} wide operating torque range available. Like an electro-mechanical <b>brake,</b> <b>torque</b> to voltage is almost linear; however, in a magnetic particle <b>brake,</b> <b>torque</b> can be controlled very accurately (within the operating RPM range of the unit). This makes these units ideally suited for tension control applications, such as wire winding, foil, film, and tape tension control. Because of their fast response, {{they can also be}} used in high cycle applications, such as magnetic card readers, sorting machines and labeling equipment.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic braking and regenerative braking system. The <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> distribution strategy is proposed based on the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> and the regenerative braking system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque,</b> a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> required for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions are classified as the emergency braking and the normal braking. In the case of emergency braking, the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is to be equal to the overall maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> In the case of normal braking, the command <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is chosen as the smaller one between the overall maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> and the command <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good braking performance when the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is smaller than the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system, the whole <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> can be provided by the regenerative braking system; when the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is bigger than the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system, the whole <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> can be provided by both the hydraulic braking system and the regenerative braking system, while the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time. Both fuzzy rule-based scheduling and robust control approaches will be applied to achieve the above proposed distribution strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by numerical simulations under various road conditions, vehicle speeds, driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions, and the battery SOCs...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{advantages}} of the electric motor such as fast and precise torque response, the performance of the electric vehicle (EV) can be improved. During braking or driving on the cornering, the vehicle will over steer or under steer if a car turns by more or less than the amount commanded by the driver. To improve the stability of the small EV with four in-wheel motors, the differential regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> control is proposed. In this system, the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> at each wheel will be controlled individually based on the value of slip ratio. If the slip ratio is greater than the optimum value, the regenerative brake will turn off. In this situation, the electric motor will not produce the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> Conversely, if the slip ratio lower than the optimum value, the regenerative brake will turn on and the electric motor will generate the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> In the numerical analysis, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the road condition is set to an icy road on the left tire and dry asphalt on the right tire. From the simulation results, the differential regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> control can prevent the tire from lock-up and avoid the vehicle from skidding...|$|R

Several configurations of MR brake is proposed such as disc-type, serpentine-type and hybrid-type. After {{the configuration}}s of the MR brakes are proposed, <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the <b>brakes</b> is analyzed based on Bingham rheological model of the MR fluid.

5000|$|Power off brakes stop or hold a load when {{electrical}} power is either accidentally lost or intentionally disconnected. In the past, {{some companies have}} referred to these as [...] "fail safe" [...] brakes. These brakes are typically used on or near an electric motor. Typical applications include robotics, holding brakes for Z axis ball screws and servo motor brakes. Brakes are available in multiple voltages and can have either standard backlash or zero backlash hubs. Multiple disks {{can also be used}} to increase <b>brake</b> <b>torque,</b> without increasing brake diameter. There are 2 main types of holding brakes. The first is spring applied brakes. The second is permanent magnet brakes.|$|E
5000|$|Various brake designs such as band {{brakes and}} many drum brakes are self-assisting: when the brake is applied, {{some of the}} braking force feeds back into the brake {{mechanism}} to further self-apply the brake. This is called [...] "positive feedback" [...] or [...] "self-servo". Self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply the brake, but exaggerates fade, since a reduction in pad friction material height or thickness also reduces pad force. In contrast, for a brake without self-assist, such as a conventional disc brake, a loss of pad friction material {{does not change the}} pad force, so there is no necessary loss in the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> reaction for a given amount of input force.|$|E

40|$|Eddy current brake (ECB) is an {{attractive}} contactless brake whereas it suffers from <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> attenuation when the rotating speed increases. To stabilize the ECB’s torque generation property, this paper introduces the concept of anti-magneto-motive force to develop the ECB model on the fundamental of magnetic circles. In the developed model, the eddy current demagnetization {{and the influence of}} temperature which make the <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> attenuation are clearly presented. Using the developed model of ECB, the external and internal characteristics of the ECB are simulated through programming by MATLAB. To find the sensibility of the influences on ECB’s torque generation stability, the stability indexes are defined and followed by a sensibility analysis on the internal parameters of an ECB. Finally, this paper indicates that (i) the stability of ECB’s torque generating property could be enhanced by obtaining the optimal combination of “demagnetization speed point and the nominal maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> ” (ii) The most remarkable influencing factor on the shifting the demagnetization speed point of ECB was the thickness of the air-gap.

50|$|Water has a {{very high}} heat of vaporization. As the ambient {{temperature}} water is injected into the engine, heat transfers from the hot cylinder head and intake air into the water. This makes it evaporate, cooling the intake charge. A cooler intake charge means it is more dense (higher volumetric efficiency) and also has a lower tendency to knock. However, the water vapor displaces some air, negating some of the denser intake charge benefit. Knocking is generally {{more of a problem}} in forced induction engines rather than naturally aspirated, so this can help prevent it. On electronic ignition systems the ignition timing is generally retarded to prevent knock from occurring but with water injection it can be advanced closer to maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> (MBT) timing for additional power.|$|E
50|$|The {{engines of}} the F103 series were a {{development}} of Daimler-Benz {{for a military}} project that never came into being. They were dubbed the Mitteldruckmotor (medium-pressure engines) because of their unusually high BMEP (mean effective pressure, as calculated from <b>brake</b> <b>torque)</b> values, {{which led to a}} good thermodynamic efficiency. The engines had spiral-formed intake channels that gave the fuel-air mixture a good swirl. The engine had Heron-type combustion chambers with broad squish bands, further enhancing the mixture swirl and aiding good combustion. These features made it possible to use very high compression ratios for the time. The initial engine version had a CR of 11.2 to 1 for 98 RON fuel and even the engines intended for 92 RON fuel had a CR of 9 to 1, which was a very unusually high value for the time.|$|E

Figure 10 shows that the <b>brake</b> <b>torque,</b> {{in the case of}} a constant compression ratio, changes between 281 and 252 N.m passing through a maximum of 295 N.m at about 1, 900 rpm. For the variable compression ratio, the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> is kept constant at its maximum value of 295 N.m over a speed ranging from 1, 500 to 2, 460 rpm by varying the compression ratio between 16.4 and 19.3. This means that the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> increases by 5.4 % at 1, 500 rpm and 4.6 % at 2, 460 rpm. The shown variation trend in compression ratio urges that actual variation in compression ratio should be considered to increase the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> to its constant maximum value.|$|E

40|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> of a direct-{{injection}} {{diesel engine}} {{is known to}} plateau over a range of injection timings. Injection timing affects the engine?s ignition delay and the fractions of fuel which burn in premixed and diffusion modes. Therefore, the characteristics of combustion for swept injection timings along the maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> plateau are determined. The research is conducted by varying injection timing at constant engine speed and load while measuring engine emissions and in-cylinder pressure, revealing the premixed and diffusion burn fractions as well as important engine and exhaust design criteria such as maximum in-cylinder pressure and exhaust composition. These results are significant in diesel engine design because cheaper, lighter engines may be built if desired maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> may be produced with lower peak in-cylinder pressures. More critically, different emissions composition profiles exist for the desired maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque,</b> which will allow designers to choose injection calibrations which favor some emissions over others.
