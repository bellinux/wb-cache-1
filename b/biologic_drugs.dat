2500|$|Before {{a company}} can market a generic drug, it needs to file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the Food and Drug Administration, seeking to {{demonstrate}} therapeutic equivalence to a previously approved [...] "reference-listed drug" [...] and proving that it can manufacture the drug safely and consistently. [...] For an ANDA to be approved, the FDA requires the bioequivalence of a generic drug to be between 80% and 125% of the innovator product. (This range {{is part of a}} statistical calculation, and does not mean that generic drugs are allowed to differ from their brand-name counterparts by up to 25 percent.) The FDA evaluated 2,070 studies conducted between 1996 and 2007 that compared the absorption of brand-name and generic drugs into a person’s body. The average difference in absorption between the generic and the brand-name drug was 3.5 percent, comparable to the difference between two batches of a brand-name drug. [...] Non-innovator versions of <b>biologic</b> <b>drugs,</b> or biosimilars, require clinical trials for immunogenicity in addition to tests establishing bioequivalency. These products cannot be entirely identical because of batch-to-batch variability and their biological nature, and they are subject to extra rules.|$|E

Following the experimental procedure, S 100 A 9 concentrations were analysed with respect to EULAR response. Results. No evidence of association between S 100 A 9 concentration and EULAR response to the TNF-inhibitor <b>biologic</b> <b>drug</b> etanercept was observed following multinomial logistic regression analysis (non-responder vs moderate responder, P = 0. 957; and non-responder vs good responder, P = 0. 316).

50|$|The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act {{was signed}} into law in March 2010 to {{encourage}} the development of generic drug competition as a cost containment measure for high-priced pharmaceuticals. Part of the government’s signatory Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it has created a pathway for fast-track licensure for biological products that are shown to be ‘biosimilar’ to, or ‘interchangeable’ with, an approved biological product. One inspiration for the act was that the patents for many <b>biologic</b> <b>drugs</b> will expire in the next decade.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{analyze the}} {{clinical}} {{relevance of the}} levels of TNFα blockers and anti-drug antibodies (anti-drug Ab) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) treated with adalimumab (ADA), etanercept (ETA), or infliximab (INF) for a prolonged period of time. Methods. Clinical characteristics (disease activity, and adverse events), serum TNFα blockers, and anti-drug Ab levels were evaluated in 62 RA and 81 SpA patients treated with TNFα blockers for a median of 28 months. Results. Anti-ADA Ab were detected in 1 (4. 0 %) and anti-INF Ab in 14 out of 57 (24. 6 %) RA and SpA patients. Patient with anti-ADA Ab and 57. 1 % patients with anti-INF Ab were considered nonresponders to treatment. Anti-ETA Ab were not found in any of 61 ETA treated patients. Anti-ADA and anti-INF Ab levels differ between responders and nonresponders (P> 0. 05). Three (5. 3 %) patients with high serum anti-INF Ab levels developed infusion related reactions. Patients with anti-INF Ab more often required changing to another <b>biologic</b> <b>drug</b> (OR 11. 43 (95 % CI 1. 08 – 120. 93)) and treatment discontinuation (OR 9. 28 (95 % CI 1. 64 – 52. 52)). Conclusion. Patients not responding to treatment had higher serum anti-ADA and anti-INF Ab concentrations. Anti-INF Ab formation is related to increased risk of infusion related reactions, changing to another <b>biologic</b> <b>drug,</b> and treatment discontinuation...|$|R
