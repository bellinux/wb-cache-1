40|$|A new {{approach}} to the synthesis of polymer beads that give surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) is reported. Controlling the aggregation of silver nanoparticles by silica seeding prior to encapsulation into a polymer is shown to yield a highly reproducible bead with a relative standard deviation (RSD) diameter down to 5 %. The reliable and intense SERRS response is attributed to the combined resonance of the reporter dye (435 nm) and the nanoparticle cluster (440 nm). The presence of heavier clustered particles within the <b>bead</b> <b>core</b> means the activity can be further improved to around 93 % by means of sedimentation purification. This is a significant step towards a reproducible and reliable reporter unit for the many varied potential biodiagnostic applications of SERRS...|$|E
40|$|Novel hybrid gel beads with a {{well defined}} and {{controlled}} size formed by alginate biopolymer and halloysite (Hal) nanotubes were designed, prepared and characterized from the physico-chemical viewpoint. The thermogravimetry {{made it possible}} to determine the water content, the total as well as the local compositions of Hal into the gel beads. Dielectric spectroscopy evidenced that Hal reduced the fluctuation of ions. The SEM micrographs showed that the dried beads exhibit a rough surface, with pores in the micrometer range. In addition, the concentration of nanotubes was higher into the <b>bead</b> <b>core</b> at a higher overall loading. The performance of these materials was verified with the specific purpose of adsorbing crystal violet from aqueous phase.

40|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC) relies {{exclusively on}} intraparticle diffusion to separate solutes of different molecular sizes and shapes. Thus, its feed volume {{can only be}} {{a small fraction of}} the column volume. Much larger columns are required for SEC than other forms of liquid chromatography. Becasue of this, SEC often employs less expensive soft gels in large-scale applications to reduce costs. Excessive bed compression forces engineers to use pancake-shaped columns instead of more desirable slim columns during scale-up. Cored beads have impenetrable rigid cores that result in lower pressure drops and better pressure resistance. They also provide sharper peaks due to shortened radial distance for diffusion. Using a new general rate model for SEC with <b>cored</b> <b>beads,</b> this work demonstrated that <b>cored</b> <b>beads</b> performed better than fully-porous beads for myoglobin and ovalbumin separation through computer simulation.

Experiments are repeated for a single sintered glass <b>bead</b> <b>core</b> using three different non-wetting phase fluids, and varying concentrations of surfactants, to explore and separate the effects of interfacial tension, viscosity, and fluid flow rate. Analysis of the data demonstrates distinct and consistent differences in the amount of initial (i. e. following CO 2 injection) and residual (i. e. following flood or WAG scheme) non-wetting phase occupancy as a function of fluid properties and flow rate. Further experimentation and analysis is needed, but these preliminary results indicate trends that can guide design of injection scenarios such that both initial and residual trapped gas occupancy is optimized...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} a {{sintered}} glass <b>bead</b> <b>core</b> to simulate the spaces and surfaces of reservoir rock in studies of the bacterial plugging phenomenon that affects waterflood oil recovery operations. The passage of pure or mixed natural populations of bacteria through this solid matrix was initially seen to promote the formation of adherent bacterial microcolonies on available surfaces. Bacteria within these microcolonies produced huge amounts of exopolysaccharides and coalesced to form a confluent plugging biofilm that eventually caused a > 99 % decrease in core permeability. Aerobic bacteria developed a plugging biofilm on the inlet face of the core, facultative anaerobes plugged throughout the core, and dead bacteria did not effectively plug the narrow (33 -μm) spaces of this solid matrix because they neither adhered extensively to surfaces nor produced the extensive exopolysaccharides characteristic of living cells. The presence of particles in the water used in these experiments rapidly decreased the core permeability because they became trapped in the developing biofilm and accelerated the plugging of pore spaces. Once established, cells within the bacterial biofilm could be killed by treatment with a biocide (isothiazalone), but their essentially inert carbohydrate biofilm matrix persisted and continued to plug the pore spaces, whereas treatment with 5 % sodium hypochlorite killed the bacteria, dissolved the exopolysaccharide biofilm matrix, and restored permeability to these plugged glass bead cores...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{starvation}} on bacterial penetration through artificial rock cores were examined. Klebsiella pneumoniae was starved {{in a simple}} salts solution for a duration of up to 4 weeks. These cell suspensions were injected into sintered glass <b>bead</b> <b>cores,</b> and the resulting reductions in core permeabilities were recorded. Vegetative cell cultures of K. pneumoniae grown in a sodium citrate medium were injected into other, similar cores, and the reductions in core permeabilities were recorded. The starved cell suspensions did not completely block the core pores, whereas the vegetative cultures reduced core permeability to less than 1 %. Scanning electron microscopy of core sections infiltrated with either vegetative or starved cells showed that the former produced shallow “skin” plugs and copious amounts of glycocalyx at the inlet face, whereas the latter produced very little glycocalyx and the cells were distributed evenly throughout {{the length of the}} core. The use of a DNA assay to produce a cell distribution profile showed that, compared with the vegetative cells, starved bacteria were able to penetrate deeper into the cores. This was due to the smaller size of the cells and the reduction in biofilm production. This ability of starved bacteria to penetrate further into cores than the normal-size vegetative cells can be usefully applied to selective plugging for enhanced oil recovery. To further test the suitability of starved cells for use in selective plugging, the activities of starved cells present within cores were monitored before and after nutrient stimulation. Our data indicate that with nutrient stimulation, the starved cells lose their metabolic dormancy and produce reductions in core permeability due to cell growth and polymer production...|$|R

40|$|Charlie Lake Cave (HbRf 39) is a {{stratified}} site {{in northeastern}} British Columbia, Canada, containing a flutedpoint component {{at the base}} of the excavated deposits. The small artifact assemblage includes a fluted point, stone <b>bead,</b> <b>core</b> tool, and retouched flake. A diverse associated fauna includes fish, birds, and mammals, indicating a more open environment than exists today. Radiocarbon dates suggest that the artifact assemblage was deposited about 10, 500 years ago.   Article Summary by Jonathan C. Driver, May 2015             This was the first major publication about Tse’K’wa and it focuses on what for many people was the most exciting find at the site – a very early occupation of so-called “Paleoindian” people.             There continues to be considerable debate about when the first people came to the Americas. In the 1980 ’s (and continuing today), the weight of evidence supports a long-held belief that the ancestors of the indigenous peoples of the Americas made their initial migration from somewhere in northeast Asia.   However, the timing of this movement, the context in which it occurred, and the date are still contentious. (It is, of course, a simplification to describe this as a single event. There is plenty of evidence for a number of major migrations across the Bering Strait, and it is likely that there was a flow of people and ideas in both directions over thousands of years).             In the 1980 ’s, as today, virtually all archaeologists agree that “Paleoindian” cultures dating to the end of the last glacial period (about 12, 000 BC) indicate a well-established population throughout the Americas by that time, although there is still considerable debate about when the first ancestors of Paleoindians arrived in the Americas.             While the way of life of these peoples must have varied across different environments found in North and South America, the most distinctive Paleoindian artifacts in North America are a kind of stone spear point, known as “fluted points”.   Fluted points were chipped from fine-grained rocks, such as chert, jasper and obsidian, and generally had a long, lanceolate outline. In order to fit the base of the point into the shaft of the spear, it was thinned by striking off some flakes that ran from the base towards the sharp tip, creating a shallow channel or “flute” on one or both surfaces of the stone spearpoint.             Fluted points have been found in association with extinct animals, most commonly woolly mammoth and extinct forms of bison, but also with horse and camel, primarily  in the central and western half of the USA. Due to different geological and soil conditions in eastern USA, most fluted point sites there do not preserve animal bone. In 1983 when a fluted point was found at Tse’K’wa, there was only one site in all of Canada where fluted points had been found in association with organic material that could be radiocarbon dated – at Debert, in Nova Scotia where charcoal in the soil provided some dates. Tse’K’wa was the first site in Canada that produced a fluted point in association with animal bones that had clearly been butchered by people – in this case an extinct form of bison – and the first site in Canada in which a fluted point was found at the bottom of a long sequence of later cultural periods. The unique soil conditions at the Tse 2 ̆ 7 K 2 ̆ 7 wa site have enabled archaeologists to use radio carbon dating on fluted points and animal remains to gain further insight into the lifestyles and timeline of early human occupation of Canada.             Also of significance was the location of Tse’K’wa just to the east of the Rockies. Archaeologists had proposed that one route into the Americas during the late ice age was between the Rocky Mountain glaciers to the west and the massive ice sheets that covered Canada to the east – this so-called “ice-free corridor” might have allowed early hunters to move from unglaciated areas of Siberia and Alaska into the vast uninhabited continents to the south of the ice. Although fluted points had been picked up from ploughed fields in BC and Alberta, before the excavations at Tse’K’wa none of them had been radiocarbon dated, and so it was difficult to relate them to known dates of glaciers and post-glacial landscapes...|$|E

We showed that the three model parameters optimised to fit the new model against experimental data (namely the thermal conductivity of the solid phase and the two Archie's exponents) are consistent with independent estimates. We also observed that the anisotropy of the effective thermal conductivity of the Callovo-Oxfordian clay-rock was mainly due to the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity of the solid phase...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we focus on}} the {{dynamics}} of macromolecular networks formed by end-linking identical polymer stars. The resulting macromolecular network can then be viewed as consisting of spacers which connect branching points (the cores of the stars). We succeed in analyzing exactly, in the framework of the generalized Gaussian model, the eigenvalue spectrum of such networks. As applications we focus on several topologies, such as regular networks and dendrimers; furthermore, we compare the results to those found for regular hyperbranched structures. In so doing, we also consider situations in which the <b>beads</b> of the <b>cores</b> differ from the beads of the spacers. The analytical procedure which we use involves an exact real-space renormalization, which allows to relate the star-network to a (much simpler) network, in which each star is reduced to its core. It turns out that the eigenvalue spectrum of the star-polymer structure consists of two parts: One follows in terms of polynomial equations from the relaxation spectrum of the corresponding renormalized structure, while the second part involves the motion of the spacer chains themselves. Finally, we show exemplarily the situation for copolymeric dendrimers, calculate their spectra, and from them their storage and the loss moduli. Comment: 15 pages, 11 eps-figures include...|$|R

Large numbers of stereocilia from bullfrog sacculi and semicircular canals were isolated by blotting onto coverglasses and were demembranated to expose the polar actin tracks of their cytoskeletal cores. Silica or polystyrene beads, coated with thick filaments of chicken skeletal muscle myosin, were added to this core preparation {{in the presence of}} ATP. Myosin-coated beads could reach some of the cores by diffusion alone, but the efficiency and precision of the assay were improved considerably by the use of "optical tweezers" (a gradient-force optical trap) to deposit the beads directly on the <b>cores.</b> <b>Beads</b> applied in this fashion bound and moved unidirectionally at 1 - 2 microns/s, escaping the retarding force of the trap. Actin filaments within the stereocilia are cross-linked by fimbrin, but this did not appear to interfere with the motility of myosin. Beads coated with optic-lobe kinesin were also tested for movement; these bound and moved unidirectionally at 0. 1 - 0. 2 microns/s when applied to microtubule-based kinociliary cores, but not when applied to actin-based stereociliary cores. Our results are consistent with, and lend support to, a model for hair cell adaptation in which a molecular motor such as myosin maintains tension on the mechanically gated transduction channels.

40|$|Purpose Faecal {{incontinence}} is a physically, psychologically {{and socially}} disabling condition.

Preliminary studies suggest the FENIX™ MSA is safe, but efficacy data is limited. Rigorous evaluation is required prior to widespread adoption. Method and design The SaFaRI trial is a National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) -funded UK multi-site, parallel group, randomised controlled, unblinded trial that will investigate {{the use of the}} FENIX™ MSA, as compared to SNS, for adult faecal incontinence resistant to conservative management. Twenty sites across the UK, experienced in the treatment of faecal incontinence, will recruit 350 patients randomised equally to receive either SNS or FENIX™ MSA. Participants will be followed-up at 2 weeks post-surgery and at 6, 12 and 18 months post-randomisation. The primary endpoint is success, as defined by device in use and ≥ 50 % improvement in the Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score (CCIS) at 18 months post-randomisation. Secondary endpoints include complications, quality of life and cost effectiveness. Discussion SaFaRI will rigorously evaluate a new technology for faecal incontinence, the FENIX™ MSA, allowing its safe and controlled introduction into current clinical practice.

Here, an endotoxin-free E. coli strain (ClearColi) was engineered to produce polyhydroxybutyrate <b>beads</b> displaying the <b>core</b> antigen on their surface (Beads-Core) and their immunogenicity was evaluated in BALB/c mice. Immunization with Beads-Core induced gamma interferon (IFN-γ) secretion and a functional T cell immune response against the HCV Core protein. With the aim to target broad T and B cell determinants described for HCV, Beads-Core mixed with HCV E 1, E 2, and NS 3 recombinant proteins was also evaluated in BALB/c mice. Remarkably, only three immunization with Beads-Core+CoE 1 E 2 NS 3 /Alum (a mixture of 0. 1 μg Co. 120, 16. 7 μg E 1. 340, 16. 7 μg E 2. 680, and 10 μg NS 3 adjuvanted in aluminum hydroxide [Alum]) induced a potent antibody response against E 1 and E 2 and a broad IFN-γ secretion and T cell response against Core and all coadministered antigens.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 An {{acceptable}} microparticulate {{diet for}} marine fish larvae {{may be defined}} as an artificial diet that contains, retains, and delivers the required nutrients to support survival and growth. Factors affecting ingestion rate of prey items by fish larvae include environmental factors such as light intensity, prey/background contrast, possible chemical cues, and co-feeding with live foods. The efficient addition of FAA (free amino acids) in microparticles, at concentrations {{similar to those found}} in live foods may reduce or eliminate the need for exogenous proteases and FAA from live feeds. Complex particles (CP), when coupled with optimization of environmental parameters, may result in ingestion of artificial diets at rates sufficient to support high survival and growth rates. Lipid spray beads (LSB) have shown promise in their ability to deliver low molecular weight water-soluble (LMWS) nutrients to marine fish larvae. Furthermore, ingestion and digestion of zein-bound complex particles (CP), with incorporated LSB, by fish larvae have been reported. Here we describe improvements in LSB technology as well as feeding conditions for the effective delivery of FAA to blue spotted goby larvae (Asterropteryx semipunctata). The FAA glycine was used as a model LMWS nutrient due to its high solubility in water.

40|$|We have {{prepared}} {{a new type}} of anion exchanger, which effectively discriminates between RNA and plasmid DNA. The material is based on a Sephacryl S- 500 HR matrix provided with quartenary amine anion-exchange groups. A distinguishing feature of the beads is that a thin (2 - 3 mum) outer layer of the beads lacks ion-exchange groups. In the synthesis of these beads the vinyl groups in the outer layer of vinylalkyl substituted Sephacryl S- 500 HR beads are reacted with bromine. The resulting layer of bromoalkyl groups are hydrolysed, creating an inert outer layer of hydroxyalkyl groups. Finally, bromination and trimethylamine reactions of the inner vinyl groups provide the <b>beads</b> with a <b>core</b> of cationic groups. Large plasmid molecules will not bind to such beads since they are too large to enter the pores and therefore cannot come into contact with the charged matrix in the inner parts of the beads. RNA and protein molecules present in a cleared lysate, on the other hand, readily enter the pores and become adsorbed. A two-column strategy was developed for plasmid purification (recombinant pBluescript, 5. 9 kilo base pairs, kbp). The first column was packed with the restricted access anion-exchanger beads (lid beads) and the second column with normal ion-exchange material (same ligand density as the lid beads). Diluted (3 x), cleared lysate was pumped through the tandem columns. The first column was subsequently disconnected from the system and the purified plasmid adsorbed on the second column was eluted in a concentrated form (6 x) and with 89 % recovery. The two-column procedure removed 99. 5 % of the RNA and 96 % of the proteins. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop extended release pellet formulations with pH-independent drug release for the weakly basic drug SAG / ZK. A strong pH-dependent solubility was observed because of the weakly basic nature of the drug substance. Pellets were prepared by extrusion / spheronization followed by film coating. Two methods were used to overcome the problem of pH-dependent drug release. Firstly, organic acids were added to the core formulation in order to lower the micro-environmental pH inside the pellet core and therefore to increase the solubility of the drug substance in media with higher pH-values. Secondly, layers of an insoluble extended release polymer and an enteric polymer were applied onto pellet cores in order to reach a pH-independent drug release by adjusting the polymer permeability contrary to the drug solubility. Coated pellet formulations with a 15 % (% w/w based on the core weight) fumaric acid content as pH-modifier showed pH-independent drug release. However, the drug release from coated pellets with a 15 % tartaric acid content stayed dependent on the pH of the medium. The drug release patterns of fumaric acid formulations were found to be mainly influenced by the pH-adjusting properties of the organic acid. In contrast, the increasing porosity of the core pellets mainly influenced the dissolution behavior of tartaric acid containing formulations. X-ray diffraction studies showed no recrystallisation or the formation of new salts of the active ingredient and the organic acid during the preparation of the <b>core</b> <b>beads.</b> Pellets coated with a first layer of an insoluble polymer (Kollicoat® SR 30 D) and a second layer of an enteric polymer (Kollicoat® MAE 30 DP) showed a pH-independent drug release.

An increase in drug release was reached by the addition of different osmotically active excipients to the core formulation. Pellet formulations with a 15 % (% w/w based on the core weight) content of ionic excipients as sodium chloride and potassium chloride and the nonionic excipient sucrose showed pH-independent drug release.

40|$|Objectives: One- and 2 -year {{evaluation}} of a feasibility trial (clinicaltrials. gov registration numbers NCT 01057992, NCT 01058070, and 01058564) to assess the safety and efficacy of a laparoscopically implanted sphincter augmentation device {{for the treatment of}} gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Methods: A sphincter augmentation device (LINX Reflux Management System; Torax Medical, Shoreview, MN), designed to prevent reflux due to abnormal opening of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), was laparoscopically implanted at the gastroesophageal junction in 44 patients. At baseline, all patients had abnormal esophageal acid exposure on 24 -hour pH monitoring and improved, but persistent, typical GERD symptoms while on acid suppression therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The device comprises a miniature string of interlinked titanium <b>beads,</b> with magnetic <b>cores,</b> placed around the gastroesophageal junction. The magnetic bond between adjacent beads augments sphincter competence. The beads temporarily separate to accommodate a swallowed bolus, allow belching or vomiting, and reapproximate to augment the LES in the closed position. Patients were evaluated after surgery by GERD Health-Related Quality of Life symptom score, PPI usage, endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24 -hour esophageal pH monitoring. Results: The total mean GERD Health-Related Quality of Life symptom scores improved from a mean baseline value of 25. 7 to 3. 8 and 2. 4 at 1 - and 2 -year follow-up, representing an 85 % and 90 % reduction, respectively (P < 0. 0001). Complete cessation of PPI use was reported by 90 % of patients at 1 year and by 86 % of patients at 2 years. Early dysphagia occurred in 43 % of the patients and self-resolved by 90 days. One device was laparoscopically explanted for persistent dysphagia without disruption of the anatomy or function of the cardia. There were no device migrations, erosions, or induced mucosal injuries. At 1 and 2 years, 77 % and 90 % of patients had a normal esophageal acid exposure.
