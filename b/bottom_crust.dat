40|$|To study {{reactivity}} in bread crust {{during the}} baking {{process in the}} pan, we followed furan mainly resulting from Maillard and caramelisation reactions in cereal products.

40|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} of the frying process requires precise {{knowledge of the}} thermal conductivity of different regions in fried product. While thermophysical properties of fresh and fried foods are well documented in the literature, thermophysical properties of the crust and core regions are not available. This study investigated potato thermal conductivity during deep-fat frying, specifically in the crust and core regions. Changes in characteristics of the crust and core in relation to frying time are discussed. A fried product has a porous structure, especially in the crust region. An improved Lees apparatus, in which the sample is enclosed between plates, was successfully used to directly determine the effective thermal conductivity of porous samples. The potato was cut into 0. 05 x 0. 05 x 0. 006 m(3) slabs and fried for 110 min at 170 degrees C. Top and bottom crusts were separated from the core region after each frying time and their thermal conductivities were individually measured. Results showed that the effective thermal conductivity (k) of the core increases with frying time, reaching a maximum value of 0. 6 W/(m K) at 3 min of frying and then decreases to 0. 4 W/(m K) {{at the end of}} frying. This behavior can be related to physico-chemical changes such as starch gelatinization and moisture loss in the core region.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine bread microstructure, oxygen diffusion properties, and gas exchange between bread and headspace after packaging in modified atmosphere (MA). Breads were produced at laboratory scale, and industrially produced breads were included as a reference. X-ray microtomography was applied to characterize the microstructure of the bread samples. For each sample type, oxygen diffusivity was calculated based on microstructural parameters. The samples for gas analyses were packaged under MA using vacuum compensation, using two vacuum strengths during the air evacuation step. The total porosity of all laboratory samples was above 75 %, except for the side and <b>bottom</b> <b>crusts</b> which had a lower porosity (< 70 %). The porosities of the crumb and the side crust of the commercial bread were 80 and 76 %, respectively. The connectivity density of the crumbs of the laboratory and commercial breads was 8 and 10 mm− 3, respectively. The crust showed a larger resistance to oxygen diffusion than the crumb, but for both bread regions, the diffusivity was maximally ten times smaller than that of oxygen in air. When considering all data obtained from the gas analysis in the headspace immediately after packaging, oxygen levels of 0. 1 ± 0. 1 % for strong vacuum and 3. 8 ± 2. 9 % for weak vacuum were obtained, which differed significantly (p < 0. 05). The results of the laboratory samples corresponded well to those of industrially baked breads.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} characterizing {{the effect of}} {{hydrothermal}} dynamics on the dough rheology, {{in order to develop}} a complete dough viscosity model valid at different locations during baking. The dough rheology was characterised using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Temperature and water content (WC) were monitored during DMTA. At high heating rates (15 - 30 degrees C/min), relevant to the top crust, viscosity behaved as if WC was kept constant, in spite of dehydration (37 %); such similarity was valid up to 80 degrees C (stage A). Beyond, the viscosity decrease observed in the samples at constant WC was replaced by a long-lasting plateau (stage B, 3 - 4 x 10 (6) Pa. s), attributed to WC reduction below similar to 37 %. Above the boiling water temperature, the logarithm of viscosity increased linearly with decreasing WC (stage C). At lower heating rates (5 degrees C/min), relevant to the <b>bottom</b> <b>crust,</b> viscosity was two-fold higher than that at higher heating rates, suggesting lower oven-rise. The viscosity decrease, observed at high temperatures (> 80 degrees C) for samples at constant WC, was not observed if drying occurred late (case of crumb beneath the crust); instead, viscosity increased up to levels close to that of the top crust (2 - 3 x 10 (7) Pa. s at WC similar to 20 %). Despite these deviations, viscosity as a WC function was modelled with a unique equation set. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} report an {{analytically}} based scheme is presented, which allows {{to capture the}} influence of basal solidification onto a spreading flow of liquid melt with poor thermal conductivity. Based on an underlying lubrication theory we derive an approximation for the temperature field and, thus, for the s/l-interface. Solutions are found based on similarity transformations or numerical schemes using the method of lines. Effects due to capillarity or liberation of latent heat are negligible. Solidification occurs at a defined solidification temperature, no mushy solidification regime is presumed. For the temperature field we use a quasi-steady approximation, which leads with respect to reactor safety applications to a conservative result for the crust influence onto the spreading flow. Furthermore, we assume both thermal conductivity and density to be constant and equal in the liquid and solid phases. The spreading flow is characterized in terms of Reynolds number Re, Froude number Fr, Prandtl number Pr and an aspect ratio #epsilon#. For the spreading volume we allow for V#propor to#t"#alpha#, {{which leads to a}} characterization of all possible spreading flows in terms of the exponent #alpha#. Within the viscous/gravitational regime, #epsilon#Re> 1 a weak influence of the <b>bottom</b> <b>crust</b> onto the spreading flow.

40|$|The CometPC-H 3 {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} investigate melt cooling by water addition {{to the bottom of}} the melt. The {{experiment was}} performed with a melt mass of 800 kg, 50 % metal and 50 % oxide, and 300 kW typical decay heat were simulated in the melt. As this was the first experiment after repair of the induction coil, attention was given to avoid overload of the induction coil and to keep the inductor voltage below critical values. Therefore, the height of the sacrificial concrete layer was reduced to 5 cm only, and the height of the porous concrete layers was also minimized to have a small distance and good coupling between heated melt and induction coil. After quite homogeneous erosion of the upper sacrificial concrete layer, passive bottom flooding started from the porous concrete after 220 s with 1. 3 liter water/s. The melt was safely stopped, arrested and cooled. The porous, water filled concrete was only slightly attacked by the hot melt in the upper 25 mm of one sector of the coolant device. The peak cooling rate in the early contact phase of coolant water and melt was 4 MW/m" 2, and exceeded the decay heat by one order of magnitude. The cooling rate remarkably dropped, when the melt was covered by the penetrating water and a surface crust was formed. Volcanic eruptions from the melt during the solidification process were observed from 360 - 510 s and created a volcanic dome some 25 cm high, but had only minor effect on the generation of a porous structure, as the expelled melt solidified mostly with low porosity. Unfortunately, decay heat simulation in the melt was interrupted at 720 s by an incorrect safety signal, which excluded further investigation of the long term cooling processes. At that time, the melt was massively flooded by a layer of water, about 80 cm thick, and coolant water inflow was still 1 l/s. The melt had reached a stable situation: Downward erosion was stopped by the cooling process from the water filled, porous concrete layer. Top and <b>bottom</b> <b>crusts</b> had formed, and included the bulk of the melt, which at this stage was still in the liquid state. Further cool down of the melt continued slowly over the next 40 min. (orig.) concrete underneath are completely intact as always cooled by the presence of the flooding water. In summary, the experiment has demonstrated that the CometPC cooling concept is able to stop and to cool the melt, although the expected porosity formation of the majority of the melt did not prevail in the present experiment. Under this aspect, the porous, water filled concrete layer has proven its reliability to stop the melt. On the other side, volcanic melt eruptions which occurred during a limited period of the test, did not improve the coolability significantly, as no major new porosity was created. (orig.)
