5000|$|... "Allomone was {{proposed}} by Brown and Eisner (Brown, 1968) to denote those substances which convey an advantage upon the emitter. Because Brown and Eisner {{did not specify}} whether or not <b>the</b> receiver would <b>benefit,</b> <b>the</b> original definition of allomone includes both substances that <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> receiver and the emitter, and substances that only <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> emitter.

5|$|In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as {{a result}} of {{overhunting}} in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the important arapaima (Arapaima gigas), also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and the urine and faeces of the caimans may have increased primary production by contributing plant nutrients. Thus the presence of the reptiles could have <b>benefited</b> <b>the</b> fish stock; the number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated with the fish population.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is not {{threatened by}} human activity, and is widespread throughout its range. The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has <b>benefited</b> <b>the</b> American goldfinch. Clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of neotropical migrants, while favoring short-distance migrants and permanent residents. This benefits the American goldfinch {{both as a}} short-distance migrant, and because the created open areas are the preferred environment of the bird, where weeds thrive which produce the primary food source of the American goldfinch.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression, {{although}} negative to {{the local}} economy, also <b>benefited</b> <b>the</b> San Diego State Teachers College, {{as the federal government}} made money available for construction projects in an attempt to stimulate the economy. For the campus, some of these construction projects included new buildings (such as a $500,000 stadium completed in 1936 and a $200,000 open air theater completed in 1941), facilities, and art works. Several federal programs were also created to give jobs to students and to increase financial aid.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the {{military}} dictatorship, Alfonsín pursued cultural and educational policies aimed at reducing the authoritarian customs of several institutions and groups. He also promoted freedom of the press. Several intellectuals and scientists who had left the country in the previous decade returned, which <b>benefited</b> <b>the</b> universities. The University of Buenos Aires returned to the quality levels that it had in the 1960s. Many intellectuals became involved in politics as well, providing a cultural perspective to the political discourse. Both Alfonsín and the Peronist Antonio Cafiero benefited.|$|E
5|$|Adding to the problems, the zip fuel {{program was}} {{canceled}} in 1959. After burning, the fuel turned into liquids and solids that increased wear on moving turbine engine components. Although the B-70 {{was intended to}} use zip only in the afterburners, and thus avoid this problem, the enormous cost of the zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation. This by itself was not a fatal problem, however, as newly developed high-energy fuels like JP-6 were available to make {{up some of the}} difference. Most of the range lost in the change from zip fuel was restored by filling one of the two bomb bays with a fuel tank. However, another problem arose when the F-108 program was canceled in September 1959, which ended the shared development that <b>benefited</b> <b>the</b> B-70 program.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the queen and her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it <b>benefited</b> <b>the</b> emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the queen and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E
50|$|Commensalism {{is a type}} of {{relationship}} among organisms in which one organism <b>benefits</b> while <b>the</b> other organism is neither <b>benefited</b> nor harmed. <b>The</b> organism that <b>benefited</b> is called <b>the</b> commensal while the other organism that is neither benefited nor harmed is called the host. For example, an epiphytic orchid attached to the tree for support <b>benefits</b> <b>the</b> orchid but neither harms nor <b>benefits</b> <b>the</b> tree.The opposite of commensalism is amensalism, an interspecific relationship in which a product of one organism has a negative effect on another organism.|$|R
50|$|The {{assumption}} by the Monetary Authority of the money-creating responsibility would incidentally <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> Government, {{by reducing}} the interest-bearing public debt pari passu with every dollar of new currency money put out.

5|$|Bancroft {{served as}} player–manager for the Braves for three seasons, from 1924 through 1927. Upon {{becoming}} manager, {{he became the}} youngest manager in the National League (NL). He missed time during the 1924 season with appendicitis. After finishing in last place in the eight-team NL, Bancroft overhauled the Braves' roster for the 1925 season. However, he lost the services of Rube Marquard and Joe Genewich, and the Braves finished in fifth place. Bancroft suggested that Bob Smith, ineffective as an infielder, become a pitcher; Smith's successes as a pitcher <b>benefited</b> <b>the</b> Braves' starting rotation. The Braves lacked offense going into the 1926 season, but hoped their pitching and defense could lead them into contention. The Braves finished in seventh place in the NL in 1926 and 1927.|$|E
5|$|Dozens {{of birth}} control clinics opened across the United States during the 1920s, but not without incident.Robinson, Caroline Hadley (1930), Seventy Birth Control Clinics, Williams and Wilkins (70 clinics in U.S. and Britain by 1930, cited by Kennedy, p. 291). In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing {{contraceptive}} information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled that use of contraceptives to space births farther apart was a legitimate medical treatment that <b>benefited</b> <b>the</b> health of the mother. The trial, in which many prominent physicians served as witnesses for the defense, brought {{a large segment of}} the medical community onto the side {{of birth control}} advocates.|$|E
5|$|Episcopalianism had {{retained}} supporters {{through the}} civil wars and changes of {{regime in the}} seventeenth century. Since most Episcopalians gave their support to the Jacobite rebellions {{in the first half}} of the early eighteenth century, they suffered a decline in fortunes. The remoteness of the Highlands and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later eighteenth century saw some success, owing to the efforts of the SSPCK missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society. Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. There was Evangelical Revival from the 1730s, reaching its peak at the Cambuslang Wark in 1742. The movement <b>benefited</b> <b>the</b> secessionist churches who gained recruits.|$|E
