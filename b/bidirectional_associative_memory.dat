The bi-directionality comes from passing information through a matrix and its transpose. Typically, bipolar encoding is preferred to binary encoding of the associative pairs.

50|$|<b>Bidirectional</b> <b>associative</b> <b>memory</b> (BAM) {{is a type}} of {{recurrent}} neural network. BAM was introduced by Bart Kosko in 1988. There are two types of associative memory, auto-associative and hetero-associative. BAM is hetero-associative, meaning given a pattern it can return another pattern which is potentially of a different size. It is similar to the Hopfield network in that they are both forms of associative memory. However, Hopfield nets return patterns of the same size.|$|E

50|$|Building on his 1964 Rockefeller PhD thesis, in the 1960s and 1970s, Grossberg {{generalized}} the Additive and Shunting {{models to}} a class of dynamical systems that included these models as well as non-neural biological models, and proved content addressable memory theorems for this more general class of models. As part of this analysis, he introduced a Liapunov functional method to help classify the limiting and oscillatory dynamics of competitive systems by keeping track of which population is winning through time. This Liapunov method led him and Michael Cohen to discover in 1981 and publish in 1982 and 1983 a Liapunov function {{that they used to}} prove that global limits exist in a class of dynamical systems with symmetric interaction coefficients that includes the Additive and Shunting models. John Hopfield published this Liapunov function for the Additive model in 1984. Some scientists started to call Hopfield’s contribution the Hopfield model. In an attempt to correct this historical error, other scientists called the more general model and Liapunov function the Cohen-Grossberg model. Still other scientists call it the Cohen-Grossberg-Hopfield model. In 1987, Bart Kosko adapted the Cohen-Grossberg model and Liapunov function, which proved global convergence of STM, to define an Adaptive <b>Bidirectional</b> <b>Associative</b> <b>Memory</b> that combines STM and LTM and which also globally converges to a limit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Typical <b>bidirectional</b> <b>associative</b> <b>memories</b> (BAM) use an offline, {{one-shot}} learning rule, have poor {{memory storage}} ca-pacity, {{are sensitive to}} noise, and are subject to spurious steady states during recall. Recent work on BAM has improved network performance in relation to noisy recall {{and the number of}} spurious attractors, but at the cost of an increase in BAM complexity. In all cases, the networks can only recall bipolar stimuli and, thus, are of limited use for grey-level pattern recall. In this paper, we introduce a new bidirectional heteroassociative memory model that uses a simple self-convergent iterative learning rule and a new nonlinear output function. As a result, the model can learn online without being subject to overlearning. Our simulation results show that this new model causes fewer spurious attractors when compared to others popular BAM networks, for a comparable performance in terms of tolerance to noise and storage capacity. In addition, the novel output function enables it to learn and recall grey-level pat-terns in a bidirectional way.

The approach is non-traditional {{in order to}} attract many students to use this methodology in their research. The traditional approach of mathematicians has conditioned students of sociology in such a manner that they are averse to using mathematical tools. Six simple types of fuzzy models that make use of fuzzy matrices are given. These models are distinct because they are time-dependent and can even be used for statistical data. The Fuzzy Cognitive Maps models gives the hidden pattern. Fuzzy Relational Maps model not only gives the hidden pattern but also gives the inter-relations between two sets of disjoint attributes. The <b>Bidirectional</b> <b>Associative</b> <b>Memories</b> model analyzes data depending on the time-period, while the Fuzzy <b>Associative</b> <b>Memories</b> model can give the gradation of importance of each attribute.

According to the results of detailed simulations, the PBHAN has a higher capacity for pattern pair storage than do the conventional <b>bidirectional</b> <b>associative</b> <b>memories</b> and fuzzy memories. The practical capacity of a PBHAN considering fault tolerance is discussed. The fault tolerance requirement leads to the discovery of the attraction radius of the basin for each stored pattern pair.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} neural association, which deals with the retrieval of a previously memorized pattern from its noisy version. The performance of various neural networks developed for this task may be judged {{in terms of their}} pattern retrieval capacities (the number of patterns that can be stored), and their error-correction (noise tolerance) capabilities. While significant progress has been made, most prior works in this area show poor performance with regard to pattern retrieval capacity and/or error correction. In this paper, we propose two new methods to significantly increase the pattern retrieval capacity of the Hopfield and <b>Bidirectional</b> <b>Associative</b> <b>Memories</b> (BAM). The main idea is to store patterns drawn from a family of low correlation sequences, similar to those used in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communications, instead of storing purely random patterns as in prior works. These low correlation patterns can be obtained from random sequences by pre-coding the original sequences via simple operations that both real and artificial neurons are capable of accomplishing.
