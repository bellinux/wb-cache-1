500|$|Harvest of the Cold Months (1994) is subtitled [...] "A {{social history}} of ice and ices". David had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> {{intermittently}} for several years before her last illnesses. The book traces the history of ice in the cuisines of Europe from mediaeval times, when {{it had to be}} brought from the mountains and kept in ice houses. The Independent's reviewer described it as [...] "not a cookery book but an awe-inspiring feat of detective scholarship... sumptuous and stately." [...] Reviewing the book in The Times, Nigella Lawson wrote that although it deserved a place on the shelves of anyone who cared about food, it revealed a waning of the author's energies, and [...] "lacks her customary, high-spirited, if fierce, readability".|$|E

[...] "Sparks Fly" [...] was written by Swift when she was sixteen years old, prior the release of her eponymous album in 2006. She {{performed}} the song live during several bar shows [...] "of forty and fifty people". A recorded live performance of the song during one of her concerts made its way onto the internet in 2007. The song became a favorite among Swift's fans, leading Swift to rework the song and include it on Speak Now after having so many requested {{for it to be}} included on the album. Of the song, Swift said that: [...] "This is a song I wrote {{a few years ago and}} I have <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> ever since. It's been awesome to see it change over the years. The fans have heard it before in concert, but there have been some really cool changes that I am very proud of and can't wait for them to hear." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{role was}} the most {{difficult}} to cast, and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese, noting [...] "Who would you rather make the argument [...] for mankind than John Cleese?" [...] Stoff, a producer, had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect. The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him, and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age. He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns. Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters. Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard: [...] "The trouble is, I {{had to be able to}} write the equation, because Barnhardt has <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> for 60 years. I learned to carefully copy things down that mean nothing to me at all. In A Fish Called Wanda, I spoke a lot of Russian without having any idea what it means." ...|$|E

[...] "It's {{safe to say that}} it will be post-Memorial Day at some point, but we're not exactly sure when. We've got some dates locked in for him to perform live in Europe in August, so we're trying to see what else lines up."

[...] The United States does not have a DVD boxed set of Kill Bill, though box sets of the two separate volumes are available in other countries, such as France, Japan and the United Kingdom.

A few months after the announcement, Gaga exclaimed that she had finished writing songs for the album: [...] "It came so quickly.

Lynch was criticized for her involvement in the meeting and was called on by some critics to recuse herself from involvement in the FBI's investigation of the email case.

2500|$|Vladimir Kosmich Zworykin {{was born}} in Murom, Russia, in 1888, on July 29 (old style July 17), {{to the family of}} a prosperous merchant. He had a {{relatively}} calm upbringing, and he rarely saw his father except on religious holidays. He studied at the St. Petersburg Institute of Technology, under Boris Rosing. He helped Rosing with experimental work on television in the basement of Rosing's private lab at the School of Artillery of Saint Petersburg. [...] They worked on the problem of [...] "electrical telescopy," [...] something Zworykin had never heard of before. [...] At this time, electrical telescopy (or television as it was later called) was just a dream. [...] Zworykin did not know that others had been studying the idea since the 1880s, or that Professor Rosing had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in secret since 1902 and had made excellent progress. Rosing had filed his first patent on a television system in 1907, featuring a very early cathode ray tube as a receiver, and a mechanical device as a transmitter. Its demonstration in 1911, based on an improved design, was the first world's demonstration of TV of any kind.|$|E

It was that, more than anything, which made him acutely conscious of his lack of success. His nerves were being sorely troubled by the quiet scorn of Mrs. Pickett's gaze. He began to think that perhaps he had been a shade too self-confident and abrupt in the short interview which he had had with her on his arrival.|$|E
