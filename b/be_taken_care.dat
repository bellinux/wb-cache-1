Thus on 28 November 1848, the Federal Assembly voted in majority to locate the seat of government in Berne. And, as a prototypical federal compromise, to assign other federal institutions, such as the Federal Polytechnical School (1854, the later ETH) to Zurich, and other institutions to Lucerne, such as the later SUVA (1912) and the Federal Insurance Court (1917). In 1875, a law (RS 112) fixed the compensations owed {{by the city of}} Bern for the federal seat.|$|E

They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years. In 1937, their father recalled them to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> of by their older sister, Inam. Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father; {{when he died in}} 1952, Arafat did not attend the funeral, nor did he visit his father's grave upon his return to Gaza. Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. When she asked Arafat why he would not stop going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.|$|E

5|$|That evening, the {{witnesses}} gathered {{to discuss what}} was to be done. United States laws were not applicable west of the Continental Divide (in what was then Mexican territory) and wagon trains often dispensed their own justice. But George Donner, the party's leader, was a full day ahead of the main wagon train with his family. Snyder had been seen to hit James Reed, and some claimed that he had also hit Margret Reed, but Snyder had been popular and Reed was not. Keseberg suggested that Reed should be hanged, but an eventual compromise allowed Reed to leave the camp without his family, who were to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> of by the others. Reed departed alone the next morning, unarmed, but his daughter Virginia rode ahead and secretly provided him with a rifle and food.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{informed}} by Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) that he has health problems as Tracy has a weakened system only found on dead people. Tracy and his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) meet with Jack and Tracy reveals what Dr. Spaceman told him. Angie becomes concerned {{on whether or not}} their family will <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> of after Tracy dies. Jack offers Angie a job in the entertainment business, and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz's intern. Liz realizes that Angie's new job is Jack's way of messing with her, and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not getting paid and fires her. Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGSs time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers. Liz, however, still refuses—even admitting she likes the concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it. To get back at Jack, Liz holds a press conference and announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. The next day, Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines. During the meeting, the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had, and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGSs budget.|$|E

25|$|In {{families}} {{with more than}} one child (twins or triplets), it has been found that maternal sensitivity is lower, as there are more needs to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> of by the mother and less time to form a unique bond, which in turn results in decreased cognitive development in the infants (relative to if the child were raised alone). Furthermore, in the newborn period, women who displayed high maternal sensitivity had children who were able to regulate their emotions and who had higher symbolic and cognitive skills. In the case of the triplets, the child that received the least maternal sensitivity was the one that showed the poorest outcomes cognitively and had the most medical problems.|$|E

This suggestion, however, did not get the green light of most of the assembly since it would have swayed the balance of power among many Qizilbash clans.

25|$|Following the {{experience}} of economic instability throughout the 1990s, and {{the implementation of a}} free travel agreement with the EU, a great number of Romanians emigrated to Western Europe and North America, with particularly large communities in Italy and Spain. In 2008, the Romanian diaspora was estimated to be at over twomillion people. The cyclical nature of the world economy and economic disparities between Romania and advanced European economies has fueled further emigration from the country. The emigration has caused social changes in Romania, whereby the parents would leave for Western Europe to escape poverty and provide a better standard of living for their children, who have been left behind. Some children are left to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> of by grandparents and relatives; and some live alone, if the parents deem them to be reasonably self-sufficient. Subsequently, the youth began to be called Euro-orphans.|$|E

Due {{to the fact}} that Zhang Xiu was backed by Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, Cao Cao realised Zhang could not <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> of within a short period of time. Under the rationale that Liu Bei was asking for help in Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) to fight Lü Bu, Cao Cao finally relinquished his war against Zhang Xiu, and sent envoys to ask Zhang to form an alliance, which Zhang agreed upon the term that a marriage be arranged between the two families. During the siege of Xiapi, Yue Jin led a separate command and defeated one of Lü Bu's deputies outside the city before he joined the encirclement.|$|E

Giuseppe agreed and sent Andrea back to Paris, which he reached on 23 April. Visiting his uncle the following day, he found himself recognized. He was able to go on to convince the Paris Prefect, by threats of family action and general public concern, and the composer should be moved to an apartment in Paris. This took place on 23 June and, while there, he was able to take rides in his carriage and appeared to be much more aware of his surroundings. However, he was held under virtual house arrest by the police for several more months, although able to be visited by friends and even by Verdi while he was in Paris. Finally—on 16 August—in Constantinople, Giuseppe filed a formal complaint with the Austrian ambassador (given that the composer was an Austrian citizen).|$|E
