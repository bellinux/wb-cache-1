5000|$|The first Belgian Hares were bred in Belgium in {{the early}} 18th century out of {{selective}} breeding between domestic and wild European rabbits, {{with the intent of}} creating a practical meat rabbit. In 1874, they were imported to England and called the [...] "Belgian Hare." [...] English breeders made the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> appear more spirited, like wild English rabbits. By 1877 the first Belgian Hares were shown in America, where it immediately rose in popularity, giving rise to thousands of <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> clubs around the country, thousands were bred, and some sold for as much as US $1,000.The first of these clubs was known as the [...] "American <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> Association". With a wide and scattered membership the club lasted {{not much more than a}} year. In 1897 the [...] "National <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> Club" [...] was formed. Twelve years after the formation of the National <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> Club of America, and as additional breeds were introduced in the US, a new [...] "all-breed" [...] club, the [...] "National Pet Stock Association" [...] was formed. After several name changes, the National Pet Stock Association became the American Rabbit Breeders Association As years passed, the National <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> club of America also passed from existence. In June, 1972, a group of <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> breeders gathered together to apply for a specialty club charter from the American Rabbit Breeders Association to replace the National <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> Club of America. In July, 1972, the charter was granted and the last, and most prominent of these groups, the [...] "American <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> Club" [...] was established, that continues to exist to this day.|$|E

The <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> doe gave birth on 29 May 1890 to four offspring which appeared to be of the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> breed and two offspring which appeared to be of the Angora breed.

50|$|The <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> is most {{known for}} its distinctively close {{resemblance}} to a hare, with a long, fine body with muscular flank, and distinctly arched back with loins and well-rounded hind quarters. Their head is long and their tail straight and carried {{in line with the}} backbone. The fore feet of a <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> is usually long and fine-boned and perfectly straight, while their hind feet long are fine and flat.

5000|$|The <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{intelligent}} and energetic rabbits. Rabbits can become trained to learn their name. Due to their active nature and alert temperament, they can very easily be startled by sudden noise or movement, and a recommended practise by owners of this breed is to have a radio constantly playing near them, so they can get used to noise. As a result of their active personality, they have been called [...] "the poor man's racehorse". The <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> is known to be responsive to handling, particularly when trained from an early age, however, it is recommended that the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> should not be handled by children mainly due to their large size and speed that may cause injury.|$|E
5000|$|As the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> has a {{very high}} {{metabolic}} rate, it may require more food and more consistent feeding than other breeds of domestic rabbit. The specific dietary requirements of a <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> do not differ significantly from other breeds of domestic rabbit, and like the majority of rabbits, the most {{important component of the}} diet of a <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> is hay, a roughage that reduces the chance of blockages and malocclusion whilst providing indigestible fiber necessary to keep the gut moving. Grass hays such as timothy are generally preferred over legume hays like clover and alfalfa. Legume hays are higher in protein, calories, and calcium, which in excess can cause kidney stones and loose stool. This type of hay should be reserved for young kits or lactating does.|$|E
5000|$|Domestic rabbits {{have been}} {{popular in the}} United States since the late 19th century.

From 1898 to 1901, many thousands of Belgian Hares were imported to America.

Large, arched American Rhinelanders were bred to the small Polish breed to reduce the size. <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hares,</b> Tans, Harlequin, Mini Satins, and Britannia Petites were other instrumental breeds. Now that the Elfins have been included in the Swedish Hare population, an international exchange of breeding stock is possible.|$|R
5000|$|New Zealand whites {{descended from}} New Zealand Reds, which were likely {{developed}} in California and developed from {{a mix of}} breeds, possibly including <b>Belgian</b> <b>hares</b> and Flemish giants.

Preshaw out of some white New Zealands born in a litter of reds. While the reds remained more popular for meat for some time, whites quickly caught on because of their white pelt, which could be easily dyed and was more valuable in the fur market.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of hereditary premature senescence {{in a family}} of pure bred <b>Belgian</b> <b>hares</b> belonging to a rabbit-breeding colony organized for the investigation of constitutional problems, has been described. Representatives of 20 generations of the complex have been studied. The condition was a degeneration of variable degrees of severity and two principal forms were recognized, the acute and the chronic, the chronic being the more frequent. The chronic form has now been described in terms of the principal local or external manifestations; that is, degeneration of the coat and skin, lesions of the eyes and feet, and reproductive abnormalities, and of the general deterioration which in severe cases pursued a progressive course characterized by muscle wasting, fat reduction, emaciation, weakness, and death. The acute form will be described in the next paper (2) ...|$|R

50|$|In 1917, their {{popularity}} {{began to fade}} away, {{and one of the}} reasons attributed to this decline is the failed attempt by many breeders to turn the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare,</b> a naturally race rabbit, into a meat rabbit, a role to which they were physically and behaviourally unsuited. However, today, true Belgian Hares are rare, due partly to the degree of difficulty many have had in breeding them.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of hereditary premature senescence in the rabbit {{has been described}} in the first paper of this series (1). The condition, which developed in a certain family of <b>Belgian</b> <b>hares</b> belonging to a large breeding colony organized {{for the study of}} constitutional problems, was established as an hereditary entity. From observations made on individuals representing 20 generations of the condition, two principal forms of the degenerative syndrome were recognized, the acute and the chronic, the essential difference between them being the degree and rate of deterioration. For convenience of description, the classification of cases in the two categories was made on an age-survival basis, the age selected being 2 years 6 months. The chronic form (1) was described in terms of local or external manifestations that developed in mild as well as severe cases and of the progressive general and fatal degeneration that was characteristic of the severe grade of the condition. The external manifestations comprised degenerative changes of the coat and skin and a senile appearance was often observed. Lesions of th...|$|R
50|$|Right {{across the}} river from where the current zoo is located lived an Irishman named Archibald Rowan. He made the first printed cloth in Delaware. On the land where the zoo now stands, there was a public amphitheater where people would go to hear famous orators of their time. Among them were Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun and Henry Clay. It is even said that George Washington mustered his troops on the field above the zoo near the Washington Street Bridge during the American Revolution. In 1904, Dr. James H. Morgan came to the Board of Park Commissioners with the idea of {{starting}} a zoo in Wilmington. He was able to donate some animals if the Commission would pay for the shelters and fences. The boundaries of the zoo were very different from today. The main area of the zoo was the area of the old bear pit (across from the current Andean condor exhibit) and the Exotic Animal House, and extended down the river. Ducks and geese, <b>Belgian</b> <b>hares,</b> a sea turtle, and a sea gull were among the original collection.|$|R

50|$|In Sweden, the {{landrace}} breed {{called the}} Gotland Rabbit, although rare, was admired for its good temperament and strong bodies. The Gotland rabbit also comes in all colors with many individuals possessing an athletic arched body type.

He was succeeded by his brother, John, owner of John Inglis (shipbuilder), a well known shipbuilder situated in Glasgow. John died in 1922. The house was empty for 30 years. After this in 1952, it was sold to the Wolfe-Murray family, then the Morrow family. The Woodd family have been living at Glenternie since 1998.|$|E
50|$|The ideal jumping rabbit {{has long}} legs {{and a long}} back, which will help it see over longer {{obstacles}} and correctly judge the height or length {{in order to get}} over. In the case of with slender bone, such as the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare,</b> the legs should be strong and muscular so high jumps will not hurt them. In Scandinavia, where rabbit show jumping has a strong base, most are crossbreeds, bred with good jumpers as parents, similar to the method of breeding show dogs.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} size and {{energetic}} nature, {{it is recommended that}} the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare</b> be provided with a large hutch or cage to enable them to move freely. For an outdoor rabbit the ideal home is a hutch with a waterproof roof, and raised off the ground. If the rabbit is going to live indoors then a hutch can also be used or a cage. Belgian Hares should have a cage with at least a 24 by 60-inch floor and a height of 24 inches. A breeding or brood cage should be 36 by 72 inches, at least.|$|E

The colour for the RCMP Stetson is sometimes referred to as [...] "Belgian Belly"; it is a reddish buff, pastel-like colour of the underfur of the <b>Belgian</b> <b>hare.</b> It is also a very little-used [...] "second name" [...] for the Stetson. Although called a Stetson, the hat type should be considered as a campaign hat.|$|E
5000|$|All rabbits {{must have}} an {{adequate}} exercise area, whether it is an outside run or an enclosed area in the house. Softwood shavings {{should not be used}} for the floor of the hutch or cage as they can cause respiratory problems. Fine sawdust can cause eye irritations so this should be avoided. Bedding material should be provided especially in cold and wet weather for the outdoor rabbit. A recommended practise is to place the straw on top of a layer of the hardwood shavings in the sleeping compartment, in order to ensure warmth and insulation for an outdoor <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare.</b> The rabbit home should be cleaned out weekly and any old food removed. If it is necessary to wash the home then only use a cleaner specifically designed for cleaning rabbit hutches.|$|E
5000|$|The Flemish Giant {{originated}} in Flanders. It was bred {{as early as}} the 16th century near the city of Ghent, Belgium. It is believed to have descended from a number of meat and fur breeds, possibly including the Steenkonijn (Stone Rabbit—referring to the old Belgian weight size of one stone or about 3.76 kg) and the European [...] "Patagonian" [...] breed (now extinct). This [...] "Patagonian" [...] rabbit, a large breed that was once bred in Belgium and France, was not related to the Patagonian rabbit of Argentina (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), a separate wild species weighing less than two pounds (about 1 kg), nor the Patagonian hare (Dolichotis patagonum), a species in the cavy family of rodents that cannot interbreed with rabbits.Thomas Coatoam, in his Origins of the Flemish Giants, tells us, [...] "The earliest authentic record of the Flemish Giant Rabbit occurred about the year 1860." [...] The first standards for the breed were written in 1893. The Flemish Giant is an ancestor of many rabbit breeds all over the world, one of which is the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare,</b> imported into England in the mid 19th century. The Flemish Giant was exported from England and Belgium to America in the early 1890s to help improve the size of meat rabbits during the great [...] "rabbit boom".|$|E
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare,</b> like other rabbits, receive a standard intake of 2 cups of chopped dark, green, leafy vegetables per 6 pounds of body weight (although this should only be given after four months of age to prevent enteritis) and up to 2 tablespoons of fruit or carrots per 6 pounds of body weight daily. It is common for some owners to provide treats, although in very limited quantities, which can include a few pellets, a slice of strawberry, or other healthful foods. Commercial treats {{are available in the}} pet stores can be fed, but owners should stay away from anything with a yoghurt coating, or other ingredients that the rabbit would not encounter in the wild.Some of the vegetables that rabbits enjoy are romaine lettuce, escarole, turnips, collards, kale, parsley, thyme, cilantro, dandelion, and basil. The green, leafy tops of radish and carrots also are excellent sources of nutrients, but should be fed sparingly due to the high calcium content. New vegetables should be introduced slowly due to the delicate digestive systems of rabbits. It {{is recommended}} that cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage be avoided, as they cause gas and can lead to gastrointestinal stasis, which can be fatal. Vegetables such as potatoes and corn should also avoided due to their high starch content. Belgian Hares also require an unlimited amount of fresh water, usually provided for in a water crock, tip-proof ceramic pet dish, or hanging water bottle.|$|E
40|$|A unique {{condition}} of the rabbit, designated premature or early senescence, {{was one of the}} inherited disease complexes which occurred in a breeding colony maintained in this laboratory for studies on constitutional problems (1). The senile appearance of many individuals was striking, a rabbit 1 or 2 years of age resembling a much older rabbit in such respects as an irregular unkempt coat, dry scurfy or scaly skin areas, and an increasingly poor nutritional state. The basis of the condition was a degeneration of greater or less degree and distribution. In a considerable proportion of cases, a progressive general deterioration developed that was rapidly progressive in character and fatal within a year or so while in other rabbits it was comparatively mild. The pathologic findings, particularly those in the cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine systems, were impressive features. The first example of the condition occurred in a pure bred <b>Belgian</b> <b>hare,</b> the daughter of parents purchased as one of the foundation stocks of the colony; other examples which later developed in the Belgian group included in their ancestry one or bot...|$|E
40|$|A {{candidate}} gene {{approach has been}} already successfully applied to identify several DNA markers associated with production traits in livestock. The principle {{is based on the}} fact that variability within genes coding for protein products involved in key physiological mechanisms and metabolic pathways directly or indirectly involved in determining an economic trait (e. g. feed efficiency, muscle mass accretion, reproduction efficiency, disease resistance, etc.) might probably explain a fraction of the genetic variability for the production trait itself. Growth hormone (GH) and myostatin (MSTN) genes play important roles in animal growth, development and muscle mass accretion. For their functions, these two genes can be considered {{candidate gene}}s for meat production traits. Here we resequenced parts of these two genes in four rabbit breeds (<b>Belgian</b> <b>Hare,</b> Burgundy Fawn, Checkered Giant and Giant Grey) in order to identify DNA markers useful for association studies with economic traits. On the whole, resequencing of the GH and MSTN genes generated sequence information for 9988 bp. No mutation was detected in the sequenced regions of the GH gene suggesting the absence of common polymorphisms in this rabbit gene. Resequencing of the rabbit MSTN gene identified only a single nucleotide polymorphism (C>T) in intron 2. A PCR-RFLP protocol was designed to investigate thi...|$|E
