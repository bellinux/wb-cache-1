5|$|The Bhutanese {{subsequently}} redesigned their flag {{to match}} the measurements of the flag of India, which they believed fluttered <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> own. Other modifications such as changing the red background color to orange led to the current design, in use since 1969. The National Assembly of Bhutan codified a code of conduct in 1972 to formalize the flag's design and establish protocol regarding acceptable flag sizes and conditions for flying the flag.|$|E
5|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} {{have historically}} been kept in captivity, {{under the assumption that}} they would fare <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide, nearly 100 were kept in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour porpoise and five finless porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due {{the fact that there were}} few breeding attempts, many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E
5|$|Government {{estimates}} from 2003 put the literacy rate at 98.6 percent, with {{no significant difference}} between the sexes. Educational standards have been traditionally high, although still far from European benchmarks and in continuing deterioration for the past decade. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had deteriorated. State expenditures for education are far below the European Union average. The PISA study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science. Bulgaria ranked 45th out of 72 countries surveyed. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. The State provides free education in primary and secondary public schools. The educational process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level. High schools can be technical, vocational, general or specialised in a certain discipline, while higher education consists of a 4-year bachelor degree and a 1-year master's degree.|$|E

5|$|Hershey broke their four-game {{losing streak}} with a 2–1 {{victory against the}} Manchester Monarchs on February 2, making a season-high 44 shots on goal. LeBlanc and Wellman {{combined}} for 10 shots in their Hershey debuts, and LeBlanc scored {{one of the two}} goals. Hershey lost the next day to the Penguins, falling 2–1 in overtime after allowing a power play goal with 10.8 seconds left in overtime. In a 3–2 shootout win against the Lake Erie Monsters on February 5, Sabourin made 35 saves and the Bears killed seven power plays. They also defeated Binghamton 4–3 on February 9, scoring on two of eight power plays, <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> 1-for-11 power play record going into the game. Hershey lost 4–3 in a shootout against Norfolk on February 10, despite scoring three goals in the third period. Potulny made two of the goals, including the last with 34.4 seconds in regulation, marking his second multi-goal game of the season. Stoa also scored his second two-goal game of the season in the Bears' subsequent 4–3 loss against Norfolk on February 10, which marked the team's third consecutive shootout loss.|$|E
5|$|The Ireland fixture {{was played}} at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, on 1 December 1888. Both teams {{had a number}} of leading players out injured– the Irish were forced to make four changes to their {{original}} selection. Ireland led 3–0 at half-time after scoring a converted try, but the Natives improved considerably in the second-half, scoring four tries. Patrick Keogh scored the first two tries, and his play was praised by the local press. The third try scored was by Thomas Ellison after a counter-attack by George Williams. The try was not converted, but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the visitors a 13–4 victory. The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team, but Ireland did go on to defeat Wales two tries to nil in the 1889 Home Nations Championship. Following their defeat of Ireland, the Natives played Trinity College and then North of Ireland. The match against Trinity College was drawn 4–4, and despite Keogh not playing, the Native side played much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> previous fixture. The team then travelled to Belfast, where they defeated North of Ireland 2–0 on 5 December; scoring two tries to nil.|$|E
5|$|With 9:28 {{remaining}} in the quarter, Nebraska's second possession of the game mirrored its first. The Cornhuskers picked up a first down on a Scott Frost throw, but were unable to gain another after being stopped for a loss on one play and had to punt. Following the kick, Virginia Tech took over at its 28-yard line. The Hokies performed <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> first possession, picking up a quick first down on two rushes by Oxendine. Druckenmiller then completed a first-down throw that pushed the Hokies into Nebraska territory for a second time. Druckenmiller rushed for eight yards on the next play, then ran an option with Oxendine that saw the players combine for 20 yards and a first down. Now at the Nebraska 20-yard line, Oxendine ran for a yard, pushing the Hokies into the red zone. On the first play inside the Nebraska red zone, Druckenmiller completed a 19-yard pass to Marcus Parker for a Virginia Tech touchdown—the game's first points. Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham kicked the extra point, and Virginia Tech took a 70 lead with 3:14 {{remaining in}} the first quarter. The drive covered 72 yards and had taken eight plays and 4:06 of game time.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies {{continued}} to Atlanta, where they took {{two of three}} from the Braves, with Kendrick's second win and Lidge's 30th save {{in the first game}} of the series. Martínez was outdueled by Javier Vázquez in the second game of the series, but the Phillies avoided a loss by defeating the Braves, 4–2, on September 20. A doubleheader followed against the Marlins; the Phillies won game one, while the Marlins won game two. In the rubber game, Lidge blew his 11th save after a rain delay to give the Marlins a series victory, keeping the team's number to clinch the division at five. The Phillies and the Brewers split the next series at two games each, with Philadelphia winning the first and last game of the series. The Phillies returned to Citizens Bank Park for their final homestand to close out the season, opening with a fifth consecutive loss to the Astros. However, the Phillies broke the streak with a 7–4 win on September 29, thanks to a Feliz grand slam. The following night, the Phillies clinched their third consecutive division title with a 10–3 win over Houston, guaranteeing a split in the series and a playoff berth, and tying the franchise record for consecutive division titles set by Danny Ozark's teams from 1976 to 1978. After the clinching game, the Phillies rested most of their regular starters, six of whom had started over 150 games during the season; they lost four straight games while the regulars regained their strength, but won the final game of the season in extra innings as Paul Hoover hit a walk-off single in the bottom of the 10th inning. The Phillies finished with a record of 93 wins and 69 losses, one game <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> record in the previous season.|$|E

25|$|By January 1945, the {{air raids}} on Nauru had tapered off, {{the front lines}} of the Pacific War having moved to the west.

25|$|Despite the {{barriers}} {{that come from}} being born to immigrants who are generally low skilled, have little education, and have less knowledge of the English language compared to U.S. natives, second-generation immigrants are doing better than U.S. native groups of comparable racial backgrounds, contradicting the concept of downward assimilation. A major factor that contributes to second-generation immigrants doing so well is the drive to succeed and do <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>their</b> predecessors that is commonly instilled in these immigrants from childhood by their families. The theory of segment assimilation undermines such early socialization.|$|E

Furthermore, no New Zealand team managed to win a single match in Australia, although Australian teams had some success playing in New Zealand. Most notably, the Wellington-based Central Pulse failed to win a single game.
