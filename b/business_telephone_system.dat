50|$|A <b>business</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> {{differs from}} an {{installation}} of several telephones with multiple central office (CO) lines {{in that the}} CO lines used are directly controllable in key telephone systems from multiple telephone stations, and that such a system often provides additional features related to call handling. Business telephone systems are often broadly classified into key telephone systems, and private branch exchanges, but many hybrid systems exist.|$|E

50|$|Softphones are client {{devices for}} making and {{receiving}} voice and video calls over the IP network {{with the standard}} functions of most original telephones and usually allow integration with VoIP phones and USB phones instead of using a computer's microphone and speakers (or headset). Most softphone clients run on the open Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supporting various codecs. Skype runs on a closed proprietary networking protocol but additional <b>business</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> (PBX) software can allow a SIP based telephone system to connect to the Skype network. Online chat programs now also incorporate voice and video communications.|$|E
5000|$|TAPI is used {{primarily}} to control either modems or, more recently, to control <b>business</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> (PBX) handsets. When controlling a PBX handset, {{the driver is}} provided by the manufacturer of the telephone system. Some manufacturers provide drivers that allow the control of multiple handsets. This is traditionally called [...] "third-party control". Other manufacturers provide drivers that allow the control of a single handset. This is called [...] "first-party control". Third-party drivers are designed to allow applications to see and/or control multiple extensions at the same time. Some telephone systems only permit one third-party connection at a time. First-party drivers are designed to allow applications to monitor and/or control one extension at a time. Telephone systems naturally permit many of these connections simultaneously. Modem connections are by nature first-party.|$|E

40|$|Teleconferencing is an {{essential}} feature in any <b>business</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> A teleconference allows associates {{to engage in a}} group discussion by conducting a virtual meeting while remaining at geographically dispersed locations. Teleconferencing increases productivity while reducing travel costs and saving travel time. In a VoIP telephone system, we face the significant challenge of providing a teleconference feature that can support a large-scale teleconference without using excessive bandwidth. This paper presents a new, bandwidth-efficient way of implementing a real-time VoIP teleconference system. This new method provides all of the features that existing teleconference systems provide, but this new approach consumes considerably less data bandwidth than existing systems require. The new system allows a network with a given capacity to accommodate almost double the number of conference participants that an existing system would allow...|$|E
50|$|Night {{service in}} {{telephony}} is {{a feature of}} private branch exchanges and other <b>business</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems,</b> whereby for a set period during the day (usually those hours outside of normal office or work hours, when normal operator services are not provided), all incoming calls are automatically redirected by the switchboard to a specific extension or to equipment such as an answering machine or other voice mail system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} unified {{communications}} {{is tied to}} the evolution of the supporting technology. Originally, <b>business</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> were a private branch exchange (PBX) or key <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> provided and managed by the local phone company. These systems used the phone company's analog or digital circuits to deliver phone calls from a central office (CO) to the customer. The system [...] - PBX or key <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> - [...] accepted the call and routed the call to the appropriate extension or line appearance on the phones at the customer's office.|$|R
2500|$|As <b>business</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> {{have adopted}} VoIP technology, support for {{wideband}} audio has grown rapidly. Telephone sets from Avaya, Cisco, NEC Unified Solutions, Grandstream, Gigaset, Polycom (which brands wideband audio [...] "HD Voice"), Snom, AudioCodes (which brands wideband audio [...] "HDVoIP") and others now incorporate G.722, {{as well as}} varying degrees of higher-quality audio components.

50|$|Menus are {{now also}} seen in {{consumer}} electronics, starting with TV sets and VCRs that gained on-screen displays {{in the early}} 1990s, and extending into computer monitors and DVD players. Menus allow the control of settings like tint, brightness, contrast, bass and treble, and other functions such as channel memory and closed captioning. Other electronics with text-only displays can also have menus, anything from <b>business</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> with digital <b>telephones,</b> to weather radios that can be set to respond only to specific weather warnings in a specific area. Other more recent electronics in the 2000s also have menus, such as digital media players.|$|R
40|$|The virtual {{warehouse}} (VW) is a {{state of}} real-time global visibility for logistics assets such as inventory and vehicles. The efficiency of the VW is comparable to that achieved in a local warehouse facility. We assess the enabling technologies, develop a conceptual framework, and identify the essential decision-support modules of a virtual warehouse. A case study for field repair service illustrates potential benefits of perfect information, in terms of reduced transportation, labor costs and service times. The case study pertains to field logistics support for <b>business</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems.</b> The productivity and utilization of highly skilled field technicians are improved substantially. A field scrap policy supported by VW reduces the volume of returns to the repair depot by over 20 %. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} {{formulated in}} this paper is a direct reaction to the reviewer selection process of IJCAI 1997, which relied on an unintelligent string matching program. We challenge the AI community to implement an intelligent knowledge-based reviewer selection program for IJCAI 1999. 1 Introduction In this paper we will formulate a challenge that should result {{in the design and}} implementation of a reviewer selection program to be used by the organizing committee of IJCAI 1999. The motivation behind this problem is partially rooted in a dissatisfaction with the assignment process of papers to reviewers that was apparently used for IJCAI 1997. The challenge is that the process of assigning papers to reviewers should be automated and performed by a flexible and intelligent AI program. We will explain this motivation in more detail, based on a metaphor from the <b>business</b> of <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> development. Then we will outline some of the major problems that are part of this challenge. Finally [...] ...|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s {{it was clear}} that GTE must make {{substantial}} investments into the emerging mobile telecommunications field, which was beginning to compete against its core <b>business</b> in traditional <b>telephone</b> <b>systems.</b> The decision was made to sell off Sylvania to finance these new investments. At this time the global lamps market was dominated by only four players - Sylvania, GE, Philips and Osram, each of whom had roughly a quarter of the market. International monopoly regulations prohibited an outright takeover of the entire of Sylvania by one of these three competitors. Eventually a deal was struck in which the company was split into two parts. Osram GmbH, obtained the North America, Mexico and Puerto Rican operations and rights to the Sylvania brand in those territories. The remainder of the company in Europe, Asia and Latin America, together with the Sylvania brand in those countries, {{was the subject of a}} management buyout which led to the formation of SLI Holdings International LLC. Eventually, Australia and New Zealand became independent entities.|$|R

50|$|Mobile radio <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> were <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> of {{wireless}} type {{that preceded the}} modern cellular mobile form of telephony technology.
