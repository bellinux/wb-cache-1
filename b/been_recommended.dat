40|$|International audienceScreening {{with breast}} {{ultrasound}} {{in combination with}} mammography is needed to investigate a clinical breast mass (Grade B), colored single-pore breast nipple discharge (Grade C), or mastitis (Grade C). The BI-RADS system <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> for describing and classifying abnormal breast imaging findings. For a breast abscess, a percutaneous biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> {{in the case of}} a mass or persistent symptoms (Grade C). For mastalgia, when breast imaging is normal, no MRI or breast biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). Percutaneous biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> for a BI-RADS category 4 - 5 mass (Grade B). For persistent erythematous nipple or atypical eczema lesions, a nipple biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). For distortion and asymmetry, a vacuum core-needle biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> due to the risk of underestimation by simple core-needle biopsy (Grade C). For BI-RADS category 4 - 5 microcalcifications without any ultrasound signal, a minimum 11 -G vacuum core-needle biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade B). In the absence of microcalcifications on radiography cores additional samples <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade B). For atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, flat epithelial atypia, radial scar and mucocele with atypia, surgical excision <b>is</b> commonly <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). Expectant management is feasible after multidisciplinary consensus. For these lesions, when excision margins are not clear, no new excision <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> except for LCIS characterized as pleomorphic or with necrosis (Grade C). For grade 1 phyllodes tumor, surgical resection with clear margins <b>is</b> <b>recommended.</b> For grade 2 phyllodes tumor, 10 mm margins <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). For papillary breast lesions without atypia, complete disappearance of the radiological signal <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). For papillary breast lesions with atypia, complete surgical excision <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade C...|$|R

5|$|In 1799, Spain gave Louisiana back to France in {{exchange}} for the promise of a throne in central Italy. Although the agreement was signed on October 1, 1800, it did not go into effect until 1802. The following year, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the United States. Many of the Spaniards who had moved to the colony left for Texas, Florida, or other Spanish-held lands. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions in the documents were ambiguous and contradictory. Even when both territories had been under Spanish control, there was disagreement on where the border should be. In 1793, the King of Spain decided that {{there was no need to}} move the boundary from Natchitoches to the Sabine River, as had <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> by some Frenchmen.|$|E

The initial orders for MX3000 trains did not call for sufficient numbers to replace the T2000. Kollektivtransportproduksjon has estimated the cost of renovating the units so they can run for 15 more years at NOK50 million.

5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has <b>been</b> <b>recommended,</b> but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of pain. For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Jim Thompson {{was hired}} by Foster and McQueen to adapt his novel. He worked on the {{screenplay}} for four months, changing some of the scenes and episodes in his novel. Thompson's script included the borderline surrealistic ending from his novel featuring El Rey, an imaginary Mexican town filled with criminals. McQueen objected to the depressing ending and Thompson was replaced by screenwriter Walter Hill. Hill had <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> by Polly Platt, Bogdanovich's wife, who was then still attached to direct; Platt had been impressed by Hill's work on Hickey & Boggs (1972). Hill said Bogdanovich wanted to turn the material into a more Hitchcock-type thriller, but he had only gotten twenty-five pages in when McQueen fired the director. Hill finished the script in six weeks, then Peckinpah came on board.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Royal Warrant, {{was silent}} {{on whether the}} VC could be awarded posthumously. From 1857 until 1897, 18 recipients were gazetted after their deaths but only 12 of the next of kin received the actual medal. In the other six cases there was a memorandum stating {{that they would have}} <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> for the VC had they survived. By 1899, the precedent had been established that the VC could be awarded posthumously if the recommendation for the award was submitted prior to the recipient’s death from wounds. Two such awards were granted during the Second Boer War, the well known award to Frederick Roberts, the son of Lord Roberts VC and to Francis Parsons. In 1900 and 1901, three memoranda were issued for Herman Albrecht, Robert Digby-Jones and David Younger stating they would have <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> for the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy restricted to the Second Boer War, it was announced in the London Gazette on 8 August 1902, that the next of kin of the three soldiers mentioned in memoranda would be sent medals. In the same gazette, the first three posthumous awards were gazetted to Alfred Atkinson, John Barry and Gustavus Coulson. In 1907, the posthumous policy was reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the remaining six officers and men. Although the Victoria Cross warrant was not amended to specifically include posthumous awards until 1920, one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.|$|E
