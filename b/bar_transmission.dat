40|$|OBJECTIVES. Condoms are {{designed}} to <b>bar</b> <b>transmission</b> of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but they sometimes fail. This paper explores the effect of experience with condoms on condom failure among gay men. METHODS. Risk of condom failure (breakage or slippage) on a single occasion is estimated for four sexual acts reported over 12 months by a sample of gay New York City men (n = 741). The estimation procedure assumes that each episode in which a condom is used is an independent event. Evidence is offered to support this assumption. RESULTS. Risk of condom failure in a single episode was fairly high, particularly in anal intercourse, for men who had engaged in each act {{only a few times}} in the previous year. It declined rapidly with experience (e. g., to below 1 % for receptive anal intercourse after about 10 episodes in the previous year). Condoms failed less often in oral than anal sex, but estimated risk of failure also decreased with experience. CONCLUSIONS. Gay men should be especially cautious the first few times they use a condom; after moderate experience, however, they may expect a low risk of condom failure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNumerical {{simulations}} of mechanical loadings on pyrotechnic structures require {{the determination of}} the friction coefficient between steel and explosives. Our study focuses on contact pressures of around 100 [*]MPa and sliding velocities of around 10 [*]m/s. Explosives are brittle materials which fracture when submitted to such pressures in uniaxial compression. They have therefore to be confined to avoid any fracture during the tests. A new Hopkinson bar device which simultaneously enables to confine a sample and rub it on steel has therefore been designed. This device is composed of two coaxial <b>transmission</b> <b>bars.</b> It consists in a cylindrical sample confined in a steel tube, the cylindrical sample being inserted between the incident bar and the internal <b>transmission</b> <b>bar,</b> and the confinement tube being leant against the external <b>transmission</b> <b>bar.</b> The high impedance of the external <b>transmission</b> <b>bar</b> keeps the confinement tube quasi-motionless whereas the impedance of the internal <b>transmission</b> <b>bar</b> is calculated to reach the desired pressure and the desired velocity at the tube–sample interface.

40|$|Dynamic {{fracture}} toughness of engineering materials at loading rates greater than 10 6 MPa m / s is widely investigated using the modified Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus. For accurate measurement of dynamic {{fracture toughness}}, {{it is essential}} to thoroughly understand the dynamic effects excited by the stress wave, such as stress wave propagation characteristics in bars/cracked specimen, the contact situation between the specimen and loading point or supports, and the dynamic response of the fracture specimen. In this work, full transient dynamic analysis techniques are used to comprehend “loss of contact” situation of cracked fracture specimen with an incident bar (impactor) and a <b>transmission</b> <b>bar</b> (supports) in a Hopkinson bar loaded two-bar/three-point bend test.

The parameters included in this model are determined by 3 D numerical Voronoi model and experiments.

A tensile wave was created by impacting the weight bar with a ram and having the initial compression wave reflect as a tensile wave off the free end [...] Another breakthrough in the SHPB design was done by Nichols who used a typical compression setup and threaded metallic specimens on both the incident and transmission ends, while placing a composite collar over the specimen. The specimen had a snug fit on the incident and transmission side in order to bypass an initial compression wave. Nichols setup would create an initial compression wave by an impact in the incident end with a striker, but when the compression wave reached the specimen, the threads would not be loaded. The compression wave would ideally pass through the composite collar and then reflect off the free end in tension. The tensile wave would then pull on the specimen. [...] The next loading method was revolutionized by Ogawa in 1984. A hollow striker was used to impact a flange that is threaded to end on an incident bar. This striker was propelled by using either a gas gun or a rotating disk. The specimen was once again attached to the incident and <b>transmission</b> <b>bar</b> via threading.|$|R

Light transmission characteristics are then studied quantitatively using a lateral effect detector to dynamically track a thin He-Ne laser beam as it wanders under the influence of the passing coherent structures. The study finds that the spanwise coherent structures generate systematic deflections of the light beam in the streamwise direction; the greatest deflections occur near the trailing edges of the structures at a formation called the cusp, where the high-speed fluid and low-speed fluid are entrained into the vortex core. The streamwise coherent structures, which form later in the mixing layer's development than the spanwise structures, generate substantial beam deflections in the span-wise direction which are closely associated with the streamwise streaks in plan-view shadowgraphs. The rms fluctuations of the streamwise and spanwise deflection angles increase rapidly during mixing transition, peaking at 380 high-speed-side momentum thicknesses downstream from the splitter plate, then decrease far down-stream to asymptotic values of 0. 6 to 0. 8 as scaled by the static pressure and the Gladstone-Dale constant shift across the mixing layer.

40|$|The {{present report}} focuses on testing and {{modeling}} strain rate dependent compressive and fracture strengths of unidirectional fiber reinforced composites by using off-axis specimens. Experimental results in split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests with AS 4 / 3501 - 6 off-axis specimens showed large bending wave existing {{in the incident}} <b>bar</b> and <b>transmission</b> <b>bar</b> because of the strong interface friction induced by the direct contacts between the stiff fiber ends and loading surfaces, thus the extension-shear coupling was prevented fully developing in the off-axis specimens under compression and the one-dimensional wave propagation assumption in the SHPB analysis was violated. Through the vapor deposition technique a thin titanium layer is coated on both specimen ends, smooth sliding between loading surfaces and specimen ends assures the pressure is the only interaction. Stress-strain curves are generated at different strain rate using this type of specimens with various off-axis angles under strain controlled testing mode. From these curves a rate-dependent viscoplasticity constitutive model is developed to predict the stress-strain relations at various strain rates and a compressive strength model is established from the viscoplasticity model for AS 4 / 3501 - 6 carbon/epoxy composite. Comparison between the model predictions and experimental results shows good agreement and indicates that the compressive strength model obtained by using low strain rate test data is valid for high strain rate too. From the established rate dependent compressive strength model, the longitudinal compressive strengths at various strain rates are predicted. Through an extrapolation technique proposed in the work, rate dependent 0 ° compressive strengths of unidirectional AS 4 / 3501 - 6 composite are obtained from off-axis test data and compared to model predictions. By utilizing the advantage of off-axis specimens that a combined stress state {{can be obtained from}} a simple uniaxial loading, a new method to perform mode II fracture tests is presented which involves using off-axis specimen by properly introducing a pre-crack in the specimen along the fiber direction. Static off-axis fracture tests are conducted with S 2 / 8552 glass/epoxy composite at various off-axis angles and finite element (FE) method is used to evaluate the critical mode II energy release rate (fracture toughness). Note that the crack surface is not frictionless and existence of pressure on the crack surfaces, crack surface friction is considered in the FE analysis and it is found that the virtual crack closure method is still valid in the presence of crack surface friction. Different crack surface frictions are obtained by varying the off-axis angle and friction effect on mode II fracture toughness of S 2 / 8552 glass/epoxy composite is found to increase as off-axis angle increases. Moreover, the transverse compressive stress is found to have significant effect on mode II energy release rate from FE analysis. The small size of block off-axis specimen makes it possible to perform dynamic fracture tests on a SHPB setup and high crack propagation speed is obtained with this type of specimen. By defining a time rate of mode II energy release rate GcII 2 ̆ 6 d 2; to represent the load rate or using average strain rate of the off-axis specimen, it is found that the dynamic initiation mode II fracture toughness is larger than the static value of mode II fracture toughness and a load rate effect is observed.

40|$|Abstract-A {{technique}} is developed {{for measuring the}} flow stress of metals over {{a broad range of}} strains, strain rates, and temperatures, in uniaxial compression. It utilizes a recent, enhanced version of the classical (Kolsky) compression split Hopkinson bar [l], in which a sample is subjected to a single stress pulse of a predefined profile, and then recovered without being subjected to any other additional loading. For the present application, the UCSD’s split Hopkinson bar is further enhanced by the addition of a new mechanism by means of which the incident and <b>transmission</b> <b>bars</b> of the split Hopkinson construction are moved into a constant-temperature furnace containing the sample, and gently brought into contact with the sample, as the elastic stress pulse reaches and loads the sample. The sample’s temperature is measured by thermocouples which also hold the sample in the furnace. Since straining at high strain rates increases the sample’s temperature, the sample is allowed to attain the furnace temperature after each controlled incremental loading, and then is reloaded. using the same stress pulse and strain rate. The technique also allows for checking any recoveries that may occur during unloading and reloading. Using several samples of the same material and testing them at the same strain rate and temperature, but different incremental strains, an accurate estimate of the material’s isothermal flow stress can be obtained. Additionally, the modified Hopkinson technique allows the direct measurement of the change in the (hig...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- During {{stress wave}} {{propagation}} through a composite material, the wave velocities through the fiber and matrix {{will be different}} because {{of the differences in}} their respective modulus and density. The stresses generated in the constituent components will accordingly be related to the wave velocities. In a typical Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) experiment the composite coupon is held in-between the incidence and <b>transmission</b> <b>bars</b> and a global response is obtained. While this provides a basis of comparison between various material systems, the information is not sufficient to predict failure of the composite precisely. One needs to know the individual response of fiber and matrix for an accurate failure analysis. However, the existing SHPB formulations are not capable of extracting individual response from a regular test set up. In the current investigation, a set of mathematical equations have been derived from the momentum concept so that the individual strain and stress response of fiber and matrix can be estimated from the regular SHPB tests. Coaxial cylindrical coupons have been designed and fabricated for this purpose. Test results indicate that there is a good correlation between the predicted and experimental data especially at lower strain rates. It is also observed that during a compressive stress pulse propagation fiber embedded by the surrounding matrix can take almost one order higher stress than the matrix. Details of the mathematical derivations and experimental procedures are described in the paper...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique has}} been developed {{that is capable of}} (1) controlling the triaxial stress state in the specimen, (2) dynamically loading the specimen in multiaxial compression, and (3) allowing the recovery of the sample after loaded by a single and well-defined pulse for the characterization of the failure mode. Hydrostatic pressure is introduced to the test section of a compression Kolsky bar to create dynamic triaxial loading conditions on sand specimens. Both the test section and the free end of the <b>transmission</b> <b>bar</b> in a Kolsky bar setup are fitted with two hydraulic pressure chambers. After a desired hydrostatic pressure is applied to the specimen, an impact-generated axial load is applied through the incident bar for characterizing the dynamic shear response. Quasi-static and dynamic triaxial compression experiments have been performed on Quikrete # 1961 ® fine grain dry sand. The sand specimens are confined triaxially and the amount of confining pressure (25 - 150 MPa) is varied by controlling hydraulic pressure. The profile of the dynamic loading pulse is controlled through pulse shaping such that the specimens deform at constant axial engineering strain rates under uniform dynamic stresses. The experimental results show that the compressive stress-strain response of the sand is sensitive to hydrostatic pressure levels but insensitive to strain rates. After test, specimens are investigated using gradation, particle breakage factor and surface morphology. The effect of dynamic loading on the failure behavior of sand grain shows ductile to brittle failure transition. ...|$|R

The typical configuration of such GISs is double <b>bar</b> with two <b>transmission</b> line bays, two transformer bays and a coupling bay. Overhead transmission lines and power transformers are connected to the GIS using either insulated cables or Gas Insulated Lines (GILs) of different length. The protection of the power transformers against lightning overvoltages is performed with surge arresters at the connection point of the overhead lines with either the insulated cables or the GILs. This paper reports an exhaustive study conducted by Iberdrola aimed at assessing the performance of the protective scheme in three configurations in both 132 kV and 220 kV stations: 1. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using GILSs. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using GILs. 2. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using insulated cables. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using insulated cables. 3. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using insulated cables. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS using GILs. Very detailed models of the stations for electromagnetic transient simulation have been developed using manufacturer data of the GISs, insulated cables, GILs, power transformers and surge arresters. The study has comprised simulation of a reference case of each configuration and several sensitivity studies with respect to the length of the insulated cables and the GILs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Community {{outbreaks}} of serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease are increasing in North America (L. H. Harrison, JAMA 273 : 419 - 421, 1995; L. A. Jackson, A. Schuchat, M. W. Reeves, and J. D. Wenger, JAMA 273 : 382 - 389, 1995; C. M. Whalen, J. C. Hockin, A. Ryan, and F. Ashton, JAMA 273 : 390 - 394). In a recent 15 -month university outbreak, disease {{was linked to}} patronage of a specific campus-area bar, suggesting that aspects of a campus bar environment might promote meningococcal transmission (P. B. Imrey, L. A. Jackson, P. H. Ludwinski, et al., Am. J. Epidemiol., in press). To investigate this hypothesis, oropharyngeal carriage results from samples taken from 867 university health service clients and 85 campus-area bar employees during the last 3 months of the outbreak were analyzed to determine factors correlated with carriage of any strain of Neisseria meningitidis. Results were validated with data from samples from 344 health center clients and 211 campus bar employees taken 8 months after the last outbreak case. Recent alcohol consumption (adjusted prevalence odds ratio = 3. 8 for > 15 versus 0 drinks in last week [P = 0. 0012]) and campus bar patronage (adjusted odds ratio = 1. 9 for any versus no patronage in last 2 weeks [P = 0. 0122]) showed separate effects in both univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses of data from the 1992 health center clients. Prevalence of meningococcal carriage among 1992 campus bar workers was 3. 8 times that among health center clients; this prevalence ratio was roughly 2. 5 after adjustment for alcohol consumption and bar patronage. Recent antibiotic usage was protective (prevalence odds ratio = 0. 3) among health center clients and bar workers. These findings were generally supported by the validation samples. If alcohol consumption {{and other aspects of}} the campus <b>bar</b> environment facilitate <b>transmission</b> of and/or colonization by N. meningitidis, then the introduction of a highly pathogenic substrain into the campus bar environment may provide an unusual opportunity for invasive meningococcal disease within a campus community...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Malaria {{remains a}} heavy burden across sub-Saharan Africa where {{transmission}} is maintained {{by some of the}} world's most efficient vectors. Indoor insecticide-based control measures have significantly reduced transmission, yet elimination remains a distant target. Knowing the relative abundance of the primary vector species can provide transmission models with much needed information to guide targeted control measures. Moreover, understanding how existing interventions are impacting on these relative abundances highlights where alternative control (e. g., larval source management) is needed. METHODS: Using the habitat suitability probabilities generated by predictive species distribution models combined with data collated from the literature, a multinomial generalized additive model was applied to produce relative abundance estimates for Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae/Anopheles coluzzii. Using pre- and post-intervention abundance data, estimates of the effect of indoor insecticide-based interventions on these relative abundances were made and are illustrated in post-intervention maps. RESULTS: Conditional effect plots and relative abundance maps illustrate the individual species' predicted habitat suitability and how they interact when in sympatry. Anopheles arabiensis and An. funestus show an affinity in habitat preference at the expense of An. gambiae/An. coluzzii, whereas increasing habitat suitability for An. gambiae/An. coluzzii is conversely less suitable for An. arabiensis but has little effect on An. funestus. Indoor insecticide-based interventions had a negative impact on the relative abundance of An. funestus, and a lesser effect on An. arabiensis. Indoor residual spraying had the greatest impact on the relative abundance of An. funestus, and a lesser effect on An. gambiae/An. coluzzii. Insecticide-treated bed nets reduced the relative abundance of both species equally. These results do not indicate changes in the absolute abundance of these species, which may be reduced for all species overall. CONCLUSIONS: The maps presented here highlight the interactions between the primary vector species in sub-Saharan Africa and demonstrate that An. funestus is more susceptible to certain indoor-based insecticide interventions than An. gambiae/An. coluzzii, which in turn, is more susceptible than An. arabiensis. This may provide An. arabiensis with a competitive advantage where it is found in sympatry with other more endophilic vectors, and potentially increase the need for outdoor-based vector interventions to deal with any residual <b>transmission</b> <b>barring</b> the way to malaria elimination...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{generator}} {{technologies have}} been widely researched and documented. Modern wind generator systems are now being implemented with an output power of up to 5 MVA. They adopt power electronic control systems which allow the system to operate {{with a wide range}} of turbine shaft speeds, as well as with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms to maximise the energy delivery to the power system. Despite the extensive development, maximum power transfer from the total available power in the wind gusts to the grid is limited by the mechanical and electrical losses in the generation process. A Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) uses a two stage power converter process in the rotor circuit which contributes to the electrical losses in the system. By adopting a Matrix Converter (MC), the electrical losses may be reduced as the power conversation is conducted as a single stage process. This thesis presents existing variable speed generator technologies with a focus on DFIG systems. Based on this research, an alternative design for a DFIG control system using an MC is developed and analysed. The work begins with the presentation of existing DFIG systems using back-to-back PWM converters connected between the rotor circuit and the grid. The study examines MC technology and the application of current commutation techniques to MC systems. A non-ideal MC model and commutation controller is developed in the PSCAD / EMTDC environment. Simulation and analysis are conducted on the MC system connected to a passive load to determine its suitability for application in DFIG systems. The MC is connected to the rotor circuit of the DFIG system in the simulation and analysis is carried out to investigate the viability of the system. From this the MC excited DFIG is extended with the development of a hybrid Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm. The wind generator system is tested using pseudo-random wind speeds with varying wind gusts. The results of the simulation are presented and compared with existing MPPT technologies to assess the overall performance of the system in relation to existing technologies. Finally, the MC excited DFIG control system is adapted to provide reactive power compensation to the power system for the regulation of voltage in distribution networks. Testing of the system using a variable load connected to a common bus <b>bar</b> and single <b>transmission</b> line is conducted. Observations from the simulation show that VAr compensation from the DFIG system does reduce voltage fluctuations in power systems...|$|R
