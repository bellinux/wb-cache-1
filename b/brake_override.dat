25|$|Toyota {{recalled}} {{and replaced}} 55,000 optional all-weather rubber floor mats from the Toyota Camry and ES 350 in September 2007, citing {{the risk of}} unsecured mats jamming the accelerator pedal. In August 2009, the NHTSA probed the ES 350 following 40 acceleration control complaints, eight crashes and 12 injuries, with floor mats implicated in most cases. An accident involving a loaner ES 350 killed four persons near San Diego on 28 August. The NHTSA and San Diego County Sheriff's Department found that the car was wrongly fitted with an unsecured SUV rubber floor mat; the mat had jammed the accelerator, which an earlier driver had complained about. On 29 September, a Toyota safety notice advised floor mat removal, shift to Neutral (N) gear in an emergency, with a 3-second push button ignition press for engine shutoff. On 29 November, the 2007–2010 MY floor mat recall was revised to add shorter accelerator pedals, thinner replacement mats, and a <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> feature which ignores accelerator input when the brake pedal is depressed.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, {{the revised}} ES line gained a <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> feature which ignored {{accelerator}} input when the brake pedal was depressed, which was installed on new builds from January 2010. Debuting {{first in the}} Chinese auto market, the 2010 ES lineup added a second model, the ES 240 (ACV40), which was produced {{to comply with the}} country's new emission laws for luxury cars, making it the first gasoline four-cylinder Lexus since the 2005 IS. The ES 240 received a 2.4L 2AZ-FE inline-four engine producing [...] and [...] of torque at 4000 rpm.|$|E
25|$|Safety rules: The safety {{requirements}} on {{the rolling stock}} will be {{similar to those of}} other long Swiss tunnels, including the ability for the emergency <b>brake</b> to be <b>overridden.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For {{drive-by-wire}} automobiles, a brake-accelerator interlock switch, or [...] "smart throttle" [...] {{would eliminate}} {{or at least}} curtail any instance of unintended acceleration not a result of pedal misapplication by causing the <b>brake</b> to <b>override</b> the throttle. An unintended acceleration event would require the failure of such a mechanism if it were present. Such a solution would not be applicable to older vehicles lacking a drive-by-wire throttle.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Edmunds.com {{also tested}} the {{stopping}} distances of a Toyota Camry SE V6 with a purposely stuck wide-open throttle. Their tests {{found that the}} car's <b>brakes</b> could <b>override</b> a stuck accelerator and bring the car to a stop. Although the transmission downshifted and the engine continued to propel the car, stopping distance compared [...] "favorably to a normal panic stop on wet asphalt." [...] Edmunds.com did note that switching to neutral was the best option, given that average drivers may not press the brakes as firmly, and lighter presses will simply wear the brakes down. The German Commission on Technical Compliance (TÜV) of Rheinland also tested the stopping distance of Toyota iQ, Aygo, Yaris, Auris, Verso, Avensis and RAV4 models. With the accelerator purposely jammed to 80% of maximum speed, each vehicle was able to brake safely to a halt. The TÜV findings indicated that each model met the legal requirements for deceleration and stopping distances, and that all Toyota models tested had <b>brakes</b> which could <b>override</b> a stuck accelerator.|$|R
2500|$|On 26 September 2007, Toyota {{recalled}} the optional [...] "all-weather" [...] heavy-duty rubber floor mats from 2007 and 2008 model year Toyota Camry XV40s sold in North America. Toyota issued a second recall on 2 November 2009 asking owners {{to remove the}} driver floor mat and not replace it with {{any other type of}} mat. Toyota extended its floor mat recall on 25 November to reconfigure the accelerator pedal, replace the all-weather floor mats, and install a <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> system to prevent sudden unintended acceleration. Toyota issued a fourth unwanted acceleration-related recall for the Camry on 21 January 2010, this time in response to reports of accelerator pedals sticking in models without floor mats. Evaluations by Car and Driver and Edmunds found that the Camry's brakes were powerful enough to overcome the accelerator in all tests, bringing the car safely to a stop.|$|E
50|$|Collision {{avoidance}} {{assist with}} <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> and 4 ultrasound sonar sensors was an option.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> system, which cuts {{engine power}} if both the {{accelerator}} and brake are detected as pressed, will be installed.|$|E
50|$|European Citroën,Mercedes Benz,Peugeot,Renault {{as well as}} some Ford car and van {{models have}} driver-controlled speed {{limiters}} fitted or available as an optional accessory which can be set by the driver to any desired speed; the limiter can be overridden if required by pressing hard on the accelerator.The limiter may be considered as setting the maximum speed (with throttle kickdown to override it) easing the throttle to reduce speed, whereas cruise control sets the minimum speed (with the <b>brake</b> pedal to <b>override</b> it) pressing on the throttle to increase speed. The limiter may shift down through automatic gears to hold the maximum speed.|$|R
50|$|Hill Descent Control (HDC) {{allows a}} smooth and {{controlled}} hill descent in rough terrain without the driver needing {{to touch the}} brake pedal. When on, the vehicle will descend using the ABS brake system to control each wheel's speed. If the vehicle accelerates without driver input, the system will automatically apply the brakes to slow down to the desired vehicle speed. Cruise control buttons can adjust the speed to a comfortable level. Applying pressure to the accelerator or <b>brake</b> pedal will <b>override</b> the HDC system when the driver requires. The other name for this is Hill Mode Descent Control.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} the on-road driving performance {{of patients with}} glaucoma. METHODS. The sample comprised 20 patients with glaucoma and 20 subjects with normal vision, all licensed drivers, matched for age and sex. Driving performance was tested over a 10 -km route incorporating 55 standardized maneuvers and skills through residential and business districts of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Testing was conducted by a professional driving instructor and assessed by an occupational therapist certified in driver rehabilitation, masked to participant group membership and level of vision. Main outcome measures were total number of satisfactory maneuvers and skills, overall rating, and incidence of at-fault critical interventions (application of the dual <b>brake</b> and/or steering <b>override</b> by the driving instructor to prevent a potentially unsafe maneuver). Measures of visual function included visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and visual fields (Humphrey Field Analyzer; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA; mean deviation [MD] and binocular Esterman points). RESULTS. There {{was no significant difference}} between patients with glaucoma (mean MD = − 1. 7 dB [SD 2. 2] and − 6. 5 dB [SD 4. 9], better and worse eyes, respectively) and control subjects in total satisfactory maneuvers and skills (P = 0. 65), or overall rating (P = 0. 60). However, 12 (60 %) patients with glaucoma had one or more at-fault critical interventions, compared with 4 (20 %) control subjects (odds ratio = 6. 00, 95 % CI, 1. 46 – 24. 69; higher still after adjustment for age, sex, medications and driving exposure), the predominant reason being failure to see and yield to a pedestrian. In the glaucoma group, worse-eye MD was associated with the overall rating of driving (r = 0. 66, P = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS. This sample of patients with glaucoma with slight to moderate visual field impairment performed many real-world driving maneuvers safely. However, they were six times as likely as subjects with normal vision to have a driving instructor intervene for reasons suggesting difficulty with detection of peripheral obstacles and hazards and reaction to unexpected events. <br /...|$|R

5000|$|On November 25, 2009 Toyota amended its {{floor mat}} recall {{involving}} the same 3.8 millionvehicles sold in North America. Toyota will reconfigure the accelerator pedal, replace the all-weather floor mats with thinner mats, and install a <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> system to prevent unwanted acceleration. The <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> system, also called [...] "brake to idle" [...] and already a common design in German cars, allows {{the driver to}} override the accelerator by hitting the brakes. In a follow-up statement, the NHTSA announced the November 25, 2009 recall details as a [...] "vehicle-based remedy" [...] to address the floor mat pedal issue. According to Toyota, the repair work done under the amended recall for floor mat incursion problems are as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|For the 2012 model year, the Mitsubishi Eclipse {{receives}} three (slight) changes: <b>Brake</b> <b>override</b> logic, a clear lip spoiler on the GT trim, and one new exterior color. This was {{the final}} model year, albeit a short run because production ended in August 2011.|$|E
5000|$|In its November 25, 2009 announcement, Toyota {{stated that}} dealers would be {{instructed}} first {{on how to}} reshape the accelerator pedal forthe repair.

Only trains with emergency <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> are allowed {{to operate in the}} airport tunnel. A fire alarm system was also installed on the class 143 locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|Toyota {{has also}} been sued for not having a <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> system on older models. Attorney Robert Nelson, {{representing}} Jacquelyn Donoghue of Holder, Nebraska, the 67-year-old widow of a man killed in an accident in which her model year 2006 Prius allegedly suddenly accelerated into another vehicle, killing the man and seriously injuring her, alleged that Toyotas failure to include a <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> on their models played a [...] "direct role" [...] {{in the death of}} John Donoghue. Edgar Heiskell, an attorney involved with one of the lawsuits, contends that electromagnetic interference with the electronic throttle control system is to blame for acceleration cases. Heiskell contends that Toyota models as old as 2002 are also affected. According to him, [...] "Toyota cant tell you that the 07 Camry they are recalling is any different from the 06 or the 03 that has the same throttle control in it." [...] According to the Wall Street Journals Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., [...] "trial lawyers love the electronic gremlin theory because its impossible to disprove in any individual case." ...|$|E
50|$|Toyota stopped {{producing}} {{vehicles on}} certain production lines {{for the week}} ofFebruary 1, 2010, to assess and coordinate activities. The NorthAmerica vehicle production facilities affected were located inCambridge and Woodstock, Ontario,Canada (where Corolla, Matrix, and RAV4 models are produced),Princeton, Indiana (Highlander and Sequoia), Georgetown, Kentucky(Avalon and Camry), and San Antonio, Texas (Tundra).

50|$|On whether braking alone {{may fail}} to stop {{affected}} vehicles, a driver account in the Los Angeles Times claimed that the attempt to stop a 2005 Camry was unsuccessful with both the brake and emergency brake. However, tests of the Camry by Car and Driver in 2009, attempting to use the brakes to stop acceleration of a purposely stuck throttle at 70, 100, and 120 mph, found that the test driver was able to reduce speed to 10 mph in all instances, and in the 70 and 100 mph tests, stop the car completely. The Camry's braking distances with a purposely stuck accelerator were also shorter {{than that of the}} Ford Taurus' regular stopping distance. Car and Driver concluded that, based on their emergency stopping tests, the Camry's brakes could overcome the accelerator in all cases even without a <b>brake</b> <b>override,</b> and that stopping distances with a wide-open throttle were largely indiscernible from regular braking.|$|E

5000|$|On March 12, 2010, Autoline Detroit {{argued that}} {{searches}} for additional vehicle defects were likely fruitless, as driver error {{was the primary}} cause of the 0.009 per million rate of Toyota sudden acceleration incidents from 1999 to 2009, with [...] "demographics and psychographics", namely elderly drivers and pedal misapplication as factors. Also noted was that drivers with Type II diabetes (adult onset), which is more common among the elderly, are subject to reduced sensation in their lower extremities (peripheral neuropathy) with related impairment in positional knowledge of foot placement (proprioception). Wired wrote that since investigators have been [...] "unable to find evidence supporting drivers’ claims their Toyotas suddenly raced out of control" [...] operator error is the most likely explanation. However, victims and relatives of sudden acceleration cases are commonly unwilling to suspect involved loved ones, and blame the vehicle instead. [...] Analysis of alleged Toyota acceleration reports in The Atlantic and other sources have found the highest distribution of involved drivers between 70 and 80 years old, with the average age skewing over 55; with elderly susceptibility to [...] "neuronal misfiring" [...] and pedal misapplication as a possible cause. While many alleged cases lack exact details, over half of reported incidents occurred from a complete stop or low speed, providing a window for the pedal misapplication to occur. A prior GM study found that 60- and 70-year-olds were six times more likely to experience sudden acceleration than 20- to 30-year-olds. In the New York Times, Richard Schmidt concluded that a <b>brake</b> <b>override</b> system could prevent acceleration cases where a vehicle defect existed, but would not prevent sudden acceleration cases caused by pedal misapplication.|$|E
