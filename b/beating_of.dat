5|$|CSF {{moves in}} a single outward {{direction}} from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space. Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> the heart. Some authors dispute this, posing {{that there is no}} unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.|$|E
5|$|When prey is swallowed, it is {{liquefied}} in the pharynx by enzymes and by muscular contractions of the pharynx. The resulting slurry is wafted {{through the}} canal system by the <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> the cilia, and digested by the nutritive cells. The ciliary rosettes in the canals {{may help to}} transport nutrients to muscles in the mesoglea. The anal pores may eject unwanted small particles, but most unwanted matter is regurgitated via the mouth.|$|E

5|$|The Jena Six {{were six}} black {{teenagers}} in Jena, Louisiana, {{convicted in the}} 2006 <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> Justin Barker, a white student at the local Jena High School, which they also attended. Barker was injured on December 4, 2006, {{by the members of}} the Jena Six, and received treatment at an emergency room. While the case was pending, it was often cited by some media commentators as an example of racial injustice in the United States. Some commentators believed that the defendants had been charged initially with too-serious offenses and had been treated unfairly.|$|E

5|$|The lophophore and mantle are {{the only}} {{surfaces}} that absorb oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide. Oxygen seems to be distributed by the fluid of the coelom, which is circulated through the mantle and driven either by contractions of {{the lining of the}} coelom or by <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> its cilia. In some species oxygen is partly carried by the respiratory pigment hemerythrin, which is transported in coelomocyte cells.The maximum oxygen consumption of brachiopods is low, and their minimum requirement is not measurable.|$|E

5|$|The {{violence}} was worse in Huế, where {{the approach of}} government forces was met by the <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> Buddhist drums and cymbals to alert the populace. The townsfolk left {{their homes in the}} middle of the night in an attempt to defend the city's pagodas. At Từ Đàm, the temple of Buddhist protest leader Thích Trí Quang, monks attempted to burn the coffin of a monk who had self-immolated recently. Government soldiers, firing M1 rifles, overran the pagoda and confiscated the coffin. They demolished a statue of Gautama Buddha and looted and vandalized the pagoda. They then set off an explosion, leveling much of the pagoda. Many Buddhists were shot, beheaded, confiscated, and clubbed to death.|$|E
5|$|Ependymal cells {{actively}} regulate neuronal fate {{specification of}} adult neural precursors through release of Noggin. <b>Beating</b> <b>of</b> the cilia of ependymal cells appears {{to set up}} concentration gradients of guidance molecules, such as cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), to direct migration of neuroblasts, {{such as in the}} RMS. Microglia also actively regulate adult neurogenesis. Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from the niche by unactivated microglia in the adult SGZ. Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult neurogenesis, depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action. In one study, the activation of microglia and recruitment of T cells were suggested to be required for enriched environment-induced SGZ neurogenesis, suggesting a possible role in the RMS.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Johnson had {{his second}} best {{statistical}} season of his NFL career, reaching a career-high 1,681 receiving yards and 16touchdowns. In Week 4 against the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson helped rally the Lions from a 24-point deficit to a 3430 victory by catching two touchdown {{passes in the}} fourth quarter, including a famous catch in which Johnson beat the Cowboys' triple coverage in the end zone. This performance gave Johnson eighttouchdown receptions through the first four {{games of the season}} and tied Cris Carter for most consecutive games with multiple touchdown receptions with four. In a Week17 game against the Green Bay Packers, Johnson had a then career-best 244receiving yards in a 4541 loss. Johnson and the Lions clinched a playoff spot {{for the first time since}} 1999, and the first time in Johnson's career, after a 3810 <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> the San Diego Chargers on Christmas Eve.|$|E

5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E
5|$|The Festival des Arts du Pacifique, the Festival of Pacific Arts, is {{organized}} every four years. Dancers {{are trained in}} traditional dances in special workshops. Welcome dances performed by groups are very popular. Of the various dance forms, the pilou-pilou dance is a unique dance form of the Kanaks, which recounts many stories of the clans. The pilou-pilou dance form of the Kanaks, now almost extinct, was so named by the early French missionaries of New Caledonia and involved stomping with bamboo tubes and <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> bark-clappers accompanied by singing in duets with shrieks and whistles of hundreds of dancers. However, in view of very strong nature of this form of dance, with a trance-like status attained by the dancers, these have been banned; the last such dance reported was in 1951.|$|E

5000|$|In the Havanese style, this accent {{falls on}} a syncopated {{note on the}} third <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> the measure, configurating a very well known rhythmic pattern (one, two, three, cick).In the Conga from Santiago, the {{stressed}} <b>beats</b> <b>of</b> the measure are more emphasized, thus inducing a powerful impulse feeling, which incites to move the feet along with the rhythmic pulse. In this case, the drum accent is played between the fourth <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> the previous measure and {{the first of the}} following measure.|$|R
