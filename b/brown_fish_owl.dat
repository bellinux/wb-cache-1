50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> breed from November to April, with {{activity}} tending to peak a bit {{earlier in the}} north of their breeding range and a bit later in the more tropical south of their breeding range. The breeding season is concurrent with the dry season, which has the benefit of low water levels and thus crabs and fish being more readily assessible. However, most other owls and diurnal raptors also primarily breed in the dry season as well. As owls do not build nest, <b>brown</b> <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> are somewhat opportunistic when it comes to nesting sites. <b>Brown</b> <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> frequently nest in shady spots such as old-growth mango trees (Mangifera ssp.), fig trees, including Ficus religiosa and Ficus benghalensis, Shorea robusta and other large trees in lowland forests. Outside of the bare surface of large branches, nests are often in spots such as overgrown eroded ravines and steep riverbanks with natural holes. However, it may also nest near suitable villages, along wet roadsides, jheels, canals and rice fields. Usually nest are large natural holes, in hollows or at the base of large branches. Deserted nest built by fish eagles and vultures are also sometimes used as nesting locations. Other nesting sites have included rock ledges, caves in shady cliff faces and stone ruins. The clutch is two or occasionally just one egg. 10 eggs in India averaged 58.4 x 48.9 mm in sizes, with eggs of <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> to the north averaging slightly larger. Incubation is 38 days or somewhat less, and the young fledge after about 7 weeks. The downy chicks are mostly an off-white color and develop into a paler version of adults by their second year.|$|R
50|$|This typical owl {{is found}} in {{subtropical}} to temperate forests in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, and Vietnam. They inhabit the Himalayan foothills from Kashmir and Garhwal east to the mountains of Laos and Vietnam and in southern China up to Chekiang and Anhwei. They require forest tracts and duars bearing mountain streams. In areas such as Darjeeling and Nepal, they commonly live at elevations of 1500 to 2450 m. It more less replaces the buffy <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> (Bubo ketupu) in range and at one time they {{were considered to be}} of the same species.

Unlike the <b>brown</b> and buffy <b>fish</b> <b>owls,</b> they are found only in remote wilderness with little to no disturbance. Those other two <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> (but not the Blakiston's species) can adapt to living and hunting near human habitations or human-altered areas, such as canals, paddy fields, reservoirs, ornamental ponds and villages, which provides them a boon of ornamental and commercial fishes.|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} an all-year {{resident}} throughout most tropical and subtropical {{parts of the}} Indian Subcontinent to Southeast Asia and adjoining regions. West of its main range, it is patchily distributed to the Levant (possibly extinct) and southern Asia Minor (recently rediscovered). The typical habitat of <b>brown</b> <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> is forest and woodland bordering streams, lakes or rice fields. It inhabits mainly the lowlands, from open woodland to dense forest {{as well as in}} plantations; in the Himalayas foothills it ranges into submontane forest up to 1500 m ASL or so but not higher. It frequently spends the day in stands of bamboo or other large shady trees. They be found around water reservoirs (or jheels in India), along canals, on the outskirts of villages and along sea coasts. Western birds are found in semiarid landscape and may breed in oases in arid regions. Regardless of habitat, it rarely strays far from larger bodies of water such as rivers and lakes.|$|R

50|$|It is more {{correct to}} call this species the Blakiston's eagle owl. This is {{because it is more}} closely related to the Eurasian eagle-owl by studies of the main {{subgenus}} of the species, B. b. dumeril, than to the subgenus of <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> that it was believed to be more close to, i.e. Ketupu. This was proven by osteological (skeleton/bone-related) and DNA-based tests in 2003 by ornithologists/taxonomists Michael Wink and Claus KÃ¶nig, author of Owls of the World. However, the other <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> are not believed to be divergent enough to support a separate genus either and now all <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> are generally also included in the Bubo genus. Given that it shares genetic material osteological characteristics with the eagle-owl and also seems to share some characteristics with the other three <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> (especially the <b>brown</b> species), the place of the Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> in this evolutionary chain is ambiguous. Some authors have wondered whether the Blakiston's represents an intermediate step between traditional eagle-owls and the other <b>fish</b> <b>owls,</b> despite the current gap in distribution between Blakiston's and other <b>fish</b> <b>owls.</b> Whether other Asian eagle-owls with sideways slanting ear-tufts, namely the spot-bellied (B. nipalensis), the barred (B. sumatranus) and especially the somewhat superficially fish owl-like dusky eagle-owl (B. coromandus) are closely related to the <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> and/or the Blakiston's is also unclear. Despite a few authors also include them in Bubo, the <b>fishing</b> <b>owls</b> of Africa, generally classified in the genus Scotopelia, seem to be unrelated in every major way, based on external characteristics, oseology and preliminary genetic materials, to the <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> and it is unclear how, and if, they are related to typical eagle-owls.|$|R
50|$|Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> is {{the largest}} living species of owl. A pair field study of the species showed males {{weighing}} from 2.95 to 3.6 kg, while the female, at up to 2.95 to 4.6 kg, is about 25% larger. Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> measures 60 to 72 cm in total length, and thus measures slightly less at average and maximum length than the great gray owl (Strix nebulosa), a species which has a significantly lower body mass. The Eurasian eagle-owl (B. bubo) is sometimes considered the largest overall living owl species. The three largest races of eagle-owl, all found in Siberia and the Russian Far East, are close in size to the Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl.</b> According to Heimo Mikkola, the very largest specimen of eagle-owl was 30 mm longer in bill-to-tail length than the longest Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl,</b> while the top weight of the two species is exactly the same. The longest great gray owl was 120 mm longer than the biggest Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> but would be about 2.5 times lighter than {{the weight of the}} largest female Blakiston's. However, the average measurements of Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> surpass the average measurements of the Eurasian eagle-owl in the three major categories: weight, length, and wingspan, making Blakiston's the overall largest species of owl. Even the large Siberian races of eagle-owl are slightly smaller on average than the Blakiston's, {{at least in terms of}} body mass and wing size. The maximum wingspan of the Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> is also greater than any known eagle-owl. The wingspan range known for Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> is 178 to 190 cm. The Blakiston's is noticeably larger than the other three extant species of <b>fish</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Sinclair owl (Bubo sinclairi) from Late Pleistocene California {{may have}} been a paleosubspecies of the great horned owl, while the roughly {{contemporary}} Bubo insularis of the central and eastern Mediterranean has been considered a junior synonym of a <b>brown</b> <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> paleosubspecies. Additional paleosubspecies are discussed on the appropriate species page.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} structure, the Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> is {{more similar to}} eagle-owls {{than it is to}} other <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> but it shares a few {{characteristics}} with both types of <b>owl.</b> Like all <b>fish</b> <b>owls,</b> its bill is relatively long, the body relatively husky and wings are relatively long compared to eagle-owls. It also shares with other <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> a comparatively long tarsi, although relative to their size the three smaller <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> have a proportionately longer tarsus. Other than these few characteristics, a Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> skull and skeleton is practically {{the same as that of}} a Eurasian eagle-owl. The talons of the Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> are similar in shape and size to those of the Eurasian eagle-owls. It has been stated that the combination of wavy cross patterns on the underside of the Blakiston's plumage and its huge talons make it look strikingly like an outsized great horned owl (B. virginianus) from below. Two external characteristics that Blakiston's share with eagle-owls, but not with the other <b>fish</b> <b>owls,</b> is that its tarsi are totally feathered and that its wing beats are silent, although apparently the Blakiston's has relatively fewer sound-blocking combs on its wing primaries than the a comparable eagle-owl would. Among standard measurements, which at average and maximum are greater than any other living owl other than tail length, the wing chord measures 447 - 560 mm, the tail measures 243 - 305 mm, the tarsus is 73 - 102 mm and the culmen is around 55 to 71 mm.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fishing</b> <b>owls</b> are a {{group of}} birds in the family Strigidae, the true <b>owls.</b> <b>Fishing</b> <b>owls</b> have {{traditionally}} been placed in the genus Scotopelia, but DNA evidence suggests they {{should be included in}} genus Bubo with the horned owls and eagle-owls.|$|R

50|$|The Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> {{feeds on}} a variety of aquatic prey. The main one is fish, with common prey {{including}} pike (Esox reichertii), catfish, trout and salmon (Oncorhynchus ssp.). Some <b>fish</b> these <b>owls</b> catch are quite large. Jonathan Slaght estimated that some fish caught are up to two to three times their own weight and has seen owls keep one foot on a tree root to be able to haul a large catch onto a bank. In Russia, amphibians are taken in great quantity in spring, especially Dybowski's frog (Rana dybowskii), and may come to seasonally outnumber fish in the diet during that time. Crayfish (Cambaroides ssp.) and other crustaceans are known to be taken in some numbers, but the extent of their importance in the Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl's</b> diet is unknown. Freshwater crabs and secondarily frogs seem to be numerical as important, or sometimes more significant, as a source of food as compared to fish for the three smaller <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> species, other than frogs during spring thus far this has not proven to be the case with the Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl.</b> The only owl species to which fish are more significant to their diet is the <b>fishing</b> <b>owls</b> of Africa. Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> seem to co-exist with Steller's sea eagles (Haliaeetus pelagicus) and white-tailed eagles (H. albicilla) on the coasts of the rocky Kurile Islands but nothing is known how they relate with these larger fish-eating raptors, the presence of which has sometimes been theorized as partially the cause of the restricted range of the Blakiston's due to competition for similar food resources. However, in other raptor communities, diurnal raptors and owls can co-exist successfully given their distinct times of activity. Furthermore, Blakiston's <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> generally dwells in forested areas while sea eagles are more likely to forage near more open wetland or coastal areas.|$|R

Of the four living species of fish owl, it is the most widely distributed, most common and best-studied. It occupies a range of over 7000 km from eastern China to Palestine.|$|E
50|$|The {{plentiful}} avifauna {{population has}} more than 300 species of birds, {{most of which are}} resident. The scavenger group of birds has 6 recorded species of vultures.

5000|$|The Indian {{scops owl}} (Otus bakkamoena) is a {{resident}} species of owl {{found in the}} southern regions of Asia from eastern Arabia through the Indian Subcontinent, except the far north, east across much of Southeast Asia to Indonesia. This species formerly included what has been split out as the collared scops owl (Otus lettia). The species epithet is derived from [...] "bakamuna", the Sinhalese name for the white barn owl (Tyto alba), and the <b>brown</b> <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> (Ketupa zeylonensis).|$|E
50|$|The main prey of Pel's <b>fishing</b> <b>owl</b> is, of course, fish. They {{can take}} fish {{weighing}} at least 2 kg but {{a majority of}} fish caught are much smaller, regularly weighing 100 - 200 g. They are not picky eaters among fish species and any fish that is in a reasonable size range and found close to the water's surface is ready caught and consumed. Compared with the <b>fish</b> <b>owls,</b> the three <b>fishing</b> <b>owls</b> are more completely piscivorous and rarely vary their prey selection from fish. However, seldom, they will also take other aquatic animals such as frogs, crabs, mussels and large insects. In one case, a Pel's <b>fishing</b> <b>owl</b> was observed to predate a baby Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). While perched over the water, these owls detect the movement of fish from ripples {{in the water and}} swoop down to seize their prey with their powerful talons and then swoop back to their perch for consumption. Unlike many other fish-eating birds, Pel's <b>fishing</b> <b>owl</b> rarely submerge themselves or get particularly wet while hunting. More uncommonly, this species will forage by wading into shallow water along sandbanks.|$|R
50|$|The four <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> were {{previously}} generally separated in the genus Ketupa. mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data is equivocal on which genus name is applied for them, and {{today they are}} commonly lumped with the horned and eagle-owls (Bubo) - which they also resemble osteologically very much - for sake of convenience. Depending on whether some little-studied tropical eagle-owls are closer to the fish-owls than to the typical eagle-owls, Ketupa might be a valid genus if these {{as well as the}} <b>fishing</b> <b>owls</b> (formerly Scotopelia) are included in it, although {{there are a number of}} osteological differences that suggest that <b>fishing</b> and <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> are not directly related to each other.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to eagle owls {{of similar}} length, <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> {{tend to be}} even shorter in tail length and even heavier in build, have {{relatively}} larger wings (the tawny and Blakiston's being particularly chunky in shape), have considerably longer legs, and have a rough texture {{to the bottom of}} their toes. At least the latter two features are clear adaptations to aid these <b>owls</b> in capturing <b>fish.</b> Diurnal raptors who feed largely on fish have similar, if not identical, rough texture under their toes, which helps these birds grasp slippery fish. Unlike diurnal raptors who capture fish such as the osprey (Pandion haliaetus) as compared to most terrestrial raptors, the <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> have large, powerful, and curved talons and a longitudinal sharp keel sitting under the middle claw with all having sharp cutting edges that are very much like those of eagle owls. Also, unlike fish-eating diurnal raptors will not submerge any part of their body while hunting, preferring only to put their feet into the water, although <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> will hunt on foot, wading into the shallows. Unlike most owls, the feathers of <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> are not soft to the touch and they lack the comb and hair-like fringes to the primaries, which allow other owls to fly silently in order to ambush their prey. Due to the lack of these feather-specializations, <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> wing beats make sounds. The lack of a deep facial disc in <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> is another indication of the unimportance of sound relative to vision in these owls, as facial disc depth (as well as inner ear size) are directly related to how important sound is to an owl's hunting behavior. Also different from most any other kind of owl, the bill is placed on the face between the eyes rather below it, which is said to impart this <b>fish</b> <b>owl</b> with a [...] "remarkably morose and sinister expression". Similar adaptations, such as unwillingness to submerge beyond their legs and lack of sound-muffling feathers are also seen in the African <b>fishing</b> <b>owls,</b> which {{do not seem to be}} directly related. Due to their neat replacement of each other in range, at one time the tawny and buffy <b>fish</b> <b>owls</b> were considered the same species but there are a number of physical, anatomical, habitat and behavioral distinctions between them.|$|R
