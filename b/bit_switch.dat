40|$|We {{consider}} Hamiltonian quantum {{systems with}} energy bandwidth Δ E {{and show that}} each measurement that determines the time up to an error Δ t generates at least the entropy (ħ/(Δ t Δ E)) ^ 2 / 2. Our result describes quantitatively to what extent all timing information is quantum information in systems with limited energy. It provides a lower bound on the dissipated energy when timing information of microscopic systems is converted to classical information. This is relevant for low power computation since it shows the amount of heat generated whenever a band limited signal controls a classical <b>bit</b> <b>switch.</b> Our result provides a general bound on the information-disturbance trade-off for von-Neumann measurements that distinguish states on the orbits of continuous unitary one-parameter groups with bounded spectrum. In contrast, information gain without disturbance is possible for some completely positive semi-groups. This shows that readout of timing information can be possible without entropy generation if the autonomous dynamical evolution of the clock is dissipative itself.

40|$|The elucidation upon fly's {{neuronal}} patterns as a link {{to computer}} graphics and memory cards I/O's, is investigated for the phenomenon by propounding a unified theory of Einstein's two known relativities. It is conclusive that flies could contribute {{a certain amount of}} neuromatrices indicating an imagery function of a visual-computational system into computer graphics and storage systems. The visual system involves the time aspect, whereas flies possess faster pulses compared to humans' visual ability due to the E-field state on an active fly's eye surface. This behaviour can be tested on a dissected fly specimen at its ommatidia. Electro-optical contacts and electrodes are wired through the flesh forming organic emitter layer to stimulate light emission, thereby to a computer circuit. The next step is applying a threshold voltage with secondary voltages to the circuit denoting an array of essential electrodes for <b>bit</b> <b>switch.</b> As a result, circuit's dormant pulses versus active pulses at the specimen's area are recorded. The outcome matrix possesses a construction of RGB and time radicals expressing the time problem in consumption, allocating time into computational algorithms, enhancing the technology far beyond. The obtained formulation generates consumed distance cons(x), denoting circuital travel between data source/sink for pixel data and bendable wavelengths. Once 'image logic' is in place, incorporating this point of graphical acceleration permits one to enhance graphics and optimize immensely central processing, data transmissions between memory and computer visual system. The phenomenon can be mainly used in 360 -deg. display/viewing, 3 D scanning techniques, military and medicine, a robust and cheap substitution for e. g. pre-motion pattern analysis, real-time rendering and LCDs.

40|$|Power {{consumption}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important for both embedded and high-performance systems. Off-chip data buses can be a major power consumer. In this paper, we present a strategy called “power protocol ” that tries to reduce the dynamic power dissipation on off-chip data buses. To accomplish this, our strategy reduces the number of bus lines {{that need to be}} activated for data transfer by employing a small cache (called “value cache”) at each side of the off-chip data bus. These value caches keep track of the data values that have recently been transmitted over the bus. The entries in these caches are constructed {{in such a way that}} the contents of both the value caches are the same all the time. When a data value needs to be transmitted over the bus, we first check whether it is in the value cache of the sender. If it is, we transmit only the index of the data (i. e., its value cache address) instead of the actual data value and, the other side (receiver) can determine the data value by using this index and its value cache. Our experimental results using a set of fifteen benchmark codes from embedded systems domain show that power protocol is very effective in practice, and reduces the <b>bit</b> <b>switching</b> activity on the data bus by as much as 70. 7 % (with a value cache of 128 entries). We also present results from an implementation that combines our strategy with 1 -to- 2 encoding, a popular bus encoding strategy for low power. Our results indicate that this combined optimization strategy reduces <b>bit</b> <b>switching</b> activity by 67. 8 % on the average (across all benchmarks). These reductions in <b>bit</b> <b>switching</b> activity lead to more than 7 % reduction on overall system energy on the average for a value cache of 256 entries.

40|$|Digital-to-analog {{converters}} (DACs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} crucial building blocks for telecommunications. High speed DACs {{are one of the}} key components for wideband radio systems and high speed internet access (xDSL). However, the traditional performance parameters such as offset error, gain error, integral non-linearity, differential non-linearity, etc., are not directly applicable to this kind of applications. For telecommunication applications, it is the dynamic performances that determine the quality of DACs [1]. Among the most important dynamic performance parameters are spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and inter-modulation distortion (IMD). In the literature, there are publications on DACs [2 - 6]. However, most published DACs were not optimized for dynamic performance. In this article, we will discuss the influence of design and process parameters on the dynamic performances and describe a DAC chipset for telecommunications. SFDR, Spurious-free dynamic range is the amplitude difference from a fundamental to the largest harmonically or non-harmonically related spur. SNR, Signal-to-noise ratio is the ratio of the signal power and the noise power within a certain bandwidth, usually, half of the sampling frequency. IMD, Inter-modulation distortion is the measure of distortion when more than one tone is driven into a DAC. At the behavioural level, IMD is usually determined by SFDR. I.

Consequently, fewer off-chip bus lines need to be activated for transmission Our approach tries to achieve the first option by exploiting the locality of the data values communicated over the off-chip data bus. However, once the width of the data (that needs to be transmitted) has been reduced, we can also expect a reduction (in general) on the average <b>bit</b> <b>switching</b> activity per transfer.

The likelihood of data <b>bit</b> <b>switches</b> inside the correlation window is also considered in a similar fashion.
