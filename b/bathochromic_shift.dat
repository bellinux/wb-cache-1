The wavelength is longer and the band is much stronger than that of benzene. This is a <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shift.</b> The wavelength is longer than in thiopyrylium and pyrylium, but the intensity is weaker, due to selenium being less electronegative.

Löwig' route involved treating an Sn/K and Sn/Na alloys with iodoethane, in the presence of quartz sand which was used to control the reaction rate. Products with elemental compositions close to those of oligo(diethylstannane)s or poly(diethylstannane) were obtained. Cahours obtained similar products and attributed the formation of the so-called [...] "stannic ethyl" [...] to a reaction of the Wurtz type. Already in 1858, [...] "stannic ethyl" [...] was formulated as a polymeric compound denoted with the composition n(SnC4H5). In 1917 Grüttner, who reinvestigated results on hexaethyl-distannanes(H5C2)3Sn-Sn(C2H5)3 (reported by Ladenburg in 1870) confirmed the presence of Sn-Sn bonds and predicated {{for the first time that}} tin could form chain like compounds. In 1943, it was postulated that “diphenyltin” exists as a type of polymeric material because of its yellow color 8, and indeed a <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shift</b> of the wavelength at maximum absorption with increasing number of Sn atoms was found later in the case of oligo(dibutylstannane)s comprising up to 15 Sn atoms.|$|E
40|$|Current {{applications}} of porphyrins {{in medicine and}} optics, such as photodynamic therapy or nonlinear absorption, increasingly {{require the use of}} far-red absorbing dyes. Modifications to the porphyrin structure to accommodate these conditions can be achieved by extending the conjugation of the porphyrin ?-system, which will cause a <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shift</b> in the absorption spectrum. Thus, conjugated porphyrin oligomers have found widespread use. However, past synthetic strategies have mainly targeted symmetric porphyrin dimers, trimers, and oligomers which limit the practical use of such chromophores. To further extend the absorption profile, a series of symmetric and unsymmetric dimeric and oligomeric porphyrin ?-?, meso-meso, ??-?? triply-fused systems were synthesised via oxidative coupling methods. This required an analysis and optimization of the various synthetic strategies. These arrays exhibit a dramatic <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shift</b> into the nearinfrared region, many displaying absorption of greater than 1050 nm. Additionally, post-fusing chemical transformations, namely organolithium, cycloaddition and transition-metal catalysed reactions, at the meso- and ?- positions enables the fine-tuning of such arrays with the aim of enhancing the <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shift</b> and their potential optical applications...|$|E

While this is well studied for oligo- and polysilanes the current paper addresses the UV-absorption properties of small tin containing oligosilanes in order to evaluate the effects of Sn–Si and Sn–Sn bonds {{as well as the}} results of substituent exchange from methyl to phenyl groups. The new stannasilanes were compared to previously investigated oligosilanes of equal chain lengths and substituent pattern. Replacing the central SiMe 2 group in a pentasilane by a SnMe 2 unit caused a <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shift</b> of the low-energy band (λmax = 260 nm) of 14 nm in the UV spectrum. If, instead of a SnMe 2, a SnPh 2 unit is incorporated, the <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shift</b> of 33 nm is substantially larger. Keeping the SnMe 2 unit and replacing the two central silicon with tin atoms causes shift of the respective band (λ = 286 nm) some 26 nm to the red.

40|$|THESIS 9715 The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop synthetic strategies for the construction of multiporphyrin arrays with enhanced ?-conjugation. Porphyrin oligomers with extended conjugation display a <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shift</b> in their absorption profiles and thus have a diverse range of potential optical applications. As Prof Senge?s group has interest in the areas of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and non-linear optics (NLO), the design of such oligomers took these into account. One method to enhance the <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shift</b> is via the creation of conjugatively linked porphyrin oligomers. In our work, a series of symmetric and unsymmetric dimeric and trimeric porphyrin systems which are connected via conjugated linkers, namely alkyne and phenylacetylene, were synthesised via palladium catalysed C-C coupling reactions. These novel unsymmetric dimers and symmetric trimers were synthesised via the incorporation of all substituents on the monomeric components prior to coupling. The majority of these conjugated arrays exhibited a significant <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shift</b> in their UV/vis absorption profiles, in particular the alkyne linked arrays which showed absorption greater than 720 nm. The mass spectrometry spectra for phenylacetylene and diphenylbutadiene linked zinc arrays exhibited detachment of zinc from the porphyrin core in their spectra.

40|$|Meso-tetrasubstituted Mg(II) porphyrins {{containing}} six membered phenyl groups (MgTPP) {{and five}} membered thienyl (MgTThP) and furyl groups (MgTFP) were synthesized and structurally characterized, {{and the effects}} of meso-substituents on electronic properties were studied using NMR, absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to correlate with experimental observations. The three Mg(II) porphyrins MgTPP, MgTThP, and MgTFP were crystallized as hexa-coordinate systems with Mg(II) ion {{in the center of the}} porphyrin plane and having two tetrahydrofuran molecules as axial ligands. The X-ray studies clearly showed that the meso-furyl groups adopt a conformation in which they are more in-plane with the porphyrin plane whereas the thienyl and phenyl groups prefer an orthogonal arrangement with respect to the porphyrin plane. This arrangement of meso-substituents with the porphyrin plane helps in the enhancement of porphyrin pi-delocalization in MgTFP compared to MgTThP and MgTPP. The differences in their structures are clearly reflected in their spectral and electrochemical properties. The absorption and fluorescence bands experienced <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shifts</b> on moving from six membered phenyls to five membered thienyl and furyl group, and the maximum effects were observed for meso-tetrafuryl Mg(II) porphyrin. The electrochemical studies indicated that the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) decreases as we move from six membered phenyl groups to five membered thienyl and furyl groups, which explains the <b>bathochromic</b> <b>shifts</b> observed in absorption and fluorescence bands.
