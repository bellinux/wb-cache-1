40|$|Pharmaceutical {{products}} that are contaminated with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) bacteria may pose serious consequences to vulnerable patients. Benzyldimethylalkylammonium chloride (BZK) cationic surfactants are extensively used in medical applications and have been implicated in the coselection of antimicrobial resistance. The ability of BCC to degrade BZK, tetradecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride (C 14 BDMA-Cl), dodecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride (C 12 BDMA-Cl), decyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride (C 10 BDMA-Cl), hexyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, and benzyltrimethylammonium chloride was determined by incubation in 1 / 10 -diluted tryptic soy broth (TSB) to determine if BCC bacteria {{have the ability to}} survive and inactivate these disinfectants. With BZK, C 14 BDMA-Cl, and C 12 BDMA-Cl, inhibition of the growth of 20 BCC strains was observed in disinfectant solutions that ranged from 64 to 256  µg/ml. The efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone increased the sensitivity of bacteria to 64  µg/ml BZK. The 20 BCC strains grew well in 1 / 10 -diluted TSB medium with BZK, C 12 BDMA-Cl, and C 10 BDMA-Cl; they absorbed and degraded the compounds in 7  days. Formation of benzyldimethylamine and <b>benzylmethylamine</b> as the initial metabolites suggested that the cleavage of the C alkyl-N bond occurred as the first step of BZK degradation by BCC bacteria. Proteomic data confirmed the observed efflux activity and metabolic inactivation via biodegradation in terms of BZK resistance of BCC bacteria, which suggests that the two main resistance mechanisms are intrinsic and widespread...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} Linxian, {{an area of}} China with a high {{incidence}} of esophageal carcinoma, showed that fungal infections are common in the esophageal epithelium of patients with either premalignant changes or early esophageal carcinoma. Fungi of the genus Candida were the most frequent invaders. In these areas nitrate and nitrite are often present in high concentrations in drinking water and staple grains. The present studies have established the ability of Candida albicans to augment the nitrosative formation of the esophagus-specific carcinogen, benzylmethylnitrosamine (NBMA; N-nitroso-N-methylbenzylamine). Stationary C. albicans cultures, with pH held at 6. 8, were incubated with the precursors of NBMA, <b>benzylmethylamine</b> (BMA; N-methylbenzylamine) and NaNO 2. There was {{a significant increase in the}} amount of NBMA formed in these cultures, compared to precursors-only controls. The amount of NBMA synthesized depended on fungal cell number. Exponentially growing cultures were also able to cause NBMA formation. The identity of the NBMA was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatographic coelution with authentic NBMA in three solvent systems and by mass spectroscopy. Boiled cells and conditioned medium in which cells had been incubated were not effective in enhancing nitrosation. Cultured Candida released acidic metabolites that reduced the pH of the medium when only a low concentration of buffer was present. Spontaneous nitrosation of BMA was enhanced under these acidic conditions. Thus, C. albicans infecting the esophageal epithelium could cause local formation of NBMA by both cell-mediated catalysis and extracellular decrease in pH...|$|E
