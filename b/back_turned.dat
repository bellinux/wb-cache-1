5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{challenged}} Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young), {{who were}} accompanied by Coach D'Amore, for the NWA World Tag Team Championship in the seventh match. Johnny Devine interfered midway through by hitting Storm with a kendo stick, {{which led to a}} pinfall attempt by Young, however Stormed kicked out at two. Later, Young went to grab a chair from Devine who had his <b>back</b> <b>turned</b> to the ring. This caused Devine to panic and hit Young in the head with the chair. Storm immediately followed by grabbing Young and pinning his shoulders to the mat with a school boy type pin attempt for the victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Cleburne and Hindman {{were both}} wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena {{with members of}} the Know-Nothing Party {{following}} a debate. Cleburne was shot in the <b>back,</b> <b>turned</b> around and shot one of his attackers, killing him. The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed on the street and then left. After the two recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to all charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi. By 1860, he was a naturalized citizen, a practicing lawyer, and very popular with the local residents.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik, accompanied to the ring by Freddie Blassie, challenged the reigning champions, The U.S. Express (Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham), who were accompanied by Lou Albano. The U.S. Express dominated {{the early part of}} the match until Volkoff and The Sheik began to gain the offensive advantage over Rotundo. Rotundo then tagged in Windham, who performed a bulldog on The Sheik. After nearly being pinned, The Sheik hit Windham in the head with Blassie's cane as the referee had his <b>back</b> <b>turned.</b> After Volkoff got the pin, Volkoff and The Sheik were crowned as the new tag champions.|$|E
5000|$|The album version {{contains}} an opening with a backwards message. When {{the song is}} played in reverse, the message, in a masked heavy voice (performed by ELO drummer, Bev Bevan), can be heard stating, [...] "The music is reversible but time is not. <b>Turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Turn</b> back." [...] — ostensibly Jeff Lynne's shot at backmasking hysteria, after satanic allegations were made against their song [...] "Eldorado" [...] by Fundamentalist Christianity members. Snippets of Messiah by Handel can be heard during the album opening as well.|$|R

This was, ostensibly, Jeff Lynne's response to accusations that the song [...] "Eldorado" [...] contained Satanic messages that could be heard when played backwards. [...] "Down Home Town" [...] begins with the chorus of [...] "Waterfall" [...] played backwards. A portion of the string crescendo from [...] "Nightrider" [...] was used backwards on [...] "Evil Woman".|$|R

25|$|March 18, 2012, Sydney, Australia, Roberto Laudisio Curti, a 21-year-old Brazilian student {{suspected}} of stealing {{a package of}} biscuits from a convenience store, died during a pursuit by police. CCTV footage shows police forcing the unarmed victim to collide with a glass window and tasering him with his <b>back</b> <b>turned</b> to the officers. The coroner did later find that Curti was suffering acute effects of LSD use. Witnesses said the victim was tasered {{at least four times}} and also capsicum sprayed.|$|E

25|$|In 1577 De Vere {{invested}} £25 in {{the second}} of Martin Frobisher's expeditions {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage. In July 1577 he asked the Crown for the grant of Castle Rising, which had been forfeited to the Crown due to his cousin Norfolk's attainder in 1572. As soon as it was granted to him, he sold it, along with two other manors, and sank some £3,000 into Frobisher's third expedition. The 'gold' ore brought <b>back</b> <b>turned</b> out to be worthless, and De Vere lost the entire investment.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{is divided into}} three principal spaces. Musicians occupy the lower left section, one of whom is centrally located, his <b>back</b> <b>turned</b> toward the viewer, with his double-bass erected to the left. A row of dancers, two women and two men with their legs raised, occupy the upper right. They are characterized by curves and rhythmic repetition, creating a synthetic sense of dynamical movement. The background consists of ornate cabaret-style lighting fixtures, and a few members of the audience sitting in the front row, their eyes fixed on the performance. On the lower right another client is staring with a sidelong glance, indicative of sexual desire or sly and malicious intent; the archetype of a male voyeur, often portrayed in mid-century journalistic illustrations of the can-can.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of his training, {{he made his}} return to the ring to engage in yet another contest at the 205-pound limit, this time against fellow shoot wrestler Ken Shamrock. Three minutes into the bout, Sakuraba struck through Shamrock's guard with a left hand. Shamrock staggered back and ultimately fell into the ropes, his head hanging out of the ring and his <b>back</b> <b>turned</b> to Sakuraba. Sakuraba rushed in to follow up but before any meaningful offense could be launched, the fight was halted by referee Yuji Shimada. Shamrock sprang to his feet immediately following the KO and protested vigorously. Opinions have been mixed regarding the KO's legitimacy; Ken's adopted brother and rival, Frank, has stated he believes the stoppage was justified, while others have come down on the opposing side.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels faced Muhammad Hassan and Daivari. Hogan and Hassan began and Hassan was {{immediately}} sent into the turnbuckles. Hogan double clotheslined both his opponents {{and then he}} and Michaels teamed up with a big double boot to Hassan's face. Michaels {{climbed to the top}} rope but missed an elbow drop. Daivari was tossed outside where Hogan bashed him. Michaels hit Daivari with a flying forearm smash and a kip up. Michaels was about to hit Daivari with Sweet Chin Music, but instead Hassan hit Michaels with a lead pipe. Hassan then took advantage and locked Michaels in the Camel Clutch. Michaels fought his way to his feet and dropped Hassan with an Electric Chair. Hogan then got tagged in and went for a leg drop to Daivari, but Hassan hit Hogan with a lead pipe instead. As the referee has his <b>back</b> <b>turned</b> at Hogan, Michaels hit Daivari with Sweet Chin Music allowing Hogan to get the pinfall and win the match for his team.|$|E
25|$|Hulsker {{called the}} signed drawing The Public Soup Kitchen (F1020a below) {{important}} and attractive. Van Gogh and his contemporary George Hendrik Breitner had sketched {{together at a}} soup kitchen in the Geest (it is not known which of the several possibilities it was). After going to the trouble and expense of installing shutters in his windows to adjust the light and to recreate the scene itself in his studio, van Gogh was able to study his models at leisure. In this way {{he was able to}} introduce more chiaroscuro (light and dark) in his drawing, which he executed with the natural ('mountain') chalk that Theo had sent him and whose properties he lauds in his letters. All the models are from Sien's family: her mother and baby on the left, her sister, <b>back</b> <b>turned,</b> and her daughter, hair cropped as a precaution against lice, in the center, with Sien herself, superbly executed in profile, on the right. The watercolor F1020b (below) is much less successful as van Gogh himself acknowledged, blaming the paper in part for not being right for the job.|$|E
25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its <b>back</b> <b>turned</b> to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E

25|$|For {{the main}} event Dragon Lee had his brother Rush {{accompany}} him to the ring and working as his corner man, while La Máscara was accompanied by Shocker, who had played a peripheral role in the storyline prior to the anniversary show. During the first fall Rush helped his younger brother win the fall, pulling La Máscara's leg while the referee had his <b>back</b> <b>turned.</b> In the second fall Rush's interference was noticed by the referee causing Dragon Lee to lose the second fall of the match. After the disqualification the referee tried to make Rush leave the arena, but at first he refused. It was not until Dragon Lee pleaded with Rush to leave, fearing he would lose the match all-together if Rush did not leave, that Rush left the arena. The third fall was the longest of the match with both Dragon Lee and La Máscara executing several of their signature moves and dives out of the ring. At one point Dragon Lee rolled La Máscara up with a la Casita hold, but Rush ran back in the arena and distracted the referee to prevent the pinfall. The third fall was decided when Dragon Lee managed to execute his finishing move, the Phoenix Plex, and then pinned La Máscara.|$|E
25|$|In this outdoor hunting {{scene the}} horizon line is almost {{on top of}} the canvas. Seven people are present, along with {{numerous}} animals. A man with a hunting horn (Cor de chasse, la trompe du piqueur) {{can be seen in the}} foreground, his <b>back</b> <b>turned</b> to the viewer, with a group of hunting dogs to his right. Men on horses prepare for departure. Tension is in the air as the hunters and animals interact with one another. Another hunter on foot holds a gun in the background with a woman and child nearby and a village beyond. Spatial depth is minimized, the overall composition flattened, yet distances to the viewer are determined by the relationship of size; the further the object, the smaller in appearance. The faceting however does not partake in the size-distance relation, as one would expect. The hunting dogs to the lower right, for example, are treated with similar sized 'cubes' as the elements in the upper portions of the canvas; corresponding to the background. The hunting horn in the foreground is almost identical in size and in faceting to the trees in the distance. The same rounded shapes espouse the spherical surfaces formed by the horses heads. This serves to counter the illusion of depth; each portion of the canvas equally important in the overall composition.|$|E

The observers set up a betting pool {{on the results of}} the test. Edward Teller was the most optimistic, predicting [...] He wore gloves to protect his hands, and sunglasses underneath the welding goggles that the government had supplied everyone with. Teller {{was also one of the}} few scientists to actually watch the test (with eye protection), instead of following orders to lie on the ground with his <b>back</b> <b>turned.</b> He also brought suntan lotion, which he shared with the others.|$|E
500|$|The March 30, 1974, concert {{featured}} an ethnically and age-diverse {{audience that}} included young hippies and old, wealthy attendees.

[...] Although he lived only 15 minutes away, Davis {{arrived at the}} venue {{more than an hour}} late. When the band walked out onstage, he followed with his <b>back</b> <b>turned</b> to the audience, casually strolling onstage while the other musicians were setting up. Davis immediately began to play, and the band responded by playing a dense rhythm in unison. Saxophonist Dave Liebman, writing in the 1997 US reissue liner notes for Dark Magus, recalled the start of the show: [...] "It is his whim [...]. That's the thing!... Miles can do that and have three thousand musicians follow him. Right? So what I learned in that respect from Miles was to be able to watch him and be on his case".|$|E
