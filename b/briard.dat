25|$|Preparation for the {{expedition}} began in May 1890, and {{the expedition}} left Matadi in September of that year. With Delcommune were the geologist Diferrich, the naturalist Protche, doctor <b>Briard,</b> Baron de Roest d'Alkemade and Count Soutchoff. Delcommune {{was charged with}} exploring the region and examining its local wealth and the problems of transport and communications.|$|E
25|$|Some experts {{insist that}} this breed {{is related to}} the more {{well-known}} <b>Briard</b> and Beauceron, while others believe it shares a common origin with Dutch and Belgian Shepherds. Although the Berger Picard made an appearance at the first French dog show in 1863, the breed's rustic appearance did not lead to popularity as a show dog.|$|E
50|$|<b>Briards</b> {{can compete}} in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, Schutzhund, tracking, and herding events.

50|$|<b>Briards</b> {{have been}} used in a variety of service and therapy roles to help those with disabilities and comfort those in hospitals, schools and {{retirement}} communities. <b>Briards</b> are also being trained as autism service dogs and PTSD service dogs for both adults and children. With their keen intelligence, tactile coat interaction, and loyalty, they make a huge difference in {{the quality of life for}} those with disabilities or in recovery.|$|R
25|$|The Komondor {{is related}} to the South Russian Ovcharka, the Puli and, by extension, the Pumi, the Mudi, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog, the Schapendoes, the Bearded collie, and the Old English sheepdog. In 1947, the Komondor was used to acquire fresh blood in the rare South Russian Ovcharka. In the 1970s, another Komondor cross was made. It is also {{believed}} {{to be related to the}} <b>Briard,</b> the Catalonian Sheepdog, the Cão da Serra de Aires, the Pyrenean Shepherd and the Bergamasco shepherd, but the Bergamasco has flocks unlike the Komondor.|$|E
500|$|Scandinavian punk was {{propelled}} {{early on}} by tour dates by bands {{such as the}} Clash and the Ramones (both in Stockholm in May 1977), and the Sex Pistols' tour through Denmark, Sweden and Norway in July the same year. The band <b>Briard</b> jump-started Finnish punk with its November 1977 single [...] "I Really Hate Ya"/"I Want Ya Back"; other early Finnish punk acts included Eppu Normaali and singer Pelle Miljoona. The first Swedish punk single was [...] "Vårdad klädsel"/"Förbjudna ljud" [...] released by Kriminella Gitarrer in February 1978, which started an extensive Swedish punk scene featuring act such as Ebba Grön, KSMB, Rude Kids, Besökarna, Liket Lever, Garbochock, Attentat, and many others. Within a couple of years, hundreds of punk singles were released in Sweden.|$|E
500|$|They {{returned}} {{to assist in}} the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March. British ships made the initial entry into the Dardanelles, but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range. Gaulois was hit twice during this bombardment; the first shell struck the quarterdeck, but caused little damage other than deforming the deck. The second shell hit just above the waterline on the starboard bow and did little obvious damage. In reality, however, it pushed in the armour plates below the waterline and opened up a hole [...] by [...] through which water flooded in. Little could be done to staunch the inflow and Captain <b>Briard</b> decided to head for the Rabbit Islands, north of Tenedos, where he could beach his ship for temporary repairs. He ordered the non-essential crewmen off the ship in case she foundered en route, but managed to reach the islands, escorted by Charlemagne.|$|E
50|$|There {{is another}} retinal disease in <b>Briards</b> known as {{hereditary}} retinal dysplasia. These dogs are night blind from birth, and day vision varies. Puppies affected often have nystagmus. It {{is also known}} as lipid retinopathy.|$|R
25|$|The first Berger Picards {{were shown}} {{together}} in the same class with Beaucerons and <b>Briards</b> in 1863 {{but it was more than}} 50 years later in 1925 that the Picard was officially recognized as a breed in France.|$|R
50|$|Armants {{originate}} from Egypt and were originally used as guard dogs. It {{is believed to}} be a descendant of European dogs, that were introduced by Napoleon's troops, crossed with <b>Briards.</b> They are named after the town of Armant in Egypt. The breed's fearlessness when confronted by predators as well as its loyalty see them put to use in Egypt as guard dogs.|$|R

2500|$|The dogs became nearly extinct during World War II, and {{the modern}} day breed descends from the few survivors. The Dutch Raad van Beheer (national kennel club) first {{recognised}} the breed in 1952, and the first standard was written in 1954. Related breeds are the Bearded Collie, the Puli, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog (Owczarek Nizinny), the Old English Sheepdog, the <b>Briard,</b> the Bergamasco Shepherd (Cane da pastore Bergamasco) and the Old German Sheepdog (Schafspudel), {{all of which are}} small versions of the [...] "mountain type" [...] herding and livestock guardian dogs.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, McCoy and Pete Malmi {{reformed}} {{their old}} band <b>Briard</b> after 20 years. The new <b>Briard</b> (which also included Angela McCoy) released {{a new album}} simply titled <b>Briard.</b> That same year filmmaker Pekka Lehto started the filming for the movie The Real McCoy, a half-real, half-fictional bio-pic on McCoy. The film was released in 1999.|$|E
50|$|Millionaire animal {{lover and}} overall spoiled rich girl Trudy (Rene Russo) adds Buddy, a gorilla, to her family. Buddy finds {{life in the}} city very {{difficult}} to deal with. Although Trudy raises him as her own son in her mansion (which also houses a few comical chimpanzees, a kitten, a horse, a cheeky talking green parrot, her prize-winning champion pack of <b>Briards,</b> a raccoon and a flock of geese), he becomes hard to control due to his strength. A particularly bad experience in the Chicago World's Fair makes things even harder for Buddy. After he goes on an aggressive rampage and nearly destroys Trudy's home, Buddy is taken to an ape sanctuary to live among his own kind in peace.|$|R
5000|$|Ancestors of today's breed were {{traditionally}} {{used for}} herding cows, sheep, goats, horses and even pigs in the Serra de Aires {{and in the}} Alentejo. Although there is speculation about the breed's ancestry, as with other breeds who came from undocumented, working dog origins, [...] "... data is rare, or does not exist ... most guardian and herding breeds do not have records before 1900". The dog is recognisable {{as one of the}} old-fashioned types of European sheepdogs, believed to be closely related to the Pyrenean and Catalan Sheepdogs. It is also believed to be descended from <b>Briards</b> imported into Portugal in the early 1900s by the Conde de Castro Guimarães from Cascais, and crossed with the Pyrenean Sheepdog. The landscape of the Serra de Aires is barren and harsh and it has been noted that the breed would have had a difficult time adapting to the climate there. That it is a recent breed was validated by a DNA study done in Portugal on regional breeds.|$|R
5000|$|Other breeds, {{notably the}} Border Collie, {{get in front}} of the animals and use what is called strong eye to stare down the animals; they are known as headers. The headers or {{fetching}} dogs keep livestock in a group. They consistently go to the front or head of the animals to turn or stop the animal's movement. The heelers or driving dogs keep pushing the animals forward. Typically, they stay behind the herd. The Australian Kelpie and Australian Koolie use both these methods and also run along the backs of sheep so are said to head, heel, and back. Other types such as the Australian Shepherd, English Shepherd and Welsh Sheepdog are moderate to loose eyed, working more independently. The New Zealand Huntaway uses its loud, deep bark to muster mobs of sheep. Belgian Shepherds, German Shepherd Dogs and <b>Briards</b> are historically tending dogs, who act as a [...] "living fence," [...] guiding large flocks of sheep to graze while preventing them from eating valuable crops and wandering onto roads.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name for}} the breed, <b>Briard,</b> is {{sometimes}} called Chien d'Aubry, so {{it is suggested that}} a trained <b>Briard</b> may have been used {{in the role of the}} dog in Pixérécourt's version.|$|E

50|$|This breed is also {{commonly}} {{screened for}} congenital stationary night blindness (SNB) with a DNA test. SNB is inherited through recessive genes.Progressive retinal atrophy PRA, {{is a disease}} that causes nerve cells {{at the back of}} the eye to degenerate. The condition usually begins in older pets and can lead to blindness. Progressive retinal degeneration or atrophy (PRD/PRA) represents a group of inherited eye diseases characterized by abnormal development or premature degeneration of the retina. There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina and these are the light-sensitive rods and cones. They are responsible for detecting light and converting it into an electrical signal that travels to the brain. When the photoreceptor cells deteriorate, vision is lost because the animal has no way to generate an image from the light reaching the retina. Puppies are usually blind before one year of age.For the first time ever, animals (<b>Briards)</b> that were born blind gained the ability to see after undergoing gene therapy, according to research from the University of Florida, Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania.UF researchers had established that the apparently harmless adeno-associated virus can carry healthy copies of a gene into the cells of the retina, which is composed of layers of light-sensitive nerve cells. The healthy gene's mission: to produce a protein critical to translating light waves into nerve impulses that can be interpreted as images by the brain. The study was successful and the puppies could see in the eye that was treated. Officials from the Foundation Fighting Blindness, which supported the study with grant funds, said the success in reversing blindness in dogs is an important advance.|$|R
40|$|As a species, {{the dog is}} unique. Depending on the breed, {{body weight}} varies 100 -fold from the 1 -kg Chihuahua to the 115 -kg St. Bernard (1). The time taken for a growing puppy to achieve adult body weight also varies {{considerably}} with larger breeds having a longer growth period than smaller breeds. Also {{the rate of growth}} during this period is not constant; energy requirements decrease from 3 times maintenance at weaning to 1. 2 times maintenance as the puppy approaches adulthood (1). The provision of accurate feeding guides is essential if under- and overnutrition are to be prevented. Overnutrition of dogs results in obesity, but in large breeds overnutrition also causes musculoskeletal disorders (2, 3). However, present feeding guides are based on "typical" growth data that use only a single equation (4, 5). Breed-specific differences in growth patterns might be expected due to huge variations in size, temperament, and coat type, all of which are likely to affect energy requirements. This was evident in a study of six breeds of puppies that demonstrated very different energy requirements despite similar absolute body weights in Great Danes versus Newfoundlands and <b>Briards</b> versus Labrador Retrievers (6). Little information is published on breed-specific variations in puppy growth patterns, and most studies provide only limited data on single breeds, for example, 8 - 34 -mo-old and 6 - 20 -wk-old Labrador Retrievers (7, 9) and 0 - 12 -wk-old German Shepherds (8). Other studies are confounded by the use of different groups of dogs to provide data for a variety of age groups (10). Comparisons between these studies are difficult due to differing data presentation and treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the complete growth curves of 12 different-sized dog breeds and to investigate a mathematical basis for the provision of breed-specific feeding guides...|$|R
