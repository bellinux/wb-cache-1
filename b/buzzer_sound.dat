5000|$|When {{engaging}} slow or straight-receding targets, {{the operator}} tracks the target with the iron sights in the launch tube and applies half-trigger. This action [...] "uncages" [...] the seeker and allows {{its attempt to}} track. If a target IR signature can be tracked against the background present, this is indicated by a light and a <b>buzzer</b> <b>sound.</b> The shooter then pulls the trigger fully, and immediately applies lead and superelevation. This method is called a manual engagement. An automatic mode, which is used against fast targets, allows the shooter to fully depress the trigger in one pull followed by immediate lead and superelevation of the launch tube. The seeker will uncage and will automatically launch the missile if a strong enough signal is detected.|$|E

5000|$|All CityRail trains {{now have}} an {{additional}} safety feature, which has been fitted since the accident. In addition to the deadman handle and foot pedal, the trains are fitted with [...] "task linked vigilance" [...] - which resets a timer every time the driver activates certain controls. If there is no change in control, a flashing lamp and then <b>buzzer</b> <b>sound</b> and the driver is required to acknowledge a vigilance button. If the train's driver does not use the controls and does not acknowledge the vigilance alarm, the vigilance system is activated and makes an emergency brake application. All trains have also been fitted with data loggers to record the driver's and guard's actions as they work the train, {{as well as the}} train's speed. Such a system had been fitted to G7, but was in the early stage of fleet roll-out, and hence had not been commissioned and switched on {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} model a protection system for rotating electrical machines through online condition monitoring to indentify the problem including the problematic {{source in the}} machine and to protect breakdown due to excessive vibration without human intervention. Maintenance of electrical machines is essential so, condition monitoring of machines is gaining importance in industry to reduce the downtime costs and increase machine reliability. In this work a simulation model has been developed using MATLAB / Simulink for online condition monitoring to detect the problem {{and to protect the}} machine without human intervention. If any problem is occurred in any location in the machine then vibration of the whole system increases. It extracts the maximum value of vibration signals coming from different bearing positions of the machine. If the magnitude of vibration is in ‘unacceptable ’ range then it trips the relay to stop the system and creates a <b>buzzer</b> <b>sound</b> to alert everybody. If the magnitude of vibration is in ‘unsatisfactory ’ range then an alert message has been designed to appear on the computer screen with different <b>buzzer</b> <b>sound</b> for caution. In ‘unsatisfactory ’ and ‘unacceptable ’ condition it displays serial no. of defective bearing. This system not only protects the unscheduled shut down of machines but also increases the lifetime of machine components...|$|E
40|$|In this robot {{provides}} {{fire protection}} {{when there is}} a fire in a tunnel or in an industry by using automatic control of robot by the use of microcontroller in order to reduced loss of life and property damage. This robot uses dc motors, castor wheel, microcontroller, sensors, pump and sprinkler. Microcontroller {{is the heart of the}} project. Microcontroller controls all the parts of the robot by the use of programming. In this robot as the fire sensor senses the fire, it sends the signal to microcontroller; since the signal of the sensor is very weak the amplifier is used so that it can amplify the signal and sends it to microcontroller. As soon as microcontroller receives the signal a buzzer sounds, the <b>buzzer</b> <b>sound</b> is to intimate the occurrence of fire accident. After the sounding of the buzzer microcontroller actuates the driver circuit and it drives the robot towards fire place, as the robot reaches near the fire microcontroller actuates the relay and pump switch is made ON and water is sprinkled on the fire through the sprinkler...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT:- People {{make use}} of {{different}} languages to express their thoughts in a different way. But, {{it is difficult for}} the people who are affected by paralysis and stroke. Hence, there is a need to develop a platform for those people who are physically challengeable. An Embedded device shall address the above said problems. Based on the ARM processor the operation takes place. The device is designed with an intelligent wheelchair and the People With Disabilities (PWD) can direct it. By pressing the keypad (buttons) in the device, people with disabilities can move the wheelchair. In this process, the line following algorithm is implemented. To direct the wheelchair, L 298 motor driver is used with the help of an ultrasonic obstacle sensor. By pressing a button, an automatic call to the doctor takes place if the PWD needs critical help. The GSM modem is used to forward the call. The LCD shows the basic needs of PWD which is already assigned in the buttons. On pressing the button, a text is displayed in the LCD with a <b>buzzer</b> <b>sound.</b> This device provides a unique mobility for the people with disabilities...|$|E
40|$|Have been {{designed}} and used, home security system by using mobile phone with make use {{short message service}} (SMS) facility. This system {{can be used to}} supervise home condition when it was leaved by the host or when no body at home, so home condition will be always supervised and secure without any security to guard it. This system uses 2 pieces Sensor Passive Infrared (PIR) to detect if there is someone enter a house and for giving the dangerous warning it uses sms facility at mobile phone which will be sent to certain number with <b>buzzer</b> <b>sound.</b> The destination number and sms content is formatted on Protocol Data Unit (PDU) which has been saved on microcontroller program. From the research has been done the result is, if there ishave been rain so the sms content will be sent is “TURUN HUJAN”, if there is 1 sensor which is set outside of the house detected so the sms content will be sent is “ADA YANG DATANG!!” and if the second sensor which is set inside the house detected so the sms content will be sent is “ADA YANG MASUK!!” and the same time buzzer will be on to give warning for people around the house...|$|E
40|$|Generally, {{blind people}} use a cane {{to know the}} {{distance}} around them. A cane was normally use when they walk outdoors, but if the cane used in indoors; it is not used because of fear of damaging the goods-glassware. Another disadvantage of the stick was usually used just to feel the objects / obstacles below the blinds, and other obstacles such as cars or trucks, which often not detected by the cane. Blind people also have constraints to determine the distance of nearby objects, such as people to talk to, etc. The main component {{of the system is}} sensor HC-SR 04 used to scan the surrounding area by emitting ultrasonic waves. Echoes from objects were use as an input to microcontroller, and then it used to determine the direction and the distance of objects around the blinds using the servo arm movement and <b>buzzer</b> <b>sound.</b> The design of the device utilizes the theory of sound waves velocity in the air, and it was carried out in several steps. The first step is making the hardware device, which uses sensor HC-SR 04, micro servo Tower Pro, and power supply of nine Volt battery. The test result shows that the system is able to detect objects with a range of 60 degrees. The design of the device was valuable because it is wearable which can be attached {{to the back of the}} hands. Conceptually, the device has met the basic criteria that detect objects and give feedback to the user. Some things that can be improved are power supply and increasing device responsibility so it is able to read distance and give feedback more accurately and more quickly...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This project {{presents}} the spy robot for defence and rescue purpose with the solar panel {{to charge the}} batteries. To maximize the energy obtained from the sunlight we are using MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) technique. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) {{is used in the}} photovoltaic (PV) system to maximize the PV output power, irrespective of the temperature and irradiation conditions. The MPPT system consists of a buck-type Direct Current (DC) /DC converter, which is controlled by a microcontroller unit. The microcontroller is programmed with a simple and reliable MPPT technique. The PIC microcontroller will be used to collect the maximum power to the battery. This robot has the capability of swapping the battery between two of them to extract the power to operate, whenever it detects the battery which provides the power supply to the robot is dead. The robot is controlled by a remote controller which has RF transmission to send commands to direct the robot and to receive the information from it. The robot continuously senses about the metal detection, obstacle detection and the present temperature value for defence purpose with that we are using carbon monoxide sensor, oxygen sensor and fire sensor to inspect coal mine. This information is transmitted through RF transmitter and the information is received and displayed at the receiver end on the LCD display which is interfaced with the remote controller. If the in the gas sensors senses the changes in the value which is beyond the preset value they will make to glow the LEDs and <b>buzzer</b> <b>sound</b> to alert the critical situation. Meanwhile the video of the remote environment is captured by the wireless camera which is mounted on the robot and transmits with the help of RF transceiver. Now a days army requires LASER gun. So the LASER gun is fixed with the robot which can be operated remotely...|$|E

40|$|Current {{theories}} {{that attempt to}} explain the horizontal-vertical illusion (HVI) are inconsistent with all empirical evidence, {{largely due to the}} remaining gaps in our knowledge. This thesis expands our understanding of the HVI by addressing two main research issues – whether the HVI works in a similar manner across the spatial senses, and the effect of embedding single lines into two-dimensional shapes. The first research issue was addressed by presenting single lines sequentially to visual, haptic and auditory senses allowing a fair comparison by providing each modality the availability of equal information. In Experiment 1 participants used vision, haptics, audition, and a combination of the three senses to estimate lengths presented in the x-, y- and z-axes. No significant difference in length estimations was found between the modality conditions. A strong correlation was observed between the length estimations for each pair of senses. In Experiment 2 auditory lengths were presented using different sound to that used in Experiment 1 (i. e., white noise instead a <b>buzzer</b> <b>sound)</b> and a reverse HVI was found. Despite this, the findings show that length perception operates in a similar manner across the modalities. The second main research issue was broken into two parts. The first part (Experiments 3 and 4) assessed whether the HVI existed in the creation of squares, and the second (Experiment 5) compared the degree of illusion in traditional HVI figures with that of single lines. In Experiment 3 participants altered the dimensions of overlapping L-shaped cut-outs so the inner segment formed a square. As the sides of the squares were frequently made shorter than the bases (and/or the base longer than the side) {{it was found that the}} HVI does influence the creation of squares. In Experiment 4 participants were asked to construct squares using a cardboard cut out. The creation of squares demonstrated the error of the standard with changes to the side resulting in a greater degree of illusion. In the final experiment, Experiment 5, in which participants used vision and haptics to make length estimates of lines presented separately or as part of an L or inverted-T figure, it was found that the latter produced the greatest degree of illusion where the side was overestimated compared to the base, and the strength of illusion produced from L figures and single lines was relatively similar. All three stimulus types produced a significant illusion in that vertical lines were, on average, judged to be longer than horizontal lines of the same size. The findings reported here point towards a more appropriate explanation for the illusory distortion. It is likely that the HVI is the result of flawed spatial cognition that impacts all modalities; however it remains unclear why this phenomenon occurs...|$|E
