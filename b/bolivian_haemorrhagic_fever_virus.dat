40|$|The {{attachment}} of ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-like (Ubl) molecule interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG 15) to {{cellular proteins}} mediates important innate antiviral responses. Ovarian tumor (OTU) domain proteases from nairoviruses and arteriviruses were recently found to remove these molecules from host proteins, which inhibits Ub and ISG 15 -dependent antiviral pathways. This {{contrasts with the}} Ub-specific activity of known eukaryotic OTU-domain proteases. Here we describe crystal structures of a viral OTU domain from the highly pathogenic Crimean–Congo <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> (CCHFV) bound to Ub and to ISG 15 at 2. 5 -Å and 2. 3 -Å resolution, respectively. The complexes provide a unique structural example of ISG 15 bound to another protein and reveal the molecular mechanism of an ISG 15 cross-reactive deubiquitinase. To accommodate structural differences between Ub and ISG 15, the viral protease binds the β-grasp folds of Ub and C-terminal Ub-like domain of ISG 15 in an orientation that is rotated nearly 75 ° with respect to that observed for Ub bound to a representative eukaryotic OTU domain from yeast. Distinct structural determinants necessary for binding either substrate were identified and allowed the reengineering of the viral OTU protease into enzymes with increased substrate specificity, either for Ub or for ISG 15. Our findings now provide the basis to determine in vivo the relative contributions of deubiquitination and deISGylation to viral immune evasion tactics, and a structural template of a promiscuous deubiquitinase from a <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> that can be targeted for inhibition using small-molecule-based strategies...|$|R

40|$|Crimean-Congo <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> (CCHFv) is {{a member}} of the genus Nairovirusin the family Bunyaviridae. It {{possesses}} a tripartite, single stranded RNA genome of negative polarity consisting of large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments. CCHF virus is enzootic in life stock and wild animals in many parts of the Middle East, Asia and Africa and is also recognised in Southeast Europe. Severe disease, manifest as <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> and high mortality rates (up to 50 %), is only recognised in humans. We have determined the complete sequence of the small genomic RNA segment from several strains of CCHF virus from outbreaks in Pakistan 2000, Baghdad 1976 and Uzbekistan 1967. Phylogenetic analysis of three datasets of sequences from the small genomic RNA segment available from a range of strains indicates that they can be divided into seven subtypes. Superimposed on this pattern are links between distant geographic locations, pointing to the existence of a global reservoir of CCHFv.

An isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay was successfully developed for molecular detection of CCHFV. The assay showed rapid (under 10 minutes) detection of viral extracts/synthetic virus RNA of all 7 S-segment clades of CCHFV, with high target specificity. The assay was shown to tolerate the presence of inhibitors in crude preparations of mock field samples, indicating that this assay may be suitable for use in the field with minimal sample preparation. The CCHFV RPA was successfully used to screen and detect CCHFV positives from a panel of clinical samples from Tajikistan. The assay is a rapid, isothermal, simple-to-perform molecular diagnostic, which can be performed on a light, portable real-time detection device. It is ideally placed therefore for use as a field-diagnostic or in-low resource laboratories, for monitoring of CCHF outbreaks at the point-of-need, such as in remote rural regions in affected countries...|$|R

We have demonstrated the potential of a DNA resequencing microarray (PathogenID v 2. 0) for this purpose. The microarray was first validated in vitro using supernatants of cells infected with prototype strains from five different families of BSL- 4 viruses (e. g. families Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae).

This nairovirus infection is highly prevalent among giant leaf-nosed bats, Hipposideros gigas (detected in samples from 16 individuals out of 38). Whole-genome analysis of three viral isolates (11 SB 17, 11 SB 19 and 11 SB 23) reveals a typical bunyavirus tri-segmented genome. The strains form a single phylogenetic clade that is divergent from other known nairoviruses, and are hereafter designated as Leopards Hill virus (LPHV). When i. p. injected into mice, the 11 SB 17 strain causes only slight body weight loss, whereas 11 SB 23 produces acute and lethal disease closely resembling that observed with Crimean-Congo <b>Haemorrhagic</b> <b>Fever</b> <b>virus</b> in humans.

40|$|Viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> (VHF) {{caused by}} arenaviruses {{are among the}} most devastating {{emerging}} human diseases. The most important pathogen among the arenaviruses is Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever that is endemic to West Africa. On the South American continent, the New World arenavirus Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo (MACV), Guanarito (GTOV), and Sabia virus (SABV) have emerged as causative agents of severe VHFs. Clinical and experimental studies on arenavirus VHF have revealed a crucial role of the endothelium in their pathogenesis. However, in contrast to other VHFs, haemorrhages are not a salient feature of Lassa fever and fatal cases do not show overt destruction of vascular tissue. The functional alteration of the vascular endothelium that precede shock and death in fatal Lassa fever may be due to more subtle direct or indirect effects of the virus on endothelial cells. Haemorrhagic disease manifestations and vascular involvement are more pronounced in the VHF caused by the South American <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> <b>viruses.</b> Recent studies on JUNV revealed perturbation of specific endothelial cell function, including expression of cell adhesion molecules, coagulation factors, and vasoactive mediators as a consequence of productive viral infection.
