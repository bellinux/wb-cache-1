5|$|As {{early as}} 1999, the St. Louis Cardinals began {{pushing for the}} {{construction}} of a new Busch Stadium as part of a broader trend in Major League Baseball toward stadium building. In early 2002, plans for a new park were settled among state and local leaders and Cardinals owners. According to an agreement in which the state and city would issue <b>bonds</b> <b>for</b> construction, the Cardinals agreed to build a multipurpose development known as St. Louis Ballpark Village on part of the site of Busch Memorial Stadium. The new stadium opened in 2006, and groundbreaking for Ballpark Village took place in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as KTA had, to prove that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets for investor dollars. All of these issues combined made it difficult for OTA to issue <b>bonds</b> <b>for</b> its toll road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.|$|E
5|$|In December 2005, Kirchner {{decided to}} {{liquidate}} the Argentine {{debt to the}} IMF in a single payment, without refinancing, {{for a total of}} $9.8 billion. The payment was partly financed by Venezuela, who bought Argentine <b>bonds</b> <b>for</b> US$1.6 billion. As of mid-2008 Venezuela hold an estimated US$6 billion in Argentine debt. In 2006, Argentina re-entered international debt markets selling US$500 million of its Bonar V five-year dollar denominated bonds, with a yield of 8.36%, mostly to foreign banks and Moody's boosted Argentina's debt rating to B from B-.|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} {{on the use}} of wafer <b>bonding</b> <b>for</b> formation of Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) materials for high performance applications. Recent developments in wafer bonding and available techniques for formation of thin semiconductor films is presented. Furthermore, a review is given on results in use of wafer <b>bonding</b> <b>for</b> formation of advanced SOI-materials. Finally, a more detailed discussion is given {{on the use of}} wafer <b>bonding</b> <b>for</b> manufacture of SOI-materials intended for high-frequency applications and SOI-materials with films of electrically insulating but highly thermally conductive materials as buried insulators...|$|R

25|$|On September 22, 2007, the Giants officially {{announced}} that the team would not re-sign Barry <b>Bonds</b> <b>for</b> the 2008 season.

25|$|By July 1905, the Times {{began to}} warn the voters of Los Angeles that the county would soon dry up unless they voted <b>bonds</b> <b>for</b> {{building}} the aqueduct.

The male feeds the female {{while she is}} brooding the eggs. There are usually between 3 and 6 (averaging 4 or 5) eggs laid and incubated over 16–18 days. The young fledge usually between 17–21 days after hatching.|$|E

25|$|The {{shape of}} the yield curve is {{influenced}} by supply and demand: for instance, {{if there is a}} large demand for long <b>bonds,</b> <b>for</b> instance from pension funds to match their fixed liabilities to pensioners, and not enough bonds in existence to meet this demand, then the yields on long bonds can be expected to be low, irrespective of market participants' views about future events.|$|E

25|$|Bond length: Hyperconjugation is {{suggested}} {{as a key}} factor in shortening of sigma bonds (σ <b>bonds).</b> <b>For</b> example, the single C–C bonds in 1,3-butadiene and methylacetylene are approximately 1.46 angstrom in length, much less than the value of around 1.54Å found in saturated hydrocarbons. For butadiene, this can be explained as normal conjugation of the two alkenyl parts. But for methylacetylene, hyperconjugation between the alkyl and alkynyl parts.|$|E
25|$|In early 1922 Denver's {{lawmakers in}} the state {{legislature}} found an opening. Pueblo had been devastated by a flood, and Gov. Oliver Henry Shoup called an emergency session of the legislature. Denver lawmakers now had power over Pueblo. They would vote for emergency funding for the beleaguered town (an economic rival to Denver) in return for legislation authorizing the issuance of <b>bonds</b> <b>for</b> Denver's tunnel. A deal was struck, and on April 29, the Moffat Tunnel Improvement District was created.|$|E

25|$|Carr {{was elected}} to the Texas House of Representatives from Lubbock District 19 in 1950. During his ensuing ten years of service, he focused on West Texas water quality and availability. Under his leadership, the {{legislature}} proposed a constitutional amendment and passed enabling legislation to establish the Texas Water Development Board. At its creation, the board was authorized to issue up to $200 million in water development <b>bonds</b> <b>for</b> the purpose of funding local water projects. Carr also helped to establish a code of ethics for legislators and lobbyists. He promoted tourism and industrial development.|$|E
25|$|Arundel, {{along with}} Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, {{was at the}} very centre of Henry V's tight-knit group of advisers. The king's {{intervention}} in Shropshire in 1414 was a bold move designed to show {{that even the most}} powerful magnates were not above the law. It provoked the laying of almost 1800 indictments and the prosecution of about 1600 individuals. However, only seven were prosecuted as far as the requirement to give <b>bonds</b> <b>for</b> £200. Ultimately Arundel and Furnival stood surety for their affinity members and most received formal pardons.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, Colter issued first {{mortgage}} <b>bonds</b> <b>for</b> $250,000, using 16,135 {{acres of}} his ranch as collateral, including 7,500 acres which were cultivated and irrigated, {{in order to}} pay off debts he had accumulated during his campaign for the governorship, as well as to provide him with extra funds to use on the ranch. At the time the acreage was appraised at $640,000. In October 1919, Colter sold a five-year lease for oil and gas exploration and development on his patented lands in the Holbrook oil fields in Apache County.|$|E

40|$|This paper shows, in a {{comparative}} way, AE and mechanical {{results in the}} pull-out experiment to evaluate the concrete-steel <b>bond,</b> <b>for</b> two kinds of steel bars: black steel and hot-dip galvanized steel. We report here traditional parameters of AE and load-slip diagrams recorded along tests by using cubic samples of concrete centrally reinforced with ribbed bars. Several ages (7, 14, 21, 28 and 90 days) of concrete are considered to evaluate the <b>bond</b> <b>for</b> both kinds of steel. A comparison between mean values of <b>bond</b> tensile-force <b>for</b> concrete/black steel and concrete/galvanized steel systems is performed {{on a set of}} ten different concrete samples obtained with the same mixture. Results show a lower <b>bond</b> <b>for</b> galvanized steel than for black steel. Moreover, AE diagrams obtained during each monotonic pull-out test also show important differences for both types of steel. 1...|$|R
