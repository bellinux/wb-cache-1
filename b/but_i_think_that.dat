And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E

Hall {{was one of the}} few cast members not to audition for their roles; Robert Greenblatt and Michael Cuesta approached him with the script. Hall said that he didn't think [...] "the role was created with me in mind <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> once the pilot script emerged at Showtime, both Robert Greenblatt and Michael Cuesta independently thought of me for the role and then approached me about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1994, {{ski flying}} {{returned}} to a newly independent Slovenia, where the hill in Planica had been reprofiled {{with the aim of}} allowing for jumps of more than 200m. The FIS was strongly against this and initially threatened to cancel the event on the grounds that its regulations on hill design had been violated. Negotiations between the organisers in Planica and the FIS managed to defuse the situation, allowing that year's Ski Flying World Championships to take place. Before the event, Espen Bredesen said: [...] "Of course I want to be the first , <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> [...] or [...] are also possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite its criticisms, [...] "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] {{received}} some positive reviews. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented on the}} episode, writing: [...] "I remember that 'Saddlesore' was much despised when it first aired, though I can’t recall if I joined that chorus as well. Maybe the many iffy episodes since early 2000 have made it look better, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> 'Saddlesore' offers a decent number of laughs. It goes off onto some dopey tangents and displays an unnerving tendency toward self-awareness, but it provides reasonable entertainment." [...] DVD Talk's Ian Jane described the cameo appearance by Bachman and Turner as [...] "fun".|$|E
500|$|The Incredibles as {{a concept}} dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during {{a period in which}} he tried to break into film. Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life. During this time, Bird had inked a {{production}} deal with Warner Bros. Animation and {{was in the process of}} directing his first feature, The Iron Giant. Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life. He stated, [...] "Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie." [...] After the box office failure of The Iron Giant, Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.|$|E
500|$|In {{opposition}} from 2012 to 2015, Tsakalotos {{was a key}} proponent of Syriza's economic policy. He argued that Greece needed something similar to the Marshall Plan, with a payment scheme that took into account {{the strength of the}} economy. He told Bloomberg News that [...] "People say that we are responsible for the situation we find ourselves in. OK, sure. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Germany will find it hard to argue that in 1953 [...] they were completely blameless." [...] He appeared in various international media as a spokesperson for Syriza and making the case for their policies: among others, he was interviewed on Lateline, an Australian news programme on ABC, by SBS, another Australian news channel, was quoted by the BBC and Bloomberg, and also appeared in an Intelligence Squared debate arguing for the motion 'Angela Merkel is Destroying Europe'.|$|E

500|$|Kelly {{believes}} that there's now {{a chance to}} change a political environment he thinks is filled with far too much vitriol. He hoped that the tragedy would also be an opportunity to improve the tone of our national dialogue and cool down the rhetoric. In {{response to a question}} on February 4, regarding the discussions about civility in politics Kelly said: [...] "I haven’t {{spent a lot of time}} following that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> with something that was so horrible and so negative, and the fact that six people lost their lives including a nine-year-old girl, a federal judge, Gabby’s staff member Gabe—who was like a younger brother to her—it’s really really a sad situation. I am hopeful that something positive can come out of it. I think that will happen, so those are good things." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{director}} Sam Mendes {{had been}} working on a film version of the story for several years, and in June 2003 Sondheim was approached to write the script. Although he turned down the offer, Mendes and producer Walter F. Parkes obtained his approval to use writer John Logan instead. Logan had previously collaborated with Parkes on Gladiator, and claimed his biggest challenge in adapting the Sondheim stage play [...] "was taking a sprawling, magnificent Broadway musical and making it cinematic, and an emotionally honest film. Onstage, you can have a chorus sing as the people of London, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be alienating in a movie." [...] Mendes left to direct the 2005 film Jarhead, and Burton leaped at taking over the direction after his project, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, fell apart due to its excessive budget.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, writing that [...] "The structure of 'White Rabbit' {{is kind of}} half-formed, {{in a way that}} strikes me as very similar to the structure of 'Tabula Rasa', <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> feeling of everything having been tossed together at the last minute suits the episode in a way it didn’t the earlier one." [...] VanDerWerff also writes, [...] "the more I think about this episode, the more I admire it for taking away Jack’s agency." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it [...] "features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave [...] "White Rabbit" [...] a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another [...] "character heavy" [...] episode without [...] "trying to cram unnecessary action." [...] However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as [...] "we don’t really believe that he will die, so it is an action movie scene which we probably didn’t leave." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with ABC News, sociologist of the University of Alberta, Stephen A. Kent commented, [...] "Historically, Scientology has tried to control what critics say about it. The Internet, however, has posed insurmountable problems regarding control and censorship and Wikipedia's action {{is just one of}} many disputes that have occurred when Internet users have pushed back. Scientology can't roll over and give up on this issue. It will continue to attempt to have its representation." [...] Evgeny Morozov of Foreign Policy wrote a blog post critical of the Arbitration decision, and stated, [...] "I am no fan of Scientology, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> banning them from Wikipedia is going to be counterproductive. Unfortunately, it presents the Wikipedia admins/editors as a non-neutral group that opposes a particular set of ideas." [...] In an August 2010 article in The Guardian, journalists Rachel Shabi and Jemima Kiss observed, [...] "Editors can remain anonymous when changing content, but conflicts are passed to Wikipedia's arbitration committee. Scientology was a regular source of conflict until the committee blocked editing by the movement." ...|$|E

On his injury, Jesé stated: [...] "I had a very tough time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> things in life happen for a reason. Maybe I had the injury because I needed to learn and become a more mature footballer." [...] Later that month he {{was included in the}} club's squad which won the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, making a substitute appearance in a 4–0 win over Cruz Azul in the semi-finals. He scored the first of his three La Liga goals for the season on 4 February 2015 in a 2–1 victory over Sevilla. Jesé struggled to break back into the first team following his injury though, starting only 3 of his 23 appearances for the season, {{and by the end of}} the campaign it was reported that he had grown frustrated at the club and was looking to leave in the summer.|$|E
500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure I agree with those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We worry about him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it still might be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E

Darren {{is due to}} go on a date he has arranged and Nancy comes to watch him, Darren's date does not arrive. As the evening continues, the pair realise there is an attraction between them and agree to go home together. Dawson said that the pair have [...] "always sort of hated each other" [...] as they are opposites, explaining that [...] "She's a feminist and he's a male chauvinist pig!"

He commented that the pair have [...] "never seen eye-to-eye, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> when they sit down and chat they realise they have a lot more in common than they think.

500|$|Furthermore, in 2013 Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{pointed out}} that [...] "two decades after its release, the Icelandic artist's first album has never sounded more relevant." [...] He argued that Debut [...] "reconstructed pop music", also writing that [...] "while pop in 2013 looks {{back to the early}} 90s for inspiration, Björk's ability on Debut to {{innovate}} by using disparate genres without losing a sense of her own identity should be the blueprint for any new artist with desires to break the mould." [...] In the album's entry in their list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" [...] —where the album was included at number 46—, NME claimed that [...] "Debut achieved the remarkable feat of turning an idiosyncratic vocalist from a feted cult band into a significant global pop star, without losing one iota of the experimental mindset and creative cool that made her so special." [...] In 2005, Björk stated that she thought the album wasn't as strong as her later efforts: [...] "It's hard to judge yourself but I don't think [...] my best. Debut was the album that went the highest up there in terms of what is 'Bjork music'. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the persona I created, which was entirely accidental, is better captured on the later albums".|$|E
