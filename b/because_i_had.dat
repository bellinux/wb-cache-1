5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{fallen in love with}} words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

25|$|These tenses (except for present perfect) {{correspond}} roughly to equivalent English perfect tenses (I {{had read}} / I will have read). They {{are used in}} various contexts for very different meanings, but they usually indicate an action that happened before another action said with another verb, noun or similar: Tos knygos neėmiau, nes jau ją buvau skaitęs – I didn’t take that book <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already read it; Po kelionės vaikai bus labai pasiilgę tėvų – After the trip the children will have badly missed their parents.|$|E

25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} of this book {{prompted}} many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E

According to Fordham, [...] "I was really shocked when I got the demo back, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never envisioned a '50s number.

[...] The response to Nike's project was mixed, with some comparing the story {{to the story of}} the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Games, while others such as Bob Wojnowski of The Detroit News said [...] "These are marketing pawns financed by well-heeled publicity seekers." ...|$|E

500|$|Gandhi {{credited}} Shrimad Rajchandra, a {{poet and}} Jain philosopher, as his influential counsellor. In Modern Review, June 1930, Gandhi wrote about their first encounter in 1891 at Dr. P.J. Mehta's residence in Bombay. Gandhi exchanged letters with Rajchandra {{when he was in}} South Africa, referring to him as Kavi (literally, [...] "poet"). In 1930, Gandhi wrote, [...] "Such was the man who captivated my heart in religious matters as no other man ever has till now." [...] 'I have said elsewhere that in moulding my inner life Tolstoy and Ruskin vied with Kavi. But Kavi's influence was undoubtedly deeper if only <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come in closest personal touch with him.' ...|$|E
500|$|Director Kim Manners {{noted that}} the episode [...] "was a really good show for me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not {{got a chance to}} work with Mitch.

This was the second episode of the series to not feature Scully, the first being the second season episode [...] "3". Guest actor Morris Panych, portraying the Syndicate assassin The Grey-Haired Man, makes his last appearance in the series in this episode. Panych had previously appeared in [...] "Piper Maru", [...] "Avatar", [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] and [...] "Memento Mori".|$|E

After briefly considering Tennessee Williams, Berg decided to research the aviator Charles Lindbergh, attracted by what he described as [...] "the dramatic possibilities of the story of the great hero who became a great victim and a great villain". Berg convinced Lindbergh's widow, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, to grant him unprecedented access to the man's archives, which he was surprised to find totaled [...] "1,300 boxes, or several million papers".|$|E

500|$|The {{novel is}} partly autobiographical. Like her narrator, Müller {{comes from the}} German-speaking {{minority}} in Romania, the Banat Swabians, with a father who had been former SS man during World War II. Trained as a teacher, she lost her position after refusing {{to cooperate with the}} Securitate. She emigrated to Germany in 1987. In a 1998 interview she mentioned that real persons can be recognized in some of her characters, including one in The Land of Green Plums: [...] "That [...] was already the case in my previous book [...] Because my best girlfriend died young, and because she had betrayed me, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to despise her and could not stop loving her." ...|$|E
500|$|Nunn {{also became}} an {{advocate}} of legalizing industrial hemp in Kentucky, writing, [...] "Frankly, I was opposed to the legalization of hemp for years <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been of the opinion hemp was marijuana. I was short-sighted in my thinking, and I was wrong." [...] In 2000, Nunn secured an acquittal for actor Woody Harrelson, who came to Lee County, Kentucky, and planted hemp seeds in open defiance of Kentucky's law forbidding the cultivation of hemp. [...] Later, he traveled to South Dakota where, {{at the base of}} Mount Rushmore, he publicly presented an Oglala Lakota leader with bales of hemp after the tribe's crop was confiscated by officers from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.|$|E
500|$|Seropian met {{programmer}} Jason Jones in {{an artificial}} intelligence {{course at the}} University of Chicago.

I think he actually thought I was a dick <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a fancy computer." [...] Seropian and Jones partnered to release the role-playing video game as [...] in 1992; while Jones finished the coding, Seropian handled design and publicity. The game relied on then-uncommon internet modems and AppleTalk connections for play and sold around 2,500 copies, but it developed a devoted following.|$|E
