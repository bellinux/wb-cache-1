5|$|Different {{national}} {{styles of}} organ building began to develop, often due to changing political climates. In the Netherlands, the organ became a large instrument with several divisions, doubled ranks, and mounted cornets. The organs of northern Germany also had more divisions, and independent pedal divisions became increasingly common. The {{divisions of the}} organ <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> discernible from the case design. 20th-century musicologists labelled this the Werkprinzip.|$|E
25|$|When Dziekański {{left the}} Customs hall, he <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> agitated. Bystanders and airport {{security}} guards {{were unable to}} communicate with him {{because he did not}} speak English. He used chairs to prop open the one-way doors between a Customs clearing area and a public lounge and at one point threw a computer and a small table to the floor before the police arrived.|$|E
25|$|Bunning {{is remembered}} {{for his role}} in the pennant race of 1964, in which the Phillies held a {{commanding}} lead in the National League for most of the season, eventually losing the title to the St. Louis Cardinals. Manager Gene Mauch used Bunning and fellow hurler Chris Short heavily down the stretch, and the two <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> fatigued as September wore on. With a six and a half game lead as late as September 21, they lost 10 games in a row to finish tied for second place.|$|E

25|$|Following The Sandman's victory, Woman began {{carrying}} the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to ringside. Throughout mid-1995, she helped The Sandman defend his championship {{in a series}} of bouts with Cactus Jack. In September 1995, she began also managing The Sandman's ally, ECW World Television Champion 2 Cold Scorpio. In late-1995, The Sandman began feuding with Mikey Whipwreck, during which a controversial storyline began in which Woman <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> aroused while watching The Sandman cane Whipwreck. The Sandman's reign lasted until October 28, 1995, when he lost to Whipwreck in a ladder match after Stunning Steve Austin prevented Woman from interfering.|$|E
25|$|Feeling a grand {{sense of}} loss at court and unable to assert his authority, the Tongzhi Emperor {{returned}} to his former habits. It was rumoured that he caught syphilis and <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> ill. The physicians spread a rumour that the emperor had smallpox, and proceeded to give medical treatment accordingly. Within a few weeks, on 13 January 1875, the emperor died. The Jiashun Empress followed suit in March. Judging from a modern medical perspective, the onset of syphilis comes in stages, thus the emperor's quick death {{does not seem to}} reflect its symptoms. Therefore, most historians maintain that the Tongzhi Emperor did, in fact, die from smallpox. Regardless, by 1875, Cixi was back onto the helm of imperial power.|$|E
500|$|Strom {{was not an}} {{effective}} speaker and often would {{not look at the}} text of his speeches until he was delivering them. [...] Realizing this, Hamilton once handed him a folder with nothing but a paper reading [...] "Sock it to 'em, Harry" [...] before the Premier was to give a speech at the University of Alberta. [...] The Premier opened the folder and, as he <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> alarmed, gratefully received the real speech when an aide brought it to him.|$|E

500|$|Edward Seymour was {{appointed}} Earl of Hertford in 1559. [...] He married Lady Catherine Grey, who was Lady Jane Grey's sister, in 1560. [...] As Catherine was {{in line for}} the throne, she needed Queen Elizabeth's permission to wed, and because this was not sought, the marriage was held in secret with Edward's sister, Lady Jane Seymour, as the only witness. [...] However, when Catherine <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> pregnant, she had little option but to reveal her marriage and, at her request, Lord Robert Dudley told the Queen. An angry Elizabeth had the Earl and Countess of Hertford interned in the Tower of London and annulled their marriage.|$|E

Sometime around 10 p.m., Dannemann, apparently feeling left out of the conversation and jealous of the attention Hendrix was giving Harvey's female friends, <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> upset and stormed out of the flat. Hendrix followed her, and an argument ensued between them during which Dannemann reportedly shouted: [...] "you fucking pig". Harvey, concerned that their yelling would draw unwanted attention from the police, asked them to quiet down.|$|E
500|$|Josh Scherr, {{leader of}} the Drake's Fortune story {{sequence}} team, said that they created Drake as an [...] "ordinary guy" [...] with no special powers. Instead, Drake <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> nervous at times, barely cleared objects while jumping, and stumbled while running. The characterizations were meant to show Drake as a frail character. He is not a master of hand-to-hand combat, and throws punches without style or skill. Sam Thompson, producer of Among Thieves, described Drake's martial arts abilities as [...] "fallible." [...] Sony Entertainment of America line producer Sam Thompson mused that Naughty Dog had created iconic characters before, including Crash Bandicoot. With Nathan Drake, however, the company wanted to produce a more average character, one who did not possess {{the same amount of}} confidence and who was more realistic and humble.|$|E

500|$|Parsons {{remained}} {{in contact with}} Oppenheimer. The two men and their wives visited each other from time to time, and the Parsons family especially enjoyed visiting its former neighbors at their new home at Olden Manor, a 17th-century estate with a cook and groundskeeper, surrounded by [...] of woodlands at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Parsons was disturbed {{by the rise of}} McCarthyism in the early 1950s. In 1953 he wrote a letter to Oppenheimer expressing his hope that [...] "the anti-intellectualism of recent months may have passed its peak". On 4 December that year, Parsons heard of President Dwight Eisenhower's [...] "blank wall" [...] directive, blocking Oppenheimer from access to classified material. Parsons <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> upset, and that night began experiencing severe chest pains. The next morning, he went to Bethesda Naval Hospital, where he died while the doctors were still examining him. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery alongside his daughter Hannah. He was survived by his father, brother, half-brother and sister, as well as his wife Martha and daughters Peggy and Clare.|$|E
500|$|In early July 1955, Hensley began {{a series}} of {{meetings}} near Altha, Florida. He conducted the meetings without snakes for three weeks, before procuring a [...] snake and bringing it to a Sunday afternoon service on July 24. Several dozen people gathered at an abandoned blacksmith shop for the observance. During the service, Hensley loudly delivered a sermon on the topic of faith. He removed the snake from the lard can in which it was stored, wrapped it around his neck, and rubbed it on his face. He walked around the audience while preaching and then returned the snake to the can. As he placed the snake into the can, it bit him on his wrist. After a few minutes, Hensley <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> ill, experiencing severe pain, a discolored arm, and hematemesis. He refused medical attention, although he remained in pain and was urged to seek treatment both by congregants and the Calhoun County Sheriff. One eyewitness claimed that Hensley attributed his suffering to the congregation's lack of faith, although his wife Sally stated that she believed it was the will of God. Hensley died early the next morning. Calhoun County Judge Hannah Gaskin ruled his death a suicide.|$|E

2500|$|On March 18, 2008, {{running back}} Ereck Plancher {{collapsed}} shortly after a conditioning drill, and was then transported {{to a nearby}} hospital where he died approximately one hour later. ESPN's [...] "Outside The Lines" [...] program on November 2, 2008 interviewed players {{who were at the}} training session at which Plancher became ill, and which after he died, and stated that the session was longer and far more rigorous than O'Leary and other UCF Athletics officials have admitted to publicly. They also alleged that O'Leary and other coaches had initially warned players off from providing assistance to Plancher when he <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> distressed. After a 14-day trial in 2011, a jury found the UCF Athletics Association guilty of negligence in the death of Plancher. The jury awarded each of his parents $5 million. Upon appeal, however, the Florida Supreme Court sided with the University of Central Florida, ruling that sickle-cell disease caused the death and the university didn't owe any money to Plancher's family.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a memo to}} Independence's human {{resources}} manager, released by {{the city in the}} aftermath of the shooting, Independence deputy police chief Jim Polak wrote that Loehmann had resigned rather than face certain termination due to concerns that he lacked the emotional stability to be a police officer. [...] Polak said that Loehmann was unable to follow [...] "basic functions as instructed" [...] and specifically cited a [...] "dangerous loss of composure" [...] that occurred in a weapons training exercise. Polak said that Loehmann's weapons handling was [...] "dismal" [...] and he <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> [...] "distracted and weepy" [...] as a result of relationship problems. The memo concluded, [...] "Individually, these events would not be considered major situations, but when taken together they show a pattern of a lack of maturity, indiscretion and not following instructions, I do not believe time, nor training, will be able to change or correct these deficiencies." [...] It was subsequently revealed that Cleveland police officials never reviewed Loehmann's personnel file from Independence prior to hiring him.|$|E
2500|$|When the not-guilty {{verdict was}} rendered, there was {{significant}} outcry {{among the general}} public and media that the jury made the wrong decision.

Traffic to news sites surged from about twomillion page views a minute to 3.3million, with most of the visits coming from the United States. Mashable reported that between 2pm and 3pm, one million viewers were watching CNN.com/live, 30times higher than the previous month's average. Twitter's trending topics in the United States were mostly about the subjects related to the case, and Newser reported that posts on Facebook were coming in [...] "too fast for all Facebook to even count them, meaning at least 10per second". Some people referred to the verdict as [...] "O.J. Number 2", and various media personalities and celebrities expressed outrage via Twitter.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s it was {{apparent}} to some that this juggernaut of economic growth was slowing down, and it began to <b>become</b> <b>visibly</b> apparent in the early 1970s. The United States grew increasingly dependent on oil importation from OPEC after peaking production in 1970, resulting in oil supply shocks in 1973 and 1979. Stagflation gripped the nation, and the government experimented with wage and price controls under President Nixon.|$|R

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, Miller {{appeared}} {{in an interview}} with Chris Matthews on the MSNBC show Hardball. Here, Miller <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> angry. Matthews criticized the premise of Miller's assertion that Kerry had actually voted against such defense programs by noting that in voting on appropriations bills, senators often vote against a version of a bill without wishing to oppose every item in that bill. Matthews also asked Miller to compare his assertion that a military under Kerry would be armed with only [...] "spitballs" [...] with rhetoric from Democrats that Republicans [...] "want to starve little kids, they {{want to get rid of}} education, they want to kill the old people" [...] and whether such level of rhetoric was constructive. When Miller expressed irritation at this line of questioning, Matthews pressed Miller with the question, [...] "Do you believe now– do you believe, Senator, truthfully, that John Kerry wants to defend the country with spitballs?" [...] Miller at first said that he wished the interview had been face-to-face so that he could [...] "get a little closer up into your face." [...] Miller angrily told Matthews to [...] "get out of my face," [...] and declared, [...] "I wish we lived in the day where you could challenge a person to a duel."

She visited Irish nuns and priests abroad, Irish famine relief charities, attended international sports events, met the Pope and, against pressure from the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, not to do so, was the only head of state to meet the 14th Dalai Lama during his tour of Europe. She put a special symbolic light in her kitchen window in Áras an Uachtaráin which was visible {{to the public as}} it overlooked the principal public view of the building, as a sign of remembering Irish emigrants around the world (placing a light in a darkened window to guide the way of strangers was an old Irish folk custom).

2500|$|The Court of Appeals of Virginia {{issued a}} ruling on April 23, 2013, which granted Huguely an appeal {{based on two}} key issues. The court agreed with the defense's {{argument}} that Huguely's right to counsel was violated {{when one of his}} attorneys, Rhonda Quagliana, fell ill and missed a day of trial. The court also granted the appeal based on the failure to exclude [...] "Juror 32" [...] because of possible doubts about his/her impartiality. The Court of Appeals then heard oral arguments from Huguely's new lawyer, Paul Clement (former Solicitor General of the United States), on December 11, 2013. Clement argued for a new trial, arguing Huguely was denied his right to an attorney when one of his (two) lawyers fell ill during the trial. Nine days into the trial, Huguely co-counsel Rhonda Quagliana <b>became</b> <b>visibly</b> ill with stomach flu, but the trial judge refused to grant a continuance, even though Huguely objected: co-counsel Frances Lawrence was asked by the trial judge whether he could proceed without Quagliana, he said he could. In addition to raising questions about [...] "Juror 32", Huguely's appeal team also objected to the trial judge's refusal to allow [...] "blame the victim" [...] questions of jurors and said the jury was not properly instructed on the definition of [...] "malice", an element in a second-degree murder conviction. The Court of Appeals ruled against Huguely on March 4, 2014, affirming the second-degree murder conviction. In November 2014 the Virginia Supreme Court declined to consider Huguely's appeal.|$|E
