40|$|This paper investigates whether <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> {{platinum}} ores display linear grinding and flotation characteristics {{or whether}} non-linear effects occur, i. e. synergistic/antagonistic effects. Ores from four different shafts {{are used in}} the study, i. e. Salene, Waterval UG 2, Paardekraal and Townlands. Laboratory grinding and flotation tests are conducted on <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> the four ores using a statistical simplex lattice mixture design. Grinding results show no evidence that <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ores display non-linear grinding characteristics. Flotation results show significant antagonistic effects in binary <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> the Salene ore with the other ore types. On the other hand, ternary/quaternary <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ores result in synergistic effects. The study concludes that <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> platinum ores display non-linear (non-additive) characteristics when there are large differences in metallurgical properties between the ore types. The study demonstrates that appropriately designed mixtures experiments are an effective way to study the performance <b>of</b> ore <b>blends</b> in the laboratory...|$|R
