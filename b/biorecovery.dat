40|$|Wastewater {{pollution}} {{with heavy}} metals {{is an issue}} of great environmental concern. The future development of clean technologies for the treatment of wastewater loaded with heavy metals entails environment friendly and sustainable processes that may allow simultaneously the recovery of the metals and their reutilization as value-added catalysts to be used in environmental applications. This is the first review regarding the <b>biorecovery</b> of metals and their further reutilization as heterogeneous catalysts. In this regard, metallic residues that generally would be considered as a waste {{at the end of the}} treatment process can be reutilized and transformed into value-added catalysts to be used in environmental applications. This review is focused in two broad areas: the <b>biorecovery</b> of chromium by a combined biosorption system consisting of bacteria supported on zeolites, and the catalytic reutilization of the metal-loaded zeolites in the oxidation of organic compounds, both in gaseous and liquid phase. After an overview describing the main subjects in the field of heavy metals recovery, biosorption, zeolites and catalytic oxidation, in the following sections special emphasis will be given to the main results and findings regarding these clean technologies of <b>biorecovery</b> and reuse of metals in catalytic reactions of environmental concern.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the <b>biorecovery</b> of iron and other metals, {{simultaneously}} with nitrogen removal from wastewaters, {{by means of an}} innovative bioprocess which is ferrous iron-mediated autotrophic denitrification. Biological oxidation with metal recovery is a promising and cost-effective alternative to the conventional chemical processes of neutralization followed by precipitation/sedimentation for metal-containing water treatment. Nowadays, the need of metals is increasing but the natural high-grade ores are rapidly decreasing (Hoque et al., 2011). In addition, heavy metal pollution {{is one of the biggest}} environmental issues (Fu et al., 2011) mainly due to the discharge of contaminated industrial and mining wastewaters into the hydrosphere (Jadhav et al., 2013). As an example, an environmental catastrophe recently occurred and is still taking place in Brazil’s mineral-rich state of Minas Gerais, due to the collapse of two mining dams having serious consequences for the population such as the contamination of the water supplies. Environmental regulations have become more stringent and require eco-friendly technologies, with low cost and low energy requirements while giving high removal yields (Hoque et al., 2011; Jadhav et al., 2013). Therefore, <b>biorecovery</b> of metals from wastewater is an economic and profitable solution for the high demand of metals and the reduction of the mining impact. Among metals, iron is one of the most important and the processing of iron for industrial purposes accounts for 95...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Extracellular {{compounds}} {{produced by}} a consortium of indigenous bacteria interact with the polymetallic Kupferschiefer black shale and implicate for elements mobilization and/or complexation. The extracellular compounds were identified by GC-MS as carboxylic acids, but also aromatic acids and alcohols. Due to their action in batch experiment 16 elements were mobilized from black shale. Among mobilized elements precious metals (Cu, Ni, Co, V) as well as toxic heavy metals (As) were determined.

We have constructed a Deinococcus radiodurans strain harboring phoN, a gene encoding a nonspecific acid phosphatase, obtained from a local isolate of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. The recombinant strain expressed an ∼ 27 -kDa active PhoN protein and efficiently precipitated over 90 % of the uranium from a 0. 8 mM uranyl nitrate solution in 6 h.

40|$|Conventional {{physicochemical}} processes for removing heavy metals from industrial effluents {{are high in}} chemical usage and produce large amounts of chemical sludges, which in turn needs secured disposal. Biological processes {{to overcome these problems}} have been developed for treating wastewaters containing heavy metals. The bioremoval and <b>biorecovery</b> of zinc ions from rubber glove mill effluent on a sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) was studied. Without adding any precipitant, the processes could achieve Zn and COD removal of 40 - 60 % and 50 - 70 % respectively. In order to recover the metal, the sludge was digested in an anaerobic digestion reactor. This study revealed that anaerobic digestion with longer hydraulic retention time could increase the recovery of heavy metals.

Among the nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles are playing {{a major role in}} the field of biomedical nanotechnology and nanomedicine. Silver is a naturally occurring precious metal, most often as a mineral ore in association with other elements. Silver nanoparticle has a natural antimicrobial effect against many pathogens such as bacteria, fungus, viruses, and yeast.

Many approaches were tried to solve this problem, they included roasting, oxidation in addition to bioprocessing. In thelast approach, application of bacteria enhances sulfidesbio-oxidation and consequently facilitates their leaching.

40|$|AbstractUranium ore {{from the}} Narwapahar mines, Jharkhand, India (∼ 0. 047 % U 3 O 8), rich in apatite content (5 %) was {{investigated}} for bio-processing in lab-scale columns and bioreactor. With {{a load of}} 2. 0 kg ore in column at pH 1. 7 using A. ferrooxidans and L. ferrooxidans, uranium recovery of 57 % and 66 % was achieved, respectively in 40 days in comparison to 39 % in chemical leaching. Bio-leaching studies with the Narwapahar ore carried out in a 2 L bioreactor at 10 % (w/v) pulp density at pH 2. 0, rpm 150 and 35 oC yielded 57 % and 63 % uranium recovery by 10 % (v/v) enriched culture of A. ferrooxidans and L. ferrooxidans, respectively in 5 days.

40|$|The project {{objective}} was to advance {{the development of the}} H 2 economy by improving biological H 2 production in a sustainable way. Pseudo-continuous H 2 production was achieved with improved efficiency, via the bacterial fermentation of sugars in a dual-bioreactor (‘upstream system’) comprising a dark fermentation coupled to a photofermentation. Excess biomass from the upstream system was used to recover palladium from solution, producing ‘palladised biomass’ (Bio-Pd(0)), which was useful in the construction of bioinorganic catalytic anodes for the electricity generation from bio-H 2 using a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (‘downstream system’). Furthermore, the catalytic usefulness of Bio-Pd(0) was confirmed in several reactions in comparison with other palladised biomasses and with Pd(0) made chemically. The upstream modules: Escherichia coli dark fermentation and Rhodobacter sphaeroides photofermentation, were investigated and developed separately, before coupling the two stages by the novel application of electrodialysis (accelerated membrane separation). The <b>biorecovery</b> and testing of palladium bionanocatalyst are described, before the production of fuel cell catalyst using waste biomass.

40|$|Background: Biomineralization is a {{significant}} process performed by living organisms in which minerals are produced through the hardening of biological tissues. Herein, we focus on calcium carbonate precipitation, as part of biomineralization, {{to be used in}} applications for environmental protection, material technology, and other fields. A strain GM- 1, Microbacterium sp. GM- 1, isolated from active sludge, was investigated for its ability to produce urease and induce calcium carbonate precipitation in a metabolic process. Results: It was discovered that Microbacterium sp. GM- 1 resisted high concentrations of urea up to 60  g/L. In order to optimize the calcification process of Microbacterium sp. GM- 1, the concentrations of Ni 2 + and urea, pH value, and culture time were analyzed through orthogonal tests. The favored calcite precipitation culture conditions were as follows: the concentration of Ni 2 + and urea were 50  μM and 60  g/L, respectively, pH of 10, and culture time of 96  h. Using X-ray diffraction analysis, the calcium carbonate polymorphs produced by Microbacterium sp. GM- 1 were proven to be mainly calcite. Conclusions: The results of this research provide evidence that Microbacterium sp. GM- 1 can biologically induce calcification and suggest that strain GM- 1 may play a potential role in the synthesis of new biominerals and in bioremediation or <b>biorecovery...</b>|$|E
40|$|Geoactive soil fungi were {{examined}} {{for their ability}} to release inorganic phosphate (Pi) and mediate lead bioprecipitation during growth on organic phosphate substrates. Aspergillus niger and Paecilomyces javanicus grew in 5 mM Pb(NO 3) 2 -containing media amended with glycerol 2 -phosphate (G 2 P) or phytic acid (PyA) as sole P sources, and liberated Pi into the medium. This resulted in almost complete removal of Pb from solution and extensive precipitation of lead-containing minerals around the biomass, confirming the importance of the mycelium as a reactive network for biomineralization. The minerals were identified as pyromorphite (Pb 5 (PO 4) 3 Cl), only produced by P. javanicus, and lead oxalate (PbC 2 O 4), produced by A. niger and P. javanicus. Geochemical modelling of lead and lead mineral speciation as a function of pH and oxalate closely correlated with experimental conditions and data. Two main lead biomineralization mechanisms were therefore distinguished: pyromorphite formation depending on organic phosphate hydrolysis and lead oxalate formation depending on oxalate excretion. This also indicated species specificity in biomineralization depending on nutrition and physiology. Our findings provide further understanding of lead geomycology and organic phosphates as a biomineralization substrate, and are also relevant to metal immobilization biotechnologies for bioremediation, metal and P <b>biorecovery,</b> and utilization of waste organic phosphates...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of biotechnological stabilization of arsenic from (bio-) leaching operations. One of the latest applications of the Thioteq technology is arsenic immobilization. The Thioteq-scorodite <b>biorecovery</b> reactor is an aerobic system to immobilise arsenic in bio-scorodite crystals. In this patented process, biological arsenite oxidation, biological ferrous iron oxidation and crystallisation reactions are simultaneously taking place. Bio-scorodite crystals can be easily harvested by sedimentation due to their relative large size of up to 160 µm. This biogenic material is classified as non-hazardous due to its very low arsenic leaching rates. Furthermore, bioscorodite crystals resemble the colour, crystal morphology, iron and arsenic content, structural water of the mineral scorodite. The operational costs related to scorodite bio-crystallization can be reduced at least 50 % compared to chemical precipitation because the use of biological reactions to induce the crystallization of scorodite and the good stability properties of the produced crystals. The Thioteq-scorodite process is a reliable cost effective solution to arsenic removal and immobilization by using biological processes. The stabilization of arsenic {{in the form of}} biologically produced scorodite is an attractive technology for the compact and safe immobilization of arsenic from medium to high concentrations of arsenic in acidic process streams...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{need for}} the {{development}} of a system that can extract gold out of aqueous solutions without the use of hazardous chemicals. A <b>biorecovery</b> system using alfalfa biomass may be the answer for the recovery of gold(III) from aqueous solutions in an environmentally friendly manner. Batch laboratory experiments indicate that alfalfa binds gold(III) quickly and in a pH-independent manner. Gold(III) binding capacity experiments performed with the alfalfa roots and shoots have shown the following results: 40. 9 mg gold per gram of shoot tissues; 18. 7 mg gold per gram of root tissues. We were able to recover up to 99. 1 % of the bound gold metal by treatment with 0. 2 M acidic thiourea. Surprisingly we discovered that the bound gold turned purple in color, meaning that gold(III) had been reduced to gold(0). This was confirmed by transmission electron microscopic analysis (TEM). In addition, column experiments were performed with silica-immobilized alfalfa to determine the gold(III) binding ability under flow conditions. This in turn could constitute an innovative pollution prevention technology to reclaim gold from natural and industrial processes and prevent the use of hazardous chemicals that might contaminate groundwaters.

40|$|This work aims at the reutilization of a Cr-loaded NaY zeolite {{obtained}} by <b>biorecovery</b> of chromium from water as catalyst in the oxidation of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC). Cr-NaY catalysts were obtained after biosorption of Cr(VI) using a bacterium, Arthrobacter viscosus, supported on the zeolite. The biosorption experiments were conducted at different pH values in the range 1 – 4. The catalysts were characterized by several techniques, namely ICP-AES, SEM-EDS, XRD, XPS, Raman, H 2 -TPR and N 2 adsorption. The zeolite obtained at pH 4 has the highest content of chromium, 0. 9 %, and {{was selected as the}} best catalyst for the oxidation of different VOC, namely ethyl acetate, ethanol and toluene. For all VOC tested, the catalyst with chromium showed higher activity and selectivity to CO 2, in comparison with the starting zeolite NaY. The presence of chromium shifted also the reaction pathways. In terms of selectivity to CO 2, the following sequence was observed: ethyl acetate > toluene > ethanol.

40|$|Fungi play {{important}} roles in biogeochemical processes such as organic matter decomposition, bioweathering of minerals and rocks, and metal transformations, and therefore influence elemental cycles for essential and potentially-toxic elements, e. g. P, S, Pb, and As. Arsenic is a potentially-toxic metalloid for most organisms, and naturally occurs in trace quantities in soil, rocks, water, air and living organisms. Among more than 300 arsenic minerals occurring in nature, mimetite [Pb 5 (AsO 4) 3 Cl] is the most stable lead arsenate and holds considerable promise in metal stabilization for in situ and ex situ sequestration and remediation through precipitation, as do other insoluble lead apatites, such as pyromorphite [Pb 5 (PO 4) 3 Cl] and vanadinite [Pb 5 (VO 4) 3 Cl]. Despite the insolubility of mimetite, the organic acid-producing soil fungus Aspergillus niger was able to solubilize mimetite with simultaneous precipitation of lead oxalate as a new mycogenic biomineral. Since fungal biotransformation of both pyromorphite and vanadinite have been previously documented a new biogeochemical model for the biogenic transformation of lead apatites (mimetite, pyromorphite and vanadinite) by fungi is hypothesised in this study by application of geochemical modelling together with experimental data. These models should allow for accurate prediction of fungal dissolution patterns of lead apatites based on based on pH, cation-anion composition and concentrations, and other parameters. A general pattern for fungal biotransformation of lead apatite minerals is proposed, proving new understanding of ecological implications of the biogeochemical cycling of component elements as well as industrial applications in metal stabilization, bioremediation and <b>biorecovery...</b>|$|E
40|$|Phytoremediation of soil has {{attracted}} much attention in recent years due to its multiple advantages such as maintaining the biological activity and physical structure of soils, being potentially inexpensive and visually unobtrusive, and providing the possibility of <b>biorecovery</b> of metals. Identification of native species for phytoremediation {{is a key to}} the success of the method. This study sought to identify plant species with potential for phytoremediation of soils polluted with lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu). Soil and plants were collected and analysed for total metal concentration. Soil metal content range (mg kg- 1) was 29. 64 - 3457 for Pb, 37. 53 - 6544. 2 for Zn and 30. 7 - 3625 for Cu. Of 19 plant species analysed, Sporobolus sp. proved to be a hyperaccumulator of Cu, Launea cornuta (Oliv & Hiern) O. Jeffrey, Tagetes minuta (L.) and Blotiella glabra (Bory) Tryon showed high potential for phytoextraction of Cu, and Dioscorea spp. (yam) and Stylochaeton natalensis Schott showed high potential for phytostabilisation of Cu. No hyperaccumulators of Pb and Zn were identified in the area, but Tephrosia candida and Tagetes minuta (L.) were identified as potential plants for phytoextraction of Pb and Conyza bonariensis (L.)

40|$|The acidophilic proteobacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is {{involved}} in the industrial <b>biorecovery</b> of copper. It is found in acidic environments in biofilms and is important in the biogeochemical cycling of metals and nutrients. Its genome contains a cluster of four genes, glyQ, glysS, gph, and act, that are predicted to encode the Î± and subunits of glycine tRNA synthetase, a phosphatase, and an acyltransferase, respectively (GenBank accession no. DQ 149607). act, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, produces acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) principally of chain length C 14 according to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry measurements. The AHLs have biological activity as shown by in vivo studies using the reporter strain Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm 41 SinI-. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) experiments indicate that the four genes are expressed as a single transcript, demonstrating that they constitute an operon. According to semiquantitative RT-PCR results, act is expressed more highly when A. ferrooxidans is grown in medium containing iron than when it is grown in medium containing sulfur. Since AHLs are important intercellular signaling molecules used by many bacteria to monitor their population density in quorum-sensing control of gene expression, this result suggests that A. ferrooxidans has two quorum-sensing systems, one based on Act, as described herein, and the other based on a Lux-like quorum-sensing system, reported previously. The latter system was shown to be upregulated in A. ferrooxidans grown in sulfur medium, suggesting that the two quorum-sensing systems respond to different environmental signals that may be related to their abilities to colonize and use different solid sulfur- and iron-containing minerals.
