This paper presents a novel dataset that expands the data in three dimensions: (i) a larger cross-section with 28 countries, (ii) a higher (monthly) frequency of real economy data, and (iii) disaggregated data ensuring representativeness. We aggregate in total 415 single series using Principal Component Analysis to construct a <b>business</b> <b>activity</b> <b>indicator</b> for individual countries for the years 1925 – 1936. We date business cycle peaks and troughs during the Great Depression, and find that while pre-Depression peaks occurred in almost all countries in 1929, some countries were severely hit by the crisis as late as 1930 and 1931. Furthermore, we analyse business cycle comovement during the interwar period and find that exchange controls made countries more independent from the global economy, while the gold standard induced comovement...|$|E

The background of the economic crisis was a test for the perspectives of Euro adoption by Romania; where, the negative external shock was transmitted through the trade channels with foreign partners. The monetary policy of the country proved to be inefficient in neutralizing the corresponding negative effects. The solution envisaged by the authorities was the use of an external adjustment mechanism rather than an internal one. However, in this case, the negative effects of the crisis will persist in the economy and will increase the adoption costs under the circumstances of a structural divergence between the Romanian economy and the Euro Area...|$|R

40|$|The {{researcher}} establishes, through {{review of}} literature on {{the theory of the}} firm, that the firm operates as a complex adaptive system, consisting of interdependent tangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> and intangible capabilities. These interdependent capabilities are ultimately the drivers for creating competitive advantage, which is made observable as the value of the firm. When evaluating firm value, experts in the field of capital appraisal make use of the standard DCF method that, however, accounts only for tangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> and does not explicitly examine the intangible capabilities of the firm. In an attempt to address the above limitation, the researcher develops a methodology aimed at explicitly evaluating firm capabilities in the context of firm valuation. In an effort to accomplish this task, the researcher adopts a qualitative and quantitative approach to identify and analyse the underlying constituents of firm capabilities. Through a series of discussions and group sessions with experts, the research identified 127 intangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators,</b> which are summarised under eight higher order factors (capabilities). This structure is confirmed through PLS analysis that indicates the existence of the following eight intangible capabilities: (1) value for money, (2) product complexity, (3) distribution, (4) culture, (5) competition, (6) asset management, (7) environment and (8) market equity. Regression analysis confirms that intangible capabilities represent a better predictor for firm value than thangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators.</b> The researcher also carries out bivariate correlation analyses in order to examine the interrelationship between tangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> and intangible capabilities. The results confirm that the tangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> are indeed embedded in the firm's intangible capabilities. Overall, the research adds knowledge in three areas. First, it extends the literature on capabilities and firm valuation by providing a superior way to DCF of evaluating firm value {{as a function of the}} firm's capabilities. Second, the research contributes to business practice by offering a step-wise procedure for explicitly evaluating firm capabilities. Third, the research adds knowledge to methods by identifying the intangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> through interviews and surveys with experts in the field of capital appraisal and reducing these <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> into capabilities using focus groups and PLS analysis...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in IT industry {{lead to the}} notion of a Service, as an abstraction for an encapsulated <b>business</b> <b>activity,</b> hidden behind a well-defined interface. This abstraction fosters the view of complex <b>business</b> <b>activities,</b> as interactions between Services, allowing for an agile <b>business</b> <b>activity</b> modification. Furthermore, a breakdown of the monolithic <b>business</b> <b>activity,</b> into cooperating services, enables a simpler identification of Service’s capabilities, needed to accomplish given business goal. This fosters a clearer view of the overall process, in regard to outsourcing opportunities for external allocation of Services. The description of Services and collaborations between them, leads to the definition of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). In our understanding of SOA, a <b>business</b> <b>activity</b> is a set of messages being exchanged between Services, to enable the achievement of a common business goal.

40|$|The Polish <b>Business</b> <b>Activity</b> Law Act {{came into}} force on 1 January 2001. In section 5 of the Act the Polish {{legislator}} regulated {{the issue of}} undertaking and performing <b>business</b> <b>activities</b> by foreign entrepreneurs {{in the form of}} branches in Poland. The legislator allows a foreigner to undertake and conduct <b>business</b> <b>activities</b> in the form of branches in the Republic of Poland on condition of reciprocity insofar as the international agreements ratified by Poland do not stipulate otherwise. At the same time, an entrepreneur is obliged to obtain an entry in the National Register of Companies in order to undertake a <b>business</b> <b>activity,</b> just like a Polish entrepreneur. Moreover, an entrepreneur is obliged to designate an authorised person in the branch to represent a foreign entrepreneur, formulate the name of the branch and do the bookkeeping separately from the foreign entrepreneur. The Polish legislator ensures freedom for foreign entrepreneurs to undertake <b>business</b> <b>activities,</b> however, the very performance of the <b>business</b> <b>activity</b> is subject to state supervision.
