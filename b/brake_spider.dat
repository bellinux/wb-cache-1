40|$|Abstract [...] A fixture is {{designed}} and built to hold, support and locate every component to ensure that each is drilled or machined with accuracy and manufactured individually. A fixture can be designed for a particular job. A <b>brake</b> <b>spider</b> includes a spider body with a central opening and a slot for receiving a camshaft and bracket assembly. The <b>brake</b> <b>spider</b> is attached to axle housing via the central opening. The form to be used depends on the shape and requirement of the work piece to be machined. In the existing fixture, used for modeling <b>brake</b> <b>spider</b> component, only five components were machined per hour. In the present work, detailed study of <b>brake</b> <b>spider</b> component is carried out and design is modified to increase the productivity. The new fixture design is carried out by using CATIA V 5 modeling software and it is critically evaluated {{for the failure of}} piston rod component, by finite element method (FEM) using ANSYS software. This modified design is adapted in the fabrication of fixture and is tested for its productivity. It is found that there is a considerable enhancement in the productivity to seven components per hour with required accuracy.
