500|$|The {{first few}} races of the 1982 season were promising. Villeneuve led in Brazil {{in the new}} 126C2, before {{spinning}} into retirement, and finished third at the United States Grand Prix West although he was later disqualified for a technical infringement. The Ferraris were handed an unexpected advantage at the San Marino Grand Prix as an escalation of the FISA-FOCA war saw the FOCA teams boycott the race, effectively leaving Renault as Ferrari's only serious opposition. With Renault driver Prost retiring from fourth place on lap 7 followed by his teammate Arnoux on the 44th lap Ferrari {{seemed to have the}} win guaranteed. In order to conserve fuel and ensure the cars finished the Ferrari team ordered both drivers to slow down. Villeneuve believed that the order also meant that the drivers were to maintain position but Pironi passed Villeneuve. A few laps later Villeneuve re-passed Pironi and slowed down again, believing that Pironi was simply trying to entertain the Italian crowd. On the last lap Pironi passed and aggressively chopped across the front of Gilles in Villeneuve corner and took the win. Villeneuve was irate as he believed that Pironi had disobeyed the order to hold position. Meanwhile, Pironi claimed that he had done nothing wrong as the team had only ordered the cars to slow down, not maintain position. Villeneuve stated after the race [...] "I think {{it is well known that}} if I want someone to stay <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I am faster, then he stays behind me." [...] Feeling betrayed and angry Villeneuve vowed never to speak to Pironi again.|$|E

500|$|The {{second half}} {{started off with}} Crayston briefly taking {{on the role of}} a forward, driving in a shot that Smith did well to save. Arsenal's {{forwards}} followed this with a flowing move from James, Hulme and Bastin, with the final move resulting in Bastin heading just wide of the post. Although play in the first half was relatively equal, in the second half Arsenal were the superior side, simply outclassing the Second Division Sheffield United. In the 74th minute a movement was started by James, who passed the ball to Bastin. Bastin dribbled the ball past Hooper before crossing the ball into the centre for Drake, who drove the ball into the roof of the net with his left foot. Moments after the goal United were on the attack, Barton broke down the right wing, crossing the ball in for Dodds who, finding his marker out of position, headed the ball against the bar. Dodds later said in an interview, [...] "I was just about to direct the ball down into the net when a wee fellow called Wilf Copping went up <b>behind</b> <b>me</b> <b>and,</b> in striving to get to the ball, punched me in the back. This had the unfortunate effect of knocking my head backwards so the ball thudded against the crossbar instead of nestling itself {{in the back of the}} net. But for that, who knows, things might have turned out different." [...] Arsenal won the game with a single goal, the match having been mostly full of positive play and relatively free of fouls, although Drake was penalised on five occasions for using his elbows too much.|$|E

These guys played on the original and wrote the songs, and were the sound that created them."

2500|$|After {{the race}} ended, the pit lane {{atmosphere}} became turbulent when a visibly angered Buemi went to Félix da Costa and {{accused him of}} braking his car's steering in the second turn. When Félix da Costa replied he had not made contact, Buemi walked to his teammate Frijns and engaged in a heated argument. Frijns argued he the choices he had were either to hitting Buemi's rear-wing or driving around {{the outside of the}} driver. He threatened to drive into Buemi's rear-end the next time he was anywhere near him. Buemi confronted Abt shortly after and accused the latter of hitting him deliberately. When Buemi walked away, he turned to Abt and called him [...] "a dirty guy". More than half an hour after the rant, Buemi called Audi Sport Abt [...] "a dirty team" [...] through the press and claimed the company went beyond what was allowed in the rules. Frijns was perplexed by Buemi's confrontation as he was expecting to be thanked by Buemi and believed he avoided being caught up in a more serious incident in the opening lap, [...] "I had actually already taken him before I turned in and I felt a small touch on the left rear but nothing much.
