500|$|Senator David B. Hill of New York, a gold supporter, was next. As Hill {{moved to}} the podium, a {{reporter}} friend passed Bryan a note urging {{him to make a}} patriotic speech without hint of sectionalism; Bryan responded, [...] "You will not be disappointed." [...] Hill gave a calm speech defending the gold position, and swayed few delegates. He was followed by two other gold men, Senator William Vilas of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor William E. Russell. Vilas gave a lengthy defense of the Cleveland administration's policies, so long that Russell, fearing that Vilas' speech would cut into his time, asked that the time given to the gold proponents be extended by ten minutes. Bryan consented, on condition that his own time was extended by the same amount; this was agreed to. [...] "And I needed it for the speech I was to make." [...] Bryan later wrote, [...] "This was another unexpected bit of good fortune. I had never had such an opportunity <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life and never expect to have again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shyamalan {{originally}} {{offered the}} roles of Aang to Noah Ringer; Sokka to Jackson Rathbone; [...] to Nicola Peltz; and Zuko to Jesse McCartney. In an interview with People, Shyamalan claimed {{that he did not}} want to make The Last Airbender without Nicola Peltz, [...] "I said that only once <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career, and that was when I met Haley in The Sixth Sense auditions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another story {{shows his}} partner Terence Reese {{picking up a}} {{collection}} of silver cup trophies from Schapiro's flat in Eaton Place (the Upstairs, Downstairs setting) and carrying them in a pillow-case. Stopped in the street by a policeman and asked to explain his unusual sack of possessions, Reese led the officer back to the flat so that Schapiro could validate his explanation. When Schapiro answered the door, he sized up the situation, and when asked [...] "Can you identify this man?", said [...] "Never seen him <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 11 September 2010, {{the annual}} Dartmoor Yomp was re-routed to allow filming to {{continue}} undisturbed. Spielberg praised the Dartmoor countryside's beauty: [...] "I have never <b>before,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> long and eclectic career, been gifted {{with such an}} abundance of natural beauty as I experienced filming War Horse on Dartmoor... And, with two-and-a-half weeks of extensive coverage of landscapes and skies, I hardly scratched {{the surface of the}} visual opportunities that were offered to me." [...] Spielberg felt that the landscape was very much a character in the film.|$|E
2500|$|Castillo scored {{his first}} goal for Shakhtar while playing against SV Salzburg in the Champions League. He had only {{played in a}} few games for Shakhtar when, in a league match versus FC Naftovyk-Ukrnafta Okhtyrka, Shakhtar won a penalty kick. Castillo refused to give the ball to {{designated}} penalty kick-taker Cristiano Lucarelli and took the penalty himself, which was saved by the goalkeeper. Castillo was immediately substituted from the game. Coach Mircea Lucescu commented [...] "What Castillo did, from a professional point of view, I've {{never seen anything like}} it <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> whole life. There will be some measures taken against Castillo".|$|E
2500|$|Dodds {{reported}} that he asked God how he should play cricket, and received the reply: [...] "Hit the ball hard and enjoy it." [...] He took some while to follow this advice, but when he did, the Essex cricketer and coach Frank Rist noted a transformation in his batting which led him to dub Dodds [...] "the miracle man". Dodds himself dated his transformation to a match against Middlesex: [...] "I felt closer to God than ever <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life," [...] he wrote. [...] "I tried to fashion the loveliest strokes I could manage for the God who would enjoy them. In return I had {{a tremendous sense of}} His pleasure." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{never had}} a {{birthday}} cake or a birthday celebration <b>before</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> life," [...] he said, and we hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry at that confession.|$|R
2500|$|Upon Castaños' arrival Dupont {{decided to}} call for a truce, {{negotiating}} terms with the Spanish officers over several days. After learning this, Vedel withdrew some distance along the highway. Spanish commanders threatened to massacre the French soldiers if this formation did not surrender, and Dupont compelled Vedel to return and lay down his arms. Handing his sword to Castaños, Dupont exclaimed, [...] "You may well, General, be proud of this day; it is remarkable because I have never lost a pitched battle until now—I who have been in more than twenty." [...] The Spaniard's biting reply: [...] "It is the more remarkable because I was never in one <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Braves {{earned their}} fourth win {{of the season}} against former Braves pitcher Alex Wood and the Los Angeles Dodgers in a {{lopsided}} 8–1 game at Turner Field. Wood said after the game that it [...] "was not really the way I pictured coming back {{here for the first}} time. Fastball command was the most frustrating thing. I don't even know if I've walked in a run <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> professional career. The walks were pretty frustrating. It was a tough one to swallow, but I have another one in five days." [...] Despite a 3-1 lead, the Dodgers scored four unanswered runs to snap the Braves four-game win streak. A Yasmani Grandal double in the 10th inning gave the Dodgers a 2–1 victory in the Braves's fourth extra-inning game of the season.|$|E
2500|$|Lionsgate {{confirmed}} in March 2011 that about 30 actresses auditioned or read {{for the role}} of Katniss Everdeen, including Hailee Steinfeld, Abigail Breslin, Emma Roberts, Saoirse Ronan, Chloë Grace Moretz, Jodelle Ferland, Lyndsy Fonseca, Emily Browning, Shailene Woodley, and Kaya Scodelario. On March 16, 2011, it was announced that Jennifer Lawrence (who was at the time filming for [...] ) had landed the coveted role. Ross described Lawrence as having [...] "an incredible amount of self-assuredness, you got the sense that this girl knew exactly who she was. And then she came in and read for me and just knocked me out; I'd never seen an audition like that <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. It {{was one of those things}} where you just glimpse your whole movie in front of you." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 11, 1974, Coleman lost {{a bid for}} {{a no-hitter}} {{in the eighth inning}} when Gene Michael of the New York Yankees hit a one-out single. [...] By May 15, 1974, Coleman had a 6–1 record and {{appeared}} to be on track for the best season of his career. [...] However, he did not win another game for two months, and his performance dropped off markedly. [...] He finished the 1974 season with a 14–12 record and a 4.32 ERA in 41 starts. He walked an astounding 158 batters in 1974 (a Tigers single-season record) for a career high rate of 5.0/9 IP. [...] At the end of the 1974 season, Coleman said: [...] "It was really strange. [...] My arm felt better than it ever had <b>before</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. But I couldn't do it. [...] It {{was just one of those}} crazy things. At times I didn't have any idea what I was doing out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1897 Munch {{returned}} to Kristiania, {{where he also}} received grudging acceptance—one critic wrote, [...] "A fair number of these pictures have been exhibited <b>before.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> opinion these improve on acquaintance." [...] In 1899, Munch began an intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a [...] "liberated" [...] upper-class woman. They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in [...] "The Frieze of Life" [...] series, The Dance of Life (1899). Larsen was eager for marriage, and Munch begged off. His drinking and poor health reinforced his fears, as {{he wrote in the}} third person: [...] "Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage. His sick and nervous home had given him the feeling that he had no right to get married." [...] Munch almost gave in to Tulla, but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin. His Girls on the Jetty, created in eighteen different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations. In 1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing [...] "a symphonic effect—it made a great stir—a lot of antagonism—and a lot of approval." [...] The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch's work even though the public still found his work alien and strange.|$|E
