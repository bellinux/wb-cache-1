5|$|The 2000–01 season saw Johnson {{struggle}} in the league, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to score in the League Cup, putting two past Millwall in a 5–0 second-leg win in the second round, and then the winning goal in a 2–1 win over Coventry City in the fourth round.|$|E
5|$|Paoli {{sold his}} {{properties}} in Italy and acquired {{a small country}} house in Spain. He stayed {{for a few months}} with his brother Carlos in the Philippines.

5|$|As a {{military}} man, al-Mu'tasim's outlook was utilitarian, and his intellectual pursuits {{could not be}} {{compared with those of}} al-Ma'mun or his successor al-Wathiq, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> his brother's policy of promoting writers and scholars. Baghdad remained a major centre of learning throughout his reign. Among the notable scholars active during his reign were the astronomers Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi and Ahmad al-Farghani, the polymath al-Jahiz, and the distinguished Arab mathematician and philosopher al-Kindi, who dedicated his work On First Philosophy to his patron al-Mu'tasim.|$|E

5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander. Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to order the attack. The brief quiet that had {{resulted}} from the explosion of the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded. She finally struck her colours.|$|E
5|$|In 1870 Brassey {{was told}} that he had cancer <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to visit his working sites. One of his last visits was to the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, only a few miles from his first railway {{contract}} at Penkridge. In the late summer of 1870 he took to his bed at his home in St Leonards-on-Sea. There he was visited by members of his work force, not only his engineers and agents, but also his navvies, many of whom had walked for days to come and pay their respects.|$|E
5|$|Invites to Golden League meets never materialised, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> {{to run at}} smaller events. He ran a European leading time of 10.06seconds at Papaflessia in Greece, and won the 100m and 200m {{races at}} the 2009 European Team Championships. He was the fastest entrant at the {{national}} championships but 2008 runner-up Simeon Williamson won the final by some distance. The result took Chambers by surprise {{and he said that}} limited opportunities to race had made him complacent. He later withdrew from the 200m race citing exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|Kieswetter's {{career was}} cut short owing to an injury {{sustained}} while batting for Somerset in July 2014: a ball penetrated the gap between his helmet's grille and visor and struck him in the face, damaging his vision. There was initially some hope of a full recovery and he was named in a provisional England squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to experience difficulties with his vision. As {{a result of these}} problems, in June 2015, aged 27, he announced his retirement from professional cricket. In 2017, he became a professional golfer.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{present at}} King William's {{death in a}} hunting accident, Warelwast served as a diplomat to the king's successor, Henry I. After the {{resolution}} of the Investiture Controversy, Warelwast was rewarded with the bishopric of Exeter in Devon, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to serve Henry as a diplomat and royal judge. He began {{the construction of a new}} cathedral at Exeter, and he probably divided the diocese into archdeaconries. Warelwast went blind after 1120, and after his death in 1137 was succeeded by his nephew, Robert Warelwast.|$|E
5|$|The tengu's {{unpleasant}} image {{continued to}} erode in the 17th century. Some stories now presented {{them as much}} less malicious, protecting and blessing Buddhist institutions rather than menacing them or setting them on fire. According to a legend in the 18th-century , a tengu {{took the form of}} a yamabushi and faithfully served the abbot of a Zen monastery until the man guessed his attendant's true form. The tengu's wings and huge nose then reappeared. The tengu requested a piece of wisdom from his master and left, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued,</b> unseen, to provide the monastery with miraculous aid.|$|E

5|$|When the notables of Jerusalem {{learned that}} Muhammad Ali {{was set to}} arrive in Palestine with reinforcements, they offered to mediate a truce between the Egyptians and the rebel leaders through the mufti Tahir Effendi al-Husayni, who had since been released. The leader of the rebels in the Hebron Hills, Isa al-Amr, {{informed}} al-Husayni of three conditions for a truce to be reached: the pardoning of all rebels, the cancellation of conscription orders {{in return for the}} payment of 1,000 qirsh per male, and the abolition of the new taxation category. The terms were rejected by Ibrahim Pasha, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> negotiations with al-Husayni through Husayn Abd al-Hadi, the governor of Sidon.|$|E
5|$|With {{this growth}} in commerce, Tudor's initial {{monopoly}} on the trade broke down, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to make significant profits from the growing trade. Increased supplies of ice were also needed {{to keep up with}} demand. From 1842 onwards, Tudor and others invested at Walden Pond in New England for additional supplies. New companies began to spring up, such as the Philadelphia Ice Company, which made use of the new railroad lines to transport harvested ice, while the Kershow family introduced improved ice harvesting to the New York region.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to write. To the public, Waugh displayed a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E
50|$|At present, he has {{retired from}} the public activity, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> to write {{articles}} and books in several fields, including music (he {{is known as a}} sophisticated melomaniac), or ecology.|$|R

5|$|During {{his junior}} year (195859), West scored 26.6points per game and grabbed 12.3rebounds per game. He tied the NCAA five-game tournament record of 160points (32.0points per game) and led all scorers and rebounders in every West Virginia game, {{including}} getting 28points and 11rebounds in a 7170 loss to California in the final. West was named Most Outstanding Player of that year's Final Four. Further awards were All-American, Southern Conference Tournament MVP and Southern Conference Player of the Year and Athlete of the Year. He was also named {{to be a member}} of the U.S. Pan American Games basketball team that won the gold medal. West demonstrated his tenacity for the game in a match against the Kentucky Wildcats. He broke his nose during an incident in the game, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to play despite intense pain and having to breathe through his mouth. He scored 19 points in the second-half, leading WVU to an upset victory.|$|E
5|$|George IV {{spent most}} of his later reign in {{seclusion}} at Windsor Castle, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to intervene in politics. At first it was believed that he would support Catholic emancipation, as he had proposed a Catholic Emancipation Bill for Ireland in 1797, but his anti-Catholic views became clear in 1813 when he privately canvassed against the ultimately defeated Catholic Relief Bill of 1813. By 1824 he was denouncing Catholic emancipation in public. Having taken the coronation oath on his accession, George now argued that he had sworn to uphold the Protestant faith, and could not support any pro-Catholic measures. The influence of the Crown was so great, and the will of the Tories under Prime Minister Lord Liverpool so strong, that Catholic emancipation seemed hopeless. In 1827, however, Lord Liverpool retired, to be replaced by the pro-emancipation Tory George Canning. When Canning entered office, the King, hitherto content with privately instructing his ministers on the Catholic Question, thought it fit to make a public declaration to the effect that his sentiments on the question were those of his revered father, George III.|$|E
5|$|Holmes was {{released}} by Luton in July 2003 after the offer of a new contract was withdrawn because of financial difficulties at the club, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to train with the team and eventually signed a contract in November. His first appearance of the season came after starting in Luton's 0–0 draw at Holmes' former club Sheffield Wednesday, before scoring his first goal on 10 January 2004 with a header in a 2–2 draw with Rushden & Diamonds. Holmes was the oldest central midfielder in the team after starting in the FA Cup match against Tranmere Rovers, due to other players being injured, during which he gave away the possession for Micky Mellon to score the winner for Tranmere in the 81st-minute. He finished 2003–04 with 20 appearances and scored three goals. Luton won promotion to the Championship in 2004–05 after winning the League One title, while Holmes made 20 appearances and scored three goals. Following this achievement, he signed a new one-year contract with the club in June 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, the Disneys {{moved to}} Kansas City, Missouri. There, Disney {{attended}} the Benton Grammar School, {{where he met}} fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came {{from a family of}} theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home. Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times. Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the Times before school and repeated the round for the evening Star after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> his paper route for more than six years. He attended Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute and also took a correspondence course in cartooning.|$|E
5|$|Kono {{described}} Clock Tower as {{an experimental}} project {{with a small}} budget and staff. His peers believed that a game where the protagonist runs away from the enemy would not work, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> on despite these concerns. Due to lack of staffing resources, developer Human Entertainment could not include mouse support and also needed to shrink the map down significantly. Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the mansion is designed within a 3D space. The character graphics in Clock Tower were created by digitizing photographs of real people, a popular technique of the time. The actress for Jennifer was a woman in Human's planning division. Many of the motions in the game came from her acting, such as hanging from a roof and stumbling in the hallway.|$|E
5|$|Many more {{hotels and}} {{restaurants}} were constructed in the remaining years of Boeckling's tenure, including Hotel Cedars, White House Hotel, Crystal Rock Castle, and Crystal Gardens Ballroom. The Cyclone, a rickety and rough coaster, was built in 1926. Cedar Point continued to update its ride attractions, replacing the Racer, the Circle Swing, and many other rides {{to make way for}} a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride, a Tilt-A-Whirl, and fun houses such as Noah's Ark and Bluebeard's Palace. Boeckling's health began to deteriorate in the late 1920s. In 1931, Boeckling became confined to a wheelchair, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> to oversee park operations, and was pushed around Cedar Point by an employee or relative. His condition worsened, however, and he eventually had to remain indoors. Boeckling died on July 24, 1931 from uremia. His portrait in the lobby of Breakers Hotel was draped in black. Flags in the resort and on the G.A. Boeckling steamboat were lowered to half mast.|$|E
