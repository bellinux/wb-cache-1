5|$|In 1946, Szilard {{secured a}} {{research}} professorship at the University of Chicago {{that allowed him}} to dabble in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in the quest for a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a <b>bioreactor,</b> and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955.|$|E

5|$|In many {{bacterial}} communities, {{natural or}} engineered (such as bioreactors), {{there is significant}} division of labor in metabolism (Syntrophy), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others. In one such system, the methanogenic <b>bioreactor,</b> functional stability requires the presence of several syntrophic species (Syntrophobacterales and Synergistia) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste (methane). Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with microarrays or proteomics researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with metabolomics and proteomics) in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.|$|E

By studying the literature it showed that the usage of membrane <b>bioreactors</b> for municipal wastewater treatment plants still has some drawbacks. Particularly the operating costs are higher than by conventional biological wastewater treatment plants, which is result of membrane exchange. Since the membrane <b>bioreactors</b> are not commonly used at this type of treatment plants the costs of installing the system are therefore also higher.

A-stage processes are proposed {{as the first step}} in an energy producing municipal wastewater treatment process. Pyrosequencing analysis indicated that bacterial community structure of all influents was similar. Also the bacterial community of all CAS <b>bioreactors</b> was similar. Bacterial community structure of A-stage <b>bioreactors</b> showed a more case-specific pattern. A core of genera was consistently found for all influents, all CAS <b>bioreactors</b> and all A-stage <b>bioreactors,</b> respectively, showing that different geographical locations in The Netherlands and Spain did not affect the functional bacterial communities in these technologies. The ecological roles of these bacteria were discussed. Influents and A-stage <b>bioreactors</b> shared several core general, while none of these were shared with CAS <b>bioreactors</b> communities. This difference is thought to reside in the different operational conditions of the two technologies.

Two packed-bed <b>bioreactors</b> with 80 -cm 3 lava chips as biofilm carrier were inoculated with nine Hg(II) -resistant natural isolates of a- and g-proteobacte-ria. Chloralkali wastewater containing ionic mercury (3. 0 to 9. 7 mg/L Hg 2 +), amended with sucrose and yeast ex-tract, flowed through the <b>bioreactors</b> at 160 mL/h. During the 16 -month investigation the <b>bioreactors</b> showed no sign of depleted performance in terms of mercury-retaining capacity. After 16 months, both <b>bioreactors</b> still retained 96 % of the mercury load. The performance of the <b>bioreactors</b> was sensitive to mechanical perturba-tions (e. g., sheer forces of gas bubbles). Shifts to higher Hg 2 + inflow concentrations initially decreased the mer-cury retention efficacy slightly. However, the <b>bioreactors</b> could adapt to Hg 2 + concentrations of up to 7. 6 mg/L within several days. Old biofilms were less affected than the younger ones. The performance of the <b>bioreactors</b> was not affected by an increase in temperature up to 41 °C and an increased volumetric load (up to 240 mL/h). The <b>bioreactors</b> regained activity spontaneously after the stress had stopped. Recovery could be accelerated by increased nutrient concentration, although this may lead to blocking of the packed bed. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons...|$|R
40|$|Journal articleDenitrification <b>bioreactors,</b> {{typically}} containing woodchips, are artificial sinks used to remediate nitrate (NO 3 -) {{losses on}} agricultural landscapes. Analysis of these <b>bioreactors</b> frequently considers their efficacy {{in terms of}} only a single contaminant (for example, NO 3 -), but does not consider other losses ammonium (NH 4 +), phosphorus (PO 43 -), methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). In this study, laboratory-scale denitrifying <b>bioreactors</b> operated at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) ranging from 4 to 22 d, containing either lodgepole pine woodchips (LPW), lodgepole pine needles (LPN), barley straw (BBS) or cardboard, were investigated to elucidate operational optima considering three scenarios using: (1) only NO 3 - net fluxes (2) NO 3 -, NH 4 + and PO 43 - combined fluxes (3) all fluxes (water and gaseous) combined. At {{the end of the}} experiment, after up to 745 days of operation, the <b>bioreactors</b> were destructively sampled for microbial analysis. In Scenario 1, there was a net removal in the <b>bioreactors,</b> which generally performed best at shorter HRTs. In Scenario 2, there was a net release of contaminants from all <b>bioreactors,</b> which substantially increased in Scenario 3. Total greenhouse gas emissions were highest for the cardboard <b>bioreactors</b> (296 g CO 2 -eq m- 2 d- 1) at the longest HRT, and were dominated by CH 4 emissions.

Woodchip and corn cob filled <b>bioreactors</b> {{have been shown}} repeatedly to be effective at reducing nitrate pollution from agricultural fields by supporting denitrifying bacteria. Little attention has been paid, however, to other microorganisms that may also proliferate in these environments. Of particular concern are sulfate reducing bacteria and other organisms known to convert mercury to highly toxic methylmercury, since supporting such organisms could lead to increased levels of methylmercury in downstream rivers and lakes. To investigate this concern, we conducted two studies. We measured total and methylmercury concentrations and related parameters in upflow column <b>bioreactors</b> filled with either woodchips or corn cobs. The temperature of the water pumped into the column <b>bioreactors</b> was {{in the range of}} 1. 8 �C to 18. 6 �C to simulate cooler autumn and winter weather. There was no significant mercury methylation detected at these temperatures. The concentration of methylmercury flowing out of the column <b>bioreactors</b> filled with corn cobs showed greater variability than that of woodchip filled <b>bioreactors.</b> The second study was set up to pump water with low concentrations of nitrate into four edge-of-field woodchip <b>bioreactors</b> to produce a residence time of 24 hours or more. We measured total and methylmercury concentrations along with other indicators of water chemistry and biological activity. While the conditions monitored in the <b>bioreactors</b> were consistent with documented conditions that support mercury methylating bacteria, we did not find evidence of methylmercury being generated within the <b>bioreactors.</b> These studies indicate that the production of methylmercury is not likely in Minnesota edge-of-field woodchip <b>bioreactors</b> or in woodchip or corn cob <b>bioreactors</b> where water temperatures are below 18. 6 �C and nitrates are not completely reduced...|$|R
