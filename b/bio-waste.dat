Techno-economics of {{integrating}} bioethanol production from {{spent sulfite liquor}} for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from sulfite pulping mills. Biotechnology for Biofuels, 7 (1) : 169, doi: 10. 1186 /s 13068 - 014 - 0169 - 8. The original publication is available at [URL] Flow sheet options for integrating ethanol production from spent sulfite liquor (SSL) into the acid-based sulfite pulping process at the Sappi Saiccor mill (Umkomaas, South Africa) were investigated, including options for generation of thermal and electrical energy from onsite <b>bio-wastes,</b> such as bark. Processes were simulated with Aspen Plus&# 174; for mass- and energy-balances, followed by an estimation of the economic viability and environmental impacts. Various concentration levels of the total dissolved solids in magnesium oxide-based SSL, which currently fuels a recovery boiler, prior to fermentation was considered, together with return of the fermentation residues (distillation bottoms) to the recovery boiler after ethanol separation. The generation of renewable thermal and electrical energy from onsite <b>bio-wastes</b> were {{also included in the}} energy balance of the combined pulping-ethanol process, in order to partially replace coal consumption. The bio-energy supplementations included the combustion of bark for heat and electricity generation and the bio-digestion of the calcium oxide SSL to produce methane as additional energy source. Results Ethanol production from SSL at the highest substrate concentration was the most economically feasible when coal was used for process energy. However this solution did not provide any savings in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the concentration-fermentation-distillation process. Maximizing the use of renewable energy sources to partially replace coal consumption yielded a satisfactory economic performance, with a minimum ethanol selling price of 0. 83 US$/l, and a drastic reduction in the overall greenhouse gas emissions for the entire facility. Conclusion High substrate concentrations and conventional distillation should be used when considering integrating ethanol production at sulfite pulping mills. <b>Bio-wastes</b> generated onsite should be utilized at their maximum potential for energy generation in order to maximize the GHG emissions reduction.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Solid <b>bio-wastes</b> (or organic residues) are {{worldwide}} {{produced in}} high amount and increasingly considered bioenergy containers rather than waste products. A complete bioprocess from recalcitrant solid wastes to methane (SW 2 M) via anaerobic digestion (AD) {{is believed to}} be a sustainable way to utilize solid <b>bio-wastes.</b> However, the complex and recalcitrance of these organic solids make the hydrolysis process inefficient and thus a rate-limiting step to many AD technologies. Effort has been made to enhance the hydrolysis efficiency, but a comprehensive assessment over a complete flow scheme of SW 2 M is rare. RESULTS: In this study, it comes to reality of a complete scheme for SW 2 M. A novel process to efficiently convert organic residues into methane is proposed, which proved to be more favorable compared to conventional methods. Brewers spent grain (BSG) and pig manure (PM) were used to test the feasibility and efficiency. BSG and PM were enzymatically pre-hydrolyzed and solubilized, after which the hydrolysates were anaerobically digested using different bioreactor designs, including expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB), continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), and sequencing batch reactor (SBR). High organic loading rates (OLRs), reaching 19 and 21 kgCOD[*]·[*]m(- 3) [*]·[*]day(- 1) were achieved for the EGSBs, fed with BSG and PM, respectively, which were five to seven times higher than those obtained with direct digestion of the raw materials via CSTR or SBR.

CONCLUSIONS: This study proves that complex organic solids, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, proteins, and lipids can be efficiently hydrolyzed, yielding easy biodegradable/bio-convertible influents for the subsequent anaerobic digestion step.

40|$|Abstract: Concerns about {{greenhouse}} gas emissions have increased research efforts into alternatives in bio-based processes. With regard to transport fuel, bioethanol and biodiesel are still the main biofuels used. It is expected that future production of these biofuels {{will be based on}} processes using either non-food competing biomasses, or characterised by low CO 2 emissions. Many microorganisms, such as microalgae, yeast, bacteria and fungi, have the ability to accumulate oils under special culture conditions. Microbial oils might become one of the potential feed-stocks for biodiesel production in the near future. The use of these oils is currently under extensive research in order to reduce production costs associated with the fermentation process, which is a crucial factor to increase economic feasibility. An important way to reduce processing costs is the use of wastes as carbon sources. The aim of the present review is to describe the main aspects related to the use of different oleaginous microorganisms for lipid production and their performance when using <b>bio-wastes.</b> The possibilities for combining hydrogen (H 2) and lipid production are also explored in an attempt for improving the economic feasibility of the process...|$|R

However, bio-oils {{need to be}} upgraded by decreasing {{the large amount of}} oxygenated and acidic compounds to enhance the heating value and stability. With the expanded production of bio-oils, the related by-products, most of which are realized as <b>bio-wastes,</b> are largely produced from bio-refinery. In fact, a portion of the by-products can be transferred to valuable chemicals by further processes. Thus, the utilization of by-products from bio-refinery process also attracts great attention due to the huge potential market of value-added chemicals. To further study and understand the above-mentioned challenges, two main investigations were carried out in this thesis. The first investigation focuses on the removal of acidic compounds from bio-oils. Acetic acid was selected as a main model compound for the research. Bimolecular deoxygenation of acetic acid was studied on Ca/Zn/AlOx and Ca(Na) /AlOx mixed oxides. Effect of reaction conditions, influence of other model compounds, optimum atomic ratios and stability and reusability of catalysts were studied. Finally, Ca/Zn/AlOx and Ca(Na) /AlOx mixed oxides exhibited very high activity for the deoxygenation of acetic acid. Highly stable performance was observed on Ca(Na) /AlOx which showed 100...|$|R
40|$|Physic nut residue {{is one of}} <b>bio-wastes</b> which {{contains}} enough carbon can be processed further into other products with higher usage and economical value. One of the products is activated carbon which used commonly in chemical industry. Information regarding the kinetics describing mechanism and characteristic of adsorption using physic nut residue-based activated carbon can be obtained through modeling. Model used in this research are Pore-Surface Diffusion Model (PSDM) and Film-Pore Diffusion Model (FPDM) derived based on shrinking core model. This research begins with estimating the value of kf, Ds, and Dp parameters which later will be validated and simulated using various correlations and the model. Variations are done towards three variables: initial aqueous phase concentration (C 0), pH value, and adsorbent types. The result shows PSDM is more accurate in representing the mass transfer characteristics of methylene blue adsorption using activated carbon synthesized from physic nut residue because the model prediction fit the experimental data better than the FPDM. The value of Ds ranged from 3, 99 E- 14 to 7, 66 E- 14 while the value of Dp ranged from 9, 98 E- 13 to 2, 82 E- 12. It is also found that value of Ds and Dp are affected by variables mentioned before...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 Conventionally used {{processes}} for removing heavy metals from wastewater are usually either expensive, such as ion exchange, or inefficient, such as precipitation. An innovative technique {{that is both}} efficient and economical is biosorption, in which living and dead biomass can act as biosorbents through physical-chemical processes like ion exchange and micro-precipitation. Pectin, a structural polysaccharide present in plant cell walls, is similar to alginate, a molecule that is often responsible for the high metal uptake by algae. Based on the structural similarity between alginate and pectin, {{it was expected that}} pectin rich <b>bio-wastes</b> may be as good a biosorbent material as brown algae. A comparison between different pectin-rich materials showed high stability and metal binding capacity of citrus peels. Sorption isotherms for citrus peels showed higher metal uptake capacity at pH 5 compared to pH 3. Kinetic studies revealed the time required to reach equilibrium for lemon fruit waste (0. 177 mm) was 20 min while for larger particles the time increased to 30 min- 60 min. For lemon fruit waste, the content and pKa values of acidic groups were determined by using a pKa spectrum technique. Isotherm modeling was carried out by using Langmuir isotherms and pH sensitive modeling...|$|R
