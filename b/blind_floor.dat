40|$|For a {{long time}} plant {{material}} like threshing remains was used systematically as filling and isolation material in buildings. Such plant material {{can be found at}} several places, for example in blind floors[1] (Fehlböden) or in beamholes. For the first time in Switzerland desiccated plant material like this has been investigated. In this article the analysis of the material from three different sites, each dated to a different period, from the late medieval period to the time just before the industrial revolution, are presented. The samples consisted of chaff from Triticum spelta in bulk, and smaller amounts of other cereals like Triticum monococcum, Avena sativa, Panicum miliaceum and Secale cereale, plus various weeds. The assemblages in the late medieval samples show evidence of three-field rotation: the high percentage of grassland species is interpreted as an indicator for the fallow land phase within the three-field system. A higher ratio of annual to perennial plants in the more modern samples indicates the development of more intensive tillage and cultivation. Methodological questions regarding sampling strategies of the <b>blind</b> <b>floor</b> subsamples are investigated. The analyses suggest that the volume of these subsamples should be more than 2 litres...|$|E
60|$|The {{intelligence}} spread rapidly {{from house}} to house. It was quite clear that the eventful morning had at length arrived; the whole row stationed themselves behind their first and second <b>floor</b> <b>blinds,</b> and waited the result in breathless expectation.|$|R
60|$|This was enough. Laidlaw {{threw his}} heavy bulk against the door, burst lock and hinge, {{and sent it}} flat on the garret <b>floor.</b> <b>Blinding</b> smoke met and almost choked him as he fell, and Sam, {{tumbling}} over him, caught up the first person his hands touched and bore her out. It was old Liz--half dressed, and wrapped in a blanket! Susy, also half dressed, and with a shawl wrapped round her shoulders, {{was carried out by}} Laidlaw. Both were unhurt, though half stifled by smoke, and greatly alarmed.|$|R
50|$|Four {{stone steps}} {{lead up to}} the double front door in the central bay of the pavilion. Abovethe door, a {{balustrade}} is suggested by half-round, vase-shaped balusters applied to thespandrel under the tall, double round-arched window. First- and second-floor windows inthe flanking bays of the pavilion are blind. Windows in the wings are double casements,four panes high at the first floor, three at the second; two are <b>blind</b> at each <b>floor.</b> Thepavilion pilasters support a plain architrave and pulvinated frieze. The pediment above iswithout embellishment in its tympanum, and is wider than the cross gable behind it. Theentablature continues under the eaves of the cross-gable roof.|$|R
50|$|The folly, and {{the later}} house, were {{built on a}} mound. The folly has a square three-bay plan. The two outer bays are formed by large {{circular}} two story corner towers. On the south side, the two towers have pointed windows (some blind), while {{on the first floor}} they have quatrefoil windows and relief mouldings above in form of Maltese crosses. The central bay has a blocked pointed doorway with hood mouldand returns. The floor above the doorway has a <b>blind</b> pointed first <b>floor</b> window. The roof is of slate behind embattled parapets. The wall connecting the folly to the house faces south-west and has an embattled parapet above a moulded cornice.|$|R
60|$|Yea, verily, Amen and Amen! For {{this short}} heroic {{paragraph}} contains the sum and substance, the heighth {{and the depth}} of all true philosophy. Most assuredly right difficult it is for us, while we are yet in the narrow chamber of death, with our faces to the dusky falsifying looking-glass that covers the scant end-side of the <b>blind</b> passage from <b>floor</b> to ceiling,--right difficult for us, so wedged between its walls that we cannot turn round, nor have other escape possible but by walking backward, to understand that all we behold or have any memory of having ever beholden, yea, our very selves as seen by us, are but shadows, and when the forms that we loved vanish, impossible not to feel as if they were real.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} {{house with}} its lean modernist lines and industrial materials, is open plan with the spaces signified by furniture arrangement. It is spare, spacious and functional, yet comfortable. The concrete interior staircase is {{lit by a}} sunken uplight. Décor includes signature wall papers, innovations such as mechanised <b>blinds</b> over the <b>floor</b> to ceiling windows, convertible work desks, multipurpose cabinets (some with interior lighting), concealed storage and bedroom ensuites. There were originally five bedrooms, later four, and the colour scheme is neutral ranging from cream or white, shades of brown to chocolate and black with some sky blue accessories. In contrast, there is one lavish bespoke glass chandelier on the landing. The Homewood served as Gwynne's living portfolio to clients and students, exhibiting his designs from architecture to furniture, finishes and fittings, as well as attention to detail and complete design control.|$|R
50|$|Unknown to Palicrovol, Asineth has conceived, {{and bears}} the child for a ten-month term - noted with consternation {{by a local}} priestess of the Sister. Sleeve, who being a man knows nothing about the customs of the Sisters, begins to {{research}} this phenomenon; unbeknowest to him, Asineth is duplicating his reading and, being a woman, understands {{a great deal more}} of it. She employs the most terrible sacrifice possible: her own daughter. Made immensely powerful by this hateful decision, she overthrows the gods and the city of Hart's Hope, setting Palicrovol in place as a humiliated (and continually tormented) puppet ruler. She steals the Flower Princess's face and body and keeps Sleeve, Zymas and the Flower Princess as her personal pets in altered forms, along with her collection of enslaved gods - the Hart a pile of bones beneath the castle, the god named God a <b>blind</b> slave scrubbing <b>floors,</b> and the Sweet Sisters sundered and sold out as whores. She renames herself Queen Beauty and rules with omnipotent power from the capital city, while all her toys - Palicrovol, Sleeve, Zymas and the Princess - are kept immortal for three hundred years.|$|R
50|$|Rihard Škarka {{commissioned}} the architect Dragiša Brašovan to erect {{his house in}} Deligradska Street. Until then, Brašovan had already completed his independent work on {{the building of the}} former Eskontna banka in Nušićeva Street. The combined baroque-classicist eclectic style of this work had given Brašovan a level of fame in Belgrade. Škarka’s Villa was built during 1926-1927 as a city villa. Academic principles, romantic spirit, historic motifs, tinges of modern ideas and art deco surface treatment are recognized {{in the design of the}} main street facade of the building. The facade is made in one plane, and the decorative elements which are taken from the historical styles - Romanic, Venetian Gothic and Baroque - contribute to its vividness. Strict academic division of the facade was abandoned, and the architect approached its layered processing in a creative way. The flat surface of the floor is in contrast to the rustic treatment of the lower part with gable motifs, diamond cubes very close to Czech Cubism, and windows completed with <b>blind</b> arcades. The <b>floor</b> is dominated by romantic trifora filled with floral, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic motifs, placed between modernist treated window openings without special emphasis. The façade ends with a decorative pronged roof attic. The motif of the pointed arch and Baroque volutas is repeated on the monumental entrance gate, whose doors are resolved in the form of a very decoratively treated metal grille.|$|R
40|$|The Childhood Asthma Prevention Study is a {{randomized}} controlled trial to measure whether {{the incidence of}} atopy and asthma can be reduced by house dust mite allergen reduction, a diet supplemented with omega- 3 fatty acids, {{or a combination of}} both interventions. Six hundred and sixteen pregnant women whose unborn children were at high risk of developing asthma because of a family history were randomized prenatally. Study groups are as follows: Group A (placebo diet intervention, no house dust mite reduction), Group B (placebo diet intervention, active house dust mite reduction), Group C (active diet intervention, no house dust mite reduction), and Group D (active diet intervention, active house dust mite reduction). The house dust mite reduction intervention comprises use of physical and chemical methods to reduce allergen contact. The dietary intervention comprises use of a daily oil supplement from 6 months or at onset of bottle-feeding, and use of margarine and cooking oils based on sunflower or canola oils to increase omega- 3 dietary intake. Data is collected quarterly until the infant is 1 year old and then half yearly until age 5 years. Questionnaires are used to collect respiratory illness history and information about diet and home environment. Dust is collected from the child 2 ̆ 7 s bed and bedroom and playroom <b>floors.</b> <b>Blinded</b> assessments are conducted at 18 months, 3 years, and 5 years. Skin prick tests to common allergens, blood tests, and detailed illness, medication use, and vaccination histories are collected. Primary outcomes will be the development of allergic sensitization and the presence and severity of asthma. This study is designed to measure the effectiveness of allergen reduction and dietary supplementation, both separately and in combination, for the primary prevention of atopy and asthma. The results of this study may have important implications for public health policies to reduce the incidence of childhood asthma...|$|R
