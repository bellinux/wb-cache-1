5|$|The {{ability of}} {{bacteria}} to degrade {{a variety of}} organic compounds is remarkable and {{has been used in}} waste processing and bioremediation. Bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills. Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. <b>Bacteria</b> <b>are</b> also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes. In the chemical industry, <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals.|$|E

40|$|Oligotrophic <b>bacteria</b> (oligotrophs) <b>are</b> {{microorganisms}} {{that grow}} in extremely nutritionally deficient {{conditions in which}} the concentrations of organic substances are low. Many oligotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>were</b> isolated from clinical materials including urine, sputum, swabbings of the throat, vaginal discharges, and others. Seventy-seven strains of oligotrophic bacteria from 871 samples of clinical material were isolated. A relatively higher frequency of isolation of oligotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>was</b> shown in drainage, sputum, and throat specimens. Eleven strains of the obligate oligotrophic bacteria recovered showed scant growth on enriched medium, blood agar, and nutrient agar.

5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> genetically modified {{to make them more}} useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount of}} energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} and excreted by acetic acid bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. Acetic acid {{is also a}} component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{can also}} be used in the place of {{pesticides}} in the biological pest control. This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators and most other beneficial insects.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria like archaea are prokaryotic â€“ unicelluar, {{and having}} no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle. <b>Bacteria</b> <b>are</b> microscopic, {{with a few}} {{extremely}} rare exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis. Bacteria function and reproduce as individual cells, but they can often aggregate in multicellular colonies. Some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex swarming structures, operating as multicellular groups {{as part of their}} life cycle, or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as E.coli.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E

Magnetite can reduce the toxic form of chromium, chromium VI, to the less toxic chromium (III).|$|R
5|$|Motile <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> {{attracted}} or {{repelled by}} certain stimuli in behaviours called taxes: these include chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis. In one peculiar group, the myxobacteria, individual bacteria move {{together to form}} waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores. The myxobacteria move only when on solid surfaces, unlike E. coli, which is motile in liquid or solid media.|$|E

5|$|The {{bacteria}} that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the bladder via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or lymph. It {{is believed that}} the <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy. After gaining entry to the bladder, E. Coli are able to attach to the bladder wall and form a biofilm that resists the body's immune response.|$|E
40|$|The {{adhesion}} of Corynebacterium renale 115 to bovine bladder {{epithelial cells}} was studied with two clones of the bacteria, piliated (P+) and nonpiliated (P-).

5|$|The {{largest number}} {{exist in the}} gut flora, {{and a large number}} on the skin. The vast {{majority}} of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, though many are beneficial particularly in the gut flora. However several species of <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.|$|E
5|$|These {{processes}} {{are also important}} in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> {{largely responsible for the}} production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} {{of shapes and}} sizes, called morphologies. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5â€“5.0micrometres in length. However, a few species are visible to the unaided eyeâ€”for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> members of the genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3micrometres, as small as the largest viruses. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.|$|E

50|$|Investigations into reproductive-associated microbiomes began around 1885 by Theodor Escherich. He {{wrote that}} {{meconium}} from the newborn <b>was</b> free of <b>bacteria.</b> This <b>was</b> {{interpreted as the}} uterine environment was sterile. Other investigations used sterile diapers for meconium collection. No <b>bacteria</b> <b>were</b> able to be cultured from the samples. <b>Bacteria</b> <b>were</b> detected and were directly proportional to the time between birth and the passage of meconium.|$|R
5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in bacteria {{is either}} heterotrophic, where organic carbon compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, <b>bacteria</b> <b>are</b> surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular <b>bacteria,</b> <b>are</b> found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E
