50|$|In common usage, a <b>butter</b> knife may {{refer to}} any non-serrated table knife {{designed}} {{with a dull}} edge and rounded point; formal cutlery patterns {{make a distinction between}} such a place knife (or table knife) and a <b>butter</b> knife. In this usage, a <b>butter</b> knife (or master <b>butter</b> knife) is a sharp-pointed, dull-edged knife, often with a sabre shape, used only to serve out pats of <b>butter</b> from a central <b>butter</b> dish to individual diners' plates. Master <b>butter</b> knives are not used to spread the <b>butter</b> onto bread: this would contaminate the <b>butter</b> remaining in the <b>butter</b> dish when the next pat of <b>butter</b> was served. Rather, diners at the breakfast, the luncheon, and the informal dinner table use an individual <b>butter</b> knife to apply <b>butter</b> to their bread. Individual <b>butter</b> knives have a round point, so as not to tear the bread, and are sometimes termed <b>butter</b> spreaders. If no <b>butter</b> spreaders are provided, a dinner knife may be used as an alternative.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>butter</b> dish {{is defined}} as [...] "a usually round or {{rectangular}} dish often with a drainer and a cover for holding <b>butter</b> at table". Before refrigerators existed, a covered dish made of crystal, silver, or china housed the <b>butter.</b> The first <b>butter</b> dish was made by Simpson, Hall, Miller, and Co. around 1880 in Connecticut, out of silver. These <b>butter</b> dishes were made to hold the traditional round shape of <b>butter</b> {{at the time and}} came with an [...] "ice chamber" [...] to keep the <b>butter</b> cold. Another type of <b>butter</b> dish, a French <b>butter</b> dish, keeps <b>butter</b> fresh by using water to keep the <b>butter</b> away from the air, thereby keeping it fresh. The water is placed into the base of the dish and the <b>butter</b> is put into a bell-shaped lid, creating an air seal.|$|R
