5000|$|The fourth, {{and most}} {{controversial}} segue is the Neue Deutsche Härte style [...] "Die Eier von Satan".

Its [...] time signature (3 quarter notes + 1 dotted quarter note) is expressed in alternating measures of [...] and [...] or combined [...] The lyrical component of the song is spoken in German by Marko Fox, bass player for ZAUM and SexTapes. He is backed by a sound that resembles a hydraulic press, and crowd cheering and applause that increase in volume as the lyrics are read with increasing ferocity. These combined effects make the song sound like a militant German rant or Nazi rally. While the shocking, aggressive tone and [...] "von Satan" [...] in the title may suggest {{having to do with}} the Church of Satan the speaker is merely reciting an innocuous cookie recipe.

The song was originally translated by Gudrun Fox. According to Blair McKenzie Blake, the maintainer of the official Tool website, [...] "Die Eier von Satan" [...] originally were cookies that [...] "Marko Fox's grandmother used to <b>bake</b> <b>for</b> him as a child, without using eggs as an ingredient. The substitution for eggs is a magical incantation from the worm-eaten pages of some moldering grimoire." [...] This magical incantation ("sim salabim bamba sala do saladim") is taken from the German children's song [...] "Auf einem Baum ein Kuckuck" [...] and popularized by Harry August Jansen. According to the lyrics, the special ingredient besides this [...] "incantation" [...] is actually [...] "a knife-tip of Turkish hashish". The title is a play on deviled eggs, translating to [...] "The Eggs of Satan" [...] in English or [...] "The Balls of Satan", due to a German double entendre of [...] "Eier", which can either mean [...] "eggs" [...] or serve as slang for testicles. While there may not be eggs, [...] "balls" [...] do appear in the form of [...] "ground nuts" [...] (150 grams) while the dough itself is rolled into tiny balls before baking. So far the only time it has been performed live in its entirety was on December 19, 1996 at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles.
