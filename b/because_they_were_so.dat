5|$|The {{walk back}} to Bear Valley was very slow; at one point, Reed sent ahead {{two of the men}} to {{retrieve}} the first cache of food, expecting the third relief to come at any moment, a small party led by Selim E. Woodworth. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner's feet were badly burned <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to get up and move, not having eaten for days. The relief party {{had no choice but to}} leave without them.|$|E
5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost {{as they made their way}} westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, the NK 6th Division {{intensified}} {{its efforts}} to attack Battle Mountain, and began sending stronger attacks to capture the two peaks. In the face of these, all of C Company except the company commander and about 25 men abandoned their position on Battle Mountain. Upon reaching {{the bottom of the}} mountain those who had fled reported erroneously that the company commander had been killed and their position surrounded, then overrun by the North Koreans. On the basis of this misinformation, American artillery and mortars fired concentrations on C Company's former position, and fighter-bombers, in 38 sorties, attacked the crest of Battle Mountain, using napalm, fragmentation bombs, rockets, and machine guns. This action forced the company commander and his remaining 25 men off Battle Mountain after they had held it for 20 hours, having declined a call to surrender from the North Koreans. A platoon of E Company, except for about 10 men, also left its position on the mountain as soon as the attack progressed. On the regimental left, an ROK patrol from K Company's position on Sobuk-san captured the commanding officer of the NK 15th Regiment, but he was killed a few minutes later while trying to escape. The patrol removed several intelligence documents from his body. During the day of fighting on Battle Mountain and P'il-bong, the North Koreans drove off the ROK police from the 24th Infantry's left flank on Sobuk-san. 24th Infantry troops continued to straggle from their positions, ignoring commands from officers to stay in place. Both African American and white officers, infuriated by the disobedience, wrote sworn statements implicating the deserters. The situation was so severe that those who stayed in their positions were often given Bronze Star Medals with Valor Devices <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> far outnumbered in the fighting.|$|E

25|$|The Road Warriors’ {{high impact}} power style and unique attire quickly got them noticed by fans and dreaded by opponents, {{so much so}} that some wrestlers would grab their bag and leave the arena when they saw they were {{scheduled}} to face the Road Warriors. In Georgia, the team quickly rose to the top despite being very young and without the traditional “paying dues” period just <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> believable in their role as power monsters. They gained a reputation for being very stiff and not selling simply because they could and as a result most of their matches ended quickly. They won the NWA National Tag Team Championship upon their debut, a title they would win three more times while in Georgia.|$|E
25|$|The {{postural}} feeding hypothesis {{has been}} recently supported by Dr. Kevin Hunt, {{a professor at}} Indiana University. This hypothesis asserts that chimpanzees were only bipedal when they eat. While on the ground, they would reach up for fruit hanging from small trees and while in trees, bipedalism was used to reach up to grab for an overhead branch. These bipedal movements may have evolved into regular habits <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> convenient in obtaining food. Also, Hunt's hypotheses states that these movements coevolved with chimpanzee arm-hanging, as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food. When analyzing fossil anatomy, Australopithecus afarensis has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee, which indicates hanging arms. Also, the Australopithecus hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism, but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to humans. For this reason, Hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture.|$|E
25|$|During the screening, {{people began}} walking out; Goodman thought {{the film was}} bombing, until {{he learned that the}} viewers were {{actually}} leaving <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> frightened. He then realized a remake was unwise. Paramount Pictures, which acquired DreamWorks in 2005, bought the domestic rights to the film, and worldwide rights to any sequels, for USD$350,000. When the film was taken in by Paramount, several changes were made. Some scenes were cut, others added, and the original ending was scrapped, with two new endings being shot. The ending shown in theaters during the film's worldwide release {{is the only one of}} the three to feature visual effects, and it differs from the endings previously seen at the Screamfest and Burbank screenings. The theatrical release was delayed indefinitely because Paramount had put all DreamWorks productions on hold. Meanwhile, a screening for international buyers resulted in the sale of international rights in 52 countries. Only after Goodman became production chief at Paramount in June 2009 did the film finally get slated for a fall release.|$|E

500|$|When {{it became}} known that the Denver Mint had struck only 2,630,030nickels in 1950, the coins (catalogued as 1950-D) began to be widely hoarded. [...] Speculation in them {{increased}} in the early 1960s, but prices decreased sharply in 1964. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> widely pulled from circulation, the 1950-D is readily available today. [...] A number of reverse dies with an S mint mark, intended for the San Francisco Mint, were created in 1955; they were not used as that mint struck no nickels that year and subsequently closed, and the unused dies were sent for use at Denver, where the S mint mark was overpunched with a D. [...] 1949 and 1954 are other years where one mintmark was punched over another.|$|E
500|$|To {{remove the}} sculptures of the Harpy Tomb the capstone, {{which may have}} weighed as much as twenty tons and was resting on the {{sculptured}} sides, had to be lifted off, causing {{the sides of the}} tomb to fall in. Fellows, who had left the sailors to carry out this task in their own way, remarked [...] "but the sculptured parts did not receive more injury than they probably would have done from a more scientific operation". [...] The sculptures of another monument at Xanthos, the Horse Tomb, were left in situ <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> large that they could only be handled if first sawn into pieces.

500|$|To the Household's {{surprise}} and concern, during Victoria's stay at Balmoral in September 1889, she and Karim stayed {{for one night}} at a remote house on the estate, Glassalt Shiel at Loch Muick. Victoria had often been there with Brown and after his death had sworn never to stay there again. In early 1890, Karim fell ill with an inflamed boil on his neck and Victoria instructed Reid, her physician, to attend to Karim. She wrote to Reid expressing her anxiety and explaining that she felt responsible {{for the welfare of}} her Indian servants <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> far from their own land.

500|$|When {{reflecting}} on the casting of James Pickens, Jr., Spotnitz called him [...] "another great find", adding that [...] "so {{many times over the}} course of the series we just got so lucky with the actors that we cast in these guest parts and just kept bringing them back <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> wonderful. That's what happened with William B. Davis as the Cigarette-Smoking Man and with Nick Lea as Krycek, and with Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner, and that's what happened here with James Pickens. Just a fantastic actor, not at all like this person, really transformed himself to play this part". Spotnitz thought that, for a viewer who had weekly been watching The X-Files sixth season, there was a great sense of gratification when—in the final moments of [...] "One Son"—Spender essentially withdraws and tells Kersh that Mulder has been right, all along, precisely because the last thing that Kersh wanted was for Spender to behave in this way.|$|E
500|$|Brighton and {{neighbouring}} Hove, on the English Channel coast {{between the}} South Downs and the sea, were built {{on top of}} a vast aquifer of chalk. [...] A regular supply of naturally pure water was always available from this natural reservoir, and in the settlements' early days many wells were sunk to exploit it. [...] The rapid growth of Brighton in the 18th and early 19th century, followed by similar expansion in Hove, put pressure on the local authorities to provide more sources and a better supply system, though: wells became increasingly contaminated by sewage from cesspits, and some had to be blocked <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> polluted, reducing the two towns' water supply further. [...] The first local water company—the Brighton, Hove and Preston Waterworks Company—was founded on 16 June 1834 by means of an Act of Parliament; it built a waterworks on the road to Lewes and provided piped water for two hours per day to a few wealthy customers.

500|$|Critics {{have since}} remarked that Bannon's books are {{remarkable}} for portraying homosexual relationships relatively accurately. The continuity of {{characters in the}} series also gave her books a unique quality, especially when most lesbian characters during this time were one-dimensional stereotypes who met punishment for their desires. Bannon's characters have been called [...] "accessibly human", and still engrossing by contemporary standards compared to being [...] "revolutionary" [...] when first released. LGBT historian Susan Stryker describes the relationships between Bannon's characters as mostly positive, satisfactory, and at times complex depictions of lesbian and gay relationships, which Bannon attributed to not {{letting go of the}} hope that she could [...] "salvage (her) own life." [...] One retrospective of lesbian pulp fiction remarked on the reasons why Bannon's books in particular were popular is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> different from anything else being published at the time: [...] "Bannon was implicitly challenging the prevailing belief that homosexual life was brief, episodic, and more often than not resulted in death... Bannon insisted on the continuity of lesbian love, while everything in her culture was speaking of its quick and ugly demise." ...|$|E
500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close.

We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but I must say that Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E
