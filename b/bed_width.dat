The main components of the project, as built, are, a) the Ithai barrage, across the Manipur river of 10.7 m height and 58.8 m length with three spillway bays, b) water conductor system for trans-basin diversion comprising an open channel of 2.323 km length, a cut and cover section of 1.077 km length (<b>bed</b> <b>width</b> 18 m, followed by a Head Race Tunnel of 3.81 m diameter (horseshoe type) and 6.62 km long to carry a discharge of [...] (...) for power generation and [...] for irrigation), c) a surge shaft, d) penstocks and e) a surface powerhouse and a tailrace channel on the right bank of the narrow Leimatak River with three units of 35 MW capacity each generating an annual energy of 448 GW·h (1.613 PJ). The downstream Loktak Power Project in cascade to utilize the regulated releases from the upper project for further power generation of 90 MW is proposed to be taken up for joint implementation by NHPC and the Government of Manipur.The project has invited severe criticism since the water level in the lake at the Ithai barrage is maintained throughout the year at FRL 786.5 m from considerations of power generation from the well planned water conductor system.

The systematic sampling technique was used to segment the gully which measured 220 m long at intervals of 20 m. Parameters measured include among others gully length, gully depth, gully shoulder and <b>bed</b> <b>widths,</b> slope gradient, cross sectional area, stream density, stream frequency and stream intensity. Cartesian coordinates, spot heights and core soil values were also determined. Digital Elevation Model was used to model gully form, direction of runoff and sediment delivery ratio in the gully system. The result showed that the volume of sediment loss from the gully system with a cross sectional area of 91. 7 m 2 is 931. 5 m 3 using the End Area method of soil loss determination. The amount or weight of sediment loss from the gully system is estimated to be 12, 575. 28 tonnes. The Digital Elevation Model of the gully system indicates a trapezoidal form and slopes with summital convexity. The convexity of the slope shape implies that runoff is generated from all sides of the slopes, influencing a considerate amount of sediment loss at the gully sides and floor. It is therefore recommended that planting of cover crops should be intensified to enhance infiltration and concreted surfaces should be minimised to reduce surface runoff and sediment loss along slopes...|$|R

An increase in the <b>bed</b> <b>width</b> generally increases land use efficiency due to a smaller cropped land loss due to furrows. However, PRB configuration and seasonal pre-sowing renovation need careful selection due to their influence on crop production. Two experiments investigating PRB systems used for wheat-maize rotations were conducted over a ten year period on a silty clay loam in Pakistan. The use of PRBs generally resulted in higher yield, lower water application and higher Gross Production Water Use Indices (IGP) compared to traditional flat basin systems. Wide (180 cm) beds produced higher wheat (15 %) and maize (26 %) yields than the flat basin treatment during the first experiment. Maize yields were 10 % higher than the basin treatment in the second experiment involving narrow (65 cm) and medium (130 cm) width beds while wheat yields were only marginally (< 5 %) higher.

This behavior contrasts with the behavior of noncohesive grains, such as dry sand, where avalanches consist of superficial layers of about ten grains. The reason behind this is that for our experimental powders (particle diameter ~ 10 mm) the van der Waals interparticle adhesive force exceeds several orders of magnitude particle weight.

In a previous work it has been demonstrated that a microstructured membrane-assisted {{fluidized bed}} can be successfully operated with state-of-the-art membranes in the turbulent fluidization regime with significantly reduced formation of densified zones. The effect of the particle size and the reactor size on the hydrodynamics of these novel reactors is not well understood. In this paper, the fluidization behavior of beds with different reactor sizes employing different particle sizes has been investigated using particle image velocimetry coupled with an advanced digital image analysis. It {{has been found that}} a bed with small width can be operated in the turbulent regime already at relatively low fluidization velocities. Also for reactors with a small <b>bed</b> <b>width</b> the extraction of gas via membranes results in the formation of densified zones close to the membrane walls, while the addition of gas results in an inversion of the solids circulation pattern.

The bubble shape illustrated by aspect ratio, was found to elongate more as it rise through the bed and then commence to expand horizontally after it was detached from the orifice. Aspect ratio {{was found to be}} closer to a circle for the bubble at higher jet velocity, lower orifice width to bed ratio and for non-spherical particles...|$|E

The seats rotate, {{facing forward}} for takeoff, but rotating {{to the side}} for dining and sleeping, with 83.5in seat pitch (extending to a 212cm fully flat <b>bed)</b> and a <b>width</b> of [...] Each suite has a [...] widescreen HDmonitor with 1,000AVOD programs. In addition to 110V ACpower outlets, USBports are offered for connectivity. Passengers are also able {{to make use of}} the on-board business lounge on the upper deck.

The bed space {{is defined as the}} area around an individual bed that offers privacy either as a single room or a cubicle. A document review from 1866 to 2008 found that the recommendations for <b>bed</b> space <b>width</b> had increased by 1. 1 m over 44 years, from 2. 4 m (1961) to 3. 6 m (2005). However, a small scoping project in the United Kingdom revealed that the bed space areas in recently built hospitals (medical and surgical wards) were less than the recommendations. These data are discussed in the context of healthcare Evidence-Based Design to consider three patient safety issues (falls, noise and infection transmission). A role for ergonomics is proposed in the design, planning and evaluation stages as a methodology bridge between clinicians and architects (participatory ergonomics) and as an expert adviser to address design issues of patient safety and environmental functionality...|$|R

Compared with the non-head rotation position, safety widths were smaller and overlap widths were significantly larger in the 45 head rotation positions. Safety widths did not statistically change safter adjustments for ultrasound probe level. However changing the ultrasound probe level from the base of Sedillot’s triangle to thyroid cartilage significantly decreased overlap widths. Overall, The group of Trendeleberg position, with non-head rotation, whose ultrasound probe level was thyroid cartilage had largest safety widths among 8 groups.|$|R
