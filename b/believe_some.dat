5|$|Neglected in her {{relationship}} with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to <b>believe</b> <b>some</b> aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars {{to make the case for}} emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E
25|$|Some autistic {{rights activists}} <b>believe</b> <b>some</b> {{characteristics}} {{described as being}} autistic traits are actually misconceptions. Michelle Dawson has disputed the belief that 75% of autistic people have low intelligence. Psychiatrist Laurent Mottron of Hôpital Rivière-des-Prairies in Montreal says that autistic people often score much higher on a nonverbal test of abstract reasoning than on a standard IQ test. The UK's National Autistic Society claims the proportion of autistics with intellectual disability to be between 44% and 52%, a lower figure.|$|E
25|$|Cultural Mormon is a {{term used}} for Mormons who no longer <b>believe</b> <b>some,</b> or many, of the doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), but who self-identify as Mormon. Usually, this {{is a result of}} having been raised in the LDS Church or having {{converted}} and spent a large portion of one's life as {{an active member of the}} LDS Church. Cultural Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the church, and in some cases may not even be official members of the church.|$|E

The March 14 Alliance, dominated by Christian- and Sunni-based parties, is broadly {{sympathetic to the}} Syrian opposition to Bashar Al-Assad. In August, youth members of 14 March parties including Kataeb, Lebanese Forces, National Liberal Party, Future Movement and Islamic Group held a rally to demand the expulsion of the Syrian Ambassador. 8 March parties generally supported {{the continuation of the}} Assad government, but analysts <b>believe</b> <b>some</b> groups within the coalition may seek new alliances if the Assad government falls.

500|$|A patent {{was granted}} to Wizards of the Coast in 1997 for [...] "a novel method of game play and game {{components}} {{that in one}} embodiment are {{in the form of}} trading cards" [...] that includes claims covering games whose rules include many of Magics elements in combination, including concepts such as changing orientation of a game component to indicate use (referred to in the Magic and [...] rules as [...] "tapping") and constructing a deck by selecting cards from a larger pool. The patent has aroused criticism from some observers, who <b>believe</b> <b>some</b> of its claims to be invalid. In 2003, the patent was an element of a larger legal dispute between Wizards of the Coast and Nintendo, regarding trade secrets related to Nintendo's Pokémon Trading Card Game. The legal action was settled out of court, and its terms were not disclosed.|$|E

500|$|Matilda has {{attracted}} relatively little attention from modern English academics, {{being treated as}} a marginal figure in comparison to other contemporaries, particularly her rival Stephen, {{in contrast to the}} work carried out by German scholars on her time in the Empire. Popular, but not always accurate, biographies were written by the Earl of Onslow in 1939 and Nesta Pain in 1978, but the only major academic biography in English remains Marjorie Chibnall's 1991 work. Interpretations of Matilda's character have shifted over time, but there is, as Chibnall describes, a [...] "general agreement that she was either proud or at least keenly conscious of the high status of an empress". Like both Henry I and Henry II, Matilda had a certain autocratic grandeur, which was combined with a firm moral belief in her cause; ultimately however she was limited by the political conventions of the 12th century. The treatment of Matilda by modern historians has been challenged by feminist scholars, including Fiona Tolhurst, who <b>believe</b> <b>some</b> traditional assumptions about her role and personality show gender bias. In this interpretation, Matilda has been unfairly criticised for showing qualities that have been considered praiseworthy when seen in her male contemporaries.|$|E

Simon Cowell said, [...] "I brought this show to America because I <b>believe</b> <b>some</b> of the greatest singers {{in the world are}} from this country, and you just proved that. I think you, based on that performance tonight, to me, should be the winner of 'The X Factor,' because you're going to represent this country all over the world." [...] L.A. Reid also commented, [...] "That wasn't a $5 million performance. That was a $50 million performance." [...] Sarah Maloy of Billboard magazine felt that her performance was [...] "as powerfully and passionately [...] as she did the first time". Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised Amaro's rendition, writing that it contained a [...] "determined look on her face, lots of generous spreading of the arms, and plenty of big notes". Amaro eventually emerged as the winner of The X Factor, performing this song for the final time.|$|E

In response, church leaders and journalists took an active interest in explaining and justifying the doctrine, and in countering the negative press. John Taylor, Young's successor, acknowledged in North American Review the [...] "we <b>believe</b> <b>some</b> crimes can only be atoned for by the life of the guilty party"; however, he said, [...] "all culprits worthy of death...should be executed by the proper civil officer, not by any exercise of the lex talionis or the intervention of ecclesiastical authority".|$|E
2500|$|Expectation states theory {{proposes that}} {{individuals}} use available social information to form expectations of competence {{for themselves and}} others. This is thought to help coordinate group members' efforts so that goals can be more easily achieved. One's rank in a group hierarchy is based on status characteristics (race, gender, age, specific abilities, etc.) and dominance behaviors (interruptions, eye contact, rate of speech, etc.). While exhibiting dominant behavior or being of a certain race, for instance, has no direct connection to actual ability, implicit beliefs about who is relatively better or worse drive group members to [...] "act as if" [...] they <b>believe</b> <b>some</b> people are better than others.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} Judeo-Christian view {{regarding the}} authorship of the Pentateuch, except {{the last eight}} verses of Deuteronomy, {{is that it was}} written by Moses under God's order. In secular scholarly circles {{by the end of the}} 19th century, a popular proposition regarding the authorship was the documentary hypothesis, which has remained quite influential to this day, despite criticism. The books of the prophets are entitled in accordance with the alleged authorship. Some books in the Ketuvim are attributed to important historical figures (e.g., the Proverbs to King Solomon, many of the Psalms to King David), but it is generally agreed that verification of such authorship claims is extremely difficult if not impossible, and many <b>believe</b> <b>some</b> or even all of the attributions in the [...] and the apocrypha to be pseudepigraphal.|$|E

He is commemorated in the Nicola Valley Museum in Merritt, with his son Henry Castillou, the [...] "Cowboy Judge of the Cariboo", and alongside the display of the famous James Teit; a researcher of aboriginal culture {{who worked for the}} Chicago Museum of Natural History.

2500|$|According to Quisling, she and Vidkun {{were married}} at the Norwegian {{legation}} in Moscow on 10 September 1923.

The couple might have had a civil marriage in Kharkov, though there has never been any documentation for it. Historian Hans Fredrik Dahl <b>believe</b> <b>some</b> kind of marriage took place in Kharkov that day, but that he is unsure whether it happened in formally correct ways or was an informal ceremony.
