5|$|Meanwhile, Microsoft began {{introducing}} {{its most}} prominent office products. Microsoft Works, an integrated office program which combined features typically {{found in a}} word processor, spreadsheet, database and other office applications, saw its first release as an application for the Apple Macintosh {{towards the end of}} 1986. Microsoft Works would later be sold with other Microsoft products including Microsoft Word and Microsoft <b>Bookshelf,</b> a reference collection introduced in 1987 that was the company's first CD-ROM product. Later, on August 8, 1989, Microsoft introduced its most successful office product, Microsoft Office. Unlike the model of Microsoft Works, Microsoft Office was a bundle of separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and so forth. While Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office were mostly developed internally, Microsoft also continued its trend of rebranding products from other companies, such as Microsoft SQL Server on January 13, 1988, a relational database management system for companies that was based on technology licensed from Sybase.|$|E

The fireplace in the room was enclosed in marble when Buchanan bought Wheatland and had a furnace installed.

25|$|The Tokyo Babylon manga {{has been}} popular with its English {{releases}} often appearing in Diamond Comic Distributors's lists of best selling comics. It received generally positive critical response with the writers from Manga <b>Bookshelf</b> referring {{to it as}} one of Clamp's best works based on the social themes reflected on the main cast whose traits, while found stereotypical at first, are developed across the story until its tragic ending.

The artwork has also been praised for remaining appealing despite the English volumes being released over a decade after their original release.
