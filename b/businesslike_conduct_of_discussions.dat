40|$|Background: Community {{monitoring}} {{was introduced}} on a pilot mode in 36 selected districts of India in a phased manner. In Chandigarh, {{it was introduced}} in the year 2009 - 2010. A preliminary evaluation of the program was undertaken with special emphasis on the inputs and the processes. Methodology: Quantitative methods included verification against checklists and record reviews. Nonparticipant observation was used to evaluate the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> trainings, interviews, and group discussions. Health system had trained health system functionaries (nursing students and Village Health Sanitation Committee [VHSC] members) to generate village-based scorecards for assessing community needs. Community needs were assessed independently for two villages under the study area to validate the scores generated by the health system. Results: VHSCs were formed in all 22 villages but without a chairperson or convener. The involvement of VHSC members in the community monitoring process was minimal. The <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> group <b>discussions</b> was below par due to poor moderation and unequal responses from the group. The community monitoring committees at the state level had limited representation from the non-health sector, lower committees, and the nongovernmental organizations/civil societies. Agreement between the report cards generated by the investigator and the health system in the selected villages was found to be to be fair (0. 369) whereas weighted kappa (0. 504) was moderate. Conclusion: In spite of all these limitations and challenges, the government has taken a valiant step by trying to involve the community in the monitoring of health services. The dynamic nature of the community warrants incorporation of an evaluation framework into the planning of such programs...|$|R

The paper focuses on the role <b>of</b> RTI-related online <b>discussion</b> groups, known to each other as “sister-groups”, and their offline networks in generating collaborations towards collective actions, at least in the short term.

Much debate {{has been going on}} about how to describe them. In 2000, the IEEE Std 1471 proposed a model of an architecture description and its context. In this paper we propose a lightweight method for modeling architectural information after (part of) the conceptual model of IEEE Std 1471 and defining IEEE Std 1471 viewpoints. The method gives support by outlining in textual form and in diagram form the relation of the concerns of the stakeholders to the architectural information. The definition of viewpoints can then be done with insight from these relations. The method has four steps: (1) creating stakeholder profiles, (2) summarizing internal design documentation, (3) relating the summary to the concerns of the stakeholders, and (4) defining viewpoints. We have <b>conducted</b> a round <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> and testing in practice in various settings.

One hundred Indonesian class "A" construction firms were selected as respondents for this study. The data were analysed by using statistical techniques. Validity and reliability test were used to identify factors and the best activities of each factor that influence the development of quality culture. Correlation and regression were used to explain the relationship among factors and to identify critical factors in quality culture development. Path analysis was used in producing the conceptual model. Integration Definition for Function Modelling (IDEFO) method was used to develop the quality culture development model.

40|$|Purpose Many {{nursing home}} (NH) {{residents}} with dementia receive burdensome, aggressive treatments {{at the end}} of life (EOL). The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatments (POLSTs) paradigm is a strategy to enhance EOL care. This article describes the history and features of the POLST paradigm, discusses the potential advantages of using this paradigm for NH residents with dementia, and briefly explores challenges that nurse practitioners (NPs) face in using the POLST for persons with dementia. Data sources Review of the literature. Conclusions Potential advantages associated with implementation of POLST in NH residents with dementia include increased communication and documentation about residents’ EOL care preferences, increased concordance between care preferences documented in POLST forms and EOL care provided to residents, and lower rates of unwanted, burdensome treatments at EOL. POLST may also guide NPs in communicating EOL care options with residents and/or their surrogates. However, difficulty interpreting and explaining POLST care options, lack of understanding <b>of</b> POLST, limited <b>discussions,</b> and issues with surrogate authority and scope of practice are challenges that NPs may face in caring for NH residents with dementia. Implications for practice NPs should assess and optimize their knowledge and skills to <b>conduct</b> goals <b>of</b> care <b>discussions,</b> including POLST discussions...|$|R

The evaluation of these changes was made from metallographic analysis, measurements of microhardness and of the depth of the layer affected by process. The results of this work identified several metallurgical changes such as formation of white layer, hardness variation and change of microstructure. The occurrence of microcracks also was observed, especially in severe conditions. The greatest variations in results were caused by the change of technological parameters.
