2500|$|U-brakes {{were used}} on {{mountain}} bikes {{through the early}} 1990s, particularly under the chainstays, a rear <b>brake</b> <b>mounting</b> location that was then popular. [...] This location usually benefits from higher frame stiffness, an important consideration with a powerful brake since flex in the stays will increase lever travel and reduce effective braking force. [...] Unfortunately it is also very prone to clogging by mud, which meant that U-brakes quickly fell out of favour on cross-country bikes.|$|E
50|$|The swingarm, {{while looking}} {{identical}} at first glance, is narrower (192 mm against 202 mm) and runs {{on a smaller}} diameter spindle (17 mm against 22 mm) with the rear hub and <b>brake</b> <b>mounting</b> points changed.|$|E
50|$|A fine {{entry of}} 39 cars were {{accepted}} for the event, across five classes. However, scrutineering meant trouble for those Ford Galaxies which had disc brakes; Gawaine Baillie was only allowed {{to start the}} meeting {{on the promise of}} photographic evidence of the <b>brake</b> <b>mounting</b> - otherwise he would be disqualified. John Willment Automobiles was not prepared for this and withdrew their Galaxie. Of the cars accepted, 37 cars practised.|$|E

50|$|On most seat stays, {{a bridge}} or brace is {{typically}} used {{to connect the}} stays above the rear wheel and below the connection with the seat tube. Besides providing lateral rigidity, this bridge provides a mounting point for rear brakes, fenders, and racks. The seat stays themselves may also be fitted with <b>brake</b> <b>mounts.</b> <b>Brake</b> <b>mounts</b> are often absent from fixed-gear or track bike seat stays.|$|R
50|$|Several minor {{injuries}} occurred following a derailment on the Wild Thing on May 21, 2006 when a <b>brake</b> <b>mount</b> came loose. The accident {{happened in the}} mid brake, where a train waits to enter the station following a run. The failed <b>brake</b> <b>mount</b> struck the rear axle of the train's fifth car, causing the sixth car to detach from the train and de-rail on one side. 14 people were taken to St. Francis Regional Medical Center, but all were released the same day with minor or no injuries.|$|R

50|$|Splines {{are used}} in several places on bicycles. The crank arm to BB shaft {{interfaces}} that are splined include ISIS Drive, Truvativ GXP and Howitzer, Shimano's Octalink and many others, {{most of which are}} proprietary. Some cranksets feature modular spiders, where torque is transmitted through splines. Cassettes engage the freehub via a spline that has one groove wider than the others to enforce a fixed orientation. Disc <b>brake</b> <b>mounting</b> interfaces that are splined include Centerlock, by Shimano.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} hub gears, {{there is a}} torque {{reaction}} that must be countered if the internals are not to rotate, and this is routed to the bicycleâ€™s frame by means of specially designed wheel dropout slots (OEM versions), or a torque bar bolted to the frame (EX) or the disc <b>brake</b> <b>mount</b> (DB).|$|R
2500|$|This {{is one of}} {{the least}} common types of <b>brakes.</b> They are <b>mounted</b> either on the same pivot points used for {{cantilever}} and linear-pull brakes or they can be <b>mounted</b> on four-bolt <b>brake</b> <b>mounts</b> found on many trials frames. [...] They were available on some high-end mountain bikes in the early 1990s, but declined in popularity with the rise of disc brakes. [...] The moderate performance advantage (greater power and control) they offer over cable actuated rim brakes is offset by their greater weight and complexity.|$|R
50|$|Braking was {{provided}} by a dual-circuit power assisted Lockheed and Girling system with 12-inch vented disks in front and 10-inch solid disk brakes in the rear. The rear <b>brakes</b> were <b>mounted</b> inboard and the front <b>brakes</b> were <b>mounted</b> to the stub-axle on the front upright, which brought {{them out of the}} wheels and into the air-stream for cooling.|$|R
50|$|Braking is {{achieved}} by a disc <b>brake</b> <b>mounted</b> on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are used in most shifter kart classes and are increasingly popular in other classes; however, certain classes do not allow them. Shifter karts have dual master cylinders, one for the front {{and one for the}} rear and are adjustable to allow for front/ rear bias changes.|$|R

2500|$|The {{caliper brake}} is {{a class of}} cable-actuated brake in which the <b>brake</b> <b>mounts</b> to a single point above the wheel, {{theoretically}} allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim. [...] Arms extend around the tyre and end in brake shoes that press against the rim. [...] While some designs incorporate dual pivot points [...] the arms pivot on a sub-frame [...] the entire assembly still mounts to a single point.|$|R
25|$|The 1963 Sting Ray {{production}} car's lineage can {{be traced}} to two separate GM projects: the Q-Corvette, and perhaps more directly, Mitchell's racing Sting Ray. The Q-Corvette, initiated in 1957, envisioned a smaller, more advanced Corvette as a coupe-only model, boasting a rear transaxle, independent rear suspension, and four-wheel disc brakes, with the rear <b>brakes</b> <b>mounted</b> inboard. Exterior styling was purposeful, with peaked fenders, a long nose, and a short, bobbed tail.|$|R
5000|$|As German {{research}} into swept wing aerodynamics {{was not yet}} available when the design was finalized, the FJ-1 used a straight wing. No provision for wing-folding had been made as dive <b>brakes</b> <b>mounted</b> in the wings made that option unfeasible. In order to conserve carrier deck space, a unique [...] "kneeling" [...] nose undercarriage along with a swivelling [...] "jockey wheel" [...] allowed the FJ-1 to be stacked tail-high, close to another FJ-1.|$|R

5000|$|The 999 {{was mounted}} on 86 in {{diameter}} driving wheels {{rather than the}} 70 in driving wheels mounted on other engines of the class, {{and was the first}} of its kind to have <b>brakes</b> <b>mounted</b> to the front truck.

50|$|The {{foot pedal}} {{operates}} by rod a transmission <b>brake</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the rear}} end of the gearbox's second motion shaft. It {{is described as a}} powerful double-acting band brake. The brake's drum is surrounded by a water jacket. The hand lever operated side brakes (on the rear wheels) are also double-acting band brakes. These drums are fixed to the rear wheels. The operating lever is inside the car by the right hand of the driver. The system of rods and levers incorporates an equalising arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The {{single plate}} dry clutch has a central {{external}} spring and roller spigot bearing. The gears are changed by a central lever {{working in an}} invisible gate. There is a brake lever just {{to the left of}} the gear lever operating a band transmission <b>brake</b> <b>mounted</b> directly behind the gearbox. The band may be adjusted by a threaded rod. Drive is taken by an open propellor shaft coupled by triple Hardy disc joints to the half-floating spiral-bevel driven rear axle which has a banjo case.|$|R
50|$|The 33 became {{renowned for}} its nimble {{handling}} and powerful boxer engines, but also became equally well known for its unreliable electronics and tendencies to rust (a frequent complaint on Italian cars in general at the time). Another issue was its braking and increased unsprung weight - the Alfasud's inboard front disc <b>brakes</b> (<b>mounted</b> on the gearbox) had been moved to the more common outboard discs (mounted on the wheel hubs). The rear discs of the Sud's four-wheel disc arrangement had also been replaced with drums.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the stress and the strain fields in the <b>brake</b> caliper <b>mounts</b> of front {{motorbike}} suspensions produced by the braking action. First of all, some formulae useful to evaluate the maximum braking force in function of the vehicle features (e. g., total mass, centre of gravity position, tyre dimension, and brake disk diameter) have been developed. A mathematical model useful to calculate the axial, the bending, and the torque stresses on the <b>braking</b> caliper <b>mounts</b> has been then defined. The model has been developed by comparing the theoretical results with those obtained by some numerical analyses, based on the finite element method. An ad hoc test equipment has been, finally, designed and manufactured in order to define and analyze experimentally the strength {{of different types of}} <b>brake</b> caliper <b>mounts</b> and, at the same time, to verify the proposed model...|$|R
