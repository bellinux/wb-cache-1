5|$|Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article {{describing}} a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants, {{and the discovery}} of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, about 5,000 virus species have been described in detail, although there are millions of types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most abundant type of <b>biological</b> <b>entity.</b> The study of viruses is known as virology, a sub-speciality of microbiology.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} <b>biological</b> <b>entity</b> in aquatic environments—there are about one million {{of them in a}} teaspoon of seawater—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and {{this is the most important}} mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of <b>biological</b> <b>entity</b> in aquatic environments– there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within {{a short amount of}} time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, {{in the case of the}} T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E

Mulder initially believes that Druce's truck is a decoy meant to distract him from the UFO, but discovers that Deep Throat's photo is a fake. When Mulder confronts Deep Throat, he admits his deception and confirms that the earlier transmission was genuine. He also divulges that the truck is being used to transport an extraterrestrial <b>biological</b> <b>entity,</b> or E.B.E., that was recovered from the Iraqi crash site.

25|$|To {{prepare for}} an assay, the {{researcher}} fills each {{well of the}} plate with some <b>biological</b> <b>entity</b> that they wish to conduct the experiment upon, such as a protein, cells, or an animal embryo. After some incubation time has passed to allow the biological matter to absorb, bind to, or otherwise react (or fail to react) with the compounds in the wells, measurements are taken across all the plate's wells, either manually or by a machine. Manual measurements are often necessary when the researcher is using microscopy to (for example) seek changes or defects in embryonic development caused by the wells' compounds, looking for effects that a computer could not easily determine by itself. Otherwise, a specialized automated analysis machine can run a number of experiments on the wells (such as shining polarized light on them and measuring reflectivity, which can be an indication of protein binding). In this case, the machine outputs the result of each experiment as a grid of numeric values, with each number mapping to the value obtained from a single well. A high-capacity analysis machine can measure dozens of plates {{in the space of}} a few minutes like this, generating thousands of experimental datapoints very quickly.|$|E

30|$|The common {{approach}} for synthesizing AuNPs employs sodium citrate and/or sodium borohydride as reducing agents to convert gold salts into AuNPs. The emergence of sustainability initiatives {{has increased the}} use of <b>biological</b> <b>entities</b> as reducing agents in AuNP synthesis (i.e., green synthesis) to replace toxic chemicals. Many authors have extensively reported the green synthesis of AuNPs using diverse <b>biological</b> <b>entities.</b> These green synthetic processes are rapid, eco-friendly, and cost-effective, and they can easily be scaled up [4 – 8]. Examples of these diverse <b>biological</b> <b>entities</b> include plant extracts, polysaccharides, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, DNA, RNA, proteins, and polypeptides. We used aqueous earthworm (Eisenia andrei) extracts as a reducing agent for the green synthesis of AuNPs (EW-AuNPs). Earthworm extracts reportedly have anticoagulant, fibrinolytic, and antithrombotic activities [9 – 14]. Trisina and co-workers reported that the protein extracts from Lumbricus rubellus are responsible for antithrombotic and thrombolytic activities [14]. In addition to proteins, glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin/dermatan sulfates and heparan sulfate) are also present in earthworm (E. andrei) extracts [15].|$|R

Since molecular biological databases are rather heterogeneous, unification and data integration is mandatory {{to make use of the}} huge amount of available information. Currently, the most promising approach for integration is the use of ontologies. Since mapping <b>biological</b> <b>entities</b> into ontologies is usually achieved manually or semiautomatically, a system for automatic classification of <b>biological</b> <b>entities</b> into ontologies saves time and e#ort. Therefore, we present a support vector machine based approach that automatically classifies <b>biological</b> <b>entities</b> into a given ontology. To solve this di#cult task, our method copes with the following aspects. <b>Biological</b> <b>entities</b> might belong to more than one class or may be placed in classes on varying abstraction levels. An object may be described by several representations. Thus, the classifier has to be enabled to draw information from all of them, but must consider the possibility that some objects are described incompletely. Therefore, our method introduces the technique of objectadjusted weighting which regulates the impact of each representation dynamically for each object. To significantly improve the time performance of the classifier we exploit the inheritance relations of the given ontology. Our experimental evaluation on protein data and several parts of an established molecular biological ontology shows that our prototype o#ers impressive accuracy and is e#cient enough to cope with the large number of classes encountered in real world problems...|$|R

The cross-linked entries of the databases can be seen to form a large heterogeneous network on which data mining methods can be applied.

Here, k-medoids, a clustering method, has been applied to automatically find few representative vertices, i. e., <b>biological</b> <b>entities,</b> within a given set of vertices. For instance, a life scientists may obtain hundreds of genes from first research, all being candidates for further research. He then may need to select few genes for further research that are representative for all candidate genes. To automate such a selection, k-medoids is applied on the Biomine graph to find clusters of <b>biological</b> <b>entities,</b> thereby using the best path probability as pairwise similarity measure.

Moreover, the existence of internal electromagnetic fields generated by <b>biological</b> <b>entities,</b> as well as external electromagnetic fields, are essential for understanding the electromagnetic-biological effect. In fact, it is estimated that at present millimeter-wave therapy is used for the management of more than 120 diseases in cardiology, neurology, oncology, gynecology, urology, gastroenterology, surgery, pharmacology and pediatrics. However, so far there is still no consensus regarding the interaction between extremely high frequency/extremely low intensity electromagnetic waves and the biological environment at its different levels of organization. Thus, the present paper was intended to contribute to the development for the theory of millimeter-wave interaction with living <b>biological</b> <b>entities...</b>|$|R
