5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet in length, {{was released}} on June 14, 1910. Theater advertisements for the film were found in newspapers in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio. The film was alternatively known and advertised as Taming a Woman Hater. One theater in Pennsylvania would advertise Thanhouser's Jane Eyre as a magnificent and costly production and follow it up with The Woman Hater with the generic advertisement promotion {{that it was a}} great film.

25|$|Fishing is a {{relatively}} unimportant economic activity within the EU. It contributes generally less than 1% to gross national product. In 2007 the fisheries sector employed 141,110 fishermen. In 2007, 6.4million tonnes of fish were caught by EU countries. The EU fleet has 97,000 vessels of varying sizes. Fish farming produced a further 1million tonnes of fish and shellfish and employed another 85,000 people. The shortfall between fish catches and demand varies, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> EU trade deficit in processed fish products of €3billion.|$|E
25|$|The double {{jeopardy}} rule {{means that a}} person cannot be tried more than once for the same offence. It is an important safeguard to acquitted defendants, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> important general public interest in ensuring {{that those who have}} committed serious crimes are convicted of them. The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report recognised that the rule is capable of causing grave injustice to victims and the community in certain cases where compelling fresh evidence has come to light after an acquittal. It called for a change in the law to be considered, and we have accepted that such a change is appropriate. The European Convention on Human Rights (Article 4(2) of Protocol 7) explicitly recognises the importance of being able to re-open cases where new evidence comes to light.|$|E
25|$|East Croydon {{station is}} {{currently}} located in Travelcard Zone 5, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> ongoing campaign for East Croydon {{and the smaller}} West Croydon station (also located in Zone 5) to be rezoned to Travelcard Zone 4. It {{has been argued that}} the stations should be in Zone 4 because some stations currently in Zone 4 are further away from Central London, and that rezoning the stations will save commuters living in Croydon large amounts of money, attract investment to Croydon, create jobs in the town and make living in the area more attractive. It is expected that those commuting to Croydon would be largely unaffected by such a change. The issue has been debated in the House of Commons, but current train operator Southern has not formally submitted a proposal for such a change to Transport for London, which is required for a station to be rezoned.|$|E

25|$|For {{the most}} part {{carnivorous}} plant populations are not dominant enough to be dramatically significant, ecologically speaking, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> impressive variety of organisms that interact with various carnivorous plants in sundry relationships of kleptoparasitism, commensalism, and mutualism. For example, small insectivores such as tree frogs often exploit the supply of prey {{to be found in}} pitcher plants, and the frog Microhyla nepenthicola actually specialises in such habitats. Certain crab spiders such as Misumenops nepenthicola live largely on the prey of Nepenthes, and other, less specialised, spiders may build webs where they trap insects attracted by the smell or appearance of the traps; some scavengers, detritivores, and also organisms that harvest or exploit those in turn, such as the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii are largely or totally dependent on particular carnivorous plants. Plants such as Roridula species combine with specialised bugs (Pameridea roridulae) in benefiting from insects trapped on their leaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{second stage}} of Meyer's cricket career began after his return to England to set up Millfield School in Somerset. From the 1936 season, he {{appeared}} in Somerset matches, almost always those {{in the second half}} of the season when the school term had ended and, with rare exceptions, those played at home. In these games, he played as an all-rounder, his batting having improved significantly since his Cambridge days. Against Lancashire at Taunton in the last match of the 1936 season, he rescued Somerset from likely defeat with his maiden century, an undefeated 202, scored in 225 minutes. There is no doubt of the innings' merit– Somerset were still 48 behind with half their second innings wickets gone– <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> oft-repeated story that the double century was obtained by an offer to contribute to the Lancashire beneficiary's fund. And he got a second century the following year against Sussex. As a bowler, he managed at least one five-wicket innings haul in each of the four seasons running up to the Second World War, though his bowling was an increasingly idiosyncratic mixture of spin and swing. In the war, he served in the Royal Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Deuteronomy {{occupies}} a puzzling {{position in the}} Bible, linking {{the story of the}} Israelites' wanderings in the wilderness to the story of their history in Canaan without quite belonging totally to either. The wilderness story could end quite easily with Numbers, and the story of Joshua's conquests could exist without it, at least {{at the level of the}} plot; but in both cases there would be a thematic (theological) element missing. Scholars have given various answers to the problem. The Deuteronomistic history theory is currently the most popular (Deuteronomy was originally just the law code and covenant, written to cement the religious reforms of Josiah, and later expanded to stand as the introduction to the full history); <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> older theory which sees Deuteronomy as belonging to Numbers, and Joshua as a sort of supplement to it. This idea still has supporters, but the mainstream understanding is that Deuteronomy, after becoming the introduction to the history, was later detached from it and included with Genesis-Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers because it already had Moses as its central character. According to this hypothesis, the death of Moses was originally the ending of Numbers, and was simply moved from there to the end of Deuteronomy.|$|E
