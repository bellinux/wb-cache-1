We show that spin-exchange interactions {{give rise to}} several distinct phases, which differ in their spin correlations. In two- and three- dimensional lattices insulating phases with odd number of particles per site are always nematic. For insulating states with even number of particles per site {{there is always a}} spin-singlet phase and there may also be a first-order transition into the nematic phase. The nematic phase <b>breaks</b> <b>spin</b> rotational symmetry, but preserves time reversal symmetry, and has gapless spin-wave excitations. The spin singlet phase does not <b>break</b> <b>spin</b> symmetry and has a gap to all excitations. In one-dimensional lattices insulating phases with odd number of particles per site always have a regime where translational symmetry is broken and the ground state is dimerized.

50|$|Ring {{spinning}} technology {{had successfully}} replaced the spinning mule, with mills having been converted mules to rings. However in the 1970s, the depleted industry was challenged {{by a new}} technology open-end or <b>break</b> <b>spinning.</b> In 1978 Carrington Viyella opened a factory to do open-end spinning in Atherton. This was the first new textile production facility in Lancashire since 1929. Immediately Pear Mill, Stockport and Alder Mill, Leigh were closed. These were both Edwardian mills designed by Stott and Sons.The mill built in 1978 {{was built on the}} Howe Bridge mills site and was named Unit One.

50|$|It is {{also known}} as <b>break</b> <b>spinning</b> or rotor spinning. The {{principle}} behind open-end spinning {{is similar to that of}} a clothes dryer spinning full of sheets. If you could open the door and pull out a sheet, it would spin together as you pulled it out. Sliver from the card goes into the rotor, is spun into yarn and comes out, wrapped up on a bobbin, all ready to go to the next step. There is no roving stage or re-packaging on an auto-coner. This system is much less labour-intensive and faster than ring spinning with rotor speeds up to 140,000 rpm. The Rotor design is the key to the operation of the open-ended spinners. Each type of fibre may require a different rotor design for optimal product quality and processing speed.|$|E

40|$|A spin nematic is a {{state which}} <b>breaks</b> <b>spin</b> SU(2) {{symmetry}} while preserving translational and time reversal symmetries. Spin nematic order can arise naturally from charge fluctuations of a spin stripe state. Focusing on the possible existence of such a state in strongly correlated electron systems, we build a nematic wave function starting from a t-J type model. The nematic is a spin-two operator, and therefore does not couple directly to neutrons. However, we show that neutron scattering and Knight shift experiments can detect the spin anisotropy of electrons moving in a nematic background.

The typical width of this crossover is q ∼ kBT/N, where q is the QZ energy, T the spin temperature and N the atom number.
