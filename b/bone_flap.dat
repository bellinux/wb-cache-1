We aimed to compare mandibular reconstruction with prefabricated, vascularized tissue-engineered <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> with rhBMP- 2 and rhBMP- 2 applied in situ in primates (Rhesus monkey). We also compared {{the use of}} the carriers demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) and coralline hydroxyapatite (CHA) for applying rhBMP- 2. After computed tomography of the monkey head, custom meshes were made, loaded with rhBMP- 2 -incorporated DFDBA or CHA, and implanted in the latissimus dorsi muscle. Meanwhile, contralateral segmental mandibular defects were created, and custom meshes loaded with DFDBA, CHA, or rhBMP- 2 -incooperated DFDBA and CHA were implanted in situ. Thirteen weeks later, the <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> with rhBMP- 2 -incorporated DFDBA or CHA were transferred to repair segmental mandibular defects. The meshes loaded with DFDBA or CHA alone showed no bone regeneration 13 weeks after implantation in latissimus dorsi muscle. Radiography, angiography and histological analysis were used to evaluate the repair and vascularization of the implant. Segmental mandibular defects were successfully restored with prefabricated <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> and rhBMP- 2 -incorporated CHA in situ, but other segmental mandibular defects remained with rhBMP- 2 -incorporated DFDBA, DFDBA and CHA in situ. Moreover, mandibles reconstructed with rhBMP- 2 -incorporated CHA <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> revealed more regenerated and homogeneous bone formation than did other reconstructions.

Application of craniofacial skeletal buttress principles to high-energy trauma or oncologic defects with composite vascularized <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> restores the soft tissue {{as well as the}} buttresses and ultimately preserves facial contour. We conducted a retrospective review of 34 patients with craniofacial defects treated by a single surgeon with composite <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> at R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center and Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2001 to 2007. Data collected included age, sex, mechanism of injury, type of defect, type of reconstructive procedures, and outcome.

Histological analysis, substantiated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and micro-computerized tomography scans, indicated three distinct zones: an outer one, including bone tissue; a middle zone, formed by fibrous connective tissue; and a central zone, essentially necrotic. The depths of connective tissue and of bone ingrowth were consistent at different construct diameters and significantly increased from respectively 3. 1 +/- 0. 7 mm and 1. 0 +/- 0. 4 mm at 8 weeks to 3. 7 +/- 0. 6 mm and 1. 4 +/- 0. 6 mm at 12 weeks.

In treating sagittal synostosis, required <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> {{have been reduced}} to 11 (from ~ 20). Methods:. In a 2 -year period (2014 – 2015), 5 boys with sagittal synostosis underwent MCDO using our simplified and fixed-form osteotomy. Mean age at surgery was 9. 4 months (range, 8 – 11 months). Pre- and postoperative cranial morphology was assessed by cephalic index and by mid-sagittal vector analysis. Results:. Improved cranial shape was confirmed by 3 -dimensional CT scans and by mid-sagittal vector index. Mean preoperative cephalic index (68. 7) progressively increased to means of 78. 5 immediately after distraction device removal, 75. 2 at postoperative month 6, and 75. 1 at 1 year postoperatively. There were no major complications, although transient cerebrospinal fluid leakage and loosening of anchor pins occurred in 1 patient. Conclusions:.

Sterilization and preservation methods for the autologous <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> {{continue to be}} the surgeon's choice. Aim: This study aimed to assess the short-term as well as long-term clinical outcomes of CP using autoclaved autologous bone grafts. Settings and Design: This retrospective observational study was performed on patients admitted in a tertiary care teaching neurosurgery department. Patients and Methods: Seventy-two patients who underwent CP with autoclaved autologous skull flaps preserved under ambient conditions with strict aseptic precautions were included in the study. Statistical Analysis Used: Frequencies and percentages of the various characteristics before and after the surgery were tabulated. Continuous variables were summarized as means and standard deviations. Results: The primary CP had a satisfactory clinical outcome in 62 cases (86. 11 %). Osteomyelitis was observed in four patients (5. 56 %) nearly 2 months after the surgery. Radiologically significant bone resorption was noted in a single patient (1. 39 %) after 1 year. Five patients (6. 94 %) developed bone fragmentation or fracture, and the mean time taken for this was about 36 months. In all these ten cases, secondary CP was successfully done using a prefabricated, patient-specific titanium mesh.

Methods: The UK military Joint Theatre Trauma Registry (JTTR) was searched for all UK survivors in Afghanistan and Iraq between 2004 and 2014 requiring craniectomy and cranioplasty resulting from trauma. Results: Fourteen decompressive craniectomies and cranioplasties were performed with blast and gunshot wounds equally responsible for head injury. Ten survivors (71 %) had an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 75, normally designated as ‘unsurvivable’. Most were operated {{on the day of}} injury. Seventy-one percent received a reverse question mark incision and 7 % received a bicoronal incision. Seventy-nine percent had <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> discarded. Overall infection rate was 43 %.

40|$|Abstract Background Osteoprotegerin (OPG) {{has been}} {{reported}} to prevent bone resorption by inhibiting the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts in a variety of animal models. However, the effects of OPG on bone metabolism in avian species have not been described. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of chicken OPG (chOPG) expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) on chicken osteoclast function in vitro. Methods The chOPG sequence containing the open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from chicken embryo frontal bone and inserted into the pcDNA 3. 1 (+) vector. PcDNA 3. 1 (+) /chOPG was transiently transfected into CEFs by lipofectamine 2000. Transcription of OPG mRNA and expression of chOPG recombinant protein were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence. The level of chOPG recombinant protein was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The suspension of osteoclasts was separated from chicken embryos and divided into three groups (control group, pcDNA 3. 1 (+) group and pcDNA 3. 1 (+) /chOPG group). The percentage of osteoclast apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) secreted by osteoclasts was measured by the diazol method. The resorbing activity of osteoclasts was evaluated by the area of lacunae on <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> and the concentration of calcium in the supernatant liquid of osteoclasts. Results 48 h after transfection, the exogenous OPG gene transcription was detected by RT-PCR. After 72 h, the CEFs transfected from pcDNA 3. 1 (+) /chOPG displayed green fluorescence and the concentration of chOPG protein was 15. 78 ± 0. 22 ng/mL. After chicken osteoclasts were cultured for 5 d in a medium containing supernatant from transfected CEFs, the percentage of osteoclast apoptosis was increased significantly, the concentration of TRAP, the area of lacunae on <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> and calcium concentration were decreased significantly in the pcDNA 3. 1 (+) /OPG group compared to the control group and the pcDNA 3. 1 (+) group.

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} of bone {{could help}} minimise donor site defects of conventional <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> like the fibula, iliac crest, radius and scapula. First a review is given on {{the literature of}} donor site morbidity of these flaps. Then the use of MRI is investigated for longitudinal study of ectopic bone formation in a rat model with demineralised bone matrix in a subcutaneous site. The {{results of this study}} show that in vivo MRI is well suited to assess bone formation larger than 0. 5 mm in diameter and to monitor the complete three-dimensional shape of the newly formed bone in a noninvasive manner. In the third chapter it is concluded that in vivo MRI proves to be a reliable method for monitoring ectopic bone formation in a rat model with DBM in a muscle flap, while in vivo DEXA was unable to detect the implants. Furthermore, in vivo MRA proves to be a very useful technique for studying the circulation of muscle flaps in this animal model. In chapter four it is concluded that enlargement of the surface area by morsellizing DBM implants in a rat model is not an important factor in bone forming capacity. In chapter five, the aim of the study is to investigate the influence of the carrier in a cell-based bone regeneration approach, whereby we hypothesize that CaP ceramic implants will induce more bone formation than Ti-fiber implants. Our hypothesis is confirmed. In chapter six the hypothesis that a muscle recipient site could favor bone formation in a cell-based bone graft substitute compared to a subcutaneous recipient site due to the higher vascularity of muscle tissue, could not be confirmed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} implant {{accuracy and}} cosmetic {{outcome of a}} new intraoperative patient-specific cranioplasty method after convexity meningioma resection. METHODS: The patient's own <b>bone</b> <b>flap</b> served as a template to mold a negative form {{with the use of}} polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The area of bone invasion was determined and broadly excised under white light illumination with a safety margin of at least 1 cm. The definitive replica was cast within the remaining <b>bone</b> <b>flap</b> frame and the imprint. Clinical and radiologic follow-up examinations were performed 3 months after surgery. RESULTS: Four women and two men (mean age 51. 4 years ± 12. 8) underwent reconstruction of <b>bone</b> <b>flap</b> defects after meningioma resection. Mean duration of intraoperative reconstruction of the partial <b>bone</b> <b>flap</b> defects was 19 minutes ± 4 (range 14 - 24 minutes).

40|$|AbstractLarge bone defect {{treatment}} {{represents a}} great challenge due {{to the difficulty of}} functional and esthetic reconstruction. Tissue-engineered bone grafts created by in vitro manipulation of bioscaffolds, seed cells, and growth factors have been considered potential treatments for bone defect reconstruction. However, a significant gap remains between experimental successes and clinical translation. An emerging strategy for bridging this gap is using the in vivo bioreactor principle and flap prefabrication techniques. This principle focuses on using the body as a bioreactor to cultivate the traditional triad (bioscaffolds, seed cells, and growth factors) and leveraging the body's self-regenerative capacity to regenerate new tissue. Additionally, flap prefabrication techniques allow the regenerated bone grafts to be transferred as prefabricated <b>bone</b> <b>flaps</b> for <b>bone</b> defect reconstruction. Such a strategy has been used successfully for reconstructing critical-sized bone defects in animal models and humans.

APHA, European Union, PAHO/WHO, and Brazil/MAPA recommendations were followed. Bleeding and skinning knives were contaminated with E. coli (61. 5 %). Regarding the meat cuts, 30. 76 % samples from head meat, the esophagus and the <b>boning</b> <b>flap</b> showed the presence of E. coli in counts up to 2 [*]log[*]CFU/g, while 15. 3 % of the diaphragm samples showed up to 1. 85 [*]log[*]CFU/g. The analyzed comminuted meat was, therefore, shown to be contaminated with E. coli during processing, indicating that end-products from this raw material can offer biological risks...|$|R
