In October 2009 he made some scathing comments about the federal minister Josée Verner.

I couldn't even say if it was man or animal, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> thought there was something there. When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me that he had the same feeling. That is all that I can say." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That," [...] Thomson explained, [...] "is {{almost a}} {{personal}} matter with me. Three months ago I {{spent the night}} with the Third Army Corps up by Niemen. I was there on other business, as you may imagine, but there was some hot fighting and I went out to help. I was attending {{to some of our}} fellows and got very near to the German lines. I became separated from the others a little and was groping about when I heard voices talking German within a few feet of me. I couldn't hear what they said <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> distinguish two figures. One of them made off towards the German lines. The other, after standing still for a moment, came in my direction. I took out my revolver, and {{to tell you the truth}} I very nearly fired on sight, for it would have been an exceedingly awkward matter for me to have been taken prisoner just then. Just as my finger was on the trigger, I became conscious that the man who was approaching was humming 'Tipperary.' I flashed my light on his face and saw at once that he was a British officer. He addressed me quickly in German. I answered him in English. I fancied for a moment that he seemed annoyed. 'We'd better get out of this,' he whispered. 'We're within a hundred yards of the German trenches and they are bringing searchlights up.' 'Who were you talking to <b>just</b> now?' <b>I</b> asked, as we stole along. 'No one at all,' he answered. I didn't take the thing seriously for the moment, although it seemed to me queer. Afterwards I regretted, however, that I hadn't set myself to discover the meaning of what was apparently a deliberate lie. The next time I met Granet was at a luncheon party at the Ritz, a few days ago. I recognised his face at once, although I had only seen it by the flash of my electric lamp. From that moment I have had my suspicions." ...|$|R
5000|$|It's {{noteworthy}} that {{after two years}} and 134 dates on the 20/20 Experience World Tour, the act is drilled to perfection but never robotic. All six dancers combine precision with a personal signature, as do the musicians and singers who frequently step out from behind their 1940s big band-style JT music stands to cut loose. Timberlake is a magnetic performer who moves with twitchy sensuality in his Tom Ford tux. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as easily have watched bespectacled vocalist Jack E. King III get his groove on all night, since there's nothing quite so ecstatically graceful as a heavy-set dude with funk in his bones.Nigel M. Smith from The Guardian noted [...] "his falsetto is on-point throughout, as are his smooth moves - like a blend of Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson and Prince, to whom the film is dedicated. There’s a sexy swagger to Timberlake’s onstage personae that never reads as cocksure, {{largely because of the}} lavish attention he pays to his band and dancers... They all look like there’s no place they’d rather be, despite it being the end of a grueling two year tour. In an era when machines are largely responsible for the beats that drive pop music, the reverence Timberlake shows for actual instruments is worth endearing. Still, there’s no mistaking Timberlake as ring leader." [...] Brian Tallerico of the Roger Ebert website gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, and wrote [...] "Demme opens his fantastically entertaining film by introducing us to the backup players and musicians who have supported the pop star on this two-year tour, but make no mistake, this movie is about the entertainer at its center. While Demme’s camera never forgets to allow the other partners in pop to share time, he always comes back to Timberlake, one of the most purely enjoyable musicians around which one could center a concert film. His energy is infectious and his joy about what he’s been blessed to do for a living is contagious". On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100%, based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score 81 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim".|$|R
