5|$|By the 1890s, Svalbard {{had become}} a {{destination}} for Arctic tourism, coal deposits had been found and the islands were {{being used as a}} base for Arctic exploration. The first mining was along Isfjorden by Norwegians in 1899; by 1904, British interests had established themselves in Adventfjorden and started the first all-year operations. Production in Longyearbyen, by American interests, started in 1908; and Store Norske established itself in 1916, as did other Norwegian interests during the war, in part <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> American interests.|$|E
5|$|Eurostar {{passengers}} travelling {{inside the}} Schengen Area (Brussels-Lille or Brussels-Calais; Lille-Calais trips are not allowed) {{pass through a}} separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter carriage 18 of the train, which is reserved for these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without {{the right to do}} so, <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi if they tried to prevent passengers whom they suspected of attempting to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Diệm {{recalled}} him to Saigon to help {{deal with}} the Hòa Hảo, a religious sect equipped with a private army. The Hòa Hảo was effectively an autonomous entity in the Mekong Delta, as its private army enforced a parallel administration and refused to integrate into the Saigon administration. While the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) General Dương Văn Minh led the military effort against the Hòa Hảo, Thơ helped to weaken the sect <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> off its warlords.|$|E

5|$|Kheradpir became CEO of Juniper Networks in January 2014. He {{developed}} and executed a restructuring and cost-cutting plan that Juniper called its Integrated Operating Plan (IOP), {{in response to}} pressure from activist investors at Elliot Management. The plan included $160 million in cost cutting and returning $3 billion to shareholders over three years <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> shares and increasing dividends. It also consolidated many product and R groups, putting a major emphasis on the market segments of Web 2.0, Cloud-Builder & High-IQ Networks.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{criminal}} genius Lex Luthor {{plans to}} make a fortune in real estate <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> large amounts of barren desert land, then using a nuclear explosion on a weak point in the San Andreas Fault, sinking California and leaving Luthor's desert as the new West Coast, greatly increasing its value.

Rappaport also planned to have an apartment in one of the York Row houses. However, like many other Rappaport-owned buildings, they ended up being left vacant and neglected, becoming a target for vandals and the homeless.|$|E

5|$|When Alexander was 13, Philip {{began to}} search for a tutor, and {{considered}} such academics as Isocrates and Speusippus, the latter offering to resign to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose Aristotle and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at Mieza as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of Stageira, which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile.|$|E
5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|A major {{planning}} {{issue was}} {{the need for a}} minicomputer at the station. NDRE argued that it was fully capable of delivering such a system, but NTNF instead wanted to minimize risk <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> the PDP-8 from Digital Equipment Corporation in the United States. However, NDRE was awarded the contract, in part because of NTNF's obligation to support Norwegian technology and in part because NDRE agreed to purchase a suitable foreign computer if they could not successfully manufacture one themselves. A new minicomputer, SAM-2, was built at NDRE and completed in April 1967. It was the first computer built in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. SAM-2 was so successful that the developers established Norsk Data to commercialize the technology.|$|E

5|$|As the 49th Congress {{gathered}} in 1885, Cleveland's {{position on the}} tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, but Republicans {{and the rest of}} the Democratic caucus rejected it.|$|E
5|$|As the Flames sank in the standings, their {{attendance}} also sagged. For most {{of their}} first 16 years in Calgary, Flames tickets were among the toughest {{to get in the}} NHL. However, by 1999, attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum: buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec City in leaving for the United States. The fans responded <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> enough season tickets to keep the Flames in Calgary for the 1999–2000 season. The Flames issued another appeal for more season tickets in the summer of 2000. The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful. The increased sales did not halt the Flames' financial losses, however, as the team estimated it lost $14.5million between 2001 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|As the stadium's {{construction}} got underway, the NFL {{began to}} search for an owner for the team, which the league decided would be an expansion franchise March 23, 1998. A litany of potential owners lined up, including Kosar and a group backed partly by HBO founder Charles Dolan, comedian Bill Cosby and former Miami coach Don Shula. The ultimate winner was Al Lerner, the Baltimore man who had helped Modell in 1986 <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> a small stake in the Browns. A seven-member NFL expansion committee awarded the team to Lerner for $530 million in September 1998. Lerner, then 65 years old, had a majority share, while Carmen Policy, who helped build the 49ers dynasty of the 1980s, owned 10% of the team and was to run football operations.|$|E

5|$|Betances {{believed}} in the abolition of slavery, inspired not only on written works by Victor Schoelcher, John Brown, Lamartine and Tapia, but also on personal experience, {{based on what he}} saw at his father's farm and in daily Puerto Rican life. Based on his beliefs, he founded a civic organization in 1856, one of many others that were later called the Secret Abolitionist Societies by historians. Little is known about them due to their clandestine nature, but Betances and Salvador Brau (a close friend who later became the official Historian of Puerto Rico) describe them in their writings. Some of these societies sought the freedom and free passage of maroons from Puerto Rico to countries where slavery had been abolished already; other societies sought to liberate as many slaves as possible <b>by</b> <b>buying</b> out their freedom.|$|E

Sue Ellen decides to leave J.R. for good, but he manages to take John Ross away and put him into hiding in a boarding school. Sue Ellen and her new lover, Nicholas Pearce, confront J.R. at his penthouse and demand he tell them where he hid John Ross.
