50|$|<b>Bugs,</b> <b>dust,</b> or even wind to {{the face}} and eyes can cause rider {{discomfort}} or injury. As a result, {{it is not uncommon}} (and in some U.S. states, is required by law) for riders to wear wrap-around sunglasses or goggles to supplement eye protection with these helmets. Alternatively, many open face helmets include, or can be fitted with, a face shield, which is more effective in stopping flying insects from entering the helmet.|$|R

50|$|Medical-grade {{diatomite}} {{has been}} studied for its efficacy as a deworming agent in cattle; in both studies cited the groups being treated with diatomaceous earth did not fare any better than control groups. It is commonly used in lieu of boric acid, {{and can be used}} to help control and possibly eliminate bed <b>bug,</b> house <b>dust</b> mite, cockroach, ant and flea infestations. This material has wide application for insect control in grain storage.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Horizontal {{transfer}} of insecticide occurs when insects contact or ingest an insecticide, {{return to an}} aggregation or a nest, and transfer the insecticide to other conspecific insects through contact. This phenomenon {{has been reported in}} a number of insects including social insects, however it has not been reported in bed bugs. Since horizontal transfer can facilitate the spread of insecticide into hard to reach spaces, it could contribute greatly to the management of these public health pests. METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: To demonstrate horizontal {{transfer of}} diatomaceous earth and botanical insecticides in C. lectularius, an exposed (donor) bed bug, following a 10 -minute acquisition period, was placed with unexposed (recipient) bed bugs. Mortality data clearly demonstrates that diatomaceous earth (DE 51) was actively transferred from a single exposed bug to unexposed bugs in a concentration dependent manner. LC 50 values varied from 24. 4 mg at 48 h to 5. 1 mg at 216 h when a single exposed bed bug was placed with 5 unexposed bed bugs. LT 50 values also exhibited a concentration response. LT 50 values varied from 1. 8 days to 8. 4 days when a 'donor' bug exposed to 20 and 5 mg of dust respectively was placed with 5 'recipient' <b>bugs.</b> <b>Dust</b> was also actively transferred from adult bed bugs to the nymphs. In addition we observed horizontal transfer of botanical insecticides including neem, ryania, and rotenone to varying degrees. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data clearly demonstrate horizontal transfer of diatomaceous earth and botanical insecticides in the common bed bug, C. lectularius. Use of a fluorescent dust provided visual confirmation that contaminated bed <b>bugs</b> transfer <b>dust</b> to untreated bed bugs in harborage. This result is important because bedbugs live in hard-to-reach places and interaction between conspecifics can be exploited for delivery and dissemination of management products directed at this public health pest...|$|R
50|$|The ship's payload bay {{containing}} its sub-probes, telescopes, {{and other}} equipment would be protected from the interstellar medium during transit by a beryllium disk, up to 7 mm thick, weighing up to 50 tonnes. This erosion shield would be made from beryllium due to its lightness and high latent heat of vaporisation. Larger obstacles that might be encountered while passing through the target system would be dispersed by an artificially generated cloud of particles, ejected by support vehicles called <b>dust</b> <b>bugs</b> about 200 km ahead of the vehicle. The spacecraft would carry a number of robot wardens capable of autonomously repairing damage or malfunctions.|$|R
