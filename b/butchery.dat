40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend in the {{consumption}} of animal products such as meat {{in the developing world}} especially due to a growing population, urbanization and rising incomes. This poses a risk of food borne illnesses from meat consumption due to poor sanitation and hygiene. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the sanitation and hygiene status of <b>butcheries</b> in Kampala district, Uganda. The study was cross-sectional in design and involved quantitative data collection methods. The study units were <b>butcheries</b> from which one respondent was randomly selected to answer the questionnaire. An observational checklist was used to assess the status of sanitation and hygiene of the <b>butcheries.</b> Data were entered and analysed in Epi Info 3. 5. 1 statistical software. A total of 73 <b>butcheries</b> were visited, 51 (69. 9 %) of which were permanent structures, 7 (9. 6 %) semi-permanent and 15 (20. 5 %) temporary. Observations revealed that 24 (32. 9 %) <b>butcheries</b> had cracked walls and 66 (90. 4 %) had damaged floors.

40|$|The {{purchasing}} {{and marketing}} of game meat by supermarkets and <b>butcheries</b> in the Western Cape Province of South Africa was researched by the survey method. Two supermarket groups in South Africa indicated that they do market game meat, and springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) was the species that most supermarkets sold. Both supermarket groups {{indicated that they would}} sell more game meat if available. They also mentioned that a central marketing structure would facilitate the sale of game meat and ensure consistent quality. Thirteen of the twenty <b>butcheries</b> that sell game meat were also in favour of a central marketing structure. The <b>butcheries</b> indicated that consumers are not adequately informed about the health benefits and cooking methods of game meat. Some of the meat buyers at <b>butcheries</b> were ignorant of the qualities of meat that are important when purchasing game meat. It is evident that game meat marketers should exercise stricter control over the quality of game meat, and that supermarkets and <b>butcheries</b> are not promoting game meat extensively enough.

5|$|In Novi, Virginia, a {{group of}} ex-convicts, led by Dr. Lisa Holland (Katy Boyer), meet and discuss atoning for their sins. Terry Pruit (Don Swayze) tells the others that, since he has {{discovered}} the group, he has made amends for his past. However, another member, Ed (Cyril O'Reilly), tells him that humans are unable to change {{and that they are}} both destined for hell. Ed's friend, Victor Potts (David Figlioli), tells Holland that he's been having nightmares involving people being skinned alive. That night, he has a vision of Ed skinned. Several hours later, Victor is murdered. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) asks John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to examine Potts' body. Reyes explains that, because Potts had a premonition of his death, the case is an X-File. Meanwhile, at a <b>butchery,</b> Terry and Ed get into an argument. Terry later has a vision—similar to Victor's—in which Ed is skinned alive. That night, he is attacked and brutally flayed.|$|E

At the same time, Scully {{contacts}} Dr. Bertram Mueller (George D. Wallace), a former medical examiner who autopsied several bodies in the 1960s that were skinned {{in a manner similar}} to Potts. Mueller tells Scully that the sheriff at the time did not pay much attention to the cases, emphasizing that there was more than one victim, and that he later killed himself. Reyes and Doggett receive news of Terry's attack and arrive at the local <b>butchery</b> to find him strung up among the pigs. While looking around the crime scene, Doggett discovers that Terry is still alive; Terry weakly says Ed's name. Doggett and the local police arrest Ed, who claims that he is innocent. Reyes believes him and admits that she too is having similar visions. Ed is freed, but not before having a vision in which Dr. Holland is skinned. In the meantime, Scully discovers that Potts and Terry were both born on the same day that two of the 1960s murder victims died.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the closure}} of the Lesotho {{abattoir}} in 2003, only imported meat can be legally sold. However, it was estimated in 2007 that 80 % of the meat sold at <b>butcheries</b> comes from informal slaughter. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the situation. The number and location of informal <b>butcheries</b> in Lesotho (n = 143) were recorded and mapped using Geographical Information Systems. Observations (photographs) of informal slaughter indicated a lack of hygiene, unskilled slaughtermen and illegal disposal of offal with possible environmental pollution. In addition, a cross-sectional study was undertaken to determine the microbiological quality of meat from randomly selected carcasses (n = 237) of cattle, sheep and pigs from a sample of 44 <b>butcheries,</b> 4 of which were associated with registered supermarkets. As a control, samples for microbiological assay were taken from imported meat originating from carcasses (n = 20) slaughtered at a registered abattoir in South Africa. Of the 44 <b>butcheries</b> investigated only the 4 commercial <b>butcheries</b> associated with supermarkets sold imported meat only; 3 <b>butcheries</b> sold meat inspected at government slaughter slabs (n = 3), while the rest (n = 37) sold both imported and informally slaughtered meat. In terms of Lesotho legislation, informally slaughtered meat is only for home consumption. The bacteriological counts from all samples showed a total bacterial plate count exceeding 30 organisms per mℓ in contrast with the controls which all showed a count less than 5 colonies per mℓ. This was found for both imported and informally slaughtered meat sold in Lesotho. In addition, meat samples from <b>butcheries</b> showed the presence of the potential pathogens Salmonella (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 12) and Escherichia coli (n= 15). During the study, anthrax was confirmed in 9 human patients, 5 of whom died, after consumption of informally slaughtered livestock. Although no cases of animal abuse were detected, it was considered that informal slaughter can prejudice livestock welfare. It was concluded that the current situation is not acceptable in terms of meat safety. Thus, the Veterinary Public Health Directorate of the National Veterinary Services has prioritised the monitoring of butchers, registration of slaughter slabs and a general extension campaign to improve hygiene and animal welfare standards for slaughter in Lesotho.

40|$|Food-borne {{diseases}} such as salmonellosis are {{a major cause of}} human gastroenteritis worldwide, especially in the developing world due to poor sanitary conditions. Flies feed on food and breed in feces and other organic material. As such they are known vectors of Salmonella spp. Given that pork consumption in Uganda is rapidly increasing while good food safety practices remain absent, this study aims to assess the occurrence of Salmonella spp. in pork <b>butcheries</b> as a contribution to improve hygiene. Seventy-seven pork <b>butcheries</b> out of 179 mapped in a previous survey in Kampala were randomly selected. From June–October 2014, samples of house flies, foodstuff and equipment were collected from all <b>butcheries.</b> Cultural isolation of Salmonella spp. was performed according to ISO 6579 : 2002. Among 693 samples, 64 (9 %) tested positive for Salmonella enteritidis. Among the positives, 32 % were samples of raw pork (25), 25 % flies’ midguts (19), less than 9 % water (7), tomatoes (6), cabbage (4), onions (2) and one case on roasted pork 1, respectively. Positive flies coincided with contaminated foodstuff in 29 % of the <b>butcheries.</b> All 154 samples from either butchers’ hands or their equipment were negative for Salmonella spp. The prevalence of S. enteritidis, especially on raw pork and in flies, illustrates the need for improving food safety in pork <b>butcheries.</b> Further research is required clarifying the gaps; especially the role of flies as microbiological carriers. In this context investigations are ongoing to identify Salmonella serotypes and their antimicrobial drug-resistance situation. However, these findings merit increased attention and can be used to improve knowledge, attitudes and practices amongst butchers. The research was carried out with the financial support of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), Germany, and the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health, led by the International Food Policy Research Institute, through the Safe Food, Fair Food project at ILRI.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the rabbit meat marketing system in the Tizi-Ouzou area. To meet this objective the descriptive survey method was employed, using a structured questionnaire to provide data on commercialization of rabbit meat. <b>Butcheries</b> (n= 192 representing 67. 3 % of the total <b>butcheries),</b> poulterers (n= 49 representing 30. 6 % of the total poulterers), restaurants (n= 184 representing 43. 4 % of the total ones) and hotels (n= 11 representing 25. 5 % of the total ones) were concerned. Rabbit meat is sold in 8. 48 % (n= 37) of stores visited and do not sold in 91. 51 % (n= 399) ones. It’s marketed more cooked (restaurants and hotels) than fresh (<b>butcheries</b> and poulterers). 75. 44 % of respondents who do not sell rabbit meat justifies it by the lack of demand and 10. 78 % (n= 43) because of its unavailability. Rabbits are bought from producers generally as whole carcasses (86. 49 %) of about 1. 4 kg for an average price of 312. 16 DA per kg (1 U$= 85 DA). In the <b>butcheries</b> and poulterers, rabbit meat is sold to consumers at an average price of 470 DA. 44. 56 kg of rabbit meat are sold per week. Although the local demand continues to increase, the marketing for rabbit meat in Tizi-Ouzou stays neglected. The marketing is fragmented, inefficient so the distribution chain of this meat is disorganized. This inefficient marketing system has resulted in higher costs and lo...|$|R
