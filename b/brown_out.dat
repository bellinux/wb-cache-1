5|$|With Otto Graham {{and most}} of the other {{original}} Browns in retirement, by 1957 the team was struggling to replenish its ranks. In the first round of that year's draft, Cleveland took fullback Jim <b>Brown</b> <b>out</b> of Syracuse University. In his first season, Brown led the NFL with 942yards of rushing and was voted rookie of the year in a United Press poll. Cleveland finished 9–2–1 and again advanced to the championship game against Detroit. The Lions dominated the game, forcing six turnovers and allowing only 112yards passing in a 59–14 rout.|$|E
5|$|With Graham {{gone and}} the quarterback {{situation}} in flux, the Browns ended 1956 with a 5–7 record, Paul Brown's first losing season as a professional coach. In the next year's draft, the team selected Jim <b>Brown</b> <b>out</b> of Syracuse University. As television began to help football leapfrog baseball as America's most popular sport, Jim Brown became a larger-than-life personality. He was handsome and charismatic in private and dominant on the field. Paul Brown, however, was critical of some aspects of Jim Brown's game, including his disinclination to block. In Jim Brown's first season, the team reached the championship game, again against the Lions, but lost 59–14. The Browns did not contend for the championship in the following two years, when a Baltimore Colts team coached by Brown's former protege Weeb Ewbank won a pair of titles.|$|E
5|$|Loxton then {{played in}} each of Australia’s four {{remaining}} tour games before the Tests, {{but was unable to}} do enough to force his way into the first-choice team. He made 39 and 52 against Lancashire, and 16 against Nottinghamshire, squandering his starts in the latter two innings to run outs. In the match against Hampshire, he made one in his only innings after Australia were caught on a damp pitch and took a solitary wicket. The Australian team's batting depth did not help Loxton’s cause; in the final pre-Test match against Sussex, a match won by an innings and 325 runs, he was slated to bat at No. 9, but Australia’s earlier batsmen were largely untroubled so Bradman declared at 5/549. The all-rounder’s 3/13 in the first innings had the effect of removing him from the bowling line-up {{for the rest of the}} match, as Doug Ring, Ernie Toshack, Ron Hamence and Ian Johnson helped Ray Lindwall to bowl the touring team to an easy victory. Loxton had limited opportunities as those ahead of him tended to finish off the opposition before his turn, and did not score heavily enough when he had a chance, so he was overlooked for the First Test at Trent Bridge. Bradman again opted to use <b>Brown</b> <b>out</b> of position in the middle-order as Australia took an eight-wicket win.|$|E

5|$|The injured all-rounder missed two matches {{to recuperate}} before reappearing in mid-May, hitting 120 as the Australians posted {{a total of}} 721 against Essex {{in a single day}} at Southend, still the highest single day's total in {{first-class}} cricket. He put on 166 in 65 minutes with Ron Saggers, who, with Bill Brown and Donald Bradman, also scored centuries. Loxton's rapid innings was noted for its hooking and driving and took around 80 minutes. He followed up with an unbeaten 79 and two wickets in the match against Oxford University, but that failed to win him a place in the first set-piece battle of the summer, against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full-strength Test outfit, while Australia fielded their strongest XI, so the fixture was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Bradman opted to play <b>Brown</b> <b>out</b> of the position in the middle-order, and Loxton missed out; Australia went on to win by an innings.|$|E
25|$|In 1957's draft, however, Cleveland took fullback Jim <b>Brown</b> <b>out</b> of Syracuse University in {{the first}} round. In his first season, Brown was the NFL's leading rusher with 942 yards in a 12-game regular season and was voted {{rookie of the year}} in a United Press poll. Led by Brown's running and quarterback Tommy O'Connell's passing, Cleveland {{finished}} 9–2–1 and again advanced to the championship game against Detroit, but the Lions dominated the game, forcing six turnovers and allowing only 112 yards passing in a 59–14 rout, Detroit's last league championship to date.|$|E
25|$|Brown was {{extremely}} popular {{in his home}} of San Francisco, though less so {{in the rest of}} the state. Nevertheless, he wielded great control over statewide legislative affairs and political appointments, making it difficult for his conservative opponents to assail his power. Partially to remove Brown from his leadership position, a state constitutional amendment initiative was proposed and passed by the electorate in 1990, imposing term limits on state legislators. Brown became the focus of the initiative. Brown raised just under US$1million to defeat the initiative. The California Legislature challenged the law but it was upheld by the courts. California Proposition 140 also cut the legislature's staff budget by 30 percent, causing Brown to reduce legislative staff by at least 600. After term limits forced <b>Brown</b> <b>out</b> of office, the Assembly re-structured its rules to give most of the powers formerly held by the Speaker to a leadership committee made up of senior members of both major parties.|$|E

2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{inside the}} house suddenly turned ugly when Dillon asked the teenagers what they felt about the LVF killing of UVF Mid-Ulster brigadier Richard Jameson, {{who had been a}} successful businessman and was extremely popular in the Portadown area. McIlwaine remained silent, however Robb had replied [...] "so fucking what, it's got fuck all to do with me" [...] which Dillon had taken exception to. When he informed Robb that Jameson had been his good friend, Robb had made further disparaging comments which also angered Brown. <b>Brown,</b> <b>out</b> of earshot of the teenagers, had decided to assault Robb in retaliation, saying he would [...] "punch the head off Andrew". Neither Robb nor McIlwaine {{had been a member of}} any loyalist paramilitary organisation, although Robb had tenuous links to the LVF having been an associate of Billy Wright, and even photographed in 1996 at a march led by Wright. Writers Henry McDonald and Ian S. Wood alleged that, unknown to the teenagers, a UVF unit had gone to [...] "The Spot" [...] to seek out two known LVF individuals rumoured to have been involved in Jameson's killing; however, they had already left the nightclub by the time the UVF arrived. The UVF men encountered Robb and McIlwaine instead, and targeted them as LVF members implicated in Jameson's death.|$|E

[...] "I could tell you something {{you would like to}} know," [...] Cornelius mumbled crossly. Brown paid no attention. [...] "You did not kill him," [...] went on the other, [...] "and what do you get for it? You might have had money from the Rajah, besides the loot of all the Bugis houses, and now you get nothing." [...] "You had better clear out from here," [...] growled Brown, without even looking at him. But Cornelius let himself drop by his side and began to whisper very fast, touching his elbow from time to time. What he had to say made Brown sit up at first, with a curse. He had simply informed him of Dain Waris's armed party down the river. At first Brown saw himself completely sold and betrayed, but a moment's reflection convinced him that there could be no treachery intended. He said nothing, and after a while Cornelius remarked, in a tone of complete indifference, that there was another way out of the river which he knew very well. [...] "A good thing to know, too," [...] said Brown, pricking up his ears; and Cornelius began to talk of what went on in town and repeated all that had been said in council, gossiping in an even undertone at Brown's ear as you talk amongst sleeping men you do not wish to wake. [...] "He thinks he has made me harmless, does he?" [...] mumbled Brown very low. [...] "Yes. He is a fool. A little child. He came here and robbed me," [...] droned on Cornelius, [...] "and he made all the people believe him. But if something happened that they did not believe him any more, where would he be? And the Bugis Dain who is waiting for you down the river there, captain, is the very man who chased you up here when you first came." [...] Brown observed nonchalantly that it would be just as well to avoid him, and with the same detached, musing air Cornelius declared himself acquainted with a backwater broad enough to take Brown's boat past Waris's camp. [...] "You will have to be quiet," [...] he said as an afterthought, [...] "for in one place we pass close behind his camp. Very close. They are camped ashore with their boats hauled up." [...] "Oh, we know how to be as quiet as mice; never fear," [...] said Brown. Cornelius stipulated that in case he were to pilot <b>Brown</b> <b>out,</b> his canoe should be towed. [...] "I'll have to get back quick," [...] he explained.|$|E
