5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by {{pulverised}} <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal.</b> Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall.

The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, 15 {{years of}} {{explosive}} development began {{under the leadership}} of Collis P. Huntington, whose new Peninsula Extension of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway from Richmond opened up transportation along the Peninsula and provided a new pathway for the railroad to bring West Virginia <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> to port for coastal shipping and worldwide export. With the new railroad came a terminal and coal piers where the colliers were loaded. Within a few years, Huntington and his associates also built a large shipyard. In 1896, the new incorporated town of Newport News, which had briefly replaced Denbigh as the county seat of Warwick County, had a population of 9,000. In 1958, by mutual consent by referendum, Newport News was consolidated with the former Warwick County (itself a separate city from 1952 to 1958), rejoining the two localities to approximately their pre-1896 geographic size. The more widely known name of Newport News was selected as they formed what was then Virginia's third largest independent city in population.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was long}} thought that the Chinese had {{developed}} the blast furnace and cast iron as their first method of iron production, Donald Wagner (the author of the above referenced study) has published a more recent paper that supersedes some of the statements in the earlier work; the newer paper still places {{the date of the}} first cast-iron artifacts at the 5th and 4th centuries BC, but also provides evidence of earlier bloomery furnace use, which migrated from China to Western parts and Central Asia during the beginning of the Chinese Bronze Age of the late Longshan culture (2000BC). He suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China (221BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties. By the 11th century AD, the Song Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a remarkable switch of resources from charcoal to <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.|$|E
40|$|To use widespreadly {{the waste}} of coals and oils {{processing}} in the great and the small-scale power generation, the key parameter, which is sectional constancy of promising organic coal-water fuels (OCWF), was studied.

40|$|A new use for Illinois coal is as fuel {{injected}} into a blast furnace to produce molten iron as {{first step in}} steel production. Because of cost and decreasing availability, metallurgical coke is being replaced by coal injected at the tuyere area of the furnace where the blast air enters. Purpose {{of this study is}} to evaluate combustion of Illinois coal in the blast furnace injection process in a pilot plant test facility. (Limited research to date suggests that coals of low fluidity and moderate to high S and Cl contents are suitable for blast furnace injection.) This proposal is intended to complete the study under way with Armco and Inland and to demonstrate quantitatively the suitability of Herrin No. 6 and Springfield No. 5 coals for injection. Main feature of current work is testing of Illinois coals at CANMET`s pilot plant coal combustion facility. During this quarter, two additional 300 -pound samples of coal (IBCSP- 110 Springfield No. 5 and an Appalachian coal) were delivered.

The three coals were combustion tested in the Penn State ""plane flame furnace'' to determine ignition and burning characteristics. All three coals burned well to completion as: raw coals, chlorinolysis processed coals, and hydrodesulfurized coals.
