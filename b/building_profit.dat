30|$|In conclusion, {{scholars}} or enterprise {{professionals in}} foreign countries have made few studies on metro enterprise profit model, more have analyzed strategies or effects of rail transit. Among existing domestic research, we found many articles discussing reasons for deficit in metro enterprises and the profit-generating process from different perspectives by Chinese scholars and enterprise professionals, which served {{as a foundation for}} <b>building</b> <b>profit</b> model as well as for further studies. Yet most of them put forward some ideas or specific implementation measures based on a sole aspect or single theory, without presenting whole framework of and a logical coherence to metro enterprise profit model. Hence, {{on the basis of the}} above literature research and combining the metro industry’s attributes, this article offers an in-depth exploration on the mechanism theories and implemental methods to build all-inclusive metro profit model. The extensive and comprehensive systematic study strives to contribute to the sound development of metro systems.|$|E
40|$|The {{customer}} value {{in terms of}} satisfaction {{is one of the}} indicators for <b>building</b> <b>profit</b> oriented strategies in a firm. The {{customer value}} concepts may be applied by the firms to evaluate the product performance in the given market and determine the approach for competitive advantage. The framework for measuring the customer values discussed in this paper provides analytical dimensions for establishing the long run customer relationship by the firm and to optimize its profit levels. The model discussed in the paper analyzes how external factors like a change in consumer interests and competitiveness affect the relationship between customer satisfaction and profit in a firm. The model discussed in the paper in relation to customer choice under difference value determinants offer more general understanding of why consumers, although purchasing essentially similar products. 2 In recognizing the need to contribute {{research in the area of}} customer value measurement and the concept of customer satisfaction leading towards creating the customer value, the study aims at developing a methodological construct to measure the customer value for new product...|$|E
30|$|Some {{scholars}} {{affirm that}} the main reason of difficulty in profit earning from metro sector is {{from the fact that}} the agents in the transaction cannot profit from the positive externalities. Thus, how to obtain returns for the positive externalities has become the core focus in <b>building</b> <b>profit</b> models. Two feasible methods proposed by Miao et al. [5] include government subsidies and authorization of property development rights to rail transit enterprises. The “metro operation[*]+[*]benefit return” profit model was put forward by Zhang et al. [6] where the former represented operation on metro lines and ancillary resources and the latter includes return of value-added benefit from real estate properties along the metro line. The development benefits from this model are increased by Zhang et al. [7] through cooperation with a real estate developer brand. Liu [8] identified three fundamental aspects, i.e., overall control of property operations along rail transit lines, interactive land development combined with construction of rail stations, and integrated connections with conventional bus transport. Likewise, Xue et al. [9] proposed that the integrated approach for profit models promotes benign development in urban rail transit. Song et al. [10] formed a later compensation mode for existing lines that is mainly subsidized by government and supplemented with property development, whereas an advanced compensation mode for new line projects includes integrated development on land resources and planned resources. Cooperation and a new approach between the informal and formal actors are crucial to generate profit in order to continue increasing the aggregate benefits of society.|$|E

50|$|The Mayo Brothers, who had {{established}} a thriving furniture business in 1904, had already moved to a larger rented building on Main Street in 1906, then decided they needed still more space, which they began constructing at 420 South Main in 1909. They used half the space for their own business and rented {{the rest of the}} building as offices for oil companies. As the demand for office space increased, the Mayos built an identical five story building at 418 South Main in 1914.

40|$|We propose in {{this paper}} a theory of urban decay. Following a {{negative}} real estate demand shock, property managers optimally suspend maintenance and the probability that they ever restart can be modest. Because maintenance expenditures are proportionately less risky than are the incremental <b>building</b> <b>profits</b> they generate, managers impose a more demanding profit standard on maintenance than on the initial investment. This differential in profit standards means that rather than maintain existing investments, property managers favor new investments, which, if marginally acceptable, they also leave unmaintained. Contractually required maintenance, (e. g., for publicly subsidized real estate investments), increases the minimum profit for the initial investment acceptance and discourages subsidized real estate investments in favor of unsubsidized investments. However, the required profit for acceptance of a permanently maintained investment is below the profit boundary for maintenance if maintenance is not contractually required. Consequently, the subsidy that induces the investment is least expensive if maintenance is not required, more expensive if maintenance is permanently required, and most expensive if maintenance is induced immediately after initial construction, but thereafter, is {{at the discretion of}} the manager.

40|$|In {{the world}} of {{contemporary}} sport it is commonly claimed that at its elite end at least, sport's management is complex because the product it delivers to participants and fans is so idiosyncratic. This claim is accompanied by the view that while professional sport is in large part just another form of business, it has a range of special features that demand a customised set of practices to ensure its effective operation. This article aims to re-examine this view {{in the light of}} sport's commercial and socio-cultural developments over the last decade. It initially proposes that while both business and sport are concerned with widening market share, <b>building</b> <b>profits,</b> and strengthening brands, the presumption that sport has a monopoly over the delivery of intense emotional experiences, tribal belonging, and strong interpersonal relationships, is difficult to defend. The article concludes that while sport's economic and social progress has created an industry that is built around complex bureaucracies that turn over many thousands of millions of dollars every year, it has also created a more diverse and heterogeneous system of structures and experiences that are difficult to conflate to a handful of neat special features. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{show how}} {{rate-distortion}} theory provides {{a mechanism for}} automated theory building by naturally distinguishing between regularity and randomness. We start from the simple principle that model variables should, as much as possible, render the future and past conditionally independent. From this, we construct an objective function for model making whose extrema embody the trade-off between a model's structural complexity and its predictive power. The solutions correspond to a hierarchy of models that, at each level of complexity, achieve optimal predictive power at minimal cost. In the limit of maximal prediction the resulting optimal model identifies a process's intrinsic organization by extracting the underlying causal states. In this limit, the model's complexity is given by the statistical complexity, which {{is known to be}} minimal for achieving maximum prediction. Examples show how theory <b>building</b> can <b>profit</b> from analyzing a process's causal compressibility, which is reflected in the optimal models' rate-distortion curve [...] the process's characteristic for optimally balancing structure and noise at different levels of representation.

Therefore, the capital owners are the main winners of the internal devaluation (in the short-run, namely, because there is no long-run winners of the internal devaluation), but the general welfare is stagnating or even decreasing because of the smaller income per hour and because of wasted human capital that is used inefficiently in the companies that are <b>building</b> its <b>profit</b> margin on the low cost worforce and not by the use of technologies.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{awareness}} and Modern Architecture need {{not to be}} reciprocally exclusive, {{as shown in the}} present paper. Evidence is searched for in the temperate zone of Brazil, which represents a particular challenge to architects. This paper presents five representative houses designed between 1930 and 1965 by the first generation of architects with an academic background in Curitiba. It is true that the Modern Movement is negatively seen in terms of passive architecture. Nevertheless, at its beginning, climate awareness was present, and it can be demonstrated in rather correct choices regarding envelope design and thermal zoning. Besides, there was an exemplary attitude of rationality in the solution of problems in a particular, regional context. Therefore, the Modern Movement in Brazil can be described not specifically as aware of climate, but (to some extent) aware of architecture itself as a cultural achievement. Thus, the improvement of the general performance of <b>buildings</b> could <b>profit</b> from a deeper understanding of history: it should investigate what was the spirit of the Modern Movement, and what (international, post-modern or simply global) influences were responsible for the almost ubiquitous and often regrettable reality of architecture as a commodity...|$|R

Brickell City Centre closed the Eighth Street Station in 2014 to renovate and incorporate it into their project; Miami Worldcenter may incorporate both the Freedom Tower and Park West stations, {{in addition to a}} possible connection to All Aboard Florida's MiamiCentral station. This dense downtown development cannot be considered exclusive transit-oriented development, however, as many locations throughout the region have many high-rise and other large buildings without permanent transit infrastructure. It is more a reflection of zoning allowance; the current Miami 21 zoning code in the city of Miami lends itself to larger development, with densities up to 1,000 units per acre, and taller buildings downtown or in transit corridors, though it also sets strict and controversial parking space minimums. In addition, public transit is not considered a priority to the many high-income condo buyers, who often seek ample parking; despite this, proximity to transit if often included in the marketing of these towers. In contrast to traditional transit-oriented development, much of the real estate {{is a far cry from}} affordable housing geared toward lower and middle income residents. Real estate developers are generally required to pay high impact fees for these large <b>buildings,</b> the <b>profits</b> of which are intended to go to public infrastructure such as schools and transportation.
