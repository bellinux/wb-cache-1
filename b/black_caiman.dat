5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the <b>black</b> <b>caiman,</b> the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E
5|$|The {{species can}} hunt singly, in pairs, and in groups, relying on sharp {{eyesight}} to locate prey. In some cases, supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental, {{a result of}} group members fishing individually in close proximity; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter, such as with small anacondas and juvenile <b>black</b> <b>caiman.</b> The giant otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water. Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous, with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets. The otter can attack from both above and below, swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws. Giant otters catch their own food and consume it immediately; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head. Carter and Rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10% of their body weight daily—about , in keeping with findings in the wild.|$|E
25|$|Other aquatic and {{amphibian}} animals {{found in}} Brazil include the pink dolphin (the world's largest river dolphin), the caimans (such as the <b>black</b> <b>caiman),</b> and the pirarucu (one of the world's largest river fish). Also familiar are the brightly colored poison dart frogs.|$|E
50|$|There is a touristic hike {{from the}} river Madre de Dios to the lake. On the way if you're lucky, you might see parrots, macaws and some other species from the rain forest. The lake is also known for having <b>black</b> <b>caimans</b> and giant otters.|$|R
25|$|Many {{widespread}} Amazonian {{mammals and}} reptiles {{find a home}} in this region. These include tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), jaguars (Panthera onca), the world’s largest living rodents, capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), kinkajous (Potos flavus), and white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari). Some of the globally threatened animals found in this region include <b>black</b> <b>caimans</b> (Melanosuchus niger) and spectacled caimans (Caiman crocodilus crocodilus), woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha), giant otters (Pteronura brasiliensis), giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), and ocelots (Leopardus pardalis).|$|R
5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of <b>black</b> <b>caimans</b> in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|R
25|$|The {{rainforest}} contains {{several species}} that can pose a hazard. Among the largest predatory creatures are the <b>black</b> <b>caiman,</b> jaguar, cougar, and anaconda. In the river, electric eels can produce an electric shock that can stun or kill, while piranha {{are known to}} bite and injure humans. Various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh. There are also numerous parasites and disease vectors. Vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus. Malaria, yellow fever and Dengue fever can also be contracted in the Amazon region.|$|E
500|$|The American {{alligator}} is {{a relatively}} large species of crocodilian. On average {{it is the second}} largest species in the Alligatoridae family, behind only the <b>black</b> <b>caiman.</b> As with all crocodilians, and as opposed to many mammals where size eventually diminishes with old age, healthy American alligators may continue to expand throughout their lives and the oldest specimens are the largest. Very old, large male American alligators reach an expected maximum size of up to [...] in length, weighing up to , while females reach a maximum of [...] On rare occasions, a large, old male may grow to an even greater length. During the 19th and 20th centuries, larger males reaching [...] have been reported. The largest reported individual size was a male killed in 1890 on Marsh Island, Louisiana, and reportedly measured at [...] in length, but no voucher specimen was available, since the American alligator was left on a muddy bank after having been measured due to having been too massive to relocate. If the size of this animal were correct, it would have weighed approximately [...] Large adult American alligators tend to be relatively robust and bulky compared to other similarly length crocodilians, for example captive males measuring [...] were found to weigh [...] (although captive specimens may outweigh wild specimens due to lack of hunting behavior and other stressors).

The largest American alligator scientifically verified in Florida for the period from 1977 to 1993 was reportedly [...] and weighed , although another specimen (size estimated from skull) may have measured [...]|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> is {{structurally}} dissimilar {{to other}} caiman species, {{particularly in the}} shape of the skull. Compared to other caimans, it has distinctly larger eyes. Although the snout is relatively narrow, the skull (given the species' considerably larger size) is much larger overall than other caimans. <b>Black</b> <b>caiman</b> are relatively more robust than other crocodilians of comparable length. For example, a 3.9 m adult was found to have a considerably heavier and longer skull than a 4.8 m Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). Young <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> can be distinguished from large spectacled caiman by their proportionately larger head, as well as by the colour of the jaw, which is light coloured in the Spectacled caiman and dark with three black spots in the <b>black</b> <b>caiman.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Orinoco {{crocodile}} {{ranks among}} the largest living reptiles, {{as well as the}} largest predator in the Americas. Typically, males are 3.6 to 4.8 m in length, weighing 380 to 635 kg, while females are typically 3.0 to 3.3 m in length, weighing 225 to 317 kg. The largest specimen reported was shot in 1800, and allegedly measured at 6.6 m, although the source is considered reliable, unfortunately, no voucher specimen is known from this. Due to extensive hunting for their skins in the 20th century, such giants do not exist today, and modern Orinoco crocodiles have not been reported to exceed 5.1 m in length. Merchán listed the maximum total length attainable for a male as 5.2 m and the maximum length of a female as 3.6 m. According to Guinness Records, the average length of adults {{that they were able to}} examine was only 3 m and the largest specimen found firsthand was 4.2 m. It is arguably the largest crocodilian in the Americas, while American crocodiles and <b>black</b> <b>caimans</b> approach similar dimensions, on average the Orinoco crocodile is slightly longer.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{overhunting}} in the 20th century, other crocodilians {{may have}} also approached or exceeded 6.1 m, such sizes being somewhat reliably reported in gharials and Orinoco crocodiles in very old reports before both species were decimated by hunting and habitat destruction and reported but unverified in <b>black</b> <b>caimans</b> and American crocodiles (although voucher skulls from the latter species show it does likely exceed such lengths in very rare cases). However, the Nile crocodile is the only modern crocodilian besides the saltwater crocodile where specimens over 4.5 m are merely uncommon rather than rare. As a whole, giants are rarer today; before the heavy hunting of the 1940s and 1950s, a larger population base and more extensive wetland habitats meant more giants, as well as possibly diminishing of the genetic lines that fostered enormous sizes. Following {{is a list of}} Nile crocodile specimens reportedly taken since 1900 that exceed 5.5 m, well past the [...] "expected" [...] length for a Nile crocodile. The list includes only crocodiles that have been [...] "measured", thus excluding outsized crocodiles that were merely based on eye-witness accounts. The only exception is [...] "Gustave", a male crocodile mentioned due to his notoriety.|$|R
2500|$|The bank {{is home to}} 14 {{species of}} the 23 crocodilian species living across the world, {{two of which are}} listed by the IUCN as {{critically}} endangered and three more as threatened. The 14 crocodile species available in the bank are mugger (Crocodylus palustris), salt-water crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), tomistoma (Tomistoma schlegelii), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus Moreletii), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), West African dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis), Australian fresh water crocodile (Crocodylus Johnsoni), African slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistops cataphractus), dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus), yacare caiman (Caiman yacare), Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and the endangered Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis). The bank currently houses over 2,400 crocodiles and also many species of turtles, snakes, and lizards which are viewable by the public. The bank houses 12 endangered species of turtles and tortoises and 5 species of snakes, including king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), Asian water monitors (Varanus salvator salvator), two species of pythons, and albino cobras. Of the 5,000 reptiles bred at the bank, 3,000 represent the native Indian species Crocodylus palustris, known as muggers. One of the biggest attractions of the park is a fierce salt-water crocodile known as Jaws III. This species, believed to be the biggest in southern Asia, is [...] long and weighs over a ton. The bank is also going to get four new species of crocodiles. These are <b>black</b> <b>caimans,</b> smooth-fronted caimans, Cuban crocodiles and broad-snouted caimans. Anacondas will also appear at the bank. Since April, 2016 four Komodo dragons - three male, one female - {{have been added to the}} list of exhibits. The dragons were acquired from Bronx Zoo in New York.|$|R

50|$|The park {{contains}} some 20,000 plant species, at least 600 bird species, and 174 species of mammals, 100 reptiles and amphibians, 232 fish and 1,300 butterfly. Rare species include the giant otter, spectacled bear, <b>black</b> <b>caiman,</b> marsh deer, and the maned wolf.|$|E
50|$|They are {{relatively}} small sized crocodilians, with an average maximum weight of 6 to 40 kg depending on species, {{with the exception of}} the <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> (Melanosuchus niger), which can grow more than 5 m in length and weigh up to 1100 kg. The <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> is the largest caiman species in the world and is found in the slow-moving rivers and lakes that surround the Amazon basin. The smallest species is the Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus), which grows to 1.2 to 1.5 m long. There are six different species of caiman found throughout the watery, jungle habitats of Central and Southern America. The average length for most of the other caiman species is about 2 to 2.5 m long.|$|E
50|$|Humans hunt black caimans for leather or meat. This {{species was}} {{classified}} as Endangered in the 1970s due to the high demand for its well-marked skin. The trade in <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> leather peaked from the 1950s to 1970s, when the smaller but much more common spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) became the more commonly hunted species. Local people still trade <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> skins and meat today at a small scale but the species has rebounded overall from the overhunting in the past. The fact that black caimans lay, on average, around 40 eggs has helped them recover to some degree. Perhaps an equal continuing threat is habitat destruction, since development and clear-cutting is now epidemic in South America. Spectacled caimans have now filled the niche of crocodilian predator of fish in many areas. Due to their greater numbers and faster reproductive abilities, the Spectacled populations are locally outcompeting black caimans, although the larger species dominates in a one-on-one basis. Persistent management is needed to control caiman-hunting and is quite difficult to enforce effectively. After the depletion of the <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> population, piranhas and capybaras, having lost perhaps their primary predator, reached unnaturally high numbers. This has, in turn, led to increased agricultural and livestock losses.|$|E

50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} extant reptiles. It is the largest {{predator}} in the Amazon basin and possibly the largest member of the family Alligatoridae. Most adult black caimans are 2.8 to(-) 4.26 m in length, with a few old males growing larger than 5 m and exceeding a weight of 400 kg. Sub-adult male specimens of around 2.5 - 3.35 m will weigh roughly 95 - 100 kg, around the same size as a mature female, but will quickly increase in bulk and weight. Mid-sized mature males of 3.5 - 4 m weigh approximately 300 kg. Another sampling of subadult males found them to range in length from 2.1 to 2.8 m, averaging 2.45 m, and that they weighed from 26 to 86 kg, averaging 48 kg. The <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> broadly overlaps in size with the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), although it is on average larger at maturity. In some areas (such as the Araguaia River) this species is consistently reported at 4 to(-) 5 m in length, much larger than the alligator (which rarely even reaches 4 meters), although specimens this size are uncommon. Several widely reported but unconfirmed (and probably largely anecdotal) sources report that the <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> can grow to over 6 m in length and weigh up to 1100 kg. In South America, two other crocodilians reportedly reach similar sizes: the American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and the Orinoco Crocodile (C. intermedius).|$|E
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>caiman</b> are apex predators with a generalist diet, and {{can take}} {{virtually}} any terrestrial and riparian animal found throughout their range. Similar to other large crocodilians, <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> have even been observed catching and eating smaller species, such as the spectacled caiman and sometimes cannibalizing smaller individuals of their own kind. Hatchlings mostly eat small fish, frogs, and invertebrates such as crustaceans and insects, but with time and size graduate to eating larger fish, including piranhas, catfish, and perch, which remain a significant food source for all <b>black</b> <b>caiman.</b> Dietary {{studies have focused on}} young caimans (due both to their often being more common than large adults and to their being easier to handle), the largest specimen examined for stomach contents in one study being only 1.54 m notably under sexually mature size, which is at a minimum 2 m in smaller females. Although diverse prey is known to be captured by young black caimans, dietary studies have shown snails often dominate the diet of young caiman, followed by quite small fish. Various prey will be taken by availability, includes snakes, turtles, birds and mammals, the latter two mainly when they come to drink at the river banks. Mammalian prey mostly include common Amazonian species such as various monkeys, sloths, armadillos, pacas, agoutis, coatis, and capybaras. Larger specimens can virtually take any South American terrestrial or riparian vertebrate unfortunate enough to encounter them. Large prey can include other species of caiman, deer, peccaries, tapirs, anacondas, giant otters, and domestic animals including pigs, cattle, horses and dogs. Although rare fatal attacks on cougars or even jaguars have been reported, very little evidence exists of such predation, and cats are likely to avoid ponds with black caimans. Where capybara and white-lipped peccary herds are common, they are reportedly among the most common prey item for large adults. Evidence has suggested fairly large river turtles can be counted among the prey of adult <b>black</b> <b>caiman,</b> the bite force of which is apparently sufficient to shatter a turtle shell. Scars on Amazon river dolphins suggest they may occasionally be attacked by black caimans. Compared to the smaller caiman species, the <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> more often hunts terrestrially at night, using its acute hearing and sight. As with all crocodilian species, their teeth are designed to grab but not chew, so they generally try to swallow their food whole after drowning or crushing it. Large prey that cannot be swallowed whole are often stored so the flesh will rot enough to allow the caiman to take bites out of the flesh.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a large}} {{diversity}} of birds and reptiles such as the <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> (Melansosuchus niger). It {{is also home to}} several endangered species such as the jaguar (Panther onca) and the giant otter (Pteronura brasuliensis). This is also a site of the pink river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), endangered by being used as bait in fishing for mota fish (Calophysus macropterus), despite such practices being illegal.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{studies at}} Cocha Cashu {{centered}} on the <b>black</b> <b>caiman</b> (Melanosuchus niger), and thus {{this is the only}} species of herpetofauna thoroughly studied (as of 1990). It is thought, however, that the makeup herp communities might be very similar in Manu to that of other areas along the western Amazon Basin.
