2500|$|<b>The</b> Priory Church <b>of</b> St Mary, Abergavenny, {{formerly}} held a 15th-century composition, described [...] by Thomas Churchyard in 1587 as [...] "a {{most famous}} worke in maner of a genealogie <b>of</b> Kings, called <b>the</b> roote <b>of</b> Jesse". By this date {{it had been}} destroyed during the Reformation, but what survives is the larger than life-sized recumbent figure of Jesse himself, carved from {{a single piece of}} oak. It has been described by Andrew Graham-Dixon as [...] "the most impressive wood carving to have escaped <b>the</b> <b>bonfires</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reformation in Wales"; and by Phillip Lindley as [...] "without doubt one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finest pieces <b>of</b> fifteenth-century wood sculpture remaining in England or Wales". It is unclear what form <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree originally took, but in 2016 a new stained-glass Jesse window designed by Helen Whittaker was installed in the church, incorporating the wooden Jesse at its foot.|$|R

25|$|Henrietta Maria {{paused for}} a period at York, where she was entertained in some style by the Earl of Newcastle. Henrietta Maria took the {{opportunity}} to discuss the situation north of the border with Royalist Scots, promoting the plans of Montrose and others for an uprising. She also supported the Earl of Antrim's proposals to settle the rebellion in Ireland and bring forces across the sea to support the King in England. Henrietta Maria continued to vigorously argue for nothing less than a total victory over Charles' enemies, countering proposals for a compromise. She rejected private messages from Pym and Hampden asking her to use her influence over the King to create a peace treaty, and was impeached by Parliament shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, Parliament had voted to destroy her private chapel at Somerset House and arrest the Capuchin friars who maintained it. In March, Henry Marten and John Clotworthy forced their way into the chapel with troops and destroyed the altarpiece by Rubens, smashed many of the statues and made a <b>bonfire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's religious canvases, books and vestments.|$|E

500|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Bonfires</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s were {{constructed}} in {{five to ten}} days, working primarily in daylight, by the late 1970s, changes in the school led to a more elaborate and lengthy construction schedule. Construction began in late October with [...] "Cut", obtaining wood by cutting down trees with axes, which took several weekends. After Cut, students brought the logs to campus during [...] "Load", a {{process by which the}} logs were loaded by hand onto flatbed trucks and brought to campus. In early November, crews began [...] "Stack", a three-week period in which the logs were wired together and Bonfire took shape. Near <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> stack, known as [...] "Push", students worked around the clock in rotating shifts. <b>The</b> first four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six stacks were built with <b>the</b> efforts <b>of</b> all safety-trained participants.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Willis's career {{suffered}} a moderate slump, as he starred in flops such as The <b>Bonfire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vanities (1990). He gained more success with Striking Distance (1993) but flopped again with [...] Color of Night (1994): another box office failure, it was savaged by critics but {{did well in}} the home video market {{and became one of}} the Top 20 most-rented films in the United States in 1995.|$|E

Soon after, she co-starred with Tom Hanks in the comedy-drama The <b>Bonfire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vanities (1990), based on Tom Wolfe's novel of the same name, where she played the daughter of Hanks' character. In 1993, Dunst guest-starred on the science fiction drama [...] in season 7: episode 7 titled [...] "Dark Page" [...] as Hedril.|$|E
500|$|Although Winona Ryder was {{the first}} cast member {{attached}} to the script, Dianne Wiest {{was the first}} to sign on. [...] "Dianne, in particular, was wonderful", Burton said. [...] "She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested". When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered; Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with Tom Cruise. [...] "He certainly wasn't my ideal, but I talked to him", Burton remembered. [...] "He was interesting, but I think it worked out for the best. A lot of questions came up". Cruise asked for a [...] "happier" [...] ending. Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks turned down the part, the latter in favor of critical and commercial flop The <b>Bonfire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vanities. Oldman declined as he found the story absurd, but said of the finished film: [...] "Literally two minutes in, I went, 'Yeah, I get it'. I just got it too late." [...] Jim Carrey was also considered for the role, while Thompson favored John Cusack. Elsewhere, William Hurt, Robert Downey Jr. and musician Michael Jackson expressed interest, although Burton neglected to converse with Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Despite <b>the</b> {{complexity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design, {{there were}} no formal written instructions or architectural blueprints for <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>Bonfire.</b> [...] Knowledge on how to build the structure was passed verbally from one redpot to the next. [...] By 1999, the only written documentation on <b>the</b> building <b>of</b> <b>Bonfire</b> was <b>the</b> rough schematic printed on <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> official <b>Bonfire</b> T-shirt worn by participants from the freshman honors dormitory, Lechner.|$|R

500|$|Rubin's work on Jacob's Ladder {{began in}} 1980, sparked by his {{nightmare}} {{in which he}} dreamt about being trapped in a subway. For several years, Rubin tried to sell the script, without success; Thom Mount of Universal Pictures said he [...] "loved it, {{but it was not}} for his studio". Directors Michael Apted, Sidney Lumet and Ridley Scott all expressed an interest in making the film, but still no major studio was ready to invest in Rubin's [...] "too metaphysical" [...] stories as [...] "Hollywood does not make ghost movies". Eventually, after Deadly Friend was filmed by Wes Craven in 1986, Rubin's screenplays for both Jacob's Ladder and Ghost were picked by Paramount Pictures. In 1988, Adrian Lyne, who described Rubin's work as [...] "certainly one of the best scripts I've ever read", decided then to direct it instead of an adaptation of The <b>Bonfire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vanities as he had originally planned (incidentally, Tom Hanks, an actor originally considered by Lyne for the role of Jacob, ended up starring in Bonfire). The ownership and policy changes at Paramount resulted in the cancellation of the project; the executives had doubts about the film's ending and the scenes taking place in Vietnam. The independent film studio Carolco Pictures decided to take over the production of Jacob's Ladder, giving Lyne a greater creative control and a budget of $25 million. Rubin became the film's co-producer, along with Mario Kassar, Alan Marshall and Andrew G. Vajna.|$|E
500|$|Work {{continued}} on the screenplay from 2003 onwards, {{taking place in}} the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. The writers spent six months discussing a plot, and each of them offered sketchy ideas. Jean suggested the family rescue manatees, which became the 2005 episode [...] "The <b>Bonfire</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manatees", and there was also a notion similar to that of The Truman Show where the characters discovered their lives were a TV show. Groening rejected this, as he felt that the Simpsons should [...] "never become aware of themselves as celebrities", but the idea was later used in the video game The Simpsons Game. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. The decision for Flanders to have an important role also came early on, as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father. Hank Scorpio, a character from the 1996 episode [...] "You Only Move Twice", was originally meant to return as the main antagonist, but the staff dropped the idea and created Russ Cargill instead. Having eventually decided on the basic outline of the plot for the film, the writers then separated it into seven sections. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin, and Meyer wrote 25 pages each, and the group met one month later to merge the seven sections into one [...] "very rough draft". The film's script was written {{in the same way as}} the television series: the writers sitting around a table, pitching ideas, and trying to make each other laugh. The script went through over 100 revisions, and at one point the film was a musical. However, the songs were continually being shortened and the idea was dropped. Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, saying that he wanted to [...] "give you something that you haven't seen before".|$|E

40|$|Bonfire Night”, or Oíche Fhéile Eóin (“Saint John’s Night”), {{has been}} {{observed}} in parts of Ireland for centuries. The earliest documentary evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lighting <b>of</b> <b>bonfires</b> on <b>the</b> eve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feast, 23 June, dates to the 17 th century. The custom was so important that it {{gave rise to the}} appellation “Bonfire Night”. In <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, and elsewhere, such as in Cork city, bonfire celebrations seem strong even recently. However, to survive, they must kaleidoscopically adapt to everchanging circumstances. Drawing on a range of sources – from the unpublished replies to National Folklore Collection (NFC) questionnaires, to twenty-first century local newspapers, and to fieldwork undertaken in 2008 – three major changes in this custom have been identified: the material allowed in the fires, <b>the</b> commercialisation <b>of</b> <b>bonfires,</b> and <b>the</b> withdrawal <b>of</b> a certain part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population from the festivities.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 89 - 92) Archetypes {{are those}} recurring images or symbols which are basic to our literary experience. Rooted in classical mythology and the Bible, they illuminate the literature itself and relate it (the literature) to our common experience. Even our most casual observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writings <b>of</b> Nathaniel Hawthorne reveal his consistent use of archetypal images {{as a creative}} tool to illustrate both {{the good and the}} bad in the human situation. <b>The</b> primary purpose <b>of</b> this study, then, is to call the attention to Hawthorne???s unique utilization of archetypes, especially with regard to images of five, which occur frequently in the works. In addition, <b>the</b> theories <b>of</b> two critics Northrop Prye and Maud Bodkin, provide methods to complement this discussion, because of their own originality in dealing with archetypal images. Initially, it seemed appropriate to recall, through Hawthorne???s autobiographical musings, his personal fascination with <b>the</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> fire itself and to reveal its awareness of it as a source for creativity. To do this increases <b>the</b> subsequent pleasure <b>of</b> seeing, in his sketches and tales, <b>the</b> transformation <b>of</b> fire images into universal archetypes within <b>the</b> tradition <b>of</b> literature. In some of his sketches and tales Hawthorne has used the hearth-fire as an archetypal image of man's potential goodness. Despite his personal reference for this kind of fire, his creativity has not seemed as brilliant when he has utilized <b>the</b> wholesome image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hearth-fire as when he has ascribed negative connotations to images of fire. These negative images, to be called hell-fire, occur in many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works. They occur as creative similes of mythic fire, <b>of</b> <b>bonfires,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian Hell-fire, the latter accompanied by one or more Satan figures. As dramatically complex archetypes, these images do, indeed, present a dark picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human situation, effective and unsettling...|$|R
