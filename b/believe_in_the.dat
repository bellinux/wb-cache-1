5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{possibility of the}} reversibility of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler {{was at that time}} shared by both sides of the political spectrum – Cato had sought to turn back the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E
5|$|Comte's {{positivism}} {{established the}} initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and social research.

Positivism has also been espoused by 'technocrats' who <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inevitability of social progress through science and technology.|$|E

60|$|Home {{had never}} been a very {{pleasant}} place to me, because of my sister's temper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> it.

Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all coarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella see it on any account.|$|R

As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption.

5|$|From an {{analysis}} of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka, paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna in Sri Lanka by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, some <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possibility that there were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it likely that {{they were on the}} island by 300,000 BP. Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and south east of the island may yield evidence of such early hominids.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be {{acceptable}} to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, {{the end result of}} the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.|$|E

5|$|Perry was {{inspired}} to write the episode due to his interest in conspiracy theory literature, which he finds interesting but does not <b>believe</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> Coast to Coast AM radio show featured in the episode also served as an inspiration, and its host Art Bell agreed to appear as himself. Guest star James Marsters was cast immediately after his audition {{for the role of}} Eric Swan, and although several of Millennium crew were fans of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in which Marsters had a recurring role, Perry recalled none of them recognizing the actor during his audition due to the strength of his performance.|$|E
5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths {{have no place}} in philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E
5|$|The general {{goal of a}} {{level is}} to gain control over every village on an island, {{accomplished}} through acts that persuade the villagers to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> player. Villagers can be swayed by everything from assistance with day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs and lightning storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples {{can be used to}} impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.|$|E

5|$|The {{roots of}} the {{collapse}} of the monarchy can be traced as far back as 1850, upon the death of Pedro II's youngest male child. From that point onward, the Emperor ceased to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> monarchy as a viable form of government for Brazil's future, as his remaining heir was a daughter. Although constitutionally permitted, a female ruler was considered unacceptable by both Pedro II and the ruling circles. This issue was deferred for decades, during which the country became more powerful and prosperous. So long as the Emperor enjoyed good health, the matter of succession could be ignored.|$|E
5|$|Between 1871 and 1874, {{while he}} lectured at the Conservatory, Rimsky-Korsakov {{thoroughly}} grounded himself in Western compositional techniques, {{and came to}} <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value of academic training for success as a composer. Once Rimsky-Korsakov had made this turn-around, Tchaikovsky considered him an esteemed colleague, and, if not the best of friends, was at least on friendly terms with him. When {{the other members of}} The Five became hostile toward Rimsky-Korsakov for his change of attitude, Tchaikovsky continued to support Rimsky-Korsakov morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing, and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Beginning in 1876, Tchaikovsky was a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home during his trips to Saint Petersburg. At one point, Tchaikovsky offered to have Rimsky-Korsakov appointed to the directorship of the Moscow Conservatory, but he refused.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{begins the}} fourth {{book with a}} belated {{explanation}} of the disorganized nature of the work, and gives {{a brief description of}} his aims for the remaining three or four books. The fourth book focuses on martyrdom. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing {{that they do not have}} sufficient respect for God's gift of life. He is ambivalent whether any believing Christian can become a martyr by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives. Marcionites cannot become martyrs, because they do not <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> divinity of God the Father – their sufferings are in vain. There is then a digression to the subject of theological epistemology. According to Clement, there is no way of empirically testing the existence of God the Father, because the Logos has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of the senses. God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.|$|E

5|$|In the Main Story, Nero is a {{young man}} who lives in the castle-town of Fortuna on a mysterious island, {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} world. Fortuna is home to The Order of the Sword, a sect of holy knights who worship the demon Sparda as their God. Their leader, is the High Priest Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent spiritual leader, despite Nero's clear lack of faith. With the white hair and attitude not unlike a descendant of Sparda, his true parentage remains a mystery. Discovered on the island as a baby, Nero was sent to live with Credo, The Captain of the Holy Knights, who raised Nero to fight demons alongside his peaceful younger sister Kyrie, whom Nero eventually develops feelings for. Though Nero does not <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Order’s worship of Sparda, and openly subverts convention by using firearms, and customizing his own sword with a motorcycle handle that shoots flames, he truly believes in protecting the innocent.|$|E
5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E
5|$|Pierce's directorial debut was The Legend of Boggy Creek, {{which was}} {{inspired}} by the Fouke Monster, a seven-foot-tall Bigfoot-like creature said to live in the swamps near Fouke, Arkansas. Pierce said he did not necessarily <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legend, but was fascinated with the stories. After interviewing Fouke residents who said they encountered the monster, Pierce became impressed with their authenticity and down-to-earth qualities. He approached Earl E. Smith, an acquaintance from the advertising business, to adapt those eyewitness tales into a screenplay. The film was shot at locations in Fouke, Texarkana and Shreveport, using a camera Pierce built himself at home. It was filmed in a faux documentary style, and included interviews with Fouke residents mixed with dramatizations of their supposed encounters with the creature. Like Pierce, the film's financial backers and many of the actors had never been involved in a film before.|$|E
