40|$|Multigenerational {{households}} are an understudied type of grandfamily. In rural communities, these {{households are}} likely to be economically disadvantaged and underserved. Drawing from a subset (N = 63) of low-income multigenerational households in a multistate research study, Rural Families Speak About Health, the present study compares demographic characteristics, parent and child wellbeing, and family processes in two types of multigenerational household structures: one-parent/grandparent families and two-parent/grandparent families. Research on these multigenerational household configurations is rare despite the potential for different needs, strengths, and services. Results indicate no differences in economic hardship or disadvantage <b>by</b> <b>household</b> <b>type.</b> Children in one-parent/grandparent households were older, and mothers reported providing more elder care than in two-parent/grandparent homes. There were no statistically significant differences in mother or child wellbeing across these family structures. Differences in family processes emerged. Specifically, mothers’ reports of parenting alliances and family routines varied <b>by</b> <b>household</b> <b>type</b> such that mothers in one-parent/grandparent households reported stronger parenting alliances and more stable family routines than those in two-parent/grandparent families.

A CGE model of Uganda is used to model the effects of trade liberalisation, {{taking into account the}} distribution effects <b>by</b> <b>household</b> <b>types.</b> We can draw three broad conclusions. First, the impact of multilateral liberalisation on a low-income country such as Uganda appears to be quite slight, albeit positive, largely because there is only a slight impact on the world prices of the agricultural commodities it exports. Second, the principal gains actually arise from trade reforms that are essentially unilateral in nature. Third, the impact is likely to be pro-poor. Although the largest proportional gains are to the urban self-employed, there are significant gains in agriculture that benefit almost all categories of rural household...|$|R

Our multivari-ate results imply that, in contrast with the descriptive analysis, the presence of children robustly reduces household’s chances to step out of poverty. In turn, both methodologies show that the effectiveness of labour market events is consistently lower for childbearing households while their prevalence is particularly high. Also, both the prevalence and the effectiveness of events related to the beginning of state transfers are high for households without children...|$|R

We use data from the Luxembourg Income Study for examining the sensitivity of the Gini and the Theil index to the chosen conversion strategy, and explain our results by means of an inequality decomposition <b>by</b> <b>household</b> <b>types.</b> Country inequality rankings are sensitive to the conversion strategy applied. The decomposition analysis reveals the underlying mechanisms. We find inequality estimates typically to be lower in the size-weighted distribution compared to needs-weighting.

The main beneficiaries of the free education system in Norway are, not surprisingly, households with children. Noncash health benefits particularly improve the situation of the elderly. When the income measures are adjusted for household size and composition, the spread in relative mean income across the different groups is reduced. To measure the impact of income inequality the authors use income per decile group before and after the inclusion of in-kind benefits. Looking at the population as a whole, it is found that households {{in the bottom of the}} distribution receive more than those at the top.

The MEPI is composed of three attributes (dimensions) of energy poverty in developed countries: energy costs, income, and energy efficiency of housing. We apply this measure to gauge energy poverty in Japan after the 2000 s, focusing on the year of the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear accident. Based on unique microdata, the results show that energy poverty has been aggravated in Japan since the 2000 s. Analyzing the situation <b>by</b> <b>household</b> <b>type,</b> we can categorize mother-child and single-aged households, in particular, as vulnerable to energy poverty.

The models allow for differentiated responses <b>by</b> different <b>household</b> <b>types</b> to change and for the partial equilibrium effects of consequent supply, demand, and price adjustments in labor and grain markets.

Impacts of these changes on the poor are found to be critically dependent upon supply and demand elasticities in labor and grain markets, but the poor could potentially suffer significant losses from increased openness of the local economy leading to increased expenditure <b>by</b> less poor <b>households</b> on imported goods and services.
