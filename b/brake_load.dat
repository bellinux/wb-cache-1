50|$|Brake fade {{failures}} can cascade. For example, {{a typical}} 5-axle truck/trailer combination has 10 brakes. If one brake fades, <b>brake</b> <b>load</b> {{is transferred to}} the remaining 9 brakes, causing them to work harder, get hotter, and thus fade more. Where fade is non-uniform, fade may cause a vehicle to swerve. Because of this, heavy vehicles often use disproportionately weak brakes on steered wheels, which hurts the stopping distance and causes brakes on non-steered wheels to work harder, worsening fade. An advantage of low-fade brakes such as disc brakes is steered wheels can do more braking without causing brake steer.|$|E

40|$|Increasing oil prices, {{and global}} warming {{activates}} {{the research and development}} of substitute energy resources to maintain economic development. The methyl esters of vegetable oil, known as biodiesel are becoming popular because of their low ecological effect and potential as a green substitute for compression ignition engine. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the performance of neem oil methyl ester on a single cylinder, four stroke, direct injection, and 8 HP capacity diesel engine. The Experimental research has been performed to analyze the performance of different blends 20 % (BD 20), 50 % (BD 50), and 100 % (BD 100) of neem oil biodiesel. Biodiesel, when compared to conventional diesel fuel, results showed that the brake specific fuel consumption and brake specific energy consumption are higher and brake thermal efficiency less during testing of engine. The brake specific energy consumption is increased by 0. 60 % to 8. 25 % and brake thermal efficiency decreased by 0. 57 % to 7. 62 % at 12 kg engine <b>brake</b> <b>load</b> as compared to diesel fuel. When the fuel consumption of biodiesel is compared to diesel fuel it observed that the fuel consumption was increased by 2. 5 % to 19. 5 % than that of diesel fuel for B 20, B 50 and B 100 bends at 12 kg engine <b>brake</b> <b>load.</b> It is observed that the performance of biodiesel blends is less as compared to plain diesel and during testing of diesel engine run normally for all engine loads.

Physically, the over-heating often occurs in type disc brake, because the heat transfer surface is less proportionately, especially for high <b>braking</b> <b>loads.</b> This research aims to develop a brake disc with an active cooling system to prevent overheating. The system is applied to a simulated model of disc brakes empirically. The test was conducted at several levels of constant disc speed and breaking force.

We designed a fixture which could imitate the suspension and made the test more close to the true level. Moreover we discussed how to establish the evaluation system of vehicle braking condition. Through real vehicle test of braking, we can test and record the brake system parameters in the braking process under urban working conditions. We recorded the brake frequency, the change of brake speed and brake disc temperature.

40|$|There {{are various}} running modes of an {{internal}} combustion engine and a considerable percentage of them is occupied by such transient operation that the engine speed and <b>brake</b> <b>load</b> change. Even in such transient running as these, it is desired to improve the power performance, to reduce the exhaust emission and engine noise, to make the speed responsiveness better etc. In particular, since {{the characteristics of a}} spark ignition engine with a carburetor depends remarkably on the air-fuel ratio of mixture in the cylinder, it is necessary to feed always an appropriate mixture to the cylinder also during the transient operation. However, some part of fuel fed from the carburetor is fed into the cylinder together with intake air, whereas the remaining fuel not yet gasified flows into the cylinder along the intake pipe wall. For this reason, the state of mixture formation in the cylinder during transient operation depends on the behavior of the fuel liquid-film formed on the inside wall o...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} effect of parameters like blend and load on the performance and emission characteristics of single cylinder direct injection diesel engine using waste fried oil methyl ester (WFOME). As far as the application in rural agricultural sector of a developing country is concerned, such engines should preferably utilize alternative fuels of bio-origin, which are locally available. Two input parameters, that is, blend and load, were varied and responses such as Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC), Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), and smoke opacity(OP) were investigated. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed for modeling and analysis of response parameters to evaluate the characteristics of the engine. The experiments were designed using a statistical tool known as Design of Experiments (DoE) based on RSM. Engine-operating parameters were optimized using the Desirability approach of RSM. Finally, model optimized results were validated experimentally. The performance parameters for different WFOME blends were found close to diesel, and emission characteristics of the engine improved significantly. A blend of B 20 and <b>brake</b> <b>load</b> of 2. 5 kW were found to be optimal input parameters for the WFOME blended with diesel in the test engine of 5 HP at 1500 rpm...|$|E

The entire investigation performance of diesel engine is carried in two phases using the 100 % diesel in the first phases and the MTBE blended with diesel fuels in the second phase. The MTBE blended diesel fuels are prepared in the different proportions of 5 % & 10 % MTBE blends. The experimental performance consists of a diesel engine coupled with rope brake dynamometer. All the experiments are perform at a constant speed of 1500 rpm by varying the load and then data obtained from the experiments are {{used to evaluate the}} performance parameters of diesel engine. It is investigated that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of diesel engine using MTBE blends were decreased as the amount of blends increased in diesel. The BTE of diesel engine using 5 % and 10 % blends are 25. 26 % & 24. 65 % respectively that is less from 26. 35 % than that of diesel. The brake specific energy consumption of 5 & 10 percent of MTBE blends consumed higher energy in comparison to diesel fuel during tested on diesel engine. It is investigated that the brake specific fuel consumption of diesel engine using MTBE blends are increased for all <b>brake</b> <b>load</b> than that of diesel fuel...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the problem that the truck should spray water to cool its brake during run the long {{downhill}} on mountain highway in winter，which can Lead to icy road and cause traffic accidents. We specially selected the straight truck (6 × 4) which install the engine brake (Jacobs), carrying carry out safety tests on Yaxi highway downhill sections in winter. The tests showed that 30 % of vehicle overloading conditions, without the engine brake (Jacobs), relying on the service brake to control downhill speed, when the elevation drop of about 300 m, the truck’s highest brake drum temperature will rise to a hot recession critical failure temperature (260) above. If you continue ℃ driving, it will lead to break failure and loss of control. When the truck going downhill and open the engine brake (Jacobs), due to the <b>brake</b> <b>load</b> is greatly reduced, the brake drum temperature of the truck maintained at 150 or l ℃ ess to maintain a good braking performance, and the truck can pass the 51 km gap between 1500 m long downhill safely. The results of field test shows that, when a straight truck going down a long downhill slope and open the engine braking (Jacobs), the brake maintain a safe speed without spraying water, and keeping good braking performance. So it can solve the straight truck pass the long downhill sections of mountain highway fundamentally and the brake is not tricking...|$|E
40|$|Use of {{vegetable}} oil as {{compression ignition engine}} fuel has been investigated by many researchers during last decade either by direct blending with diesel or converting it into bio-diesel but very few publications available regarding its direct use in engine. The direct use of straight vegetable oil leading to formation of injector deposits which in turn produces higher exhaust emissions. Fuel improvement through additive is an attractive option in existing diesel engine without any modification to meet worldwide legislative efforts to lower airborne pollution. Hence, use of locally available vegetable oil with addition of fuel additive in existing diesel engine becomes an indispensable tool in global trade to meet ever-tightening pollutant emissions regulations for heavy-duty diesel engine. This paper intends to compare the behaviour of edible and non-edible crude vegetable oil on engine characteristics of existing diesel engine under similar operating condition with cognitive elaboration. The main {{purpose of the present}} work was to investigate how commercially available fuel additives for diesel fuel, influence the edible and non-edible vegetable oil, by comparing the combustion, emission and performance characteristics under similar operating condition. A comparative study was carried out on Cummins two cylinder DI diesel engine at constant speed by varying <b>brake</b> <b>load.</b> The Sunflower oil (SF) was selected as edible oil and Karanj oil (KO) as non-edible oil whereas two commercially available fuel additives for diesel referred as 'A 1 ' and 'A 2 ' respectively in this study were procured for test trial. The experimentally obtained results revealed that both edible oil (SF) and non-edible oil (MO) showed longer ignition delay which in turn leading to higher cylinder pressure, HRR, higher NOx and CO emissions whereas showed lower BSEC and smoke opacity as compared to diesel fuel. However, the KO oil exhibited lower NOx, and CO emissions when compared to SF while maintaining marginal difference in thermal efficiency. The test results showed that both additives were found effective in reduction of ignition delay, HRR and NO formation with KO whereas increased NOx and CO emissions with SF. The additive Al significantly reduced CO and smoke emissions with MO while the opposite trend was observed when additive A 2 was used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Sweet itch in horses is {{a common}} disease of great {{economic}} and clinical importance. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the influence of epidemiological- and management-related factors on the clinical signs of sweet itch in a multi equine racial, Germany-wide investigation. Furthermore, the aim was to find the best method of treatment. First, a survey was conducted using questionnaires. There was a return of 404 evaluable records. Those factors meant to have an effect on the incidence of sweet itch in horses, were then statistically analyzed using univariate and bivariate methods. The most common distributionbased test methods such as the t-test and F-test were utilized, as well as the chi-square test (χ²) test and the regression analysis. The results of the present study show that compared to stallions, geldings were most affected by sweet itch, as they showed the strongest symptoms (p 0. 05). The analysis of the feeding has shown that horses fed with concentrated feed (oats and/or muesli) showed milder symptoms than horses, which were not fed with concentrated feed (p = 0. 015). The analysis of the status of deworming demonstrated that horses that have not been dewormed regularly, showed more severe symptoms than horses that were dewormed once a year (p < 0. 02). Regions of the body where sweet itch appeared in the early stages were predominantly the mane and tail, followed by the abdomen. In later onset cases, horses would show symptoms along the linea alba. At the time of this study, the majority of the horses showed symptoms in the mane (91. 3 %) and tail (89. 4 %). Amazingly, there were also a large number of horses that had been affected in areas as the face (48 %), ears (46. 5 %), the withers (33. 7 %), neck (32. 2 %) and the inner legs (23. 5 %). Furthermore, results show that when withers, trunk or inner legs were affected, the disease had already progressed to a significant stage. At the time of this study 99 % of the horses suffered from itching, 76. 5 % with strong expression. Furthermore, the horses showed symptoms such as bald areas (87 %) and dandruff (80 %). Bloody crusts (74 %) and skin thickening (68. 1 %) were seen as a sign of a chronic affection. With increased age of the horses symptoms of sweet itch worsened. There seems to be a significant correlation between increased duration and worsened symptoms in this disease. Details were focused of the purchase of the horse. The main attention lay on the skin at the time of the purchase and the purchase investigation. These aspects were analyzed because the horses may already have shown certain skin changes at the time of the purchase but these had not been diagnosed as summer eczema. Surprisingly 41. 4 % of the horses already showed symptoms of the summer eczema at the time of the purchase. Itching manifested at 32. 4 % of the horses and in turn hairless areas already showed 30 % at the purchase in the coat. The horses which already had a big number at hairless places in the coat at the time of the purchase later showed significantly stronger symptoms of summer eczema than horses who showed none or merely few hairless areas. Even more clearly it behaved with the itching of the horses. Horses who had strong pruritus at the time of the purchase, later showed a significantly heavier clinical picture than horses with none, light or even medium strong pruritus (p < 0. 05). With 25. 1 % of the horses a purchase investigation was carried out, however, the veterinarian ascertained skin findings merely with 3. 5 % of these horses. 27. 5 % of the previous owners reported already existing skin problems. The analysis of the data shows that skin problems played a big role at the time of the purchase. Whether or not this was a deliberate deception on the side of the selling owner cannot be excluded. Furthermore 9. 5 % of the horses in the study showed a preexisting illness. 3. 8 % of these horses had an allergy, starting from hay- or dust-allergy (2. 8 %), dust-mites or feed allergens. A total of 2. 0 % of the horses (n = 8) fell ill with a lung illness. The results of this study show the success of the most common drugs and treatment methods of sweet itch. In principle, it was noticed that a recovery of the syndrome appeared as a result of the treatment of the summer eczema in 72. 8 % of the horses. The highest success rate of 70. 3 % was achieved by using an eczema blanket. The use of creams was valued at an acceptable success of 40 %. In contrast, the use of homeopathics, repellents and autohaemotherapy showed no significant improvement of the disease. Desensitization induced an improvement of the clinical signs of summer eczema of 5 horses. Furthermore, there were associations between the exposure to insects and the severity of the symptoms of sweet itch in horses. The analysis of the data showed that 85. 1 % of the owners reported a strong insect load. The higher the midges and/or <b>brake</b> <b>load,</b> the worse the symptoms. The study therefore showed that the best prevention and treatment of sweet itch in horses is the minimization of allergen exposure and the associated reduction of the insect load. The findings of this study show for the first time a representative, multi-breeding overview of the etiology, severity and treatment of summer eczema in examined horse population. All in all it was noticed that in 72. 8 % of horses suffering from sweet itch, those treated showed an improvement in symptoms. The best effect, with 70. 3 % positive outcome, was visible with the use of a blanket. Creams showed an improvement in 40 % of the treated animals. The use of homeopathy, repellants as well as autoheamotherapy did not show significant improvement of the symptoms. In 5 case studies desensitization proved efficient. The study shows that the most effective prevention and therapy of sweet itch is minimization of explosion towards the allergen. 85, 1 % of the participants in the study recalled an increase of Insects. The higher the insect load, the worse the symptomatic of sweet itch (p < 0, 00). This study provides new insight on the development, manifestation and treatment of sweet itch in different horse breeds. The random sample consisted of 404 participants throughout Germany. Limiting factor to this study was the missing reference toward the entire horse population in Germany. To be able to draw conclusions about the entire horse population one would need a control group. Only then would a concrete statement about the epidemiology of sweet itch be valid. Furthermore the subjectivity of the horse owners as well as the sample choice has to be taken under advisement. There is a possibility that predominantly owner of horses affected more severely with sweet itch participated in the study. As it is a purely written questionnaire the assessment of the horse owner concerning the severity of symptoms as well as the insect load may vary greatly. A combination of a written questionnaire as well as an examination by a veterinarian may lead to more thorough result [...] Also evaluating the progression of sweet itch over several years would be useful. A questionnaire should be designed that should be filled out by the owner more than once a year to which pictures documenting the symptomatic of sweet itch should be added...|$|E

A wheel with an S-shaped web is studied for some different stop <b>braking</b> <b>loads.</b> Using 3 D FE simulations, the effects of simultaneous thermal <b>loading</b> from <b>braking</b> and mechanical <b>loading,</b> with traversing wheel-rail rolling contact, are studied. In order to account for the elevated temperatures, the simulations utilise a temperature-dependent elastoplastic material model. The mechanical loads account for frictional rolling contact stress distributions induced by braking, using a novel method that is based on elastoplastic contact simulations. Partial slip is considered and interfacial shear stresses are introduced in the wheel-rail contact area. Evolution of damage {{in the vicinity of the}} wheel tread is studied for various <b>brake</b> <b>loading</b> cases. In order to assess limits for the tread braking, the calculated damage is compared to previously developed critical damage levels which were based on full-scale brake rig testing. Results are presented for a parametric study with thermomechanical loading based on different load cases. The influence from operational parameters such as axle loads, initial speeds, decelerations and block material is studied. The results show that the temperature has a strong influence on the rolling contact fatigue of the wheel treads and, hence, also on the thermal capacity of the wheels.

50|$|Motorcycle {{braking systems}} have varied {{throughout}} time, as motorcycles evolved from bicycles with an engine attached, to the 220 mph prototype motorcycles seen racing in MotoGP. Most systems work by converting kinetic energy into thermal energy (heat) by friction. On motorcycles, approximately 70% of the braking effort is {{performed by the}} front brake. This however can vary for individual motorcycles; longer-wheelbase types having more weight biased rearward, such as cruisers and tourers, can have a`greater effort applied by the rear brake. In contrast, sports bikes with a shorter wheelbase and more vertical fork geometry can tolerate higher front <b>braking</b> <b>loads.</b> For these reasons, motorcycles {{tend to have a}} vastly more powerful front brake compared to the rear.|$|R
2500|$|Rotors come in many {{different}} sizes, such as 160mm, 185mm, and 203mm diameter. Other sizes are available as manufacturers make discs specific to their calipers [...] the dimensions often vary by a few millimeters. Larger rotors provide greater braking force for a given pad pressure, by virtue of a longer moment arm for the caliper to act on. Smaller rotors provide less stopping power but also less weight and better protection from knocks. Larger rotors dissipate heat more quickly and have a larger amount of mass to absorb heat, reducing brake fade or failure. Downhill bikes usually have larger brakes to handle greater <b>braking</b> <b>loads.</b> Cross country bicycles usually use smaller rotors which handle smaller loads but offer considerable weight savings.|$|R
