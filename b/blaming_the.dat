50|$|The M-19 lost {{several of}} its top commanders during <b>the</b> event, and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} for the ensuing bloodshed.

There is apparently no clear consensus on the matter.|$|R

25|$|State {{authorities}} were also <b>blamed.</b> <b>The</b> state labor commissioner, John C. Brooks, blamed his department's failure {{to inspect the}} plant on shortage of money and staff, and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> federal government for not enforcing stricter standards.|$|R
5|$|During the Cold War, the Warsaw Pact {{countries}} {{launched a}} widespread {{war against the}} potato beetle, <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the species from America on the CIA, demonising the species in propaganda posters, and urging children to gather the beetles and kill them.|$|E
5|$|In a world {{historically}} {{receptive to}} any anti-Semitic argument, however crude, {{to put in}} Hitler's mouth a powerful rationale for <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> Jews, however ironically, was feeding the same fires that sent Jews up the chimneys of the death camps.|$|E
5|$|Ælfheah sent Ælfric of Eynsham to Cerne Abbey to {{take charge}} of its monastic school. He was present at the council of May 1008 at which Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York, preached his Sermo Lupi ad Anglos (The Sermon of the Wolf to the English), castigating the English for their moral failings and <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> latter for the tribulations afflicting the country.|$|E
5000|$|The Sri Lankan {{government}} denounced <b>the</b> {{killings and}} <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> LTTE, {{suggesting that the}} massacre [...] "could very well {{be a part of}} the LTTE strategy to divert international opinion". <b>The</b> LTTE, meanwhile, <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|R
5000|$|An {{orphaned}} {{brother and}} sister moved to another place where the brother opened a shop and married. One day, he told his sister to keep the house. The wife was offended, broke all <b>the</b> furniture, and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> sister. The brother said they could buy more. The wife killed his favorite horse and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> sister. The brother said the dogs could eat it. Finally, the wife gave birth, cut off the baby's head, and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> sister. The brother took his sister and drove the carriage into a bramble. He told his sister to disentangle. When she started, he cut off both her arms at the elbow and drove off.|$|R

5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking {{his case to}} the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component to the Holocaust in Lithuania {{was that the}} occupying Nazi German administration fanned antisemitism by <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community. Another significant factor was the large {{extent to which the}} Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation and execution of their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{professional}} beekeepers {{and environmentalists}} jointly {{filed a lawsuit}} against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for continuing to allow the use of neonicotinoids in the United States. The suit specifically asks for suspension of clothianidin and thiamethoxam. The lawsuit follows a dramatic die off of bees in the United States, with some beekeepers losing 50% of their hives. The EPA responded to the suit by issuing a report <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> Varroa mite for the decline in bees and claiming the role of neonicotinoids in bee extinction has been overstated.|$|E
25|$|Many locals <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> barge for {{the catastrophic}} {{inundation}} of the area.

50|$|Since {{most studies}} have found that people tend to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> victim of rape for the incident, a study called Gender Differences in Attributions of Blame for Male Rape Victims in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence focused on where <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> lies in rape cases. In cases of female rape victims, a higher {{proportion}} of males than females tend to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> victim for the sexual assault. In order to show whether male or female respondents <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> rape victim at a higher rate, this study utilized a story of a man being raped to see if <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> was placed on the victim or the assaulter. After performing the experiment, researchers found that a statistically significant proportion of males tend to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> victim, even when the rape victim is a male. This study implies that even in cases of male sexual victimization, the male victims are held responsible for the assault by the majority of the uninvolved population.|$|R
5|$|In the film, Bond is {{dispatched}} to Japan after American and Soviet manned spacecraft disappear mysteriously in orbit. With each nation <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> other amidst the Cold War, Bond travels secretly {{to a remote}} Japanese island to find the perpetrators and comes {{face to face with}} Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. The film reveals the appearance of Blofeld, who was previously a partially unseen character. SPECTRE is working for the government of an unnamed Asian power, implied to be the People's Republic of China, to provoke war between the superpowers.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's murder {{received}} {{considerable attention}} in the media. Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder, media attention later concentrated more {{on the lack of}} parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party, and on Leigh's sexuality. The media coverage of the murder has been cited as an example of <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> victim. Leigh's murder inspired a theatrical play entitled A Property of the Clan, which was later revised and renamed Blackrock, as well as a feature film of the same name.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April 1945, at his {{afternoon}} situation conference, Hitler {{fell into}} a tearful rage (famously dramatized in the 2004 German film Downfall) when he realised that his plans, prepared the previous day, could not be achieved. He declared {{that the war was}} lost, <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> generals for the defeat and that he would remain in Berlin until the end and then kill himself.|$|E
50|$|Different {{sides are}} also <b>blamed</b> for <b>the</b> coup: some <b>blame</b> LDDP {{government}} and others <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> Russian secret service, while still others blame certain {{leaders of the}} volunteers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Defense Ministry <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> {{explosion}} on high temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Readers {{may choose}} their own villain in the story we have told. Like us, some will find the {{greatest}} culpability {{in the scientific community}} itself, for the large-scale failure {{to pay attention to the}} teaching of science in the high schools. Others will <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> textbook authors and publishers for pursuing sales rather than quality. Some will attach <b>blame</b> to <b>the</b> politicians who exploited antievolution sentiment to get into, or remain, in office. Others will <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> conservative Protestant clergy. Some may <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> whole educational system for failing to teach Americans how to evaluate evidence. And many will <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> evolutionists for bringing the matter up in the first place. But whatever the lesson one wishes to draw from the history of biology textbooks since the Scopes trial, we think the story itself is worth knowing. That the textbooks could have downgraded their treatment of evolution with almost nobody noticing is the greatest tragedy of all...|$|R
5|$|The final mission {{takes place}} in Moscow, with Shadowman's unleashing his minions in the KGB, the {{military}} and the Russian mafia in attempting a coup against President Boris Yeltsin's government. The player must prevent a bombing on the Kremlin before seeking out and killing Shadowman. The game's end sequence depicts Andrea delivering a televised news report <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> destruction on an earthquake and consequent gas fires.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse {{in the value of the}} currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> West for the free fall of the currency.|$|E
5000|$|Reactions varied [...] - [...] some <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> police, {{while others}} <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} for giving the orders, {{and claimed that}} the police only did what it should. The socialist party stated that {{that was just a}} [...] "stupid love comedy" [...] which should not have ended as it did.|$|R

5|$|Burnett {{took his}} seat in the 37th Congress; sources make no mention of his making good on his threat {{not to take the}} oath of office. Just days after the First Battle of Bull Run, Burnett's fellow Kentuckian, John J. Crittenden {{proposed}} a resolution <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> war on the disloyal Southerners and defining the war's aim as preservation of the Union without interference in the rights or institutions of the states. Burnett asked that the question be divided. His request was granted, but he only found one colleague willing to vote with him against blaming Southerners for the war.|$|E
5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that {{the removal of the}} screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{comfortable}} upbringing and {{his high}} social status, Pearson was a radical, and {{throughout his life}} he fought a number of campaigns on progressive and reforming issues including the removal from the Monument inscription <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> Great Fire of London on Catholics, the abolition of packed special jury lists for political trials, and the overturning of the ban on Jews becoming brokers in the City. Pearson was in favour of the disestablishment of the Church of England and opposed capital punishment. Politically, he supported universal suffrage and electoral reform to balance the sizes of parliamentary constituencies. He unsuccessfully attempted to break the local monopolies developed by the gas companies, calling for the distribution pipework to be owned collectively by the consumers.|$|E
