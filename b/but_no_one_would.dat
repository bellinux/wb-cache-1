25|$|McLuhan {{has been}} critiqued as being {{alternately}} utopian, deterministic, and Eurocentric {{about the ways}} that media mediate between human beings and their natural world, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> deny the effects his work has had {{on the study of}} media.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than a year}} afterwards, on 14 June 1632 Susenyos made a {{declaration}} that those who would follow the Catholic faith were allowed to do so, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be forced to do so any further. At this point, all Patriarch Mendes could do in response was to confirm that this was, indeed, the actual will of the Emperor, his protector. Catholic Ethiopia {{had come to an}} end.|$|E
500|$|The NAACP {{argued that}} nothing would change while {{governors}} like Cruce sought to excuse lynching {{as the product of}} the [...] "uncontrollable passion" [...] of white people. District Judge John Caruthers convened a grand jury in June 1911 to investigate, telling them it was the duty of people [...] "of a superior race and of greater intelligence to protect this weaker race from unjustifiable and lawless attacks", <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> identify the lynchers.|$|E
60|$|Oh! if Wessex <b>would</b> <b>but</b> recant! <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> have disbelieved him then--not that fickle, motley crowd surely, {{who with}} its own {{characteristic}} inconsequence had suddenly taken the accused to its heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no idea," [...] he said gravely. [...] "We have {{agents in}} London, of course, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> who <b>would</b> go to such lengths. I {{do not know}} who killed Barnes, nor do I know who killed Bentham." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Shall the Dust Praise Thee?" [...] is {{a science}} fiction short story by American writer Damon Knight. It was first {{published}} in the anthology Dangerous Visions (1967). His agent refused to publish it and suggested the Atheist Journal in Moscow might buy, it <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would.</b>|$|R
500|$|During {{the first}} two months of 1986, Megadeth {{commenced}} a brief tour of the East Coast of the United States. At the shows, which were practically a continuation of the Killing for a Living tour, the band performed a number of songs from its upcoming album. Following the conclusion of the tour, the band intended to start making the record at the Music Grinder studio on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. Mustaine lifted the title from an article in Reader's Digest, which was titled [...] "Peace Would Sell <b>But</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> <b>Would</b> Buy It". Their label at the time, Combat Records, provided a recording budget of $25,000, which allowed the band to hire a freelance producer, Randy Burns. The recording of the album was very difficult for the band, because Mustaine and Ellefson were homeless at the time. Furthermore, guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson would not show up for hours because of their heroin addiction. Shortly after the band finished the final recordings of the album for Combat, they were approached by Tim Carr, an A representative of Capitol Records. After securing a contract with the group, Capitol hired producer Paul Lani to remix the original mixes done by Randy Burns, the previous producer.|$|E
2500|$|Dan Patch {{followed}} up with routine wins in Hartford, Cincinnati, Lexington and Memphis. All told, he won twelve races in 1901. He was supposed to finish the season at the Terre Haute meet <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> enter against him. Instead, he returned home on November 2. On November 14, Oxford held the first [...] "Dan Patch Day", in which the horse was led around town {{to the tune of}} the newly written Dan Patch Two Step.|$|E
2500|$|Nicolaus and Josephus {{mention that}} during Julia's {{marriage}} to Agrippa, she was travelling to meet Agrippa {{where he was}} campaigning, {{was caught up in}} a flash flood in Ilium (Troy), and almost drowned. Agrippa was furious, and in his anger he fined the locals 100,000 drachmae. The fine was a heavy blow <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> face Agrippa to request an appeal. [...] Only after Herod, king of Judaea, went to Agrippa to request a pardon did he withdraw the fine. In the spring of 16 BC, Agrippa and Julia started a tour through the eastern provinces, where they visited Herod. In October 14 BC, the couple traveled to Athens, where Julia gave birth to her fourth child, Agrippina.|$|E
6000|$|... "And their wages'll be cut {{off when}} they begin hiring themselves," [...] added the major. [...] "No; you can't decently thrust such an incubus on Hetty and Thursday--or on anyone else. You've been {{willing to pay the}} piper {{for the sake of the}} dance, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> do it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zona's {{body was}} {{examined}} on February 22, 1897 {{in the local}} one-room schoolhouse. Shue had [...] "vigorously complained" [...] about this turn of events, but was {{required by law to}} be present at the autopsy. He responded that he knew he would be arrested, <b>but</b> that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be able to prove his guilt.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a noise close beside him, and a frog {{jumped out of the}} water on to the bank and asked him why he was crying. The youth told her of his trouble, and how his {{brothers}} would bring home linen spun for them by their promised wives, <b>but</b> that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> spin his thread.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> {{bring them}} over, I should think, except {{to put them}} in the Zoo.|$|E
60|$|He {{tried to}} {{convince}} the circus men that he had captured the lion, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> believe him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are not a}} judicious man, Lorimer," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{infinitely}} {{obliged to}} you, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> have blamed you for letting go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something {{like this}} I suspected," [...] he admitted. [...] "I {{felt that there}} was {{something}} extraordinary and unusual about you. If I dared, my young friend, I would write a play about you; <b>but</b> then <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> believe it. Now tell me something. I have heard your principles. We are face to face--men, brothers, and friends. Do you live up to them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They've {{got him in}} jail, I believe. The {{fellow and}} his sister tried to make out that a tramp had taken the money, <b>but</b> I {{understand}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> listen to the story." ...|$|R
50|$|Back at the Daily Planet, Mr. White is {{impressed}} by Clark and Lois's findings, <b>but</b> he feels <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> believe the story. He burns {{the report and}} the photographs taken in the caverns.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most {{politicians}} are {{something or other}} at heart, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be rash enough to insure a politician against heart failure. Particularly when {{he happens to be}} in office." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{said that}} I thought so. Nobody had prosecuted him yet, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> employ him any longer. His end would be, I feared, to starve in some hole or other.|$|E
60|$|A {{wandering}} lama with a low-caste boy-servant might {{attract a}} moment's interest as they wandered about India, {{the land of}} pilgrims; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> suspect them or, what was more to the point, rob.|$|E
40|$|Motto: Certainly, if I were a {{publishing}} house, if I {{were in the}} publishing bussiness myself, I would have probably had ten different versions of TEX by now for ten different complicated projects that had come in. They would all look almost the same as TEX, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> have this program—they wouldn’t need it, they’re not doing exactly the book that my publishing house was doing...|$|R
5000|$|The Ford Maverick was {{intended}} to be marketed in Brazil as the Ford Pinto, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> in Brazil <b>would</b> identify Pinto as a horse breed, since pinto (a small chicken) is a Brazilian informal term for [...] "penis".|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} all her flavoring, the burnt odor and taste still lingered round Edith's dish; <b>but</b> fondly hoping <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> {{perceive}} it, she dressed hastily, gave Patty a touch here and there, and set forth at the appointed time to Augusta's lunch.|$|R
6000|$|All {{that day}} Serge asked questions. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> tell him anything. [...] "Popoff is dead," [...] they said. [...] "They have found him beside the river with his ribs driven {{in on his}} heart." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> have {{imagined}} that such an idea {{had come into the}} captain's mind. He worked as earnestly, and as steadily, {{as if he had been}} landing an ordinary cargo at an ordinary dock.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O great men!' he said, {{while they}} all listened, 'which {{of you will}} leap into the pool and {{overcome}} the crocodiles?' <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> come forward. So he turned and sprang {{into the water and}} disappeared.|$|E
60|$|This projection, {{as before}} mentioned, does exist at the spot; and I believe is partly an {{indication}} of the contortion in the beds alluded to by Mr. Phillips; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>but</b> Turner <b>would</b> have fastened on it, as in anywise deserving special attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith, Madame, I {{did hear}} some vague rumours of it, <b>but</b> in England <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> credit it. [...] . Sir Percy Blakeney, her husband, {{is a very}} wealthy man, of high social position, the {{intimate}} friend of the Prince of Wales [...] . and Lady Blakeney leads both fashion and society in London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the very}} thing I had on my mind all these holidays; <b>but</b> I know <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> ever listen to me. If Walter was here {{it would be a}} very {{different}} thing, for he is worth attending to, and Caroline knows that; though she thinks I have no sense at all but for mischief." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (Knocking {{the ashes}} {{out of his}} pipe.) 'Tisn't what we say, it's what we don't say, that helps. And it's all the profoundest philosophy. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> understand--even if it were put into a book.|$|E
60|$|So Theseus {{stayed with}} his father all the winter: and when the spring equinox drew near, all the Athenians grew sad and silent, and Theseus saw it, and asked the reason; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> answer him a word.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> obey, so, uttering a curse {{upon his}} comrades, {{he passed the}} rope round a stanchion, and {{with his right hand}} {{partially}} hoisted the sail, while with his left he hauled in the slack of the rope.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, I {{want to do}} {{something}} to get money. I could teach reading and speaking, Mrs. Meyrick thinks. <b>But</b> if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> learn of me, that is difficult." [...] Mirah smiled with a touch of merriment he had not seen in her before. [...] "I dare say I should find her poor--I mean my mother. I should want to get money for her. And I can not always live on charity; though"--here she turned so as to take all three of her companions in one glance--"it is the sweetest charity in all the world." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It is {{not that}} racial {{prejudice}} or social prejudice related to complexion are absent in Brazil. They exist. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> here <b>would</b> have thought of [...] "white-only" [...] Churches. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> in Brazil <b>would</b> have thought of laws against interracial marriage (...) Fraternal spirit is stronger among Brazilians than racial prejudice, colour, class or religion. It is true that equality has not been reached {{since the end of}} slavery (...) There was racial prejudice among plantation owners, there was social distance between the masters and the slaves, between whites and blacks (...) But few wealthy Brazilians were as concerned with racial purity as the majority were in the Old South".|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] replied Button-Bright. [...] "But I didn't {{come on a}} {{railroad}} train. This umbrella goes faster than any train ever did. This morning I flew from Chicago to Denver, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> there <b>would</b> give me any lunch. A policeman said he'd put me in jail if he caught me begging, so I got away and told the umbrella {{to take me to}} the Pacific Ocean. When I stopped I landed over there by the big rock. I shut up the umbrella and saw a girl sitting on the rock, so I went up and spoke to her. That's all." ...|$|R
