5|$|The world's {{languages}} can {{be grouped}} into language families consisting of languages that can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> have common ancestry. Linguists recognize {{many hundreds of}} language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of language isolates: languages that cannot <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are Basque, spoken in Europe, Zuni of New Mexico, Purépecha of Mexico, Ainu of Japan, Burushaski of Pakistan, and many others.|$|E

5|$|The Peano axioms can be {{augmented}} {{with the}} operations of addition and multiplication and the usual total (linear) ordering on N. The respective functions and relations are constructed in set theory or second-order logic, and can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be unique using the Peano axioms.|$|E

50|$|PI3K and phosphoinositide {{phospholipase}} C activation have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{necessary for}} macropinosome formation in fibroblasts. Members of the SNX family have also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important in macropinosome formation. Conversely, cyclic AMP has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> promote regurgitation from macropinosomes.|$|R

5|$|The axioms may be {{weakened}} {{to assert}} only {{the existence of}} a left identity and left inverses. Both can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be actually two-sided, so the resulting definition is equivalent to the one given above.|$|E
5|$|Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, Nemegtosaurus, {{is known}} {{only from a}} skull. Opisthocoelicaudia, on the other hand, lacks both the skull and neck, precluding a direct {{comparison}} and leading to suspicions that it may represent a synonym of Nemegtosaurus. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if Opisthocoelicaudia would <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be a synonym of Nemegtosaurus, the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid.|$|E
5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241years, making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any element to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E
50|$|DCP1A has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{interact}} with DCP2 and UPF1. It has also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{interact with}} GW182, a P-body marker.|$|R
50|$|The {{olfactory}} tubercle has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> play a {{large role}} in behavior. Unilateral lesions in the olfactory tubercle have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> alter attention, social and sensory responsiveness, and even locomotor behavior. Bilateral lesions have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> reduce copulatory behavior in male rats. The olfactory tubercle has also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> especially involved in reward and addictive behaviors. Rats have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle more than the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, other reward centers in the brain. In fact, they will administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle at about 200 times per hour and even till death.|$|R
50|$|The AP-1 {{transcription}} factor has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> play numerous roles in cell growth and proliferation. In particular, c-Fos and c-Jun {{seem to be}} major players in these processes. C-jun has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> essential for fibroblast proliferation, and levels of both AP-1 subunits have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expressed above basal levels during cell division. C-fos has also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> increase in expression {{in response to the}} introduction of growth factors in the cell, further supporting its suggested involvement in the cell cycle. The growth factors TGF alpha, TGF beta, and IL2 have all <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> stimulate c-Fos, and thereby stimulate cellular proliferation via AP-1 activation.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{subsequent}} vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at {{both ends}} of syllables. Following the reconstruction of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a tonal language, {{based on the fact that}} four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mocho'), but since these languages each can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> have innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} {{that the}} nature and conditions of her detention rendered the detention unlawful. The Court of Appeal accepted that detention that was prima facie lawful can become unlawful if the nature or conditions of the detention fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman conditions must <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> exist. In general, where {{the manner in which}} the detention is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the conditions of the detention, not the lawfulness of the detention itself.|$|E
5|$|The Gaussian {{integers}} {{are complex}} {{numbers of the}} form α=u+vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one. By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be uniquely factorizable, by the argument above. This unique factorization is helpful in many applications, such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by other arguments.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{recognizing}} whether {{a subset of}} attributes is a pseudo-intent <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coNP-hard, which together with the previous results means that this problem is coNP-complete. Recognizing an essential intent <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> NP-complete and recognizing the lectically largest pseudo-intent <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coNP-hard. ...|$|R

30|$|PBAP has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{converge}} to Nash equilibrium for zero-sum games [39]. For general finite two-player games, it <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> converge to close-to-optimal {{solutions in}} polynomial time [40].|$|R
5|$|This caused great consternation {{among the}} aristocracy, {{who insisted that}} long use in itself {{constituted}} licence. A compromise was eventually reached in 1290, whereby a liberty was considered legitimate {{as long as it}} could <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> have been exercised since the coronation of Richard the Lionheart in 1189. Royal gains from the Quo warranto proceedings were insignificant; few liberties were returned to the King. Edward had nevertheless won a significant victory, in clearly establishing the principle that all liberties essentially emanated from the crown.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{problems}} persisted, leading to motion pictures and sound recording largely taking separate paths for a generation. The primary issue was synchronization: pictures and sound were recorded and played back by separate devices, which {{were difficult to}} start and maintain in tandem. Sufficient playback volume was also hard to achieve. While motion picture projectors soon allowed film to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> large theater audiences, audio technology before the development of electric amplification could not project satisfactorily to fill large spaces. Finally, there was the challenge of recording fidelity. The primitive systems of the era produced sound of very low quality unless the performers were stationed {{directly in front of}} the cumbersome recording devices (acoustical horns, for the most part), imposing severe limits on the sort of films that could be created with live-recorded sound.|$|E
5|$|Using global geometry, some spacetimes can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> contain {{boundaries}} called horizons, which demarcate {{one region}} {{from the rest}} of spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's horizon, is not a physical barrier.|$|E

5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E
5|$|Plantard then {{enlisted the}} aid of author Gérard de Sède {{to write a book}} based on his {{unpublished}} manuscript and forged parchments, alleging that Saunière had discovered a link to a hidden treasure. The 1967 book L'or de Rennes, ou La vie insolite de Bérenger Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château ("The Gold of Rennes, or The Strange Life of Bérenger Saunière, Priest of Rennes-le-Château"), which was later published in paperback under the title Le Trésor Maudit de Rennes-le-Château ("The Accursed Treasure of Rennes-le-Château") in 1968, became a popular read in France. It included copies of the found parchments (the originals were, of course, never produced), though it did not provide the decoded hidden texts contained within them. One of the Latin texts in the parchments was copied from the Novum Testamentum, an attempted restoration of the Vulgate by John Wordsworth and Henry White. The other text was copied from the Codex Bezae. Based on the wording used, the versions of the Latin texts found in the parchments can <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> have been copied from books first published in 1889 and 1895, which is problematic considering that de Sède's book was trying to make a case that these documents were centuries old.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary work on Vesperia {{began in}} 2005. Full {{development}} began in May {{of the following}} year and lasted approximately two years. Returning staff included producer Yoshito Higuchi, composers Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura, and character designer Kōsuke Fujishima. The writers included Takashi Hasegawa and Hideo Baba. Developed by the same team that made Tales of Symphonia and Tales of the Abyss, it was designed for the Xbox 360 as the PS3 had yet to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{the company and the}} former console was achieving international popularity. The anime cutscenes were created by Production I.G, with an art style influenced by cel-shaded animation. The game's theme song, Ring a Bell by Bonnie Pink, was used for both the Japanese and English releases. Upon release, the game was an international commercial success, selling over 600,000 copies worldwide. Critical reception has been generally positive, and further media related to the world of Vesperia has been developed.|$|E

5|$|The appeal {{began on}} 29 February 2008 in the Victorian Court of Appeal. Nine Network lawyers {{argued that the}} network {{should be allowed to}} {{broadcast}} the first three episodes of the series, arguing Justice King had erred in her decision to suppress the series because she had viewed the unedited version, rather than the final edited cut that was to <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> audiences. The network believed the first three episodes, which depicted events {{from the beginning of the}} underworld war in 1995, would have no potential to prejudice any part of the trial. Goussis's murder trial was due to begin on 31 March 2008. The judges overseeing the appeal retired to decide their verdict on 3 March 2008. Their decision on 26 March 2008 upheld Justice King's ruling that the series was not to be broadcast or distributed in or out of Victoria. During the appeal the Nine Network had proposed to screen the first three episodes immediately after any successful appeal, and would give the court seven days written notice of its intention to show any further episodes that it believed would not prejudice the murder trial. The Court of Appeal had dismissed the network's application to appeal, and the network was compelled to comply with the suppression order issued by Justice King until the offending trial was complete.|$|E
