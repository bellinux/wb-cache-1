5|$|The New Zealand Division {{continued}} to man its trenches along its {{section of the}} Somme front and regularly mounted trench raids. To the amusement of the New Zealanders, the German soldiers manning the trenches opposite were warned to avoid being captured <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be eaten. In June, the division was withdrawn to Authie. The New Zealanders returned to the Somme front in early July, and settled into a sector east of Hébuterne that included Rossignol Wood. As with the division's previous stint on the Somme, trench raids were often carried out. During a raid mounted on 23 July, Sergeant Richard Travis performed actions {{that led to a}} posthumous award of the VC; he was killed the next day. A prominent soldier and renowned for his scouting skills, his death was mourned across the division.|$|E

25|$|White {{believed}} in capitalistic America and used communist propaganda as leverage {{to promote his}} own cause in securing civil liberties. He advised white America to reconsider its position of unfair treatment <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> find the black population choosing radical alternative methods of protest. Ultimately, White and other NAACP leaders decided to continue involvement with the Scottsboro boys since it {{was only one of}} many efforts they had.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} around 300 'exiled' people with some connection to ETA. Some are exiled <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are actually wanted by the Spanish judiciary, and others <b>because</b> <b>they</b> believe <b>they</b> <b>might</b> {{be in the}} future. Around 100 are in France {{with the majority of}} the rest living in Mexico and Venezuela.|$|R

40|$|Assumptions {{are often}} made about students' needs, {{especially}} {{in the area of}} learning support. In this study 89 students were asked 8 questions relating to receiving learning support. The results are presented both qualitatively and quantitatively, and indicate that all students have individual needs that cannot be assumed. The findings reveal that the most common area of perceived need was in literacy. There were some differences between primary and middle school students' responses to withdrawal from the classroom, but the majority of students in both groups indicated a preference for withdrawal <b>because</b> <b>they</b> could concentrate better in an environment that was less noisy and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> felt <b>they</b> <b>might</b> look 'stupid' if they remained in class...|$|R
25|$|In 237, Zhou Zhi (周祗), a General of the Household (中郎將), {{wanted to}} recruit {{soldiers}} from Poyang Commandery (鄱陽郡) so he sought Lu Xun's opinion. Lu Xun {{believed that the}} people in Poyang were very restless and should not be recruited for military service <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> rebel. Zhou Zhi ignored Lu Xun's advice and persisted. As Lu Xun predicted, the people in Poyang started a rebellion under the leadership of Wu Ju (吳遽) and they killed Zhou Zhi and seized control of many counties. The people in the nearby Yuzhang (豫章) and Luling (廬陵) commanderies had a history of being rebellious, so they responded to Wu Ju's call and joined the revolt. Lu Xun led his forces to suppress the rebellion and succeeded in forcing Wu Ju and the rebels to surrender. He recruited over 8,000 men into his army and pacified the three commanderies.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the explosion, Mutsus {{magazine}} contained some 16-inch Type 3 [...] "Sanshikidan" [...] incendiary shrapnel shells, which had caused a fire at the Sagami arsenal several years earlier due to improper storage. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been the cause of the explosion, the minister of the navy, Admiral Shimada Shigetaro, immediately ordered the removal of Type 3 shells from all IJN ships carrying them, until the conclusion of the investigation into the loss.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Muhammad {{has long}} been {{featured}} {{as one of the}} many characters shown in an image of dozens of South Park residents during the show's opening credits. That image, however, has gone largely unnoticed, and thus has not drawn much controversy. When asked whether they feared retribution for mocking Muhammad, Parker said, [...] "We'd be so hypocritical against our own thoughts, if we said, 'Okay, well let's not make fun of them <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> hurt us. Okay, we'll rip on the Catholics because they won't hurt us, but we won't rip on [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> hurt us.'" [...] The Muhammad subplot in [...] "200", like the [...] "Cartoon Wars" [...] episodes, advocates for free speech and speaks out against censorship, both of Muhammad's image and any subject considered taboo. [...] "200" [...] also demonstrates the double standard in the handling of offensive images of Muhammad and other religious figures, particularly in the scene in which Muhammad is censored altogether, but Buddhism founder Gautama Buddha is shown snorting cocaine in front of the South Park children. The extreme measures the South Park boys go to in order to conceal Muhammad, like hiding him in a window-less truck and dressing him as a mascot, demonstrate the absurdity of the fear in showing the prophet, as does the fear of retaliation that the South Park residents show after Randy draws a stick figure-like drawing of him, which is not censored.|$|E

500|$|In May Van der Byl greeted news of massacres in Zaire as [...] "a {{blessing in}} disguise" [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> ensure that {{warnings}} about Soviet penetration in Africa were heeded. He denounced the British government {{the following month}} for refusing to recognise that a massacre of Elim missionaries was perpetrated by the Patriotic Front. As the date for the full implementation of the internal settlement grew nearer, Van der Byl's profile decreased, but he remained active in politics: he was elected unopposed for the whites-only Gatooma/Hartley seat to the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia House of Assembly. He handed over power to his African successor on 1 June 1979, and became instead Minister of Transport and Power and Minister of Posts in the new government.|$|E
500|$|When {{questioned}} further {{about the}} lyrics, Jackson denied that [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] was antisemitic, commenting [...] "It's not anti-Semitic because I'm not a racist person... I {{could never be}} a racist. I love all races." [...] That same day, Jackson received support from his manager and record label, who described the lyrics as [...] "brilliant", that they were about opposition to prejudice and taken out of context. The following day, David A. Lehrer and Rabbi Marvin Hier, leaders of two Jewish organizations, stated that Jackson's attempt to make a song critical of discrimination had backfired. They expressed the opinion that the lyrics used were unsuitable for young audiences <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not understand the song's context and that the song was ambiguous {{for some of the}} listeners. They acknowledged that Jackson meant well and suggested that he write an explanation in the album booklet.|$|E
500|$|Susie's ballads occupy roughly {{one-third of}} the film, {{performing}} {{a combination of both}} contemporary and classic standards. Rosenberg compared the character to actress Marilyn Monroe's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk in the film Some Like it Hot (1959). Susie's lack of singing experience is balanced by an [...] "ineffable vocal quality that causes people to listen, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be missing something." [...] Steve Vineberg, writing in the journal Film Quarterly, agreed that, despite her unimpressive voice, Susie [...] "wears a lyric tight to her skin, liked a zipped-up sleeping bag." [...] According to Télérama's Guillemette Odicino, the character has been [...] "endowed with a voice and a charm to take the breath." [...] Susie remains a heavily guarded individual until she performs [...] "Makin' Whoopee", which finally allows her to lower her defenses. When Susie performs the song, she is – for the first time – not singing to the audience, but to her sole accompanist Jack instead. According to Slant film critic Chuck Bowen, [...] "When Susie sings 'Makin' Whoopee' in a traffic-stopping red dress, mounting Jack's piano as if it's an extension of his very essence... all bets of detached, business-collaborative stability between the two are understood to be off." [...] Bowen also compared the character's performance to actress Rita Hayworth's in the film Gilda (1946). Prior to this moment, it almost appears as though a romantic relationship might never actually develop between the two characters. Observing that the character's tough attitude matches the difficult life she has been through, Janet Maslin of The New York Times believes that Susie must be [...] "singing from experience" [...] when she performs the song [...] "Ten Cents a Dance". Go Slow: The Life of Julie London author Michael Owen considers both Pfeiffer's performance and Susie herself to be a tribute to actress and singer Julie London, citing similarities such as asking her accompanist to perform [...] "More Than You Know" [...] in a slow tempo, swearing into a live microphone and delivering a [...] "sexy rendition" [...] of [...] "Makin' Whoopee", capturing [...] "some of the essence of Julie's style." ...|$|E
30|$|Additionally, it {{is often}} argued that foreign {{seasonal}} workers {{should be permitted to}} join and actively participate in unions in order to be less vulnerable and thus to be able to bargain for equal and fair working conditions. Both of these rights are vital and connected to each other. Workers might be afraid to join and actively participate in unions <b>because</b> <b>they</b> fear <b>they</b> <b>might</b> lose their job and thus also their residence permits.|$|R
5000|$|The central {{principle}} of freerunning {{is that one}} should express oneself by moving fluidly in one's environment; there are no limitations on the form of this movement. [...] Foucan expands {{on a number of}} basic principles of the sport in his book, Freerunning. [...] Other practitioners have suggested other principles. For example, Daniel Ilabaca encourages people to think positively, suggesting that practitioners of freerunning will sometimes fall—largely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> think <b>they</b> <b>might.</b>|$|R
25|$|About 5:00a.m., Griffin's {{division}} {{was told to}} move to the left to J. Boisseau's house. Since Warren did not know Pickett had withdrawn his force, he still expected Griffin to be able to intercept them. Griffin's force moved in line of battle with great care <b>because</b> <b>they</b> thought <b>they</b> <b>might</b> strike the Confederate force from White Oak Road while moving toward the Crump Road. The Confederates did not attack and Warren remained with Crawford until he reached Crump Road.|$|R
2500|$|During World War II, Nazi Germany {{was known}} to be {{conducting}} experiments using heavy water as moderator for a nuclear reactor design. Such experiments were a source of concern <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> allow them to produce plutonium for an atomic bomb. Ultimately it led to the Allied operation called the [...] "Norwegian heavy water sabotage", the purpose of which was to destroy the Vemork deuterium production/enrichment facility in Norway. At the time this was considered important to the potential progress of the war.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1780 {{or early}} 1781, Sullivan, who often {{claimed to be}} in {{financial}} straits, borrowed money from the French minister to Congress, probably with no intent or expectation of repayment. Sullivan already supported positions favorable to the French in Congress, but historian Charles Whittemore described Sullivan's conduct as [...] "ethically obtuse" [...] and as tarnishing his reputation. Yet, Sullivan worked to help the country and government on several matters such as seeking French financial support for the United States. Later in the year, Sullivan worked to get people appointed as peace negotiators, especially Benjamin Franklin, who were favored by the French <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not insist on western land claims and thereby help shorten the war by eliminating that issue. Of course, Sullivan alone could not have attained results on such matters without majority support. One of Sullivan's last acts was to vote for Robert Livingston for appointment {{to the position of}} United States Secretary of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
2500|$|A {{council of}} war was held between {{the leaders of}} the two sides in which the Earl of Sutherland and Lord Reay decided that due to their enemy’s {{superior}} numbers it would not be wise to fight. However, Munro of Foulis and his cousin George Munro, 3rd of Newmore were up for fighting. In a letter from Thomas Robertson in Inverness, dated 30 January 1716, the writer says that Mackenzie of Seaforth demanded hostages to ensure that the Earl of Sutherland and Munro of Foulis would not trouble his lands while he was absent in the south. Munro of Newmore apparently protested that although the enemy was superior in numbers that it was still their business to fight them <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have a chance of beating them, and if not they would still be able to [...] "scatter" [...] them. In the end the pro government clans marched off back to their homes.|$|E
50|$|Parents {{or other}} {{relatives}} of runaways also frequently {{turn to the}} hotline to find help in learning {{what they can do}} about a child who has run away, how to go about making an official report, and to get emotional support during the crisis. Often, parents call not because their children already are missing, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> fear <b>they</b> <b>might</b> run away in the future or because of ongoing problems involving discipline, drug abuse or alcohol abuse, truancy, etc.|$|R
25|$|The ministers {{reviewed}} the working of sectoral working groups {{and decided to}} add two new sectors namely, agriculture and culture.

2500|$|On 7 July 1989, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) {{handed down}} a {{unanimous}} judgment affirming the Commission's conclusion that Article 3 could be engaged by the extradition process {{and that the}} extraditing state could {{be responsible for the}} breach where it is aware of a real risk that the person may be subject to inhuman or degrading treatment. Amnesty International intervened in the case and submitted that, in the light of [...] "evolving standards in Western Europe regarding the existence and use of the death penalty", this punishment should be considered as inhuman and degrading and was therefore effectively prohibited by Article 3. This was not accepted by the ECHR, as the Convention does allow for the death penalty's use in certain circumstances. It followed that Article 3 could not {{stand in the way of}} the extradition of a suspect simply <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be subject to the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|The line {{is mostly}} underground, but has several surface or {{elevated}} sections between Sheppard West and Eglinton West, and between Bloor and Eglinton; some {{portions of the}} section between Bloor and Eglinton were originally open and have since been covered over to permit other uses above the tracks. Sections between Bloor–Yonge and the track short of , and between [...] and Eglinton remain in their original open state. Between Summerhill and St. Clair, the track was built in open cut, but has since been covered over. Evidence {{of this can be}} seen in the tunnel: there are no columns or walls between tracks, and ballast and drainage ditches are present, something not seen in the rest of the subway system. There are also tree stumps and the stubs of lamp posts in the tunnel. There are also clues outdoors: seemingly useless railings along the sides of a nearby street, which was once on an exposed bridge, and empty lots following the trains' right-of-way marked with signs warning heavy vehicles and equipment to keep off <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> fall through to the columnless tunnel below.|$|E
2500|$|A cave then {{opens in}} front of the three, and Moses bids Aaron to enter. [...] Moses wishes now to for Aaron to remove the priestly vestments (as God had suggested), but again is at a loss for words. [...] So, one more in an {{elliptical}} manner, Moses requests that Aaron leave the vestments with Eleazar outside the cave <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> otherwise become defiled in the cave (where there may be graves, Moses points out). [...] Aaron thinks it a wise idea, and leaves the vestments with Eleazar outside, but yet remains innocent {{of the nature of the}} circumstances. [...] Entering into the cave, Moses and Aaron see a bed, a set table, and candelabra and a ministering angel. [...] Aaron now inquires what message Moses has from God, and indicates that even if it be about his own death, that he will accept it gratefully. [...] Aaron having broached the subject, Moses now takes the opportunity to inform him that it is indeed the notice of Aaron's death which is the message God means for Moses to convey. [...] Not alarmed at the content of the message, Aaron is nevertheless perturbed that Moses did not tell him of his death in a more forthright manner. [...] However, Moses explains how Aaron's death will be more desirable than his own death, for Aaron is to be buried by his brother, and his honor was to be inherited by his children; dignities which will be denied to Moses himself. [...] (Aaron is appeased by this argument, being evidently oblivious to the pathos therein.) ...|$|E
