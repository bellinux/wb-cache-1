And, I must own, I am of the same mind; else it is in the power of a whore, after she has jilted and abandoned her husband, to confine him from the pleasure as well as convenience of a woman all the days of his life, which would be very unreasonable, and, as times go, not tolerable to all people; and the like on your side, madam." ...|$|E

6000|$|So he poses for {{my picture}} amidst the raw {{beginnings}} {{that were never}} to be completed. He did the strangest things about that place, things more and more detached from any conception of financial scale, things more and more apart from sober humanity. He seemed to think himself, at last, released from any such limitations. He moved a quite considerable hill, and nearly sixty mature trees were moved with it to open his prospect eastward, moved it about two hundred feet to the south. At another time he caught a suggestion from some city restaurant and made a billiard-room roofed with plate glass beneath the waters of his ornamental lake. He furnished one wing while its roof still awaited completion. He had a swimming bath thirty feet square next to his bedroom upstairs, and to crown it all he commenced a great wall to hold all his dominions together, free from the invasion of common men. It was a ten-foot wall, glass surmounted, and had it been completed as he intended it, {{it would have had}} a total length of nearly eleven miles. Some of it towards the last was so dishonestly built that it collapsed within a year upon its foundations, but some miles of it still stand. I never think of it now <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of the hundreds of eager little investors who followed his [...] "star," [...] whose hopes and lives, whose wives' security and children's prospects are all mixed up beyond redemption with that flaking mortar....|$|E
6000|$|I am, however, {{inclined}} to think {{that my father was}} not so much opposed as he seemed, to the modes of thought in which I believed myself to differ from him; that he did injustice to his own opinions by the unconscious exaggerations of an intellect emphatically polemical; and that when thinking without an adversary in view, he was willing to make room for a great portion of the truths he seemed to deny. I have frequently observed that he made large allowance in practice for considerations which seemed to have no place in his theory. His Fragment on Mackintosh, which he wrote and published about this time, although I greatly admired some parts of it, I read as a whole with more pain than pleasure; yet on reading it again, long after, I found little in the opinions it contains, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> in the main just; and I can even sympathize in his disgust at the verbiage of Mackintosh, though his asperity towards it went not only beyond what was judicious, but beyond what was even fair. One thing, which I thought, at the time, of good augury, was the very favourable reception he gave to Tocqueville's Democracy in America. It is true, he said and thought much more about what Tocqueville said in favour of democracy, than about what he said of its disadvantages. Still, his high appreciation of a book which was at any rate an example of a mode of treating the question of government almost the reverse of his--wholly inductive and analytical, instead of purely ratiocinative--gave me great encouragement. He also approved of an article which I published in the first number following the junction of the two reviews, the essay reprinted in the Dissertations, under the title [...] "Civilization"; into which I threw many of my new opinions, and criticised rather emphatically the mental and moral tendencies of the time, on grounds and in a manner which I certainly had not learnt from him.|$|E

Crowds are the most blunderin' blighted things that ever was. They're like an angry woman with a bandage over her eyes, an' you can't have anything more dangerous than that.

A lot happens on a subconscious level, so it's hard to verbalize, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> his songs taught me have to do primarily with the line, the phrasing, the tessitura, the accentuations of speech, the careful consideration of vowels, the breathing required, and an extremely economical use of accompaniment material, often the same figure going through the whole song." ...|$|E

Reading between the lines of those letters that Macinnery sent to the Daily Mail, I have wondered if Alec, finding that someone must be sacrificed, didn't deliberately choose George Allerton {{because he was the}} least useful to him and could be best spared.

40|$|A {{range of}} works on people’s {{understandings}} of their surroundings express a recurring assumption that, as societies become more urban and capitalist, people are decreasingly {{likely to engage}} in practical and material ways with their surroundings, and are consequently more likely to stand at a distance from those surroundings culturally. This assumption implies that practical engagement is the only form of engagement that leads people to meaning-ful and consequential relationships with their surroundings, that the alterna-tive to such engagement is something like the tourist gaze or the flâneur. Using a study of some environmental activists, this article raises questions about this assumption. Key Words ◆ conservation ◆ environment ◆ Jamaica ◆ nature I am concerned here with how people engage with and understand their surroundings, and how scholars have written about that engagement and understanding.
