25|$|A {{buffer strip}} {{is an area}} of land {{maintained}} in permanent vegetation that helps to control air, soil, and water quality, along with other environmental problems, dealing primarily on land that is used in agriculture. <b>Buffer</b> <b>strips</b> trap sediment, and enhance filtration of nutrients and pesticides by slowing down runoff that could enter the local surface waters. The root systems of the planted vegetation in these buffers hold soil particles together which alleviate the soil of wind erosion and stabilize stream banks providing protection against substantial erosion and landslides.

25|$|Vegetative {{barriers}} are narrower <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> of hardy, native, perennial grasses or shrubs planted in parallel rows to crops.

25|$|Swales and <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> {{are used}} to convey {{stormwater}} in lieu of pipes and provide a buffer strip between receiving waters (e.g. creek or wetland) and impervious areas of a catchment. Overland ﬂows and mild slopes slowly convey water downstream and promote an even distribution of flow. Buffer areas provide treatment through sedimentation and interaction with vegetation.|$|E
40|$|A {{riparian}} vegetated <b>buffer</b> <b>strip</b> {{is employed}} to intercept surface runoff, wastewater, surface and groundwater flows from upland {{sources for the}} purpose of reducing sediment, nutrient pollutants and other organic pollutants before they can entersurface waters and groundwater recharge areas. It is very importantto control the agricultural nonpoint source pollutants(ANSP) along theChi-Chia-Wang Creek for protecting the habitat of Taiwan Trout, {{which is one of the}} endangered species through artificial propagation in Taiwan. This study is to estimate the suitable width of vegetated <b>buffer</b> <b>strip</b> in the riparian of the creek using topographic analysis and attenuation model. The creek is susceptible to pollution because of high saturated hydraulic conductivity and excessive use of fertilizers in its nearby upland agricultural farmlands. The width of <b>buffer</b> <b>strip</b> varies with nutrient attenuation of soil layers. The estimated width of <b>buffer</b> <b>strip</b> calculates from potassium attenuation in the vegetable plot is the widest due to easy movement of potassium in the soil. This width can be recommended for maxium prventing of creek pollution by ANSP. The plow sole with more silt and/or clay content in the vegetable plot has the functioning of high adsorption capacity and low infiltration rate. Therefore it is a good buffer layer to decrease the potential pollution to groundwater.

2500|$|Contour <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> are {{strips of}} {{perennial}} vegetation alternated with wider cultivated strips of cropland. This type of buffer strip {{is most effective}} when runoff water enters uniformly as sheetflow. They are very adapted to trapping pesticides and reducing rill erosion. These buffers need {{to be at least}} [...] wide and make up for 20 to 30 percent of slope of an area. A lot of the time contour buffers {{can be used as a}} very inexpensive substitute for terraces.

2500|$|<b>Buffer</b> <b>strips</b> {{are very}} {{important}} in helping to provide habitat for many species of wildlife [...] in the open farm lands by causing an edge effect. [...] With much of the land open on farms having an edge allows a safe-haven for animals to move between different ecosystems.

[...] are especially important to pheasants, quail, chukar and songbirds because they provide the foods they need {{as well as the}} shelter from predators. Since most buffer strip areas have limited disturbance from farming it allows for a shelter to hide year round for many of the species including insects, birds, and mammals. When buffers run into and follow riparian areas along stream beds {{it is important to have}} larger vegetation like trees and shrubs that shade the water from the open sun. The water is then able to be cooler allowing for greater fish production and other aquatic plants and other biota to thrive in a less disturbed environment.|$|E
