5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always <b>been</b> <b>fun</b> for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

500|$|Overall, while fan {{reaction}} to her character had previously {{resulted in a}} backlash Gilsig found [...] "tough", she hoped that [...] "Mattress" [...] would be the episode in which [...] "anti-Terri fans joined Team Terri". Asked how she felt about Terri being a 'love to hate' character, Gilsig replied: [...] "As long as you love to hate her, that's OK. It would be a different show if there weren't characters like Terri or Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), otherwise you'd be at Disneyland. It would be the happiest place on Earth." [...] Gilsig {{does not know how}} long her character will feature in the series, and has explained [...] "When Terri was created, she was created obviously to be an obstacle between Emma and Will. They needed an obstacle, otherwise there's no show. What's <b>been</b> <b>fun</b> about it is that she's managed to emerge as a character unto herself with her own complexities." ...|$|E

500|$|The period under Pohl is {{regarded}} as the magazine's heyday; the three consecutive Hugo Awards won from 1966 to 1968 broke a long period in which the award had been monopolized by Analog (the name to which Astounding changed in 1960) and Fantasy and Science Fiction. Frank Robinson commented that [...] "Pohl {{was the only one who}} was surprised when he won three Hugos in a row for editing IF. It had <b>been</b> <b>fun,</b> and the fun had showed." [...] Niven's [...] "Neutron Star" [...] appeared in October 1966, and Harlan Ellison's [...] "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream" [...] appeared in March 1967; both won Hugo Awards. Pohl also managed to secure a new Skylark novel, Skylark DuQuesne, from E.E. Smith; the series had been started in the 1920s and was still popular with readers. Pohl also bought A.E. van Vogt's [...] "The Expendables"; the story was van Vogt's first sale in 14years and attracted long-time readers to the magazine. Another coup was the serialization of three novels by Robert A. Heinlein, including the award-winning The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, which ran in five parts from December 1965 to April 1966.|$|E
500|$|Sale el Sol is {{considered}} to be Shakira's return to her [...] "roots" [...] and is a [...] "fusion between rock and pop heavily influenced from Latino and Colombian music". Shakira said there are three [...] "directions" [...] of Sale el Sol: a romantic one, a [...] "very rock and roll" [...] one, and a [...] "Latino, tropical" [...] one. Explaining the romantic [...] "direction" [...] of the album, she said that it was something [...] "which I hadn't tapped into for the past three years, but it suddenly came to me and I couldn't hold it back. So it’s [...] got songs that are very intense, very romantic [...] ". Examples include ballads like [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] ("Before Six O'Clock") and [...] "Lo Que Mas" [...] ("The Most"); in the former Shakira delivers [...] "sad, emotional, and heartfelt vocals," [...] while in the latter she sings over a piano and string-supplemented melody. About the rock and roll [...] "direction" [...] of the album, Shakira said [...] "I started my career as a rock artist and then I kind of crossed over into pop, so it’s <b>been</b> <b>fun</b> to re-encounter that side of my artistic personality".|$|E
500|$|Visual {{effects were}} done by Rocket Science VFX and Mr. X Inc. Paul Jones {{served as the}} special effects creator, who {{previously}} designed the Nemesis character in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The production team planned to use extras to portray 300 zombies at once, but time restraints prevented that. Around 150 zombies were eventually used and Mr. X Inc's visual effects supervisor, Dennis Berardi, added more in post-production. For Alice's clones they shot motion control photography for multiple passes of Jovovich. For the wide shots they took digital photo doubles. Visual effects production manager Eric Robertson described {{the look of the}} film, [...] "interesting contrasts, pure whites, which is a staggering look. It's so clean and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of Silent Hill. So we've got the extremes, but it's definitely a unique look for this incarnation and it's <b>been</b> <b>fun</b> to see those looks." [...] A burned cityscape with ash and smoke in the sky was created to depict a postapocalyptic Los Angeles, in which most of the film is set. Bolt described this approach as, [...] "In a world that has gone to hell in a handbasket, there's no control and no fire service, so clearly, what's going to happen to LA is it's going to get burned." ...|$|E

500|$|Angel season four {{played with}} audience's {{expectations}} of the now heroic Cordelia by revealing her to be the season's Big Bad; it was later established that Cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called Jasmine. The storyline was controversial with fans, and Carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed Cordelia seduced Angel's teenage son. Carpenter has said, [...] "I'm in denial about that whole storyline. It was creepy." [...] She tried to keep a positive attitude about the situation, though; [...] director Terrence O'Hara commented that he thought Carpenter had [...] "a lot of fun" [...] playing a manipulative Cordelia in the episode [...] "Orpheus" [...] because she enjoyed coming up with Cordelia's new [...] "schizophrenic madwoman" [...] characterization. David Boreanaz was also unsettled by the incestuous pairing. At a [...] 2004 convention he admitted that the season four storyline [...] "freaked him out." [...] The episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia's character, where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite {{the birth of the}} child they conceived together. In an effort to stop Connor, the Powers That Be send the spirit of Connor's mother Darla (Julie Benz) to convince him not to go through with it. The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black, while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality. Steven S. DeKnight, who wrote and directed the episode, felt this was a brilliant role-reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire. Much of season four's storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter's real-life pregnancy; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] she is left in a coma {{for the remainder of the}} fourth season. Crusie discusses what she felt were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season, It's that she betrays the man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely; it's that she seduces a boy she once diapered; it's that she dresses like a drag queen and talks like a Dynasty reject. It's that she's not Cordy, and what might have <b>been</b> <b>fun</b> to watch had we been let into the secret before the Beastmaster seduced Connor becomes the extended rape and death of a much-beloved character.|$|E

This {{was in the midst of}} Banksy's highly publicized month-long residency in New York City, during which he released a new piece each day somewhere in the city and posted clues to its whereabouts on his website.

2500|$|Waithe meanwhile, was {{originally}} enlisted {{to write the}} majority of the album's songs along with songwriter and vocal coach Ali Tamposi; in an interview about the project, Tamposi said [...] "it's been really cool and laid back so that's <b>been</b> <b>fun.</b> There's a lot of angst and edge in Ciara's music and we've tried to be really conceptual and write things that haven't been done before and real strong women empowerment songs." [...] Along with The Underdogs (Harvey Mason and Damon Thomas), the duo wrote the album's original title track [...] "One Woman Army". They also contributed at least one other song, [...] "Washaway", though neither song appears on the final album following the change of album titles. [...] "Washaway" [...] and another song called [...] "Running" [...] were amongst several songs previewed by the media which didn't make the album. It {{was the first time in}} her career that Ciara had collaborated with The Underdogs. Not all of the Waithe and Tamposi collaborations went to waste, [...] "Read My Lips" [...] (written by Harris, Waithe and Jerkins) and [...] "Overdose" [...] (written by Waithe, Tamposi, Oliver Goldstein and Josh Abraham) both made the album.|$|E

The game has all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a next-generation game including bump mapping and 480p support on the visual end, and five channel surround sound via Dolby Pro Logic II on the aural end." [...] Marc Saltzman of Playboy gave it a score of 90% and stated that, [...] "The combined package of beautiful graphics, intense action (including force-feedback rumble support in the controller!) and familiar Star Wars ditties all work together to create an immersive, outstanding experience from beginning to end." [...] In The Cincinnati Enquirer, he gave the game four stars out of five and stated that, [...] "If there was ever a reason to purchase this compact new console, this is it... there's no multiplayer mode. It would have <b>been</b> <b>fun</b> to fly alongside or against another player in some of the missions." [...] Alex Porter of Maxim gave it a similar score of eight out of ten and said: [...] "More than a Jedi mind trick to make you buy Nintendo's new whiz-bang console, this is the closest a video game has come to recreating a Star Wars movie." ...|$|E
