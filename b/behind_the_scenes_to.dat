5|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes.</b> <b>To</b> fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the film to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who digitally altered the footage until it was deemed suitable. The episode's title is a reference to Folie Ã  deux, a form of insanity shared by two people. It usually begins with one person who conceives of a delusional belief and then spreads it to another; thus, those two share the same delusion.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of Valor por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without any explanation. A new page with the same name was created by other administrators, who said {{that they did not know}} what had happened to the original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, Frank is shot by Lucas Goodwin, in an {{assassination}} attempt, and {{falls into a}} coma. While Frank is in surgery, Claire helps guide Frank's vice president Donald Blythe through a diplomatic crisis with Russia. While Frank is receiving a liver transplant, she declines {{going to the hospital}} in favor of negotiating a treaty with Petrov, and strong-arms him into accepting the U.S.' terms. When Frank recovers from surgery, he agrees to let Claire be his vice president. He and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill {{for the sole purpose of}} creating an atmosphere divisive enough to pick off the potential running mates. In the ensuing open convention, they publicly endorse Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) for the job, while working <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> undermine her and ensure that Claire wins enough delegates to be nominated. Meanwhile, she reluctantly honors her mother's request to help her die. She and Frank then use the public sympathy from Elizabeth's death to win the nomination; they are now running mates.|$|E

5|$|When he returns, Moody {{takes him}} to his office, and reveals himself to be Voldemort's 'faithful servant'; {{he was the one}} who put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, and has been guiding him through the tournament from <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> ensure that he would grab the Portkey first. Before Moody can kill Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape intervene. They learn that Moody is in fact Barty Crouch Jr., Mr. Crouch's son, {{disguised}} by Polyjuice Potion. Crouch had sentenced Crouch Jr. to life imprisonment in Azkaban over alleged ties to the Death Eaters but smuggled him out as a last favour to his dying wife. Crouch Jr. was the one who set off the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup, doing it to scare the Death Eaters he felt had abandoned Voldemort. Eventually, Voldemort had gotten in contact with Crouch Jr. and had him impersonate Moody as part of his plan. Crouch Jr. also admits to killing Crouch Sr., to prevent him telling Dumbledore about Voldemort. The real Moody is found inside Crouch Jr.'s enchanted trunk and rescued. Harry is then declared the winner of the Triwizard Tournament and given his winnings.|$|E
