2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses went {{up from the}} steppes of Moab to Mount Nebo, and God showed him the whole land. God told Moses {{that this was the}} land that God had sworn to assign to the {{descendants}} of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. So Moses the servant of God died there, in the land of Moab, at God's command, and God buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, near Beth-peor, although no one knew his burial place. Moses was 120 years old when he died, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> undimmed and his vigor unabated. The Israelites mourned for 30 days. Joshua was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him, and the Israelites heeded him.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his coming}} to Town for the Winter, as he {{generally}} does, {{he went to}} the Levee with the Duke of Portland, who went with Lord William to kiss hands on his going into the Guards—while Lord William was kissing hands, The King was talking to The Duke, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>were</b> fixed on [...] who was standing in the Crowd, and when He said His say to The Duke, without waiting for 's coming up in his turn, The King went up to him, and, after the usual questions of {{how long have you been}} in Town and the weather, He said you have been very much employed of late, and very much confined. [...] said, no, Sir, not more than usual—You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w'ont hear, and none so blind as those that w'ont see— made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done—You cannot be vain—You have been of use to us all, it is a general opinion, is it not so Lord Stair? who was standing near. It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said —I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.|$|E
60|$|He became {{suddenly}} still. <b>But</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> active with hate.|$|E
60|$|He {{thinks he}} has awakened his friend. He lies a little turned away, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> surely open.|$|R
6000|$|He came, the bard, {{a little}} Druid wight, [...] Of {{withered}} aspect; <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> keen, [...] With sweetness mixed. In russet brown bedight, [...] He crept along, etc.|$|R
60|$|It {{needed only}} this last blow to {{complete}} the humiliation that whitened Mulrady's face. <b>But</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> none the less clear and his voice none the less steady {{as he turned to}} Don Caesar.|$|R
60|$|No {{doubt he}} was listening, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> on the parlor-door.|$|E
60|$|The Sicilian {{interrupted}} her. His {{face was}} marble white, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> afire.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} Waterall leaned forward. His manner was quiet, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> glittering.|$|E
6000|$|GENERAL CANYNGE nods. He is a slim man {{of about}} sixty, very well [...] preserved, {{intensely}} neat and self-contained, {{and still in}} evening [...] dress. His eyelids droop slightly, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> keen and <b>his</b> [...] expression astute.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{brother is}} very young," [...] he said. [...] "He {{will be a}} brave warrior and a great hunter some day, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> not opened yet. Were he to try he would leave his scalp to dry in the 'Rappahoes' lodges." ...|$|R
6000|$|The detective {{sat down}} at a desk quietly, and even without hesitation; <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> the iron <b>eye</b> of a judge at assize. He made a few rapid notes upon paper in front of him, and then said shortly: [...] "Is {{everybody}} here?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} humorous smile about his mouth. <b>But</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> serious and pleading.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he turned}} and faced her. His face was ghastly white, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> hot and red.|$|E
60|$|The cowboy's {{voice was}} gay and bantering, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> alight with a spirit that frightened the hunter.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked with}} me to my door, and there I met old Pettigrew coming down the steps. He looked dusty and tired, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> {{brighter}} {{than it used to}} be, and he carried in a rather unaccustomed manner, a workman's tool basket.|$|R
60|$|Old Hans himself {{answered}} the thought by {{opening the door}} at that moment. He was a short, thick-set, and very powerful man, of apparently sixty years of age, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> as bright and his step as light as that of many a man of twenty.|$|R
60|$|Let us now {{change the}} scene. Why is that crowded {{assembly}} so attentive--so silent? Who is speaking? It is our old friend, the little disconsolate schoolboy. <b>But</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> flashing with intellect, his face fervent with emotion, his voice breathes like music, and every mind is enchained.|$|R
60|$|Scully did not speak; <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> {{bursting}} {{out of his}} head, and {{his face}} was the exact colour of a deputy-lieutenant's uniform.|$|E
60|$|Gyp's {{heart began}} to beat desperately. Monsieur Harmost had not moved. A faint grin slowly settled in his beard, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> startled.|$|E
60|$|He {{dismissed}} {{the man who}} had pushed the chair and gave Mordaunt a quick glance. Bernard's brows were white, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> keen.|$|E
60|$|He stopped short, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> sister's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> fixed {{upon him}} enquiringly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But it was! From the Altar of Victory at Anderida to the First Forge in the Forest here is twelve miles {{seven hundred}} paces. It {{is all in}} the Road Book. A man doesn't forget his first march. I think I could tell you every station between this and----' He leaned forward, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> caught by the setting sun.|$|R
60|$|True to his appointment, Owen arrived {{alone on}} a car chosen with all regard to Horatia's comfort, and was most {{actively}} attentive in settling on it the ladies and their luggage, stretching himself out on the opposite side, his face raised to the clouds, as he whistled an air; <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> still restless, and his sister resolved on questioning him.|$|R
60|$|Ann {{looked at}} him fixedly, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> once more on his paper. She gave a little sigh, and turned to her work again.|$|E
60|$|He {{rubbed his}} cheek. The hurt {{had not been}} great, {{so far as the}} blow was concerned. <b>But</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> dark with pain and anger.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{smiled a}} little, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> wild. He {{was silent for}} a while. He looked at her sullenly. He hated, despised, and loved her.|$|E
60|$|Drummond felt {{tempted to}} refuse, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> employer's <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> {{on him and}} he obeyed sullenly.|$|R
60|$|Cartwright was frankly puzzling. He {{looked like}} a sober country gentleman, and {{this was not the}} type Lister had thought to meet. His clothes were fastidiously good, his voice had a level, {{restrained}} note, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> like a hawk's, as Vernon had said. Now and then one saw a twinkle of ironical amusement and some of his movements were quick and vigorous. Lister thought Cartwright's blood was red.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they are}} going to reprieve him," [...] she continued, [...] "why do they let him suffer these agonies? Why do they not tell him so at once? I saw him this morning. He says nothing. He is as brave as a man can <b>be,</b> <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> awful, and when he tries to speak his voice dies away. Oh! Mr. Deane, do something! Oh! do something!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{other men}} shifted {{from one foot}} to another and there were {{deep-drawn}} breaths. Jim Cleve alone seemed quiet and cool. <b>But</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> ablaze.|$|E
6000|$|A proud man was the Roman, [...] His speech {{a single}} one, [...] <b>But</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> like an eagle's eyes [...] That {{is staring at}} the sun.|$|E
60|$|He {{said very}} little, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> eloquent; the clutch {{of his arms}} was eloquent. He was the {{playground}} of unspeakable emotions. These, you know, were real Magics.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are poor}} calashes without sense," [...] commented Wasub with pitying superiority. [...] "Some {{with no more}} {{comprehension}} than men of the bush freshly caught. There is Sali, the foolish son of my sister and by your great favour appointed to mind the tiller of this ship. His stupidity <b>is</b> extreme, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> good--nearly as good as mine that by praying and much exercise can see far into the night." ...|$|R
50|$|Zadig, a good-hearted, {{handsome}} young man from Babylonia, {{is in love with}} Sémire and they are to marry. Sémire, however, has another suitor: Orcan, who wants her for himself. Zadig tries to defend his love from Orcan's threat, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> injured in the process. Sémire abhors this injury, causing her to depart with his enemy. Shortly after, Zadig makes a full recovery and falls into the arms of another woman, Azora, with whom he is married, but who promptly betrays him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, old fellow, what is this? This {{will never}} do," [...] said Owen. <b>But</b> <b>his</b> own <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> full of tears also, and {{he too was}} nearly past speaking.|$|R
