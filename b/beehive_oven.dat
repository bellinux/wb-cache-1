25|$|Historic {{records and}} {{structural}} {{studies indicate that}} the main house and detached kitchen were built in 1798. Both are constructed of coquina rock quarried on nearby Anastasia Island. Coquina rock construction positions {{the house in the}} upper tier of St. Augustine residences of the Second Spanish Period. It is an exceptional example of St. Augustine Plan architecture. This hybrid style blends elements of Spanish Colonial architecture with more elegant Federal-style architecture introduced during Florida's British Period (1763-1784). The property's detached coquina kitchen with <b>beehive</b> <b>oven</b> is the only original 18th century detached kitchen in St. Augustine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Beehive</b> <b>ovens</b> {{were also}} used in {{iron-making}}. Before this time, iron-making utilized large quantities of charcoal, produced by burning wood. As forests dwindled dangerously, the substitution of coke for charcoal became common in Great Britain, and the coke was manufactured by burning coal in heaps {{on the ground in}} such a way that only the outer layer burned, leaving the interior of the pile in a carbonized state. In the late 19th century, brick <b>beehive</b> <b>ovens</b> were developed, which allowed more control over the burning process.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>beehive</b> <b>oven</b> {{typically}} {{took two}} to three hours to heat, occasionally even four hours in the winter. Breads were baked first when the <b>beehive</b> <b>oven</b> was hottest, with other baked items such as cinnamon buns, cakes, and pies. As the oven cooled, muffins and [...] "biscuits" [...] could be baked, along with puddings and custards. After a day's baking there was typically sufficient heat to dry apples and other fruits, vegetables, or herbs. Pots of beans were often placed {{in the back of the}} oven to cook slowly overnight.|$|E

5000|$|Between 1870 and 1905, {{the number}} of <b>beehive</b> <b>ovens</b> in the US skyrocketed from about 200 to almost 31,000, which {{produced}} nearly 18,000,000 tons of coke in the Pittsburgh area alone. One observer boasted that if loaded into a train, “the year's production would make up a train so long that the engine {{in front of it}} would go to San Francisco and come back to Connellsville before the caboose had gotten started out of the Connellsville yards!” The number of <b>beehive</b> <b>ovens</b> in Pittsburgh peaked in 1910 at almost 48,000.|$|R

50|$|The main entrance, with {{sidelights}} and transom, opens onto {{an interior}} {{with a central}} hall plan on both floors.

Many rooms retain original finishes, such as the wall plaster, wideboard flooring and exposed ceiling beams, along with some original molding.|$|E
50|$|In 1756, the house's {{irregular}} shape {{was somewhat}} squared when {{the purchase of}} land to the north yielded an opportunity to build a final northern addition of single-room plan with stair-hall and separate chimney. The building achieved its present form {{with the construction of}} a kitchen lean-to at the western end of the house, containing one of the largest fireplaces of the period, with three <b>beehive</b> <b>ovens.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ovens {{were used}} {{throughout}} the 1930s. By 1942 several new <b>beehive</b> <b>ovens</b> had been constructed to meet the increased demand for coke for smelting purposes though the actual market for this coke remains unknown (see also Klondyke Coke Ovens). In 1945 and 1946, Klondyke and Bowen in northern Queensland were the only coke producers in Queensland, with Klondyke turning out approximately a sixth of Queensland's coke production.|$|R
50|$|The most {{traditional}} fish is salt cod, which up {{until very recently}} was baked in the outdoor <b>beehive</b> <b>ovens</b> with potatoes and tomatoes in season. Gilt-head bream is popular because it is relatively inexpensive and like sea bass extensively farmed. Until recently, salted herrings bought whole out of wooden barrels were a staple food. They are still enjoyed, {{but not as much}} now, as fresh fish and meat are regular alternatives.|$|R
50|$|Access to the {{basement}} kitchen is from the hall in the eastern section {{of the house and}} from an exterior door on the south elevation. A <b>beehive</b> <b>oven</b> survives on the east wall; however, the fireplace has been rebuilt. The basement {{on the west side of}} the house is unfinished; however log joists are not typical and may have been later replacements.|$|E
50|$|The Miller-Kingsland House is {{the oldest}} {{recorded}} home in Boonton and is listed on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places. The original Dutch house was one-room with a sleeping attic, built by Johannes Miller in 1740. This room, which is complete with a large cooking fireplace and <b>beehive</b> <b>oven,</b> makes up the west wing of the current structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{opening for}} the <b>beehive</b> <b>oven</b> {{in the kitchen}} {{fireplace}} {{is located at the}} back of the fireplace. This placement necessitated a wide hearth so that the user could enter the fireplace to access the oven. The rear oven location was abandoned for the more convenient location to the side of the fireplace opening (less chance of burning the user) about 1800 on Cape Cod.|$|E
2500|$|The Dunlap {{coke ovens}} are the {{remnants}} of a coke production facility near Dunlap, in the U.S. state of Tennessee.
