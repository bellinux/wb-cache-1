40|$|Batches of film-formers {{were created}} via {{emulsion}} polymerisation from a formulation supplied by Celanese. These film-formers were then {{incorporated into a}} formulation as supplied by St. Gobain Vetrotex which is used in industry to produce a working glass fibre size. Initial studies were undertaken to determine {{the location of the}} constituent species present in the size to produce an image of its structure. The film-former formulation was then altered to produce a range of physical properties. The performance of sizes produced from these film-formers were then investigated in the areas of clarity, film formation, wetting ability and strength. Alterations to the size formulation was then undertaken to determine whether this produced any effect in the performance of the size over some of the same areas of investigation. The conclusions drawn are listed below:• The coupling agent species present in the size formulation migrates to the glass interface of the size during drying. • A minor amount of lubricant migrates to the air interface of the size during drying. • Migration of species in the size only occurs during drying when the size is in its liquid state. • The molecular weight and particle size of a film-former {{is directly related to the}} initiator and first stage monomer concentrations respectively. • The molecular weight of a film-former does not alter the size's ability to form a continuous film if dried under suitable conditions. Film-formers with large particle sizes produce inhomogeneous films due to incomplete diffusion occurring during film formation. • The inhomogeneity of films with larger particle sizes present produces an increasingly optically active film with an increased wet-out rate. • The molecular weight and particle size of a film-former do not alter the corresponding sizes ability to wet a <b>bare</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> due to the large amount of water present in the size formulation. • A size can be redistributed following successive re-wetting and drying under certain conditions. •The stiffness of a size is directly related to the molecular weight of the sizes film-former. • An inhomogeneous, discontinuous size will be formed with excessive deviation from the size formulation. • An excess of coupling agent is present in the standard size formulation...|$|E

Fibre length distribution (FLD), Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) together with characterisation of thermal, dynamic mechanical and mechanical properties were carried out on moulded specimens. FLD analyses revealed that composites with relatively high <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> loading exhibited low number average fibre length (Ln) and weight average fibre length (Lw) values than those containing relatively low <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> content. Due {{to the presence of}} added functional groups, a difference in the FTIR spectra for treated and untreated nanoclay powder was observed. XRD analyses showed that the interaction between nanoclay and PP matrix resulted in the intercalation of the polymer chains, which increased the nanoclay interlayer distance, as the TEM micrographs showed intercalated morphologies. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the incorporation of untreated nanoclay into the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite improved the thermal stability of the material. Further enhancement of this property was observed with the presence of treated nanoclay. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) study showed that the incorporation of untreated clay into <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite shifted the melting and crystallisation temperatures to higher values. Furthermore, the degree of crystallinity was strongly influenced by the presence of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> and nanoclay in the matrix. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) showed an increase in the storage modulus, indicating higher stiffness in case of the hybrid composites when compared to the clay nanocomposite, <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite and pure PP matrix. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> and nanoclay content showed a strong influence on the magnitude of tan δ. Incorporation of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> into the PP matrix reduced the tensile strength of the binary composites, indicating a poor fibre-matrix interfacial adhesion. However, by introducing the untreated nanoclay in the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite, the strength of the ternary hybrid composites increased. In addition, tensile modulus was enhanced with incorporation of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> and further increased with an introduction of untreated nanoclay. On the other hand, the flexural modulus and strength were found to increase with <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> and nanoclay loadings. Further enhancement in tensile and flexural properties was observed with the presence of treated nanoclay. For <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite and clay nanocomposite, the peak load (P) and critical stress intensity factor (Kc) increased with filler contents. By contrast, the fracture energy (W) and critical strain energy release rate (Gc) decreased with the addition of nanoclay in the hybrid composites.

The long chain branching (LCB) in LDPE resulted in higher increases both in the Elastic (Young’s) modulus in the solid state and in the Storage modulus in the melt.

Impact strength shows great enhancement by the introduction of a slight amount of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre.</b> Density of the hybrid composite decreases as the volume fraction of the OPEFB fibre increases. Hardness of the composites also showed a slight decrease on an increased volume fraction of OPEFB fibre. Scanning electron micrographs and optical photographs of the fractured surfaces were taken to study the failure mechanism and fibre/matrix interface adhesion. The experimental results were compared with theoretical predictions. The hybrid effect of <b>glass</b> and OPEFB <b>fibre</b> was also calculated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
