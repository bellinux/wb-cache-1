After her death, the original hoard was dispersed to various European collections. Eventually fourteen of the statuettes reached the British Museum.|$|R

50|$|His private lodgings were modest, but {{he rented}} space for his gallery in Palazzo Rusticucci-Accoramboni, Rome, where he welcomed visitors. The palazzo, {{in the former}} piazza Rusticucci, was {{demolished}} by Benito Mussolini {{along with the rest}} of the spina of medieval and renaissance houses to make way for the expansive via della Conciliazione, leading to piazza San Pietro. A catalogue of the Galleria Massarenti was printed in 1881, when the prelate contemplated selling the collection to Prince Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst at Strasbourg. At that time connoisseurship of Old Master paintings was in its infancy, and the works received highly optimistic traditional attributions. An English-language Catalogue of pictures, marbles, <b>bronzes,</b> <b>antiquities...</b> Palazzo Accoramboni (Rome: Forzani) was published in 1894, with a view to attracting prospective purchasers. The catalogue was assembled by a painter Edouard van Esbroeck, still with such wishful attributions that the catalogue cast somewhat of a temporary cloud over the collection as a whole. Joseph Duveen, his famous nephew recalled, had been less than impressed by the authenticity of the paintings, and Duveen's close associate Bernard Berenson, played an uncertain role in the sale of the collection, disparaging the attribution to Raphael of Massarenti's Madonna of the Candelbra in a letter to Isabella Stewart Gardner in 1897.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, in November 1773 he was {{appointed}} British resident at Venice, where his official duties left leisure for the pursuit of his antiquarian studies. He resigned his diplomatic post in 1788, and settled at Ridge, near Barnet. But he paid several further visits to Italy {{in connection with the}} transportation of the valuable collections that he had formed there, not only of books, manuscripts, and antiquities, but also of pictures, chiefly by Bellini and other Venetian masters. On 4 July 1793 he was created an honorary D.C.L. at Oxford. He died at Ridge on 19 March 1799, and by his will directed the whole of his collections to be sold—the pictures by private contract; the prints, drawings, busts, coins, medals, <b>bronzes,</b> and <b>antiquities</b> by Christie's; the natural history cabinets by King, and the library by Leigh & Sotheby's. The sale of the library alone occupied twenty-nine days in March and April 1801. A valuable catalogue was compiled by Samuel Paterson (Dibdin, Bibliomania, p. 590).|$|R

50|$|Situated in the {{north-east}} of the Republic of Macedonia Cocev Kamen (Цоцев Камен) is {{a hilltop}} cave site of volcanic origin {{near the town}} of Kratovo.

Authors agree that the site served as a gathering point for sacrificial rituals from the Neolithic, the <b>Bronze</b> age, throughout <b>antiquity</b> until the Middle Ages as clarified by an abundance of pottery shards, stone (flint) tools and bone fragments unearthed from the surrounding areas. Several caves and rock shelters are decorated with red figurative art work. Comparison with similar sites in Bulgaria and Italy suggest that the paintings are indeed prehistoric.|$|R
25|$|In 1797, {{at the end}} of Napoleon's triumphant first Italian campaign, convoys of wagons began {{arriving}} in Paris, carrying <b>bronze</b> horses, Greek <b>antiquities,</b> tapestries, marble statues, paintings and other works of art taken from Italian cities under the terms of peace agreed by the Austrians. They included works by Raphael, Leonardo Da Vinci, Titian, Paolo Veronese and other masters. Other convoys arrived from the Netherlands and Flanders with more art from the Spanish provinces. The more famous works were displayed on wagons in a festive victory parade through the center of Paris. The rest was crammed, unwrapped, into the corridors, galleries and stairways of the Louvre. Work began to rebuild the Gallery of Apollo and other galleries to provide a home for the new art.|$|R
40|$|From <b>antiquity</b> <b>bronzes</b> {{have been}} widely used to produce sculptures and others objects of art. Bronze {{artefacts}} are generally covered with a patina. The patina formed in a long term exposition acquired often a certain protective effect of the substrate metal, but a recent increase of air pollution and/or acid rain damage the bronze exposed in urban environment. A method that reinforces a protective effectiveness of patina becomes therefore necessary. In order to preserve metal works from the aggressive atmosphere, organic inhibitors are often required. The inhibiting effects of two non-toxic organic inhibitors: 1 -phenyl- 4 -methylimidazole and 1 -(p-tolyl) - 4 -methylimidazole on the patina were examined by potentiodynamic methods and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as well as spectroscopic methods. The morphology and crystallographic structure of artificially obtained patina without and with inhibitor layer were examined with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Elemental Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. The results of these investigations have shown that both studied inhibitors protect patina in aggressive media...|$|R
5000|$|Veleia, {{an ancient}} town of Aemilia, Italy, {{situated}} about 15 km south of Placentia. It is mentioned by Pliny among {{the towns of}} the eighth region, though the Veleiates were ethnically Ligurians. Its inhabitants were, in the census of Vespasian, found to be remarkable for their longevity. Nothing further was known of it until 1747, when some ploughmen found the famous Tabula alimentaria, now in National Archaeological Museum of Parma. This, the largest inscribed <b>bronze</b> tablet of <b>antiquity</b> (1.3 m by 2.8 m) contains the list of estates in the territories of Veleia, Libarna, Placentia, Parma and Luca, in which Trajan had assigned before 102 CE 72,000 sesterces and then 1,044,000 sesterces on a mortgage bond to forty-six estates. The total value of which was reckoned at over 13,000,000 sesterces (~130,000), the interest on which at 5% was to serve {{for the support of}} 266 boys and 6 girls, the former receiving 16, the latter 12 sesterces a month.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{work was}} carried out to {{the east side of}} the college, {{fronting}} onto Turl Street, in 1756 under Thomas Pardo (principal from 1727 to 1763). A new doorway replaced the previous Elizabethan one, and the front of the college was remodelled in the Palladian style - oblong sash windows were inserted at all levels and the original gables on the Turl Street side of the building were removed. Pardo himself gave £157 10s towards this work, although this only met the mason's bill of £156 18s 11d and not the other large bills for the work. In the opinion of Ernest Hardy, a college fellow who wrote a history of the college in 1899 and who served as principal from 1921 to 1925, this [...] "complete transformation" [...] gave the college a [...] "somewhat incongruous appearance". The result was also said to resemble a [...] "prison". One writer at the time, however, thought that the changes had not gone far enough. Thomas Warton, the Oxford Professor of Poetry, wrote a letter about architecture in Oxford to Jackson's Oxford Journal in 1766. He included Pardo's alterations to Jesus College in his list of improvements, but advocated replacing the chapel window with one in another design:The Front of Jesus College, within these few years, has been cleared from the <b>Bronze</b> of <b>Antiquity,</b> and beautified with a modern Portico.

40|$|As {{the first}} {{approaching}} life-sized, freestanding, sensuous, <b>bronze</b> nude since <b>Antiquity,</b> Donatello’s <b>bronze</b> David {{is a critical}} monument of the Italian Renaissance. It {{is also one of}} the most enigmatic. David is nude, but not completely unclothed, wearing a feminine-looking hat and knee-high boots. David holds a rock and a sword, while standing suggestively, on the head of Goliath. He stands in a relaxed contrapposto stance. His left hand, held to his hip, holds a stone. His right hand is resting on an oversized sword, which points downward to the helmet of Goliath, between the feet of David. As Zuraw pointed out in a talk at the 2000 Renaissance Society of America Meeting, we see different points in the narrative of the story of David and Goliath: holding the stone, before making the fatal sling shot strike, and standing on the decapitated head of Goliath after the kill. (1) The image of David slaying Goliath was rare in art before Donatello, who created an earlier David in 1408 – 16. Before Donatello’s images, David was usually portrayed as a prophet, psalmist, or ancestor of Christ. (2) The nudity of Donatello’s David is certainly not unique, but the nudity of the later David by Michelangelo, as an example, does not seem as strange as the nudity of Donatello’s.

40|$|In this {{doctoral}} thesis I experiment {{with images of}} damaged ancient figurative sculpture, physical space and {{a specific set of}} materials in order to generate a fresh understanding of how one’s personal experiences mingle with the residues, presences and traces of others peoples’ pasts, presents and perhaps, futures. Two questions drive this thesis. How are materials and material culture caught up with remembering? And, how are the broken stone and <b>bronze</b> bodies of <b>Antiquity</b> entangled with our contemporary social dimension? First investigating early photography’s association with violence and then considering the material properties and qualities of ancient figurative sculpture I investigate the relationships between materials and remembering. This research then goes on to coin and explore the the concept of premembering which through the development of this thesis I have come to define as a distributed system of memory-related cognition that extends beyond the individual and is enacted through a process of active externalism that embraces both the properties and qualities of materials in processes of mutual participation. Then taking this highly personal and psychic sensation to a social level, I examine premembering as the materially triggered understanding of events, circumstances or conditions that one may have not directly experienced, but which one’s culture already knows and stores up for all its future participants. Finally, considering this notion of premembering within the context of Michel Serres’ conception of collective acceptance, complicity and intentionality (in relation to violence), I consider the contemporary socio-cultural legacies of damaged ancient figurative sculpture and question how, through the conflation of the properties, qualities and sensed histories of materials, premembering might be considered a future-shaping force that can be made manifest in original artworks...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{assesses the}} influence of Edward Perry Warren (1860 - 1928) {{on the development of}} collegiate collections of Greek and Roman art and the rise of art history and archaeology in elite academic institutions in the United States. It employs archival research to explore Warren 2 ̆ 7 s motivations for acquiring thousands of antiquities which he sold or gave to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and six collegiate museums and study collections. Organized into six chapters, this multidisciplinary dissertation describes Warren 2 ̆ 7 s roles at these institutions. It highlights antiquities that have figured prominently in scholarship and that demonstrate the range and variety of his collecting tastes. In the first three chapters, the dissertation places Warren 2 ̆ 7 s collecting in light of its social, economic, intellectual, and cultural backdrop and considers how Warren both reflects and diverges from his family 2 ̆ 7 s values. It also weighs how Warren 2 ̆ 7 s sexuality impacted his collecting tastes and resulted in the establishment of his antiquities emporium in Lewes, England. It chronicles his partnership with John Marshall, Edward Robinson, and John Davidson Beazley and ascertains what is known about his relationships with those who established the classical collections at Harvard, Bowdoin, the University of Pennsylvania, Bryn Mawr, the University of Chicago, and the Rhode Island School of Design. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 function as a selective catalogue of Warren 2 ̆ 7 s antiquities, organized by medium. Chapter 4 is devoted to a discussion of how the Greek vases and other ceramic antiquities he obtained for American collections have been pivotal in developing the American scholarship on these objects. Chapter 5 considers the impact of Warren 2 ̆ 7 s collecting on Greek numismatics as well as on ancient gems, jewelry, ivory, and glass. Chapter 6 features <b>bronze</b> and stone <b>antiquities</b> that illustrate his connoisseurial acumen. This dissertation argues that the collecting of Edward Perry Warren is essential to understanding the rise of art history and archaeology as academic disciplines in the United States. Antiquities that he obtained for American collections continue to figure prominently in the scholarship and exhibitions focusing on Greek and Roman material culture and social history...|$|R
