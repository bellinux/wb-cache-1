25|$|The Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer (QLTR), {{an office}} {{held by the}} Crown Agent who is the senior officer of the Crown Office in Scotland, is {{responsible}} for claiming <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> {{on behalf of the}} Crown in Scotland. Finders of items are required to report such finds to the Crown Office or to the Treasure Trove Unit (TTU) at the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh. Each find is assessed by the Scottish Archaeological Finds Allocation Panel, which decides if the find is of national importance. If it is, the matter is referred by the TTU to the QLTR department at the Crown Office, which will inform the finder that it has accepted the Panel's recommendation to claim the objects in the find as treasure trove or <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{administrator}} (sometimes {{known as}} the administratrix, if female) acts as the personal representative of the deceased in relation to land and other property in the UK. Consequently, when the estate under administration consists wholly or mainly of land, the court will grant administration to {{the heir to the}} exclusion of the next of kin. In the absence of any heir or next of kin, the Crown has the right to property (other than land) as <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia,</b> and to the land by virtue of the historic land rights of the Crown (and the Duchy of Cornwall and Duchy of Lancaster in their respective areas). If a creditor claims and obtains a Grant of Administration, the court compels him or her to enter into a bond with two sureties that he or she will not prefer his or her own debt to those of other creditors.|$|E
25|$|A {{resulting}} trust {{will also be}} found where the purposes of a trust have been completed, but there is excess property left over; for example, a trust by a settlor to provide for his children's university education. Judges and academics disagree over what should happen to the property; possibilities are {{that it should be}} held for the donors, that it should be held for the beneficiaries (as the donors intended to make an irrevocable gift) or that it should be given to the Crown as <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia.</b> A fourth suggestion is that the trustees take the surplus, as in Re Foord. The general rule was set out in Re Trusts of the Abbot Fund, where it was decided that excess funds will be held on {{resulting trust}} for the settlor. There are exceptions to this rule; the general rule is put aside if the court can find intention to benefit specific individuals, as in Re Osoba.|$|E
25|$|Linked to this {{category}} {{is the problem}} of unincorporated associations. Unincorporated associations cannot hold rights (chattels or land) on their own account. When they dissolve, the question is then what to do with property that has been transferred to the association. The traditional view, as laid out in Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts, is that the members of the association hold these rights on purpose trust. Where the money was raised from identified individuals, the property should be held on resulting trust for donors upon the failure of the purpose trust. Where it is impossible or impractical, the property should be passed to the Crown as <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia.</b> The more modern view developed from Walton J's judgment in Re Bucks Constabulary Benevolent Fund. This is that dissolving a society and distributing property to its members is a matter of contract, not trusts law. As such, the contract between the association's members should be the deciding factor in how the property is to be distributed, and {{there is no need to}} involve resulting trusts. If the contractual provisions identify how to distribute property, they will be followed; if not, the property will be distributed according to an implied term, usually in equal shares.|$|E
2500|$|The Treasure Act 1996 {{does not}} apply in Scotland. Treasure trove in Scotland is dealt with under the common law of Scotland. The general rule that governs <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> ("vacant goods") – that is, objects that are lost, {{forgotten}} or abandoned – is quod nullius est fit domini regis ("that which belongs to nobody becomes our Lord the King's [...] "), and the law of treasure trove is a specialized application of that rule. As in England, the Crown in Scotland has a prerogative right to treasure trove for {{it is one of}} the regalia minora ("minor things of the King"), that is, property rights which the Crown may exercise as it pleases and which it may alienate (transfer to another party).|$|E
2500|$|The duchy was {{established}} in 1337 out of the former earldom of Cornwall by Edward III of England for his son, Edward, Prince of Wales, the [...] "Black Prince", who became the first Duke of Cornwall. The Duke obtained greater rights over Cornwall than the Earls had previously exercised. These increased powers over Cornwall included the right to appoint Sheriffs, <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia,</b> treasure trove, a separate exchequer, and such forth. Most of these rights are still exercised by the Duchy. The Kilbrandon Report (19691971) into the British constitution recommends that, when referring to Cornwall, official sources should [...] "on all appropriate occasions" [...] use the designation of Duchy when referring to Cornwall itself, in recognition of its [...] "special relationship" [...] with the Crown.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the common}} law of Scotland, the law of {{treasure}} trove {{was and still is}} a specialized application of the general rule governing <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> ("vacant goods") – that is, objects that are lost, forgotten or abandoned. The rule is quod nullius est fit domini regis: [...] "that which belongs to nobody becomes our Lord the King's [...] ". The Crown in Scotland has a prerogative right to treasure trove for {{it is one of the}} regalia minora ("minor things of the king"), that is, property rights which the Crown may exercise as it pleases and which it may alienate (transfer to another party). As the Scottish law of treasure trove on the matter has not changed, it is discussed in the [...] "Present-day legal definitions" [...] section below, under the subheading [...] "Scotland".|$|E
2500|$|To {{qualify as}} {{treasure}} trove, an object must be precious, {{it must be}} hidden, and there must be no proof of its property or reasonable presumption of its former ownership. Unlike under English common law, treasure is not restricted to only gold and silver objects. In 1888 a prehistoric jet necklace and some other articles found in Forfarshire were claimed by the authorities though they were neither gold nor silver. A compromise was eventually reached, and the find was deposited in the National Museum of Scotland. In July 1958, a porpoise bone was found together with 28 other objects of silver alloy (12 brooches, seven bowls, a hanging bowl and other small metal work) underneath a stone slab marked with a cross {{on the floor of}} St. Ninian's Church on St. Ninian's Isle in Shetland. The objects were dated to about 800 A.D. A dispute having arisen over ownership of the objects between the Crown on the one hand, and the finder (the University of Aberdeen, which had carried out the archaeological excavation) and the landowner on the other, in Lord Advocate v. University of Aberdeen (1963) the Court of Session held that the bone should be regarded as treasure trove together with the silver objects. Further, the requirement that an object must be [...] "hidden" [...] means no more than that it must be concealed; it refers to the condition in which the object was found and does not refer back to the intention which the owner of the object may have had in hiding it. Finally, the requirement that there must be no reasonable presumption of former ownership means that it must not be possible to trace the ownership of the object to a person or family currently existing. Even if an object does not qualify as treasure trove, it may be claimed by the Crown as <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Porkele {{had been}} {{formerly}} {{included in the}} manor given to Waltham Abbey; together the latter manors comprised [...] [...] Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1402–1460) held these manors leaving them in 1458 to his third son John Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire when his son died without issue in 1499, {{under the terms of}} grant the elder branch, the following Duke of Buckingham inherited. [...] His heirs sold them on the dissolution to Lord Berners who died in debt in 1533 resulting in <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> and seizure by the Crown. [...] In 1570 Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset (as Lord Buckhurst, later Lord High Treasurer, held the 'manor of Caterham and Portele farm,' which he conveyed in that year to Henry Shelley; Sir Thomas's Sondes's widow leased the lands in 1599 to her half-brother, Main Plot seditionist Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham. [...] Then in 1615 her daughter Frances Leveson gave the rest of that lease, due the tenant's attainder to Sir Edward Barrett and Walter Barrett while the reversion was held by Sir Richard Sondes. [...] George Ede purchased this massive estate in 1612 and it passed to Jasper Ockley in 1616. [...] Sir Isaac Shard who was one of two Sheriffs of the City of London in 1730 who conveyed it to Thomas Clark and then passed as with the other manors; in 1911 W. L. Williams its owner lived at Portley in what remained of the estate. [...] De Stafford School in Caterham on the Hill occupies {{a small part of the}} estate and is named after the earlier known owner. [...] Adjoining Sunnydown School, state-run, is at what was Portley House and is for secondary education for boys with a Statement of Special Educational Needs.|$|E
2500|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about associations' property, that came to be the dominant and practical view, was first stated by Brightman J in Re Recher's Will Trusts. Here it was said that, if no words are used that indicate a trust is intended, a [...] "gift takes effect in favour of the existing members of the association as an accretion to the funds which are the subject-matter of the contract". In other words, property will be held according to the members' contractual terms of their association. This matters for deciding whether a gift will succeed or be held to fail, although that possibility is unlikely on any contemporary view. It also matters where an association is being wound up, and there is a dispute over who should take the remaining property. In a recent decision, Hanchett‐Stamford v Attorney‐General Lewison J held that the final surviving member of the [...] "Performing and Captive Animals Defence League" [...] was entitled to the remaining property of the association, although while the association was running any money could not be used for the members' private purposes. On the other hand, if money is donated to an organisation, and specifically intended to be passed onto others, then the end of an association could mean that remaining assets will go back to the people the money came from (on [...] "resulting trust") or be <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia.</b> In Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts, Goff J held that a fund set up for the dependants of police staff, which was being wound up, which had been given money expressly for reason of benefiting dependants (and not to benefit the members of the trust) could not be taken by those members. The rules have also mattered, however for the purpose of taxation. In Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell it was held that the Conservative Party, and its various limbs and branches, was not all bound together by a contract, and so not subject to corporation tax.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{resulting}} trusts, {{where the}} courts have presumed that the transferor would have intended the property return, there are resulting trusts which arise by automatic operation of the law. A key example is where property is transferred to a trustee, but too much is handed over. The surplus will be held by the recipient on a resulting trust. For example, in the Privy Council case of Air Jamaica Ltd v Charlton an airline's pension plan was overfunded, so that all employees could be paid the benefits that they were due under their employment contracts, but a surplus remained. The company argued that it should receive the money, because it had attempted to amend the scheme's terms, and the Jamaican government argued that it should receive the money, as <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> because the scheme's original terms had stated money was not {{to return to the}} company, and the employees had all received their entitlements. However, the Privy Council advised both were wrong and the money should return to those who had made contributions to the fund: half the company and half the employees, on resulting trust. This was in response, according to Lord Millett, [...] "to the absence of any intention on his part to pass a beneficial interest to the recipient." [...] In a similar pattern, it was held in Vandervell v Inland Revenue Commissioners that an option to repurchase shares in a company was held on resulting trust for Mr Vandervell when he declared the option to be held by his family trustees, but did not say who he meant the option to be held on trust for. Mr Vandervell had been trying to make a gift of £250,000 to the Royal College of Surgeons without paying any transfer tax, and thought that he could do it if he transferred the College some shares in his company, let the company pay out enough dividends, and then bought the shares back. However, the Income Tax Act 1952 section 415(2), applied a tax to a settlor of a trust for any income made out of trusts, if the settlor retained any interest whatsoever. Because Mr Vandervell did not say who the option was meant to be for, the House of Lords concluded the option was held on trust for him, and therefore he was taxed. It has also been said, that trusts which arise when one person gives property to another for a reason, but then the reason fails, as in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd are resulting in nature. However, Lord Millett in his judgment in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley' ',(dissenting on the knowing receipt point, leading on the Quistclose point) recategorised the trust which arises as an immediate express trust {{for the benefit of the}} transferor, albeit with a mandate upon the recipient to apply the assets for a purpose stated in the contract.|$|E

Proceeds from <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> in the Duchy are divided between two registered charities. <b>Bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> arises, in origin, by virtue of the Royal Prerogative and in some respects remains the position although the right to <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> of the two major categories is now based on statute: Administration of Estates Act 1925 and the Companies Act 2006.|$|E

50|$|Goff J held all {{money was}} <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia,</b> {{except for the}} {{donations}} and legacies which were a resulting trust. He rejected that the members could claim {{a share of the}} property on the basis that the contract gave them any such right. Regarding the different sources he said, (1) because the members’ contract governed their contributions and gave them no claim to any residue, it was <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia,</b> (2) the raffles and sweepstakes contract also gave the participants no right to the leftovers, and thus that money was also now <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> (3) collection box money was also <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> because those people paid money out and out, with no intention for it to be returned {{in the event of a}} fund’s dissolution. But (4) those who left donations or legacies could be regarded as having intended money should be retained only so long as the fund operated. So anything left over would be a resulting trust. The distribution of property between the members was only possible where the group existed for the benefit of the members.|$|E

5000|$|For most of England and Wales, the <b>Bona</b> <b>Vacantia</b> Division of the [...] Government Legal Department is {{responsible}} for dealing with <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> assets {{on behalf of the}} Crown. If no heirs to an estate can be found then the assets are realised and the balance is transferred to HM Treasury. The division deals only with solvent estates whose net value exceeds £500. The assets of dissolved companies automatically pass to the Crown by law. They are realised by the division and the revenue passed to the Exchequer, although the division has a power to disclaim onerous assets. Liabilities associated with assets do not automatically follow those assets into <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia.</b> Care should be taken to distinguish between assets remaining when dissolution commences (which, e.g., might be distributed to shareholders or others in that process) and those that for various valid reasons remain undistributed at the end of dissolution.

50|$|In England (with the {{exception}} of Lancashire, Manchester and Cornwall), the Treasury Solicitor is the Crown's nominee for the collection and disposition of ownerless property (<b>bona</b> <b>vacantia).</b> This typically comprises the assets of dissolved companies and the estates of persons who die intestate and with no known kin.|$|E

50|$|In Scotland, <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> {{deals with}} assets of {{dissolved}} companies, {{the assets of}} missing persons and lost or abandoned property; lost or abandoned property involves a statutory saving for the Crown in ss.67-79 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. It is mostly controlled by Common Law with some statutes dealing with specific matters such as lost property; the concept also extends to such matters as Treasure trove The separate doctrine of ultimus haeres states that the assets of those who die intestate leaving no other person entitled to inherit pass to the Crown. Both of these rights, together with treasure trove, are administered by the Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, an office held by the Crown Agent, the senior official in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). <b>Bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> assets in Scotland are not aggregated with those from elsewhere in the United Kingdom, being paid directly into the Scottish Consolidated Fund.|$|E

50|$|If {{a person}} dies {{intestate}} with no identifiable heirs, the person's estate generally escheats (i.e. is legally assigned) to the Crown (via the <b>Bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> {{division of the}} Treasury Solicitor) or to the Duchy of Cornwall or Duchy of Lancaster when the deceased was a resident of either; in limited cases a discretionary distribution might be made by one of these bodies to persons who would otherwise be without entitlement under strict application {{of the rules of}} inheritance.|$|E
50|$|If {{there are}} no {{relations}} of the deceased, by blood or by adoption, and no surviving spouse, the fiscus or State is entitled, after the lapse of thirty years, to claim the estate as <b>bona</b> <b>vacantia</b> (unclaimed property) {{in terms of the}} common law.
