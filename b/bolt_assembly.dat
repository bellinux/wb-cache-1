5|$|The Cooperativa Obrera Mataronense (Mataró Workers' Cooperative) was Gaudí's {{first big}} project, {{on which he}} worked from 1878 to 1882, for Salvador Pagès i Anglada. The project, for the cooperative's head office in Mataró, {{comprised}} a factory, a worker's housing estate, a social centre and a services building, though only the factory and the services building were completed. In the factory roof Gaudí used the catenary arch {{for the first time}}, with a <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> system devised by Philibert de l'Orme. He also used ceramic tile decoration {{for the first time in}} the services building. Gaudí laid out the site taking account of solar orientation, another signature of his works, and included landscaped areas. He even designed the Cooperative's banner, with the figure of a bee, symbol of industriousness.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of the}} design was {{that it did not}} use a traditional helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much like a large clock spring, in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The operating rod had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly.</b> At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the operating rod forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|E
2500|$|Switching a Desert Eagle {{to another}} {{chambering}} requires {{only that the}} correct barrel, <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly,</b> and magazine be installed. Thus, a conversion to fire the other cartridges can be quickly accomplished. The rim diameter of the [...]50 AE (Action Express) {{is the same as}} the [...]44 Remington Magnum cartridge, consequently only a barrel and magazine change is required to convert a [...]44 Desert Eagle to the larger, more powerful [...]50 AE round. The most popular barrel length is 6 in (152mm), although a 10 in (254mm) barrel is available. The Mark XIX barrels are machined with integral scope mounting bases, simplifying the process of adding a pistol scope.|$|E

40|$|In {{structural}} fire engineering, {{the importance of}} <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> is often overlooked. Connection design uses the temperature-dependent bolt strength-reduction factors prescribed in Eurocode 3, despite the existence of two distinct failure modes under tension; necking of the bolt shank, and thread-stripping. While literature exists to predict failure modes at ambient temperature, there is no method for failure mode prediction for elevated temperatures where ductility is critical to avoid collapse. Galvanised M 20 structural <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> and <b>bolt</b> material from a single batch have been tested under tension at a range of temperatures and strain-rates typical of those experienced in fire. Turned-down bolt test data produced stress-strain curves characteristic of different microstructures at ambient temperature, despite a tempered-martensitic microstructure being specified in the standards. The failure modes of <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{were found to be}} dependent on the as-received microstructure at ambient temperature. At elevated temperatures, however, only thread-stripping was observed...|$|R
40|$|In {{structural}} fire engineering, {{the importance of}} <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> is often overlooked. Connection design uses the temperature-dependent bolt strength-reduction factors prescribed in Eurocode 3, despite the existence of two distinct failure modes under tension; bolt breakage, and thread-stripping. This thesis investigates the factors which influence failure modes at ambient and elevated temperatures {{and a range of}} strain-rates through microstructural characterisation, tensile testing and finite element modelling. Microstructural characterisation carried out on M 20 galvanised <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> consisting of Grade 8. 8 bolts and Property Class 10 nuts from a range of manufacturers has highlighted that, despite a specified tempered-martensite microstructure, microstructural variations existed between different manufacturers and within a single batch. These microstructural variations not only affected the flow behaviour of the bolt material but determined the failure modes of <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> at ambient temperatures. Tensile testing of turned-down bolts allowed the temperature and strain-rate dependent flow behaviour of bolt material to be investigated, eliminating the effect of thread deformation. The flow curves obtained were input to a finite element model to represent true bolt material behaviour, which was validated against force-displacement curves obtained from uniaxial tensile testing of <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> from the same batch. Both experimental and finite element modelling work have highlighted the importance of using a tight thread tolerance class combination and a suitably tall nut to ensure ductile bolt breakage failures and avoid thread-stripping. ...|$|R

50|$|The roller-locked <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> {{consists}} of a bolt head, two rollers, a striker sleeve, bolt body, and a large return spring, {{which is responsible for}} pushing the <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> into battery (the locked position) and returning it there when it is unlocked and pushed backwards by the recoil of firing or by the charging handle. As the striker sleeve is movable back and forth within the <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly,</b> the return spring is also responsible for pushing the striker sleeve forward during locking (described below). The <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> locks with the barrel's breech (the end the cartridge is loaded into) via a prong type barrel extension behind the breech. As it is recoil-operated and fired from an open bolt, the weapon must be manually charged with the side-mounted charging handle.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{principal}} failures of <b>bolting</b> <b>assemblies</b> is the fretting. The combination of vibration and service load can introduce the damage of fretting fatigue on the contact surfaces of the assembly which lead at a nucleation of crack and then the structure fracture. Contact pressure or clamping force and displacement at the interface or relative slip are two important factors which control the fretting wear and the fretting fatigue. This paper describes the effect of clamping force (tightening torque) on the fretting fatigue behaviour of <b>bolted</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Both fretting fatigue experiments and simulation with FEM were carried out. With the increase of contact force, the sites of cracks initiation changed {{from the edge of}} the central hole to the free edge of the contact zone and the fretting fatigue life increase dramatically. A good correlation was found between the FEM simulations and the experimental results...|$|R

A new automated torque system was successfully demonstrated in this test. This torque control tool was found to be very precise and accurate. The <b>bolted</b> <b>assembly</b> performance was further evaluated using the Nozzle Structural Test Bed. Both current socket head cap screw and proposed multiphase alloy bolt configurations were tested. Results indicated that joint skip and bolt bending were significantly reduced with the new multiphase alloy bolt design. This paper summarizes all the test results completed to date...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The primary aim of {{the study}} was to explore the current {{practice}} of occupational therapists when assessing standing performance during Functional Capacity Evaluations (FCEs). Methods: A semi-structured interview was conducted with occupational therapists and the participants were interviewed using both open and closed questions. Participants: A sample of occupational therapists (n= 20) from Queensland, Australia were involved in a survey. They were all experienced in conducting FCEs. Results: Ninety percent of the respondents used a distracting task during the assessment of standing with standardised and non-standardised nuts and <b>bolts</b> <b>assembly</b> tasks the most commonly used. Respondents reported using a mix of biophysical, physiological and psychophysical clinical observations to assess standing. The nuts and <b>bolts</b> <b>assembly</b> activities used by the respondents were rated to be of low interest in terms of engaging the client. Conclusions: It was identified there are minimal guidelines in the literature which focuses on assessment of standing in FCEs. Questions were raised regarding the adequacy of the use of nuts and bolts activities as a suitably distracting task in FCEs and further research is required on assessing standing in functional capacity evaluation including the use of suitably distracting activities...|$|R
30|$|Another issue {{concerns}} the modeling {{of the bolt}} itself. In practice, some of {{the parameters of the}} <b>bolted</b> <b>assembly</b> are not precisely determined, as the preload of the nut or the friction coefficient. Such types of problems have been analyzed by dedicated techniques for the bolt computation [37, 38], including multiresolution [39]. The use of the proposed non-intrusive techniques allows to extend these studies to the case of 2 D– 3 D structural analyses in a straightforward manner. In addition, the use of model reduction techniques for the global model itself, as proposed in [40] should lead to a very significant reduction of the computational time.|$|R

Inspired by these recent advances, and by the computational effort that has been accomplished during the past 10 years for the simulation of discontinuities by the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM), an extended correlation technique is introduced for capturing shear-band like discontinuities from images of real mechanical tests.
