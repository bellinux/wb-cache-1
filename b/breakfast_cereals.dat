5|$|Iron is pervasive, but {{particularly}} rich sources of dietary iron include red meat, lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and blackstrap molasses. Bread and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> are sometimes specifically fortified with iron. Iron in low amounts {{is found in}} molasses, teff, and farina.|$|E

The Benefits of <b>Breakfast</b> <b>Cereal</b> Consumption: A Systematic Review of the EvidenceBase demonstrates <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> eaters {{are more likely to have}} a healthier diet and to weigh less, and are less likely to suffer from certain diseases, than people who eat other options, or who have no breakfast at all...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that both negative life events and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumption are associated with the incidence and severity of subjective symptoms of upper respiratory tract illnesses (URTIs) Two studies were conducted to examine whether objective markers of illness were also associated with stress and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumption. The results from the first study showed that regular <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumption was associated with lower sub-lingual temperatures in volunteers with URTIs. Stress had no effect on temperature. In the second study nasal secretion weight was lower in regular <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumers but was not influenced by stress. These studies suggest that <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumption is associated with reduced illness severity and that this does not reflect stress levels. Further research is now required to determine whether such results are directly due to cereal consumption or reflect correlated attributes, such as other aspects of the diet...|$|R
5|$|Iron {{provided}} by dietary supplements is often found as iron(II) fumarate, although iron(II) sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate), is often added to {{foods such as}} <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids and is also available {{for use as a}} common iron supplement. Glycine, the cheapest and most common amino acid is most often used to produce iron glycinate supplements.|$|E
5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are red meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals.</b>|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that regular consumption of <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> is associated with lower stress levels and reports of better physical and mental health. The present study examined this issue using an objective indicator of stress, salivary cortisol. The results showed that stress was associated with higher cortisol levels and daily consumption of <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> was associated with lower cortisol levels. Although {{it was not possible to}} rule out all the alternative explanations of the association between <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumption and cortisol, analyses did show that the effect could not be accounted for by general health or nutritional status. The effects of <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumption and stress were also independent, which shows that the effects of breakfast found here cannot be due to stress buffering. Further research manipulating the nutrient content of the <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> is now required to provide further information about the mechanisms underlying this effect...|$|R

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} in Australia that compares the nutritional {{impact of a}} <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>breakfast</b> to a non-cereal breakfast, and includes the type of cereal. This study investigated the impact of breakfast choice and the total sugar content of <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> on nutrient intakes and anthropometric measures among Australian children and adolescents. Data from 2 to 18 -year-old in the 2011 – 2012 National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey were used (n = 2821). Participants were classified as <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumers (minimally pre-sweetened (MPS) or pre-sweetened (PS)), non-cereal breakfast consumers, or breakfast skippers. Foods consumed for breakfast, foods added to the cereal bowl, {{and the impact of}} breakfast choice on daily nutrient intakes and anthropometric measures were determined. Although only 9 % of children skipped breakfast, 61 % of skippers were aged 14 – 18 years. Among breakfast consumers, 49 % had <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal,</b> and 62 % of these exclusively consumed MPS <b>cereal.</b> <b>Breakfast</b> skippers had a higher saturated fat intake than <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumers, and lower intakes of dietary fibre and most micronutrients (p < 0. 001). Compared with non-cereal <b>breakfast</b> consumers, <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumers had additional free sugars intake, lower sodium, and higher total sugars, carbohydrate, dietary fibre, and almost all other micronutrients (p < 0. 001). The only difference in nutrient intakes between MPS and PS cereal consumers was higher folate among PS consumers. No associations between anthropometric measures and <b>breakfast</b> or <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> choice were found. The highest prevalence of breakfast skipping was among 14 – 18 -year old. <b>Breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumers had higher intakes of dietary fibre and most micronutrients compared with non-cereal breakfast consumers and skippers, and almost no differences were found between MPS and PS cereal consumers...|$|R
