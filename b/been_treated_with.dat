5|$|The {{causes of}} vampiric {{generation}} were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly {{a dog or}} a cat, was feared {{to become one of}} the undead. A body with a wound that had not <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> boiling water was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the Russian Orthodox Church while they were alive.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{assessment}} is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local pain, or systemic symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics {{may be necessary}} to relieve pain. Antivenom has been historically given for adults suffering severe local pain or systemic symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or systemic pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or excessive sweating (diaphoresis). A significant proportion of bites will not result in envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2–20% of bite victims have <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> antivenom. In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six were treated with the antivenom.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer that has not <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E

30|$|NB 4 and HL 60 cells <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> 1 μmol/L ATRA (Sigma, USA) for 4 days {{to induce}} granulocytic differentiation. Bone marrow cells from APL {{patients}} <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> 1 μmol/L ATRA for 7 days for granulocytic differentiation. For siRNA knockdown assays, NB 4 cells were electroporated with siLRRC 25, and 6 h later, the cells <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> 1 μmol/L ATRA for 48 h. For shRNA knockdown assays, NB 4 cells stably transfected <b>with</b> pGIPZ-shLRRC 25 <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> 1 μmol/L ATRA for 96 h. For LRRC 25 knockout assays, knockout cells or KO cells with restored LRRC 25 <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> 1 μmol/L ATRA for 96 h.|$|R
30|$|Patients <b>with</b> ocular {{toxoplasmosis}} <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> {{a combination}} of pyrimethamine (100 mg the first day then 50 mg daily), azithromycin (500 mg the first day then 250 mg daily), and prednisone for 4 to 6 weeks. Patients <b>with</b> rickettsiosis <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> a 2 -week course of oral doxycycline. Patients <b>with</b> Behçet’s uveitis <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> systemic corticosteroids associated with immunosuppressive therapy (azathioprine for the first patient and {{a combination of}} azathioprine and cyclosporine for the second patient). Patient <b>with</b> ocular tuberculosis <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> antituberculous therapy (four drugs for 2 months followed by two drugs for 7 months) associated with oral corticosteroids. Patients with idiopathic retinal vasculitis, Crohn’s disease, and IRVAN syndrome <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> oral corticosteroids.|$|R
5|$|Politically the {{expedition}} {{had been a}} disaster, yet Warwick gained recognition for his leadership since morale had been high and the civilian population had <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> unusual respect. The Earl's rewards were the Welsh lordship of Ruthin and the Order of the Garter, which was awarded to him while still in France in April 1563. His war injurywhich never properly healedmade him ineligible for posts like Lord President of the Council of the North or Lord Deputy of Ireland when they were suggested {{for him in the}} future. Elizabeth Lady Tailboys had also died while her husband was in France, and on 11November 1565 Ambrose Dudley married for the third time. His bride was the 16-year-old Anne Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford. Robert Dudley, meanwhile Earl of Leicester, had arranged the match. It was an extraordinary court event. In between tournaments and banquets, the bride was given away by the Earl of Leicester {{in the presence of the}} Queen; she later became one of Elizabeth's closest friends.|$|E

The cure rate of the 430 cases was 69.3 % and the improvement rate was 26.3 %, suggesting that this group of patients were still sensitive to the third generation cephalosporins {{which could be used}} as the empirical therapy of PM.|$|R

25|$|Once isolated, the {{diastereomer}}ic β-hydroxysilanes are separated. One diastereomer <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> acid, {{while the}} other <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> base, thus converted the material to an alkene with the required stereochemistry.|$|R
25|$|Studies in Pakistan showed {{diclofenac}} caused acute {{kidney failure}} in vultures when they ate the carcasses of animals that had recently <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> it.

25|$|For platinum-sensitive tumors, platins are {{the drugs}} {{of choice for}} second-line chemotherapy, in {{combination}} with other cytotoxic agents. Regimens include carboplatin combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel. Carboplatin-doublet therapy can be combined with paclitaxel for increased efficacy in some cases. Another potential adjuvant therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrences is olaparib, which may improve progression-free survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival. (Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> chemotherapy.) For recurrent germ cell tumors, an additional 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for those tho have <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> surgery or platins.|$|E
25|$|One {{survey of}} adults that had <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> {{replacement}} cadaver GH (which {{has not been}} used {{anywhere in the world}} since 1985) during childhood showed a mildly increased incidence of colon cancer and prostate cancer, but linkage with the GH treatment was not established.|$|E
40|$|Methods: All M genitalium {{positive}} patients (34 men and 26 women) attending an STD clinic {{during a}} 6 month period <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> antibiotics.

40|$|Aneurysms of the A 1 {{segment of}} the {{anterior}} cerebral artery (ACA) are rare and challenging to treat. We evaluated our experience of endovascular treatment in 11 patients with A 1 segment aneurysms of ACA. Seven aneurysms <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> coiling; three <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> stent-assisted coiling and one <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> balloon-assited coiling. Endovascular treatments were technically successful and without complication. Follow-up examinations showed complete cure in all 11 patients...|$|R
25|$|Hormonal {{fluctuations}} {{that contribute}} to cyclical attacks in women have <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> oral contraceptives and luteinizing hormones to shut down menstrual cycles. However, oral contraceptives have also triggered photosensitivity and withdrawal of oral contraceptives has triggered attacks. Androgens and fertility hormones have also triggered attacks.|$|E
25|$|Since {{some of the}} {{ammunition}} used for the massacre had <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> a special preserving paint (which was also found in some secret depots related to the Gladio undercover organization), {{it has been suggested}} that these would come from some Italian military or paramilitary corps.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several methods in {{treating}} patients who display Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome. However, which method seems to work the most is within argument. Patients with intracranial lesions have <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> surgical intervention and in some cases, this procedure has been successful. Other treatments include embolization, radiation therapy, and continued observation.|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} the anti-TB {{treatment}} received, it was not collected in the clinical records of five patients and available for the nine patients remaining. Three patients <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> collapse therapy, which could have promoted the lung destruction. Tuberculous reactivation <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> medical treatment in one patient.

50|$|Victor Meyer {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} determining the types of alcohol i.e. (primary, secondary or tertiary). In this method the sample alcohol <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> PI3 to get the iodoalkane which <b>is</b> again <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> AgNO2 to get the nitroalkane. The nitroalkane <b>is</b> then <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> nitrous acid which is obtained by NaNO2 and HCl. The resulting solution <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> KOH and the colour is observed. The red, blue and no colour indicates the primary, secondary and tertiary alcohol respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Prognosis and {{treatment}} {{depends on the}} specific type of lymphoma {{as well as the}} stage and grade. Treatment includes radiation and chemotherapy. Early-stage indolent B-cell lymphomas can often <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> radiation alone, with long-term non-recurrence. Early-stage aggressive disease <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> chemotherapy and often radiation, with a 70-90% cure rate.
