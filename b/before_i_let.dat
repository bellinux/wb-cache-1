6000|$|... "All right," [...] the mollified usurer had replied. [...] "And I want it on {{a matter}} of {{business}} <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can <b>let</b> you have any more money. You don't think I'm in it for my health?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I did it {{according}} to law, you know. I got Bingham {{to give me}} a warrant first, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> the policeman lay a hand on him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} known more <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him come here and {{encouraged}} you to think of him. It has been my fault. My dear, will you not forgive me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{he agreed}} with a {{resigned}} smile. [...] "But you just catch hold of that rail, please, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> you go." [...] She, too, forced {{a smile on her}} lips.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I {{tell you}} he was with me {{only a few hours}} ago,' cried the Sultan angrily. 'I must {{get to the bottom of}} this <b>before</b> <b>I</b> sleep! <b>Let</b> my golden coach be brought round at once.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will run}} for the doctor, sir, but <b>before</b> <b>I</b> go <b>let</b> me help you to lift your wife. She will doubtless come round shortly, and will aid you to stanch the wound till the doctor comes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> you go I'm {{going to}} make you pay up dearly for all that I have suffered. Captain Villaire, have you had them searched?" [...] he asked, turning again to his companion.|$|E

We owe our fairest province to their arms.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{well out}} of his hands," [...] {{answered}} Jack, sighing heavily, which was the most feminine thing she had done during the whole conversation, [...] "{{well out of}} his hands--and God be praised it is so.

6000|$|THE MAN [lowering the stick]. I {{accept your}} apology; but don't do it again. And {{now tell me}} one thing <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> you go home to bed. Which would you say this counthry was: hell or purgatory? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had assured}} myself {{that the man}} was sober as well as civil <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> her enter the vehicle. And now, when she was seated inside, I entreated her to let me see her set down safely at her destination.|$|E

60|$|Dan sighted a big swordfish. We {{made for}} him. Dan {{put on an}} albacore. But it came off <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>let</b> out the line. Then we tried a {{barracuda}}. I got a long line out and the hook pulled loose. This was unfortunate and aggravating. We had one barracuda left. Dan hooked it on hard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I can go in," [...] said Madame Zamenoy, [...] "but <b>before</b> <b>I</b> go in <b>let</b> me know this. Has {{he heard}} of the disgrace which you purpose to bring upon him?" ...|$|R

Blindfolding is {{according}} to the rules, and I should blindfold a flag <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him approach, though the hostile ranks stood drawn up, {{one on each side}} of a parade ground. Much is gained, while nothing is ever lost, by sticking to the rules of a trade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get out wid you! You're no good, {{and never}} will be.

[...] And so ended the interview, in which the anxious brother can hardly be said to have been triumphant, or successful.|$|E

As true as I stand here, if I hadn’t thought of you then I would have half choked {{the life out of}} the brute <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him get up.

6000|$|... "Nine, to-morrow morning? Yes, yes--your trap is laid for {{me before}} I {{can get my}} {{passport}} regulated and leave London. It is not earlier, I suppose?

6000|$|... "No, sir!--who was, but is so no longer. You {{will have}} to ask my pardon, at my feet, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> will <b>let</b> you speak to me again as my lover. Go and search.
