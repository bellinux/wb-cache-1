5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, {{has the effect of}} enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> the conjugate base than does the acid.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> the larger electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen chloride}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

In the As 4 S 5 composition, only one type of molecular configuration corresponds to an uzonite-type molecule. In the As 4 S 4 composition, two molecular configurations exist with realgar-type and pararealgar-type molecules. Three molecular configurations are in the As 4 S 3 composition. The first configuration comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two S atoms and one As atom, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms. The second is the molecular configuration of dimorphite. The third comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one As atom and two S atoms. The As 4 S 2 composition allows molecular configurations of two types. One is comprised of trigonal pyramidal As atom configurations of one type <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two As atoms and one S atom. The other comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of three types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two S atoms and one As atoms, <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms. The As 4 S molecule has trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms. The As 4 S composition permits only one molecular configuration, {{which suggests that the}} mineral duranusite comprises the As 4 S molecular geometry.

5|$|Kinetic {{measurements}} taken {{under various}} solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often {{shed light on}} this chemical mechanism, as they reveal the rate-determining step or intermediates in the reaction. For example, the breaking of a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom is a common rate-determining step. Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium, its stable isotope. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary kinetic isotope effect, which occurs because <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> deuterium are harder to break than <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> hydrogen. It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as 13C/12C and 18O/16O, but these effects are more subtle.|$|E

It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion.

5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination.

5|$|Nonmetals have {{structures}} {{in which each}} atom usually forms (8−N) bonds with (8−N) nearest neighbours, where N {{is the number of}} valence electrons. Each atom is thereby able to complete its valence shell and attain a stable noble gas configuration. Exceptions to the (8−N) rule occur with hydrogen (which only needs one bond to complete its valence shell), carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Atoms of the latter three elements are sufficiently small such that they are able to form alternative (more stable) bonding structures, with fewer nearest neighbours. Thus, carbon is able to form its layered graphite structure, and nitrogen and oxygen are able to form diatomic molecules having triple and double bonds, respectively. The larger size of the remaining non-noble nonmetals weakens their capacity to form multiple bonds and they instead form two or more single <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> two or more different atoms. Sulfur, for example, forms an eight-membered molecule in which the atoms are arranged in a ring, with each atom forming two single <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> different atoms.|$|E

Despite the high prevalence of fluorosis in many parts of South Africa (Louw A, Chikte U 1997), only limited information is available on the integrity of the bond between orthodontic brackets and fluorosed teeth. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure and compare Shear Bond Strengths (SBSs) of metal and ceramic orthodontic brackets on fluorosed and non-fluorosed teeth. One hundred and twenty (60 fluorosed and 60 non-fluorosed) extracted premolar teeth were divided into four groups A to D, consisting of 30 teeth in each group. BluGloo® was used as an orthodontic adhesive <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> brackets on the buccal surface of each tooth. The experimental groups consisted of Group A, in which Nu-Edge® metal brackets were used and Group B, in which InspireIce® ceramic brackets were <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> fluorosed teeth. Group C and D consisted of Nu-Edge® metal brackets and InspireIce® ceramic respectively, <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> non-fluorosed teeth. <b>Bonding</b> techniques were kept the same and standardised for all four groups. An Instron testing device was used to debond and measure the SBSs. SBSs were compared using ANOVA with posthoc analysis done using Dunnett’s C test for pairwise comparisons. Significance was set at PGroup C>Group D>Group A. Ceramic brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> fluorosed teeth had the highest SBS with a mean of 15. 78 (SD= 9. 07) Megapascals (MPa), while metal brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> fluorosed teeth produced the lowest SBS of 8. 41 (SD= 4. 68) MPa. The SBSs of ceramic brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> fluorosed teeth was significantly higher than that of SBS of metal brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> fluorosed teeth, but not significantly different from SBSs obtained from either brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> non-flurosed teeth. The BluGloo adhesive if used <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> ceramic brackets <b>to</b> fluorosed teeth can produce adequate SBS for clinical use. The recommendation from this study is that ceramic brackets can be used efficiently <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> <b>to</b> fluorosed teeth. A follow up study should be carried out to assess the nature of enamel damage caused during debonding of flourosed teeth. This is a laboratory study and thus the clinical application should be interpreted with caution. Dissertation (MChD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 OrthodonticsMChDUnrestricte...|$|R
