The Publication Manual Revision Task Force of the American Psychological Association established parameters for the revision based on published critique; user comments; commissioned reviews; and input from psychologists, nurses, librarians, business leaders, publishing professionals, and APA governance groups (APA, 2007a, 2007b). [...] To accomplish these revisions, the Task Force appointed working groups of four to nine members in seven areas: <b>bias-free</b> <b>language,</b> ethics, graphics, Journal Article Reporting Standards, references, statistics, and writing style (APA, 2009, pp. XVII-XVIII).|$|E
50|$|Adapting {{involves}} using certain {{techniques to}} tailor {{the message to}} the intended audience. When writing a message, it is essential {{to pay attention to the}} tone because it is a good indicator of how the reader will feel while reading the message. Words that are chosen improperly can contribute to an overall negative tone and can make the message sound unpleasant. Therefore, it is a good idea to choose words that will have a positive impact on the tone of the message. One technique involves putting the focus of the message on the receiver. This can be achieved by using second-person pronouns throughout the text and it shows that the writer has empathy towards the reader. Another technique involves using <b>bias-free</b> <b>language</b> which means the message should be free from gender, race, age and disability bias so as to not offend anyone. It is also recommended to use a professional yet friendly tone to make the writer sound professional and approachable at the same time. It is a good idea to use positive words and avoid words that have negative connotations. Finally, it is in the writer's best interest to be polite, use simple language and words that are precise.|$|E

Thus, the article {{is devoted to the}} tendency to eliminate sexisms in modern English. The role of English in today’s world is impossible to overestimate. It refers to Ukraine too since English has been declared the working language of the country. This implies the development of communicative competence which enables users to employ the language efficiently in academic and professional environments. Communicative competence is not only about linguistic competences, i. e. mastering the language as a system. Those who use the language should be sensitive to its varieties depending on the environment it is employed in, to social conventions (rules of politeness, norms governing relations between generations, sexes, social groups, etc.). In this connection there arises the issue of <b>bias-free</b> <b>language,</b> the language which is politically correct: language speakers {{should be aware of the}} fact that the language they use may offend or humiliate others. Unfortunately, this aspect the language is often left beyond the attention of language users, language teachers and learners, translators and interpreters...|$|E
