5|$|Several {{portraits of}} Octavius survive. Five portraits of him alone {{and one with}} his brother Alfred are housed in the Royal Collection of the United Kingdom. The first is the more famous {{painting}} by Thomas Gainsborough in 1782, {{which is part of}} a series of paintings of the younger royal children. The second one is after the 1782 portrait by Gainsborough (see above) and is dated to about 1782 or 1784. The third portrait is by Benjamin West and was painted shortly before Octavius's death. Furthermore, among these five portraits, there are two enamels, both after Gainsborough's 1782 portrait; one is by William Bone and the other one is by an anonymous master. The sixth and last portrait represents the apotheosis of Octavius and Alfred (see above) and was painted by West. Another portrait, this time of Queen Charlotte, features Octavius. Painted in 1779 by West, this is both a portrait of the Queen and her children, who are featured in the background. Prince Octavius is at the centre of the group, wearing <b>baby</b> <b>clothes</b> and riding in a little phaeton. He is pulled along by Prince Ernest and pushed by Prince Adolphus.|$|E

According to Donald Bogle, in his book Bright Boulevards, Bold Dreams, McDaniel happily confided to gossip {{columnist}} Hedda Hopper in 1945 that she was pregnant.

2500|$|During the 1980s, Guess {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular brands of denim jeans. The company {{was one of the}} first {{companies}} to create designer jeans. While the first jeans were for women, a men's line debuted in 1983. In 1984, Guess introduced its new line of watches known as [...] "Guess", [...] "Guess Steel", and the [...] "Guess Collection".

50|$|Cronus, {{having taken}} control of the Cosmos, wanted to ensure that he {{maintained}} power. Uranus and Gaia prophesied to him {{that one of his}} children would overthrow him, so when he married Rhea, he made sure to swallow each of the children she birthed: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus (in that order). However, when Rhea was pregnant with Zeus, Rhea begged her parents Gaia and Uranus to help her save Zeus. So they sent Rhea to Crete to bear Zeus and Gaia took the newborn Zeus to raise, hiding him deep in a cave beneath the Aegean Mountains. And Rhea gave Cronus a huge stone wrapped in <b>baby's</b> <b>clothes</b> which he swallowed thinking that it was another of Rhea's children.|$|R

25|$|The {{worn-out}} {{fabric of}} old clothing {{was used for}} <b>baby</b> <b>clothes</b> because soft cloth {{was good for the}} skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, he/she was given a decoction of the endodermis of alder and the roots of butterburs to discharge impurities. Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently, they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as attush, until coming of age.|$|E
25|$|The series {{begins with}} the {{destruction}} of a warehouse the club uses to store and assemble guns, which is their main source of income, by a rival MC right before the overdose of Jax's Methamphetamine-addicted ex-wife Wendy. An emergency C-section is performed, and their son Abel is delivered ten weeks prematurely. Jax finds his father's memoirs when he visits a storage unit to collect some old <b>baby</b> <b>clothes.</b> John Teller, Jax's father, was {{one of the founders of}} SAMCRO, and the book describes his trials with and hopes for the club. Jax's mother, Gemma Teller-Morrow, is now married to the President of SAMCRO, Clay Morrow. Jax's best friend Opie has just been released from prison for serving time for a club-related crime. The first season deals with Jax trying to reconcile things happening to the club with what he reads in his father's memoirs, Opie trying to take a lesser role in the club, and local and federal law enforcement trying to shut down SAMCRO.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} one-story wing on {{the north}} end of the residence includes a mechanical room, bedroom, and bath. In the mid-1960s, Presley enlarged the house to create a den known as Jungle Room which features an indoor waterfall of cut field stone {{on the north}} wall. In 1976, the Jungle Room was converted into a recording studio, where Presley recorded the bulk of his final two albums, From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee and Moody Blue; these were his final known recordings in a studio setting. During the mid-1960s expansion of the house, Presley constructed a large wing on the south side of the main house that was a sidewalk, between the music room in the original one-story wing and the swimming pool area, that connected to the house by a small enclosed gallery. The new wing initially housed a slot car track and to store his many items of appreciation, but was later remodeled to what is now known as the Trophy Building. The Trophy Building now features an exhibit about the Presley family, and it includes Priscilla's wedding dress, Elvis' wedding tuxedo, Lisa Marie's toy chest and <b>baby</b> <b>clothes</b> and more.|$|E
60|$|The girl blushed painfully, and Mose flushed sympathetically. He {{could not}} {{understand}} the mystery, and ignored her confusion as far as possible. The room was shabby and well worn. A rag carpet covered the floor. The white plastered walls had pictures cut from newspapers and magazines pinned upon them to break the monotony. The floor was littered also with toys, clothing, and tools, which the baby had pulled about, but the room wrought powerfully upon the boy's heart, giving him the first real touch of homesickness he had felt since leaving the Burns' farm that bright March day, now so far away it seemed that it was deep in the past. For a few moments he could not speak, and the girl was equally silent. She gathered up the <b>baby's</b> <b>clothes</b> and playthings, and passed into another room, leaving the young man alone.|$|R

2500|$|Upon hearing {{their first}} hit single at age14, {{he became a}} great fan of The Beatles.

He said in the 2011 {{documentary}} God Bless Ozzy Osbourne that [...] "as soon as [...] heard 'She Loves You' on the radio, [...] knew [...] wanted to be a rock star for the rest of [...] life". Osbourne left school at 15 and was employed as a construction site labourer, trainee plumber, apprentice toolmaker, car factory horn-tuner, and abattoir worker. He attempted to commit burglary, stealing a television (which fell on him during his getaway and had to be abandoned), a handful of <b>baby</b> <b>clothes</b> (originally thought to be adult clothes as it was too dark to see when he committed the burglary, and which were stolen to sell to people at a pub), and some T-shirts. He spent six weeks in Winson Green Prison when he was unable to pay a fine after being found guilty of robbing a clothes shop; to teach his son a lesson, his father refused to pay the fine.|$|E

2500|$|During the storyline, Inside Soap {{magazine}} had {{a regular}} feature they called [...] "Kat watch! Our {{eye on her}} guy!" [...] {{in which they would}} be [...] "scouring the episodes with a fine-tooth comb to spot any stolen glances, pointed lines of dialogue or suspicious circumstances that might indicate the identity of the fella Kat is having her torrid affair with." [...] In the first few episodes of the storyline, Derek asks for Kat's help to keep Joey in Walford, which Inside Soap said would mean he would owe Kat a favour, and Derek defends Kat when she is insulted by the rival football team's manager. Inside Soap also pointed out [...] "serious" [...] flirting between Jack and Kat, when she teases him about being out of shape, and she names him 'Legs of the match' after the team play their first football match. They spotted that Kat has a [...] "smouldering tete-a-tete" [...] with Max and she knows how frustrated he is by his family problems, and he is also seen on the phone {{at the same time as}} Kat. They said that Michael donating shirts to Kat's football team and Kat giving <b>baby</b> <b>clothes</b> to Michael were clues, especially as there was an [...] "emotional moment" [...] between them. A [...] "charged moment" [...] between Kat and Ray was noted by the magazine, when she injures herself in the pub's kitchen and he helps her. All five suspects are seen with their phones at the same time Kat ends a call from her mystery lover.|$|E
2500|$|Kat {{previously}} {{cheated on}} Alfie with Michael and Michael {{is the father}} of Kat's child Tommy. Kat chose to stay with Alfie, but Inside Soap said there seemed to be [...] "unfinished business" [...] between Kat and Michael. Michael has a baby with his new wife, millionaire businesswoman Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), and the magazine wondered if Michael would turn to Kat if things go badly at their wedding. They also thought that Michael still has feelings for Kat, but wondered if he would actually cheat on Janine. They called him [...] "a nasty bit of work" [...] but thought that starting an affair when his newborn baby, Scarlett Moon, is ill in hospital would [...] "really take the biscuit." [...] They said the characters are drawn to each other and Kat hates Janine, but an affair would not be shocking enough as they have already had a relationship. Brooks is leaving the cast in 2012 for an extended break, so Soaplife said that something will happen to break Michael and Janine up, but thought an affair with Kat would be [...] "too much been-there-done-that to be equal to as big a reveal as 'Who Shot Phil?'." [...] They later said that Michael would not risk Janine's fortune by cheating. All About Soap thought Michael was the least likely suspect, as he has other things on his mind, although Kat [...] "shows a softer side" [...] to Michael when she gives him some <b>baby</b> <b>clothes,</b> but said that Kat hates Michael, [...] "which could prove a problem in the romance department." [...] They also said Michael [...] "has a first-class degree in lying." ...|$|E
2500|$|The lost {{opening of}} the play {{probably}} featured Glykera's flight from Polemon's house. [...] Recently returned from fighting abroad, the soldier had learned from Sosias, his slave, that Glykera was seen embracing the neighbor's son, Moschion. Moschion has been stalking her because he {{is in love with}} her. In a violent fit of jealousy, Polemon cuts off Glykera's long hair. Glykera finds refuge with Myrrhine, the wealthy woman next door. In a delayed prologue, Agnoia (personified Ignorance) reveals that Myrrhine's son Moschion, is, in fact, as only Glykera knows, her brother by birth, which is why she allowed him to embrace her. Moschion was exposed together with her and given to Myrrhine by the same woman, now deceased, who kept and raised Glykera. In act II, the slave Daos falsely tries to take credit for Glykera's move into their house, and Moschion erroneously hopes that she has decided to become his concubine. He finds, however, that his mother keeps him away from her. In act III, Polemon tries to storm Myrrhine's house {{at the head of a}} comical army consisting of several male slaves, a female flute-player, and a cook with a pig, but his older friend Pataikos talks him out of it. In act IV, Pataikos tries to negotiate with Glykera at Polemon's request. With Moschion secretly eavesdropping on them, Glykera tells him the truth about the embrace and begs him to retrieve her things for her from Polemon's house, including the <b>baby</b> <b>clothes</b> in which she was exposed. As a result, Pataikos discovers that both Glykera and Moschion are the children he exposed long ago after he lost his fortune and his wife died in childbirth. Consequently, Glykera forgives the contrite Polemon in act V and marries him, whereas Pataikos betroths Moschion to another girl.|$|E

You put the philosopher down anywhere. It is {{all the same to}} him, he takes his philosophy with him. You can suddenly tell him he is an emperor, or give him penal servitude for life. He goes on being a philosopher just as if nothing had happened. We have an old tom-cat. The children lead it an awful life. It does not seem to matter to the cat. They shut it up in the piano: their idea is that it will make a noise and frighten someone. It doesn't make a noise; it goes to sleep. When an hour later someone opens the piano, the poor thing is lying there stretched out upon the keyboard purring to itself. They dress it up in the <b>baby's</b> <b>clothes</b> and take it out in the perambulator: it lies there perfectly contented looking round at the scenery--takes in the fresh air. They haul it about by its tail. You would think, to watch it swinging gently to and fro head downwards, that it was grateful to them for giving it a new sensation. Apparently it looks on everything that comes its way as helpful experience. It lost a leg last winter in a trap: it goes about quite cheerfully on three. Seems to be rather pleased, if anything, at having lost the fourth--saves washing. Now, he is your true philosopher, that cat; never minds what happens to him, and is equally contented if it doesn't." ...|$|R
