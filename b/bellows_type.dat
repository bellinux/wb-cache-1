50|$|On vintage cars you {{may find}} a <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> thermostat, which has a {{corrugated}} bellows containing a volatile liquid such as alcohol or acetone. These types of thermostats do not work well at cooling system pressures above about 7 psi. Modern motor vehicles typically run at around 15 psi, which precludes {{the use of the}} <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> thermostat. On direct air-cooled engines this is not a concern for the bellows thermostat that controls a flap valve in the air passages.|$|E

50|$|Welded bellows (also called edge-welded, or {{diaphragm}} bellows) {{are manufactured}} by welding {{a number of}} individually formed diaphragms to each other. The comparison between the two <b>bellows</b> <b>types</b> generally centers on cost and performance. Hydroformed bellows generally have a high tooling cost, but, when mass-produced, may have a lower piece price. However, hydroformed bellows have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness. Welded metal bellows are produced with a lower initial tooling cost and maintain higher performance characteristics. The drawback of welded bellows is the reduced metal strength at weld joints, caused by the high temperature of welding.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{mechanical}} {{model of}} traditional <b>bellow</b> <b>type</b> pressure compensator is established. The analysis of static characteristic shows that compensation volume and variation of pressure compensate margin {{are limited to}} each other. As a result, it cannot {{meet the requirements of}} marine equipment to the underwater hydraulic power. Therefore, a new type of pressure compensation unit is developed, it has advantages of big volume compensation and almost constant pressure compensate margin, it solves the core technical problem of deep-water balancing hydraulic power. The simulation results show that this new type of pressure compensator can satisfy the design requirements and improve the working depth of underwater hydraulic systems sharply...|$|R

These were unsuccessful, and later engines used conventional boilers.|$|E
50|$|An {{expansion}} joint {{is designed to}} allow deflection in the axial (compressive), lateral (shear), or angular (bending) deflections. Expansion joints can be non-metallic or metallic (often called <b>bellows</b> <b>type).</b> Non-metallic can be a single ply of rubberized material or a composite made of multiple layers of heat and erosion resistant flexible material. Typical layers are: outer cover to act a gas seal, a corrosion-resistant material such as Teflon, a layer of fiberglass to act as aninsulator and to add durability, several layers of insulation {{to ensure that the}} heat transfer from the flue gas is reduced to the required temperature and an inside layer.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{inhalation}} {{the bellows}} bottoms out and activates an addition valve, in much {{the way that a}} regulator diaphragm activates the demand valve, to make up the gas discharged by the inner <b>bellows.</b> This <b>type</b> of rebreather therefore tends to operate at a minimal volume.|$|R

50|$|The {{metal bellows}} {{accumulators}} function similarly to the compressed gas type, except the elastic diaphragm or floating piston {{is replaced by}} a hermetically sealed welded metal bellows. Fluid may be internal or external to the bellows. The advantages to the metal <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> include exceptionally low spring rate, allowing the gas charge to do all the work with little change in pressure from full to empty, and a long stroke relative to solid (empty) height, which gives maximum storage volume for a given container size. The welded metal bellows accumulator provides an exceptionally high level of accumulator performance, and can be produced with a broad spectrum of alloys resulting in a broad range of fluid compatibility. Another advantage to this type {{is that it does not}} face issues with high pressure operation, thus allowing more energy storage capacity.|$|E
50|$|Fin brakes {{involve a}} metal fin being {{attached}} to the underside of a train. The track is fitted with two computer-controlled squeezing mechanisms which upon closing, squeeze the fin and either slow or stop the train. Fin brakes {{are the most common}} form of brakes on roller coasters today. Sometimes they are thick metal box beams (mostly on Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters); others are thin metal plates. They slide between pairs of friction pads similar to automotive brake pads. Fin brakes are designed to be fail-safe, so that a loss of power will cause them to engage. Brakes are constructed according to a certain measure of redundancy, meaning the ride is usually fitted with one extra set of brakes to bring the train to a hold even if one brake fails. Opening is done by a <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> of air-operated actuator. Each set of brakes is fitted with its own air supply system controlled by supply valves which open the brake when it is safe to do so. A heavy spring, usually made of steel, is used to hold the brake closed by default.|$|E

50|$|Double-acting piston <b>bellows</b> are a <b>type</b> of <b>bellows</b> used by blacksmiths and {{smelters}} {{to increase}} the air flow going into the forge, with the property that air is blown out on both strokes of the handle (in contrast to simpler and more common bellows that blow air when the stroke is {{in one direction and}} refill the bellows in the other direction). These bellows blow a more constant, and thus stronger, blast than simple bellows. Such bellows existed in China at least since the 5th century BC, when it was invented, and had reached Europe by the 16th century.|$|R

Although the title describes the main focus of the work, it incorporated much more information {{on a wide variety of}} subjects that was not limited to the scope of agriculture. Wang's Nong Shu of 1313 was a very important medieval treatise outlining the application and use of the various Chinese sciences, technologies, and agricultural practices.

40|$|Context: Yoga is {{an ancient}} science, which {{originated}} in India. Pranayama has been assigned {{a very important role}} in yogic system of exercises. It is known that regular practice of breathing exercises (pranayama) increases parasympathetic tone, decreases sympathetic activity, and improves cardiovascular functions. Different types of breathing exercises alter autonomic balance for good by either decrease in sympathetic or increase in parasympathetic activity. Mukh Bhastrika (yogic <b>bellows),</b> a <b>type</b> of pranayama breathing when practiced alone, has demonstrated increase in sympathetic activity and load on heart, but when practiced along with other types of pranayama has showed improved cardiac performance. Aim: The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of long term practice of fast pranayama (Mukh Bhastrika) on autonomic balance on individuals with stable cardiac function. Settings and Design: This interventional study was conducted in the department of physiology. Materials and Methods: 50 healthy male subjects of 18 - 25 years age group, fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria underwent Mukh Bhastrika training for 12 weeks. Cardiovascular autonomic reactivity tests were performed before and after the training. Statistical Analysis Used: The parameters were analyzed by Student t test. Results: This study showed an increase in parasympathetic activity i. e., reduced basal heart rate, increase in valsalva ratio and deep breathing difference in heart rate; and reduction in sympathetic activity i. e., reduction in fall of systolic blood pressure on posture variation. Conclusion: It can be concluded that Mukh Bhastrika has beneficial effect on cardiac autonomic reactivity, if practiced for a longer duration...|$|R

40|$|Postoperative right {{ventricular}} (RV) {{failure is}} difficult to treat and develops from functional impairment of the underlying free wall and septum. This report describes the vital importance of the ventricular septum in RV structure /function relationships, demonstrates how the helical ventricular myocardial band model defines spatial geometry of the free wall and septum to provide architectural reasons for RV dynamic action, and focuses upon pathophysiologic reasons for adverse perioperative events resulting in right ventricular failure. Myocyte fiber orientation {{is the key to}} ventricular performance in health and disease. The transverse geometry of the free wall allows constriction (<b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> motion), whereas oblique septal fiber orientation and midline septal position is essential for ventricular twisting, the vital mechanism for RV ejection against increased pulmonary vascular resistance. The septum is considered “the lion or motor of RV performance”. This central muscle mass occupies ~ 40 % of myocardial ventricular weight, and injury from impaired myocardial protection is a preventable event. Septal function should be the index of adequacy of myocardial protection and we will show echocardiographic evidence that the integrated cardioplegic method prevents its injury. Dysfunction of a normally functioning septum following surgical cardiac procedures calls for reevaluation of myocardial protection methods...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a dilatometer {{to investigate the}} specific volume of polymers {{as a function of}} pressure (to 100 MPa), temperature (to 260 oC), cooling rate (to 80 C/s), and shear rate (to 77 1 /s). The dilatometeris based on the principle of con¯ned compression and comprises of a pressure cell used in combination with a tensile testing machine with rotation capability. The design of the pressure cell is a mixture of atraditional 'piston-die type' dilatometer and a Couette rheometer, i. e. piston and die make up an annular shaped sample spacing. Typical dimensions of annular samples are: inner radius ri = 10. 5 mm, outerradius ro = 11. 0 mm, height h = 2. 5 mm, and a typical mass of about 60 - 70 mg. Silicon grease is used to reduce loss of hydrostatic pressure in the sample due to friction occurring between the solidifying sampleand dilatometer wall. Specific volume measurements at low cooling rate using an isotactic polypropylene (i-PP) are compared with measurements performed using a commercial <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> dilatometer, showing relative di®erences in the range of 0. 1 - 0. 4 %. Finally, results for an isotactic polypropylene are presented showing a profound influence of cooling rate and melt shearing on the evolution of specific volume...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 31 Dual {{mechanical}} seals are operated on pressurized barrier fluid systems when the pump product properties {{do not support}} reliable single seal operation. This provides added protection against environmental release of the pumped product. Traditionally, many dual seal arrangements for pressurized barrier fluids consisted of two standard rotating flexible unit single seals mounted in a back to back orientation. Reliability concerns with the traditional designs include component unseating due to pressure reversal, inadequate provisions for heat removal, and collected debris causing damage to the inboard seal faces. The draft version of API 682 specifies standard pressurized barrier fluid dual seal designs (API 682 Arrangement 3) with two rotating elements and two mating rings in series (tandem arrangement). In addition, it includes design provisions for flush arrangements and component design to prevent unseating due to pressure reversals. The successful design and test validation of two dual seal series designs is described. One design is of the multiple spring type rotating flexible element (API 682 Type A), and one design uses a rotating welded metal <b>bellows</b> (API 682 <b>Type</b> B) with 0. 008 in thick heavy plate construction. Both designs were developed for use in HF acid services. Design features include multiple port injection at the primary seal, and provisions for continued seal operation under a range of pressure reversals and flashing conditions of the pumped product. The testing described includes operation on propane, isobutene, and unleaded gasoline (to simulate motor alkylate) fluids in a laboratory light hydrocarbon test loop. Test validations for specific customer requirements were run to validate {{the ability of the}} designs to perform safely under various conditions, including loss of primary seal pressure and loss of barrier fluid pressure. The effects on seal face temperature and post test face condition are shown for the variations in operating conditions. Designs meet strict emission standards. Both seal types are performing in refinery services since 1991...|$|R
