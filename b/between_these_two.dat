5|$|There is {{difficulty}} in labeling the trobairitz as either amateurs or professionals. The distinction <b>between</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> roles was complicated {{in the medieval}} era, since professionals were generally lower class, and amateurs had {{as much time as}} professionals to devote to their craft.

5|$|After {{more than}} two years living under {{strained}} conditions in the autumn of 1919 Victoria and Kirill left Finland and went to Germany. In Munich they were reunited with Victoria's mother and the family group moved to Zurich in September 1919.

In the following years the exiled family divided their time <b>between</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> places.|$|E

In 1955, Wood noted that D. anglica had a chromosome count of 2n=40, and hypothesized {{that it was}} of hybrid amphidiploid origin. Since the leaf morphology of D. anglica is an intermediary between that of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis and the two occur sympatrically in several locations, Wood conjectured that D. anglica likely originated from a hybrid <b>between</b> <b>these</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E

5|$|Between 1885 and 1908 it was {{believed}} that the signal had been sent using the 1799 code book, as in 1885 it was pointed out that this had not been replaced until 1808. In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805.

5|$|<b>Between</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> seasons, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England {{with the}} Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, {{according to the}} rules of the day, would have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica, {{commonly}} known as the English sundew or great sundew, is a carnivorous plant species belonging to the sundew family Droseraceae. It is a temperate species with a generally circumboreal range, although it does occur as far south as Japan, southern Europe, and the island of Kauai in Hawaii, where it grows as a subtropical sundew. It is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis, meaning that a sterile hybrid <b>between</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> species doubled its chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into the current D. anglica.|$|E
