40|$|Representation of {{the vacuum}} {{magnetic}} field {{by a set}} of harmonic functions is useful for an analysis of a magnetic configuration. To analyse a helical configuration precisely, a harmonic function describing a pure helicity of the configuration is desired specially in heliotrons, where the good quasi-symmetry is regarded as an advantage for a helical built-in divertor. Owing to the specific mode numbers in both the toroidal and the poloidal directions, the toroidal harmonic function is appropriate for a study of the helical field, when a practical method for a numerical calculation is provided. The helical components are analysed by a numerical calculation with high accuracy. From a spectral analysis of the field generated by a continuous helical coil the natural <b>winding</b> <b>law</b> was found to be peculiar by the fact that only the components resonant with the helicity of the coil are dominant. A deviation from the natural <b>winding</b> <b>law,</b> such as in a traditional <b>winding</b> <b>law,</b> causes an enhancement of off-resonant components. The unique toroidal coordinates, and hence, the unique spectral representation is practically determined from the condition that the field expression by a spectral series has the maximum area for the convergence. The high accuracy of the representation was applied to a numerical investigation of the intricate structure of a helical divertor. A reticular structure of the scrape-off layer in a helical system is visualizecl with a trace of unclosed separatrix. The field line at the X-point is a nearly pure helix in the toroidal coordinates, and it was confirmed that the deviation is sufficiently small for divertor baffles to be rigidly installed, even when some additional field is expected in an experiment. ...|$|R

This is important in determining the boundary conditions of atmosphere-ocean coupled models of many scales.

It is found that during pure wind sea conditions, the <b>wind</b> <b>law,</b> which is valid over land, is also valid over the sea. The sea surface roughness resembles that of a solid rigid surface. It scales with the surface elevation and decreases with wave age. When the sea surface is dominated by swell, wave influence is felt through the whole boundary layer. The wind profile is {{shown to be a}} function of wave state, and the classical <b>wind</b> <b>law</b> is modified when swell is present. Measurements and a wind over wave coupled model reveal that the momentum exchange depends on a combination of wind and wave condition.

40|$|Profile {{measurements}} {{of wind and}} potential temperature from a land site (obtained by a RASS for several years) and an offshore site (obtained at the meteorological mast on the research platform FINO  1 for one year) are used to analyse the temporal evolution of wind speed and wind shear under statically stable conditions, especially in situations with low-level jets. In both cases a bulk Richardson number is calculated from the data. Data analysis indicates that there seems to exist a lower bound for the bulk Richardson number during stable stratification which is greater than zero. At this lower bound the flow reaches its maximum possible vertical wind shear. Even larger shear would then mean production of new turbulence which in turn would reduce the shear. Therefore, at this lower bound, the flow is in equilibrium between production and depletion of turbulence characterized by an equilibrium Richardson number. This equilibrium Richardson number is found here at about  0. 1 for the land site and 0. 04 for the marine site. For situations where maximum shear occurs, this shear {{can be compared to}} the shear described by the logarithmic vertical <b>wind</b> profile <b>law</b> for stable stratification.

40|$|Radiometric {{measurements}} of {{the temperature of the}} south polar cap of Mars in winter have yielded values significantly below the expected 148 K. One proposed explanation for this result is a substantial reduction in the CO 2 content of the atmosphere and a lowering of the mean molecule weight near the surface. The meteorological consequences of this explanation are explored by deriving a criterion for vertical static stability and a thermal <b>wind</b> <b>law</b> for an atmosphere of variable composition. The atmosphere proves to be statically unstable unless the anomaly in the CO 2 mixing ratio extends to heights of tens of kilometers. The effect of varying molecular weight exceeds the effect of temperature gradient, producing shears with height of reversed sign. The shears are baroclinically unstable, and this instability would eradicate the latitudinal gradient of molecular weight. This inconsistency can be resolved by invoking a reasonable elevation of the central polar cap and by imposing an adequate zonal wind. It is concluded that if the explanation requiring a change in atmospheric composition is correct, it must be accompanied by other special circumstances to make it meteorologically consistent...|$|R
40|$|A new helical system(""Modular Heliotron"") with {{improved}} modular coils compatible with efficient closed helical divertor and good plasma confinement property is proposed {{based on a}} Heliotron system with continuous helical coils and one pair of poloidal coils. The physics optimization of this system {{as a function of}} the gap angle between adjacent modular coils has been carried out by means of vacuum magnetic surface calculations and finite-beta plasma analyses, and a new improved coil system is invented by combining sectored helical field coils with sectored returning poloidal field coils. The Modular Heliotron with standard coil <b>winding</b> <b>law</b> (reference Modular Heliotron) was previously proposed, but it is found that this is not appropriate to keep clean helical divertor and high beta configuration when the coil gap becomes large. By modulating the modular coil winding with outside-plus and inside-minus pitch modulation, almost the same good magnetic configuration as that of a conventional Heliotron can be produced. The optimal gap angle is determined {{as a function of the}} modulation parameter. This improved Modular Heliotron permits larger gap angle between adjacent modules and produces more clean helical divertor configuration than the reference Modular Heliotron. All these helical system are created by only modular coils without poloidal coils. ...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{vertical}} wind-speed profile in cities {{is important for}} the construction and insurance industries, wind energy predictions, and simulations of pollutant and toxic gas release. Here, five methods to estimate the spatially- and temporally- averaged wind-speed profile are compared in London: the logarithmic <b>wind</b> <b>law</b> (LOG); the Deaves and Harris equilibrium (DHe) and non-equilibrium (DHv) models; an adaptation of the power law (PL) and the Gryning et al. (GR) profile. Using measurements at 2. 5 times the average building height, a source area model is used to determine aerodynamic roughness parameters using two morphometric methods, which assume homogeneous and variable roughness-element heights, respectively. Hourly-averaged wind speeds are extrapolated to 200 m above the canopy during strong wind conditions, and compared to wind speeds observed with Doppler lidar. Wind speeds are consistently underestimated if roughness-element height variability is not considered during aerodynamic parameter determination. Considering height variability, the resulting estimations with the DHe and GR profiles are marginally more similar to observations than the DHv profile, which is more accurate than the LOG and PL methods. An exception is in directions with more homogeneous fetch and a gradual reduction in upwind roughness, where the LOG and PL profiles are more appropriate...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the features of}} the continuous-winding torsatron reactor T- 2, and presents numerical computations of the reactor's ion thermal conductivity. The helical magnet system is comprised of modular units, with the coils connected through demountable, resistive joints at the module interfaces. Reactor maintenance can be performed through the access existing between the helical coils (without moving the coils). This design feature combines desirable features of both the continuous and modular coil concepts; the continuous current paths provide more vacuum rotational transform (i) and reduce the out-of-plane forces on the coils, while the demountable joints allow for magnet maintenance and replacement. The blanket modules would be be of moderate size (the blanket structure of the illustrative reactor design was divided into three sections for each of the 19 field periods, the sections weighing 500, 100, and 25 tonnes).

40|$|This NASA grant {{supported}} {{the development of}} codes to solve the non-LTE multi-level spherical radiative transfer problem {{in the presence of}} velocity fields. Much of this work was done in collaboration with Graham Harper (CASA, University of Colorado). These codes were developed for application to the cool, low-velocity winds of evolved late-type stars. Particular emphasis was placed on modeling the wind of lambda Velorum (K 4 lb), the brightest K supergiant in the sky, based on extensive observations of the ultraviolet spectrum with the HST/GHRS from GO program 5307. Several solution techniques were examined, including the Eddington factor Approach described in detail by Bennett & Harper (1997). An Eddington factor variant of Harper's S-MULTI code (Harper 1994) for stationary atmospheres was developed and implemented, although full convergence was not realized. The ratio of wind terminal velocity to turbulent velocity is large (approx. 0. 3 - 0. 5) in these cool star winds so this assumption of stationarity provides reasonable starting models. Final models, incorporating specified <b>wind</b> <b>laws,</b> were converged using the comoving CRD S-MULTI code. Details of the solution procedure were published by Bennett & Harper (1997). Our analysis of the wind of lambda Vel, based on wind absorption superimposed on chromospheric emission lines in the ultraviolet, can be found in Carpenter et al. (1999). In this paper, we compare observed wind absorption features to an exact CRD calculation in the comoving frame, and also to a much quicker, but approximate, method using the SEI (Sobolev with Exact Integration) code of Lamers, Cerruti-Sola, & Perinotto (1987). Carpenter et al. (1999) provide detailed comparisons of the exact CRD and approximate SEI results and discuss when SEI is adequate to use for computing wind line profiles. Unfortunately, the observational material is insufficient to unambiguously determine the <b>wind</b> acceleration <b>law</b> for lambda Vel. Relatively few unblended Fe II lines of optical depth sensitive to the wind acceleration region are present in the existing HST/GHRS data set. Most of the Fe II lines are either too optically thick (resulting in a board, black wind absorption profile) or too optically thin (resulting in no wind absorption feature present). Also, most of the ultraviolet spectra obtained from HST GO- 5307 was at medium resolution (R approx. 40, 000, corresponding to a velocity resolution of 7. 5 km/s). This is simply inadequate to resolve the turbulence in the outer wind; a key parameter in theoretical wind models. We can now say that an unambiguous determination of the <b>wind</b> velocity <b>law</b> in lambda Vel will require complete coverage of the ultraviolet spectrum at high dispersion (R approx. 10 (exp 5), or 3 km/s).
