The same qualities have distinguished Redstone’s subsequent output." [...] Other early productions include visual <b>books</b> <b>in</b> boxes, such as Frans Masereel's Passionate Journey (1988), <b>a</b> novel told <b>in</b> 165 woodcuts, with an Introduction by Thomas Mann; Images of Frida Kahlo with an introduction by Angela Carter; and Osip Mandelstam's Journey to Armenia with an introduction by Bruce Chatwin. The Redstone Diary, started in 1989 and now published worldwide, is an annual spiral-bound desk diary that [...] "usually delivers a quirky collection of literary and graphic ephemera based around a single theme, such as ‘Daring!’ (2003), ‘The Artist’s World’ (2011) and ‘The Senses' (2012)." ...|$|R

30|$|An {{alternative}} {{to test the}} null hypothesis is to form portfolios of stocks that have similar risk factor loadings but different characteristics.

The null hypothesis is rejected <b>in</b> favor of <b>a</b> characteristics-based explanation if <b>a</b> FB <b>portfolio</b> exhibits <b>a</b> positive average return because then the positive return difference is caused by firm characteristics.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{postgraduate}} assessment programmes {{around the}} world have embraced workplace-based assessment (WBA) and its related tools. Despite their widespread use, results of studies on the validity and reliability of these tools have been variable. Although in many countries decisions about residents' continuation of training and certification as a specialist are based on the composite results of different WBAs collected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>portfolio,</b> to our knowledge, the reliability of such a WBA toolbox has never been investigated. Using generalisability theory, we analysed the separate and composite reliability of three WBA tools [mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (mini-CEX), direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS), and multisource feedback (MSF) ] included <b>in</b> <b>a</b> resident <b>portfolio.</b> G-studies and D-studies of 12, 779 WBAs from a total of 953 residents showed that a reliability coefficient of 0. 80 was obtained for eight mini-CEXs, nine DOPS, and nine MSF rounds, whilst the same reliability was found for seven mini-CEXs, eight DOPS, and one MSF when combined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>portfolio.</b> At {{the end of the first}} year of residency <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> with five mini-CEXs, six DOPS, and one MSF afforded reliable judgement. The results support the conclusion that several WBA tools combined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> can be <b>a</b> feasible and reliable method for high-stakes judgements...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{sponsorship}} {{research suggests}} that consumers use characteristics associated with a sponsorship property to infer the sponsor brand’s image. On the basis of accessibility-diagnosticity theory, we hypothesize that the sequence <b>in</b> which <b>a</b> brand’s multiple sponsorships <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> are communicated will influence sponsor brand’s personality evaluation. Evidence from our experiment demonstrates that the ease-of-retrieval associated with a more recently processed sponsorship increases its diagnosticity and “backward frames” the processing of a previously encoded sponsorship to exert disproportionate impact on sponsor brand personality. The results have implications for the communication strategy regarding how to combine disparate sponsorships <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>portfolio...</b>|$|R

The paper uses a real-world example (Competence Based Dual Education in Michigan) where this complexity exists and a mature decision-making process from industry, academia, and government stakeholders was successfully implemented. This paper will describe how models of decision making were considered, combined with models of complexity, transferred into applications, and facilitated success...|$|R

40|$|Portfolios are {{constructed}} to increase returns and manage risk. In high-risk investment strategies, central measures of risk must be complemented with tail measures of risk. An unanticipated event impacting securities of one firm can contagiously affect {{those of other}} firms through a contagion flow process. The connections between firms due {{to a variety of}} factors can spread the contagion, and potentially impact firms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> network. This can adversely affect the level of tail risk <b>in</b> <b>an</b> investment strategy, especially when a number of these connected firms are included <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>portfolio.</b> <b>A</b> model is developed for flow of contagion between firms which will define, characterize and calibrate a contagions impact on default risk of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> of debt instruments. The model assesses the impact of network structure underlying contagion flow and evaluates the contagion related excess risk <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> of high-yield debt instruments. ...|$|R
