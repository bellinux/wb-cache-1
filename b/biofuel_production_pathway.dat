For the model compounds, the deoxygenation degree of dibenzofuran was {{higher than that of}} cresol and guaiacol over both Pt/Al 2 O 3 and the newly developed Pt supported on mesoporous zeolite (Pt/MZ- 5) catalyst, and the deoxygenation degree of cresol over Pt/MZ- 5 was higher than that over Pt/Al 2 O 3. The results indicated that hydrodeoxygenation become much easier upon oxygen reduction. Similar to model compounds study, the hydrodeoxygenation of the real bio - oil derived from catalytic pyrolysis was much easier than that from fast pyrolysis over both Pt catalysts, and the Pt/MZ- 5 again shows much higher deoxygenation ability than Pt/Al 2 O 3.

40|$|The present work {{is part of}} a cross-disciplinary Swedish {{research}} project on advanced tailor-made biofuels that aims at identifying drop-in biofuel options for the transport sector that combine excellent combustion properties with sustainable production pathways. The present paper addresses the methodology and primary results of the <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> <b>pathway</b> assessment for the diesel fuel alternatives identified within the project. The methodology is illustrated for 2 -Ethylhexanol. Three alternative production pathways for 2 -Ethylhexanol are analyzed: gasification-based, butanol-based and ethanol-based. The highest biomass to 2 -Ethylhexanol conversion (33. 9 %, lower heating value basis) is achieved for the ethanol-based conversion pathway. The varying spectrum of by-products requires a sophisticated analysis necessary, as addressed in the present work. 2 -Ethylhexanol as biofuel cannot outperform conventional biofuels such as e. g. ethanol from a well-to-tank energy performance perspective due to the additional conversion steps necessary.

However, {{the chemistry of}} many biomass to fuel conversion pathways remains to be thoroughly studied. The future of biorefineries thus depends on developing new pathways while optimizing existing ones. Here, potential chemicals are added to create a superstructure, then an algorithm is run to enumerate every feasible reaction stoichiometry through a mixed integer linear program (MILP). An optimal chemical reaction pathway, taking into account thermodynamic, safety, and economic constraints is then found through reaction network flux analysis (RNFA). The RNFA is first formulated as a linear programming problem (LP) and later recast as an MILP in order to solve multiple alternate optima through integer cuts. A graphical method is also developed {{in order to show}} a shortcut method based on thermodynamics as opposed to the reaction stoichiometry enumeration and RNFA methods.

40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview {{of the state of the}} art of first and second generation <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> <b>pathways.</b> Information is provided on primary feedstocks, typical feedstock yields, available conversion technologies, <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> costs and market opportunities. In this report, a pathway element is considered first generation if it is deployed at commercial scale. Thus corn, sugarcane, oil palm, and soya are first generation feedstocks, whereas jatropha is a second generation feedstock. Conversion technologies are similarly divided into first and second generation according to their level of deployment. Preferred feedstock production systems depend on country or regional circumstances. Factors such as climate and soils, marketing opportunities, traditional crop and land uses, and local production costs determine preferred <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> <b>pathways.</b> Currently the primary feedstocks for ethanol are corn and sugarcane, whereas soya, rapeseed and oil palm are the primary feedstocks used for biodiesel production. The easiest and lowest greenhouse gas (GHG) production path to ethanol is fermentation of sugarcane. Converting corn or similar starches into ethanol is more complex, because the raw material has to be converted to sugar prior fermentation. These pathways also tend to result in higher GHG emissions. Conversion of plant oils to biodiesel is primarily done via transesterification. Conversion of lignocellulosic materials (woodchips, straw, algae etc.) to ethanol or biodiesel requires second generation conversion technologies. Thermochemical processes can be used to convert these feedstocks into biodiesel (e. g., via Fischer-Tropsch processes), or enzymatic hydrolysis can be used to produce bioethanol. Currently ethanol from sugarcane is the only biofuel that is cost-competitive with fossil-based transportation fuels. Both biodiesel via transesterification and biofuels produced via second generation conversion processes have high production costs and need subsidies or higher fossil fuel prices to be competitive. Although export of biofuels could be a source of income for developing countries, trade in biofuels is expected to remain a small fraction of total <b>biofuel</b> <b>production...</b>|$|R

For land use change emissions, three default values based on results from the partial equilibrium Global Biomass Optimisation Model (GLOBIOM) are used. An allocation of greenhouse gas emissions to the biofuel and its co-products is done by using the energy allocation method. The results show that wherever a land use change default value for non-wood feedstocks is used, this value dominates by far all other emission sources. Default land use change emissions for pathways using wood as feedstock are minor (short rotation coppice) or negative (wood from existing forests). However, woody feedstocks require second-generation conversion technologies. The least emission intensive first-generation pathways are bioethanol from sugar cane in Mexico and Indonesia due to the high productivity of sugar cane and the simple conversion process. Due to the limited country-specific database, a differentiation between countries or regions could not clearly be made.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{mathematical}} programming models and statistical analysis tools have been formulated {{and designed to}} study the strategic and optimal solutions to allocate the resources and manage the risk for the renewable energy and precision agriculture. The dissertation, which consists of four papers, lies at the interface of optimization, simulation, and statistical analysis, {{with a focus on}} decision making under uncertainty for biofuel process design, renewable energy supply chain management and precision agriculture. Bio-oil gasification which integrates fast pyrolysis and gasification processes is a relative new conversion technology and this integrated <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> <b>pathway</b> has been promoted to take advantage of economies of scale and logistic efficiency. The design of the supply chain networks, especially under uncertainties, {{is one of the most}} important decisions faced by the biofuel industry. In the first paper, we proposed a two-stage stochastic programming framework for the biofuel supply chain optimization problem considering uncertainties, including biomass supply availability, technology advancement, and biofuel market price. The results show that the stochastic factors have significant impacts on the decision on fast pyrolysis plant locations, especially when there is insufficient biomass. Also, farmers 2 ̆ 7 participation can have a significant impact on the profitability and robustness of this supply chain design. Another major challenge faced by the cellulosic biofuel industry is that investors are hesitant to take the risk to construct commercial scale production facilities. Techno- economic analysis (TEA) has been widely adopted to overcome this challenge. The optimal facility locations and capacities as well as the logistic flow decisions for biomass supply and biofuel distribution should be incorporated into techno-economic analysis as well. In the second paper, the author aims to provide a new method that integrated the supply chain design into the techno-economic analysis as well by evaluating the economic feasibility of an integrated pathway on biomass pyrolysis and bio-oil gasification. The results indicate that hybrid fast pyrolysis and bio-oil gasification pathway is more suitable for a decentralized supply chain structure while biomass gasification pathway is more suitable for a single centralized facility supply chain structure. Feeding millions of people throughout the world who face hunger every day is a formidable challenge. Precision agriculture has attracted increasing attention in the community of farmland management. Farmland management involves a sequence of planning and decision-making processes, including seed selection and irrigation schedule. In the third paper, a mixed integer programming optimization model is proposed to provide decision support on seed selection and irrigation water allocation for customized precision farmland management. The results show that significant increase of farmers’ annual profit can be achieved by carefully choosing irrigation schedule and type of seed. The proposed model can also serve as a risk analysis tool for farmers facing seasonal irrigation water limits as well as a quantitative tool to explore the impact of precision agriculture. The effect of limited water on corn grain yield is significant and management decisions are essential to optimize farmers’ profits, particularly under stochastic environment. The fourth paper takes uncertainties such as crop price, irrigation water availability and precipitation amount into consideration. A multi-stage stochastic programming is formulated to evaluate the effects of structure of decision making process on farmers’ income. The case study results indicate multi-stage stochastic programming is a promising way for farmland management under uncertainties and can increase farmers’ income significantly. In order to enhance the data utilization and results interpretation, statistical methods such as Monte-Carlo simulation considering parameter interactions, linear regression analysis, and moment matching method for scenario generation are also applied. The overarching goals of this dissertation is to quantify and manage the uncertainties along the modeling process and provide proper mechanisms that lead to optimal decisions. The outcomes of the research have the potential to accelerate the commercialization of second generation of biofuel and lead to sustainable utilization of water resources.

There is a strong drive in the European Union for a certification on the sustainability of biofuel pathways.

In addition, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there is no LCA study regarding the environmental performance of transportation biofuels derived from torrefied wood which considers the RED emissions targets.

Therefore, empirical data for the LC stages, such as torrefaction of wood and its subsequent gasification, are used and system expansion is used instead of allocation when it is possible. Apart from the specific environmental impacts, such as the GWP, AP, PMP, and EP, the aggregated environmental performance is evaluated as well.

It is vital that the microbes used for these processes be able to grow with minimal nutrients, produce large amounts of the target molecule, and be tolerant to the chemicals being produced. Naturally occurring strains are unable to meet all these criteria and need to be further optimized as production hosts. Proteomics is the study of cellular proteins. It has become a powerful tool for host engineering, and can give vital information about pathway performance and strain responses. Using LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry, proteomics strategies were utilized to study cellular responses to a potential biofuel, n-butanol, and to overexpression of the carbon storage regulator, which increased flux through three key <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> <b>pathways.</b> For each study, proteomics provided valuable cues for understanding how the host was adapting to an engineered environment. In the case of product toxicity, n-butanol stressed cells were iTRAQ labeled, separated into 20 fractions using HPLC, and spectra collected on an ESI-Q-TOF instrument. Analysis of the data indicates that n-butanol stress has components common to other stress responses including perturbation of respiratory functions, oxidative stress, heat shock and cell envelope stress, and metabolite transport and biosynthesis. Results from these analyses allow identification of key genes, such as degP, nlpD, and phoU, which were used to alleviate stress. Proteomics work was also vital for studying the cellular effects of the carbon storage regulator and the increased flux through biofuel pathways. Extracted proteins were analyzed on a 5600 Triple-TOF mass spectrometer. Increased levels of proteins involved with energy metabolism, particularly TCA cycle, were noted, along with approximately 20 proteins that were strongly up regulated, indicating previously unknown regulation.

40|$|The {{resource}} efficiency of <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> via biomass pyrolysis is evaluated using exergy as an assessment metric. Three feedstocks, important to various sectors of U. S. agriculture, switchgrass, forest residue, and equine waste, are considered for conversion to bio-oil (pyrolysis oil) via fast pyrolysis, {{a process that}} {{has been identified as}} adaptable to on- or near-farm application. Biomass and <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> <b>pathways</b> are defined, material flows are determined, and exergy in- and outflows associated with biomass production and conversion are computed, including the depletion of exergy from its natural state (cumulative exergy demand, CExD). Sources of exergy depletion are quantified and categorized by energy carriers, e. g., electricity and diesel fuel, and materials, e. g., fertilizer, as well as renewable and nonrenewable resources. Yields for biomass to bio-oil conversion by fast pyrolysis are determined experimentally. Breeding factors, a measure of exergy production (the ratio of the chemical exergy of the output product to process exergy inputs), are determined for the production of biomass and bio-oil. The quantification of exergy depletion for process pathways enables the possible identification of more sustainable (resource efficient) pathways for biomass and bio-oil production. It is shown, for example, that feedstocks grown primarily for biomass such as switchgrass may be less sustainable using the exergy measure compared to use of residue (e. g., forest thinnings) or waste biomass (e. g., equine waste). With regard to the pyrolysis process, there is substantial reduction in exergy depletion when the coproducts noncondensable gases and biochar are recycled and utilized as a source of heat. The sustainability of biomass production and conversion, as measured by exergy depletion, is strongly influenced by energy carriers. The study reveals that the method of electricity production, i. e., on-site generation or grid electricity, as well as the choice of grid electricity can {{have a significant impact on}} sustainability. The exergy content of the bio-oil produced varies from 24 to 27 MJ/kg bio-oil, which is much lower than traditional fuels. However, the cumulative exergy depletion for the production and conversion to bio-oil varies from approximately 4 to 11 MJ/kg bio-oil, which is also much lower than traditional fuels. Breeding factors for biomass production and conversion to bio-oil based on cumulative exergy depletion vary from approximately 2 to 5, demonstrating the potential exergy benefit of bio-oil production using fast pyrolysis...|$|R

Techno-economic evaluation of diverse technologies for <b>production</b> of <b>biofuels</b> and biochemical is a crucial step for decision making in the development of bio-economy. This contribution focuses on the economic studies carried out on biorefineries converting sugarcane bagasse, due to its availability and importance in the South African context, into value-added products. Recent studies on <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> via biochemical <b>pathway,</b> e. g., ethanol, butanol, or thermochemical pathway, e. g., methanol and bio jet fuel as well as production of biochemicals with high market demands and diverse applications such as lactic acid, succinic acid, and xylitol have been briefly reviewed. In addition, an overview on the production of biopolymers such as polyl-lactic acid and bio-based monomers, i. e., butanediol, from sugarcane bagasse is reported...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. {{government}} {{encourages the}} development of biofuel industry through policy and financial support since 1978. Though first generation biofuels (mainly bio-based ethanol) expand rapidly between the early 1980 s and late 2000 s, more attention has turned to second generation biofuels, such as cellulosic biofuels, due to the `food-versus-fuel 2 ̆ 7 debate, and potential impact on land use and climate change caused by {{the development of}} first generation <b>biofuel</b> <b>production.</b> Over the last few years, a rich literature has arisen on lignocellulosic crops or crop residues being used as biomass feedstock for second generation biorefineries. In this thesis, two types of assessments on cellulosic <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> have been conducted: techno-economic analysis of the fast pyrolysis fractionation pathway and supply chain design for the advanced <b>biofuel</b> <b>production.</b> Firstly, the economic feasibility of a fast pyrolysis fractionation facility is examined. The facility takes lignocellulosic biomass feedstock, goes through the pyrolysis process, recovers pyrolysis oil into different fractions, and upgrades the fractions into two main products: commodity chemicals and liquid transportation fuels. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of this <b>production</b> <b>pathway</b> is evaluated to be 8. 78...|$|R

40|$|Biofuels from biomass {{gasification}} {{are reviewed}} here, and demonstrated {{to be an}} attractive option. Recent progress in gasification techniques and key generation <b>pathways</b> for <b>biofuels</b> <b>production,</b> process design and integration and socio-environmental impacts of biofuel generation are discussed, {{with the goal of}} investigating gasification-to-biofuels’ credentials as a sustainable and eco-friendly technology. The synthesis of important biofuels such as bio-methanol, bio-ethanol and higher alcohols, bio-dimethyl ether, Fischer Tropsch fuels, bio-methane, bio-hydrogen and algae-based fuels is reviewed, together with recent technologies, catalysts and reactors. Significant thermodynamic studies for each biofuel are also examined. Syngas cleaning is demonstrated to be a critical issue for <b>biofuel</b> <b>production,</b> and innovative <b>pathways</b> such as those employed by Choren Industrietechnik, Germany, and BioMCN, the Netherlands, are shown to allow efficient methanol generation. The conversion of syngas to FT transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel over Co or Fe catalysts is reviewed and demonstrated to be a promising option for the future of biofuels. Bio-methane has emerged as a lucrative alternative for conventional transportation fuel with all the advantages of natural gas including a dense distribution, trade and supply network. Routes to produce H 2 are discussed, though critical issues such as storage, expensive production routes with low efficiencies remain. Algae-based fuels are in the research and development stage, but are shown to have immense potential to become commercially important because of their capability to fix large amounts of CO 2, to rapidly grow in many environments and versatile end uses. However, suitable process configurations resulting in optimal plant designs are crucial, so detailed process integration is a powerful tool to optimize current and develop new processes. LCA and ethical issues are also discussed in brief. It is clear that the use of food crops, as opposed to food wastes represents an area fraught with challenges, which must be resolved on a case by case basis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the economics}} of <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> and the implications that the accelerating growth in <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> in many countries could have on agricultural markets. It shows that production costs of ethanol and biodiesel differ significantly across countries and feedstock crops. These costs often exceed those of fossil fuels. In consequence, {{the economics of}} <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> depends on public support in most countries. Similarly, land requirements for crops required to enable significant shares of <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> in transport fuel consumption are shown to be substantial in many countries given current technologies. An expected growth in <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> is, therefore, {{likely to have a}} significant increasing impact on world prices for sugar, cereals and oilseeds beyond what is caused by higher crude oil prices alone. The paper points out a number of policy issues that require attention and further analysis to facilitate a fuller discussion of <b>biofuel</b> policies. <b>biofuels,</b> <b>production</b> costs, resource requirements, agricultural market impacts, biofuel policies, Demand and Price Analysis, International Relations/Trade, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Second {{generation}} <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> {{is increasingly}} being promoted and explored by researchers and government organizations (Tilman et al. 2009; Mitchell et al. 2012; Uden 2012). Yet, few commercial-scale advanced <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> facilities have been established, {{partly due to}} the lack of infrastructure required to manufacture ethanol from alternative crop types, such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). As pressure for advanced <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> increases, ethanol companies such as Abengoa Bioenergy are preparing to implement exploratory production on a large scale. In 2013, a proposal was established to convert one or both of Abengoa Bioenergy’s traditional corn feedstock ethanol manufacturing facilities in Ravenna and York, Nebraska to sorghum-based advanced <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> facilities. Advanced <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> in the region may help reduce land-use stressors on the environment, water supplies, and wildlife populations, particularly if grassland-dominant crop types are also used in the manufacturing process...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> in the United States is {{reshaping}} the agricultural industry, delivering both benefits and conflict among stakeholders. Routes forward on <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> {{should be viewed}} {{in the context of}} economic, land use, environmental, and energy security tradeoffs and their potential impacts in the future. This report discusses the current, emerging, and prospective conflicts arising from increased <b>biofuels</b> <b>production,</b> recommends policies to resolve these conflicts, and identifies likely areas of support and opposition from stakeholder groups. The report focuses heavily on ethanol, because ethanol accounts for 95 percent of U. S. <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> (Worldwatch 2006); however, many of the trade-offs and recommendations identified in the report can and should be applied to biofuels more generally. This report does not attempt to assess whether or not biofuels are the best option for transportation fuel use. Rather, it accepts that current mandates, policies, and market conditions will result in increased <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> and proposes policies to support growth in more economically and environmentally sustainable manners...|$|R

A) Combined biodiesel and biogas production and B) only biogas production, are compared in terms of product outputs, impact on global CO 2 emissions reduction and economic performance. Land-use efficiency of biofuels from microalgae was compared with other <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> routes. The <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> process {{is assumed to be}} integrated with a wastewater treatment plant and an industrial cluster, providing the opportunity to reduce the CO 2 emissions of the process compared to stand-alone operation. The results show that case A is advantageous in terms of all the studied factors. A higher area efficiency of algae <b>biofuels</b> <b>production</b> routes compared to other <b>biofuel</b> <b>production</b> routes was shown. Nutrient availability in municipal wastewater is shown to be the limiting factor regarding product output.

40|$|Background: Microalgae are {{touted as}} an {{attractive}} alternative to {{traditional forms of}} biomass for <b>biofuel</b> <b>production,</b> due to high productivity, ability to be cultivated on marginal lands, and potential to utilize carbon dioxide (CO 2) from industrial flue gas. This work examines the fossil energy return on investment (EROI fossil), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and direct Water Demands (WD) of producing dried algal biomass through the cultivation of microalgae in Open Raceway Ponds (ORP) for 21 geographic locations in the contiguous United States (U. S.). For each location, comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed for multiple microalgal biomass <b>production</b> <b>pathways,</b> consisting {{of a combination of}} cultivation and harvesting options. Results: Results indicate that the EROI fossil for microalgae biomass vary from 0. 38 to 1. 08 with life cycle GHG emissions of - 46. 2 to 48. 9 (g CO 2 eq/MJ-biomass) and direct WDs of 20. 8 to 38. 8 (Liters/MJ-biomass) over the range of scenarios analyzed. Further anaylsis reveals that the EROI fossil for <b>production</b> <b>pathways</b> is relatively location invariant, and that algae's life cycle energy balance and GHG impacts are highly dependent on cultivation and harvesting parameters. Contrarily, algae's direct water demands were found to be highly sensitive to geographic location, and thus may be a constraining factor in sustainable algal-derived <b>biofuel</b> <b>production.</b> Additionally, scenarios with promising EROI fossil and GHG emissions profiles are plagued with high technological uncertainty. Conclusions: Given the high variability in microalgae's energy and environmental performance, careful evaluation of the algae-to-fuel supply chain is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of emerging algal <b>biofuel</b> systems. Alternative <b>production</b> scenarios and technologies may have the potential to reduce the critical demands of biomass production, and should be considered to make algae a viable and more efficient biofuel alternative. © 2013 Zaimes and Khanna; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
