5|$|Minneapolis is the third-most literate {{city in the}} U.S. A {{center for}} {{printing}} and publishing, Minneapolis was the city in which Open Book, the largest literary and book arts center in the U.S., was founded. The Center consists of the Loft Literary Center, the Minnesota Center for Book Arts and Milkweed Editions (the latter is sometimes called the country's largest independent nonprofit literary publisher). The Center exhibits and teaches both contemporary art and traditional crafts of writing, papermaking, letterpress printing and <b>bookbinding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Uzanne's {{bibliophile}} {{activity in}} the early 1880s coincided with the gradual abandonment of manual methods of printing illustrations kin favour of photomechanized methods. His collection of contemporary bibliophilic books was sold in 1894 by Hôtel Drouot. It contained {{some of the finest}} examples of late 19th-century French <b>bookbinding,</b> by binders like Charles Meunier, Lucien Magnin, Pétrus Ruban, Camille Martin, René Wiener and Victor Prouvé.|$|E
5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern <b>bookbinding</b> materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E

5|$|Aram Khachaturian {{was born}} on 6 June (24 May in Old Style) 1903 {{in the city of}} Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi, Georgia) into an Armenian family. Some sources {{indicate}} Kojori, a village near Tiflis (now in Georgia's Gardabani Municipality), as his birthplace. His father, Yeghia (Ilya), was born in the village of Upper Aza near Ordubad in Nakhichevan (present-day Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, Azerbaijan) and moved to Tiflis at the age of 13; he owned a <b>bookbinding</b> shop by the age of 25. His mother, Kumash Sarkisovna, was from Lower Aza, also a village near Ordubad. Khachaturian's parents were betrothed before knowing each other, when Kumash was 9 and Yeghia was 19. They had 5 children, one daughter and four sons, of whom Aram was the youngest. Khachaturian received primary education at the commercial school of Tiflis, a school for merchants. He considered a career either in medicine or engineering.|$|E

25|$|Modern <b>bookbinding</b> by hand {{can be seen}} as two closely allied fields: the {{creation}} of new bindings, and the repair of existing bindings. Bookbinders are often active in both fields. Bookbinders can learn the craft through apprenticeship; by attending specialized trade schools; by taking classes in the course of university studies, or by a combination of those methods. Some European countries offer a Master Bookbinder certification, though no such certification exists in the United States. MFA programs that specialize in the 'Book Arts' (hand paper-making, printmaking and <b>bookbinding)</b> are available through certain colleges and universities.|$|E
25|$|Under Abbas' reign, {{carpet weaving}} {{increased}} {{its role as}} {{an important part of}} Persian industry and culture, as wealthy Europeans started importing Persian rugs.

During the 20th century the symbol {{was adopted by}} various Scouting organizations worldwide for their badges.

25|$|In the 8th century Arabs {{learned the}} arts of {{papermaking}} from the Chinese and were then the first to bind paper into books {{at the start of}} the Islamic Golden Age. Particular skills were developed for Arabic calligraphy, miniatures and <b>bookbinding.</b> The people who worked in making books were called Warraqin or paper professionals. The Arabs made books lighter—sewn with silk and bound with leather covered paste boards, they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use. As paper was less reactive to humidity, the heavy boards were not needed. The production of books became a real industry and cities like Marrakech, Morocco, had a street named Kutubiyyin or book sellers, which contained more than 100 bookshops in the 12th century. The famous Koutoubia Mosque is named so because of its location on this street. Because the Qur'an itself was considered a sacred object, in order to beautify the book containing the holy scripture, a culture of calligraphy and lavish <b>bookbinding</b> developed.|$|E

25|$|At {{some point}} in 1934–35, during his studies with Schoenberg, Cage was working at his mother's arts and crafts shop, where he met artist Xenia Andreyevna Kashevaroff. She was an Alaskan-born {{daughter}} of a Russian priest; her work encompassed fine <b>bookbinding,</b> sculpture and collage. Although Cage was involved in relationships with Don Sample and with architect Rudolph Schindler's wife Pauline when he met Xenia, {{he fell in love}} immediately. Cage and Kashevaroff were married in the desert at Yuma, Arizona, on June 7, 1935.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bookbinding</b> {{combines}} skills {{from other}} trades such as paper and fabric crafts, leather work, model making, and graphic arts. It requires knowledge about numerous varieties of book structures {{along with all}} the internal and external details of assembly. A working knowledge of the materials involved is required. A book craftsman needs a minimum set of hand tools but with experience will find an extensive collection of secondary hand tools and even items of heavy equipment that are valuable for greater speed, accuracy, and efficiency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bookbinding</b> is a {{specialized}} trade {{that relies on}} basic operations of measuring, cutting, and gluing. A finished book depends {{on a minimum of}} about two dozen operations to complete but sometimes more than double that according to the specific style and materials. All operations have a specific order and each one relies on accurate completion of the previous step with little room for back tracking. An extremely durable binding can be achieved by using the best hand techniques and finest materials when compared to a common publisher's binding that falls apart after normal use.|$|E
50|$|Evelyn Nordhoff was {{the only}} woman {{bookbinder}} included in a Grolier Club exhibition on American <b>bookbindings</b> that ran from April 10-24, 1897; eight of her <b>bookbindings</b> were exhibited.

Some works on paper by Nordhoff are held at the National Museum of Women in the Arts.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the seminar "Reading Things" at CRAASH, Cambridge University. With industrialization in the 19 th century, book culture went {{through a number of}} changes. Like many other goods, literature began to be sold in retail packages – readymade <b>bookbindings</b> that conveyed the character of the literary content of the book. Objects such as packages and <b>bookbindings</b> took on an increasingly important place in the public and private spaces of modern society, spreading new imagery and symbolic messages. The use and handling of books and packages coincided with a use and handling of trade marks and logotypes and of a new world of images which introduced a number of new elements in everyday life. In this paper I will concentrate on the emergence of publishers’ <b>bookbindings,</b> and especially decorated cloth bindings: Why did publishers take on the commissioning of bindings, what kind of interaction between technology, economics and aesthetics took place on the book market, how can we understand the changes in binding design and how did modern, decorated <b>bookbindings</b> influence peoples relations to books and literature...|$|R
