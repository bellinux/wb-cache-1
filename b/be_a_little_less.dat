At this stage, a candidate requires an absolute majority of merely those actually present {{at the time of}} voting in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The actual number of votes required in the second round might be the same as in the first round, but as in 2008, it can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>less,</b> due to the absence of a few parliamentarians. Nevertheless, in this second round, a single candidate would need to win a majority in both the Chamber and the Senate.|$|E
500|$|The Chicago Tribune Michael Phillips wrote, [...] "Up in the Air is a slickly crafted disappointment. [...] feels {{tailor-made}} for George Clooney, {{who is very}} good. But the stakes remain frustratingly low and it's one of those contemporary middlebrow projects that asks us to root for a genial, shallow individual as he learns to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>less</b> the man he was." [...] Julian Sancton of Vanity Fair wrote, [...] "There are two movies in Up in the Air: one about a guy who's flying around the country firing people, and one about a commitment-phobe who's flying away from responsibility and a shot at true love, as embodied by Farmiga. There is no attempt to braid these two threads together, and that's where the movie feels unsatisfying." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "Like Juno, Up in the Air conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away. The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes... warns that you can't go home again – and then, full of false cheer and false consciousness, pretends you can." ...|$|E
500|$|The mystery {{surrounding}} Mary Alice and {{her family}} was the main storyline in the first season of the series, and it is resolved in the first season finale. Cherry had wanted {{there to be a}} [...] "definite end" [...] to the mystery, hoping to avoid similar viewer fatigue that Twin Peaks suffered after drawing out its central mystery past its first season. ABC executives initially protested the writers' decision to have Mary Alice purposefully kill [...] Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), the woman whose child she had illegally purchased, prompting the writers to make Deirdre violent in order to justify Mary Alice's actions. Although Mary Alice {{and her family}} do not have much of a leading storyline thereafter, the mystery surrounding the character's suicide in the inaugural season is said to have informed and influenced every other season of the series. In 2006, when asked during an interview what viewers could expect from Mary Alice for the series' third season, Strong said that the character was [...] "going to be back with an attitude", stating: [...] "She will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>less</b> surreal, ethereal and a little more sassy, which means the show is going to be sassier." [...] During the series' final season in 2011, the actress appears as Mary Alice's ghost to her suicidal friend Bree (Marcia Cross). Strong enjoyed filming that particular scene, as it was the only scene during the entire series that featured solely Mary Alice and Bree. She described the scene as one of her personal favorites and called it an [...] "extraordinary opportunity", saying: [...] "In a way, Mary Alice becomes [...] conscious and her guide and her muse in knowing what to do with her life. And it was an exquisitely written scene and it was really, I think in my experience on the show, one of my favorite scenes I have ever shot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Official film {{adaptations of}} Matheson's novel {{appeared}} in 1964 as The Last Man on Earth, in 1971 as The Omega Man, and the 2007 release I Am Legend. Matheson was not impressed by Romero's interpretation, feeling that [...] "It was ... kind of cornball", though he later said, [...] "George Romero's a nice guy, though. I don't harbor any animosity toward him." [...] Critic Danél Griffin remarked, [...] "Romero freely admits that his film {{was a direct}} rip-off of Matheson's novel; I would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>less</b> harsh in my description and say that Romero merely expanded the author's ideas with deviations so completely original that [...] is expelled from being labeled a true 'rip-off'".|$|E
2500|$|Other {{things being}} equal, a train {{is harder to}} pull around a curve than it is on {{straight}} track because the wagons – especially bogie (2 axle) wagons – try to follow the chord of the curve and not the arc. To compensate for this, the gradient should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>less</b> steep the sharper the curve is; the necessary grade reduction {{is assumed to be}} given by a simple formula such as 0.04 per cent per [...] "degree of curve", the latter being a measure of curve sharpness used in the United States. On a 10-degree curve (radius 573.7 feet) the grade would thus need to be 0.4% less than the grade on straight track.|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing for Rolling Stone, Chuck Arnold gave Piece by Piece a three star rating, lauding Clarkson's {{homage to}} 80s pop music, saying that [...] "when Clarkson hits that money note toward the end, big hair wins again". Giving the album a [...] "C", from The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski {{wrote in her}} review that, for Clarkson, [...] "the album's music doesn't play to her strengths," [...] further adding that [...] "the record could also stand to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>less</b> conventional, {{especially}} since Clarkson is the rare pop star who sounds most comfortable when she's not playing it safe." [...] Praising the songs [...] "Nostalgic" [...] and [...] "Take You High", Zaleski wrote that [...] "Piece By Piece sounds energized during these looser moments", saying [...] "it's hard to shake the feeling the album would've been far better had it taken a few more risks". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave the record a two star rating; despite praising Clarkson's voice, he expressed despondency that [...] "the album doubles-down on Strongers over-heated production," [...] remarking that [...] "Piece By Piece piles on the gloss and glop. It's a fat sounding recording that fights with, rather than enhances, Clarkson's to-the-rafters vocals." ...|$|E
