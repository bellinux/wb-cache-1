Neither Shankman nor Dixon {{could come up with}} a solution for filming [...] "Mama" [...] that did not require a three-way split screen — something they wanted to avoid— and both felt the number did not adequately advance the plot. As a result, [...] "Mama" [...] was reluctantly dropped from the film during pre-production, although it is used by Shaiman as an instrumental number when the Corny Collins kids dance the [...] "Stricken Chicken". A special version of [...] "Mama" [...] was recorded for the film's end credits in May 2007, during the final score recording process, which featured vocals from each of the three women most famous for portraying Tracy Turnblad: Ricki Lake from the 1988 film, Marissa Jaret Winokur from the original Broadway cast, and Nikki Blonsky from the 2007 film.

2500|$|Tia Ra'shone Brooks {{was born}} August 2, 1990 in Saginaw, Michigan to parents Cyd D. Neal and David Brooks. At East Kentwood High School, she {{primarily}} ran sprint events before her coach, John Makinen convinced {{her that she}} was better suited for throwing events. Initially, she fought the change and threatened to quit track and field. [...] "I didn't really want to throw the shot put," [...] she explained. [...] "I didn't want to be the stereotypical thrower... the <b>big</b> <b>girl</b> who didn't run and wasn't athletic." [...] After a heart-to-heart talk with her mother, Brooks relinquished. During high school, she was a four-time all-state honoree and a two-time regional champion. In her final year, she won the 2008 state title with a 14.65m (48' 0½"). She finished second in both the discus and shot put at the Midwest Meet of Champions.|$|E
2500|$|She goes {{to school}} and is given a warning for [...] "inappropriate hair height". After school, Tracy rushes home with her best friend, Penny, to catch the local teenage dance show, The Corny Collins Show (“The Nicest Kids in Town”). Edna, Tracy’s shy and {{overweight}} mother, is ironing and complains about {{the noise of the}} music coming from the television, while Penny’s mother, Prudy, complains about it being race music. After an announcement that auditions for a place on the show will be held {{due to the fact that}} Brenda (one of the Corny Collins Council Members) has taken a leave of absence from the show due to being pregnant, Tracy begs her mother for permission to audition. Edna, fearing that Tracy will be laughed at due to her weight, refuses. Penny and Amber (the main dancer on The Corny Collins Show) have similar arguments with their mothers ("Mama, I’m a <b>Big</b> <b>Girl</b> Now").|$|E
