25|$|His family {{originated}} from Kashmir {{and came to}} England in the 1960s with a dream of a better life. Khan was born in Birmingham, attended Somerville Primary school {{and then went on}} to Oldknow secondary school (later to become Small Heath School). At the age of 12 he displayed a remarkable passion and talent for cricket and it was through sheer luck that his talent was discovered in the playground by a cricket mad teacher, Pete Bolland. Later that year in 1983, he was selected for the Warwickshire Under 13's team where his potential as a leader was spotted very early, resulting in him being awarded the captaincy. Khan was the only state school boy in that team. His determination to succeed was evidenced by the fact that despite having never played hard ball cricket before, he top scored in his first year. Khan only had one dream and that was to make it at the highest grade and play professional cricket. As a young boy, he would find ways to get into Edgbaston to watch Warwickshire play and vowed to his friends that one day, he too would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

Jagger wins the fight by using his tongue to stab Tyler through the chest. The 2000 film Almost Famous, set in 1973, refers to Jagger: [...] "Because if you think Mick Jagger'll still <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> trying to be a rock star at age 50 ... you're sadly, sadly mistaken." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided {{it did not}} [...] "infringe on {{the integrity of the}} roster or of the season", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum — and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know." [...] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.|$|E

500|$|With {{the release}} of Mauboy's second studio album Get 'Em Girls, some critics {{felt that she was}} {{becoming}} an [...] "R sexpot". Both the album and its title track also received negative reviews from critics. The music video for the title track was heavily criticised by fans who felt that Mauboy had become too sexy and moved away from her good girl image. Speaking of Mauboy's image for R music, Fairfax Media journalist Bernard Zuel said: [...] "It's a problem, matching the personality to a formula. The formula with young women singing modern R is that they have to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> sexually, thrusting physically and vocally. But that's just not who she is." [...] Following {{the release of}} her single [...] "Gotcha" [...] in 2012, Miranda Cashin of Sunshine Coast Daily noted that it was [...] "a return to the Mauboy [...] before the infamous 2010 sexed-up fist-pumping album, Get 'Em Girls".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's {{performance}} {{also received}} positive response from celebrities and fans. US First Lady Michelle Obama, {{who attended the}} show said, [...] "Beyoncé stepped up {{in a way that}} so many of our celebrities and athletes are stepping up on behalf of this issue, so I love her to death and was glad to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> moving my body with her." [...] Governor of New Jersey Christopher J. Christie used his Twitter account to write that everything about the show was [...] "great". Beyoncé's husband and rapper Jay-Z, also wrote on Twitter that Beyoncé was the [...] "best performer in the world". A writer of Complex magazine further discussed his statements, [...] "Sure, he's married to her... But upon further reflection, he just might have a point. What other artist out there gives the type of live performance she does on a nightly basis? Who can give you that incredible voice singing power ballads and up-tempo dance cuts—while dancing?... In a world with hotshots like Lady Gaga, legends like U2, and even Jay-Z and Kanye West's The Throne bodying stages worldwide, is Beyoncé best performer on earth?".|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, {{researchers}} {{published the}} DNA {{sequence of the}} genome of a strain of HeLa cells. The Lacks family discovered this when the author Rebecca Skloot informed them. There were objections from the Lacks family about the genetic information that was available for public access. [...] Jeri Lacks Whye, a grandchild of Henrietta Lacks, said to The New York Times, [...] "the biggest concern was privacy - what information was actually going to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing that will tell them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line". [...] That same year another group working on a different HeLa cell line's genome under NIH funding submitted it for publication. In August 2013, an agreement was announced between {{the family and the}} National Institutes of Health that gave the family some control over access to the cells' DNA sequence found in the two studies along with a promise of acknowledgement in scientific papers. In addition, two family members will join the six-member committee which will regulate access to the sequence data.|$|E

500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would be in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in the other room going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E
500|$|Cleveland Indians {{owner and}} team {{president}} Bill Veeck proposed integrating baseball in 1942, {{which had been}} informally segregated {{since the turn of}} the century, but this was rejected by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Veeck had begun the process of finding a young, talented player from the Negro leagues, and told a reporter in Cleveland that he would integrate the Indians' roster if he could find a black player with the necessary talent level who could withstand the taunts and pressure of being the first black athlete in the AL. The reporter suggested Doby, of whom Veeck had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Training School. Doby's name was also mentioned when Veeck talked with reporters who covered the Negro leagues. Indians scout Bill Killefer rated Doby favorably and perhaps just as important for Veeck, reported Doby's off-field behavior was not a concern. The Dodgers rated Doby their top young Negro league prospect. But unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers' Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson one full season before bringing him to the National League, Veeck used a different strategy, letting Doby remain with the Eagles instead of bringing him through the Indians' farm system. He told the Pittsburgh Courier, [...] "One afternoon when the team trots out on the field, a Negro player will <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> with it." ...|$|E
500|$|James Villas is {{a former}} food editor for Town & Country magazine. The back flap of the book's jacket notes that Villas was [...] "beguiled by bacon {{since he was a}} boy." [...] Prior to The Bacon Cookbook, Villas had written other cookbooks {{including}} The Glory of Southern Cooking, My Mother's Southern Kitchen, and Biscuit Bliss. The Bacon Cookbook is his 15th book on food. In the lead-up to the 2009 International Bacon Day, Villas commented to Pork Magazine, [...] "People are starting to realize that bacon is no longer just a breakfast staple. Bacon is, without a doubt, one of the most versatile and flavorful options in the grocery aisle. Most importantly, a little bacon goes a long way. A sprinkle can enhance not only the flavor, but also the aroma and appeal of nearly any dish. We’re seeing chefs and home cooks add bacon to dishes you wouldn’t expect, like popcorn or cookies, and take traditional tastes to another dimension." [...] Villas explained to Salon, [...] "Bacon has the perfect balance of sweet, salty, smoky flavor, and the perfect balance of meaty and crispy texture." [...] Villas commented to CBS News that his book was part of a growing interest in bacon products, [...] "We have a lot more conscientious producers today, you know, really turning out fresh great product like we've got here in this store. I mean quality bacon. And America really should <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> searching for this stuff. And it'll change your life. It will really change your life." ...|$|E

500|$|In another interview, Ehrich {{expressed}} more of {{his opinions}} on the storyline, stating: [...] "It’s so relevant now and it’s such an epidemic. Just for it to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{to show that it}} happens. This is a real issue that needs to be addressed. To be a part of that, and to spread awareness feels so nice because I’ve personally experience bullying and I know many friends who have. Whether people’s reason behind it are good or bad, nonetheless, it affects kids to such an extent especially young, vulnerable kids." [...] Of the character's [...] "dark side", Ehrich stated: [...] "I love playing dark, but justifiably dark. It's never coming from a psychopathic place. First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen {{is supposed to be the}} crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one." [...] He also stated that [...] "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: [...] "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I’ve had numerous times on this show where I’ve gotten to be out of control, and it’s a really nice feeling. It’s exhilarating." [...] He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go [...] "too far", saying: [...] "He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil. I don't think he's asking for too much except for some love and trust. He's on a journey—a long, long journey to find some peace." ...|$|E

The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it!
