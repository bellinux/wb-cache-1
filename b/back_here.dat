When Mohammad Tughlaq shifted his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad many weavers came and settled here. During the exodus the weavers instead of returning to Delhi stayed <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> During the reign of Malik Ambar, the city's fame attracted many people from far and wide. During the Mughal rule under Aurangzeb's governorship, Auarangabad the capital and the weavers became more prosperous. The only industry in Aurangabad allured hundreds of craftsman. Members of the royal family and an elite few used the famous Aurangabad Himroo. Himroo weaving is very characteristic and distinctive. Fabrics and shawls from Aurangabad are much in demand for their unique style and design.|$|E

500|$|The series {{forced the}} NHL and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to {{reassess}} {{all aspects of}} how the game was played in North America. Journalist Herb Pinder described the NHL to that point in this way: [...] "The Europeans took our game and evolved it, while we stood still or even went backwards. [...] The Russians had a style, and the Czechs' style was different from that... There was this hockey world evolving through international competition, and we're <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> stuck, just playing ourselves. [...] It was a business monopoly. [...] And like any monopoly, the NHL got stagnant." [...] Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Canadian hockey encouraged the adoption of new coaching and training methods used in Europe, and emphasized conditioning and skills development.|$|E

500|$|In 1925, the spectre of {{deportation}} loomed again, but a Scottish anarchist named James Colton {{offered to}} marry her and provide British citizenship. Although they were only distant acquaintances, she accepted and they were married on June 27, 1925. Her new status gave her peace of mind, and allowed her to travel to France and Canada. Life in London was stressful for Goldman; she wrote to Berkman: [...] "I am awfully tired and so lonely and heartsick. It is a dreadful feeling to come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> from lectures and find not a kindred soul, no one who cares whether one is dead or alive." [...] She worked on analytical studies of drama, expanding on the work she had published in 1914. But the audiences were [...] "awful," [...] and she never finished her second book on the subject.|$|E
500|$|The result {{marked the}} first time that Manchester United had lost in the {{calendar}} year, ending a 33-match unbeaten run. Wenger believed the result showed that Arsenal were [...] "ready for the season", albeit admitting that the defence had trouble coping with Yorke. He thought it was [...] "...psychologically important to beat United, especially after the great run they have had". Wenger confirmed afterwards that Anelka would sign for Real Madrid: [...] "I hope everything will be finalised {{in the next couple of}} days. In any case, he is not coming <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> and although the contract is not signed yet, I hope it will be after his medical and that is the end of it." [...] Kanu, who scored Arsenal's equaliser and set up the match winner, was pleased with his performance and relished the opportunity of establishing himself in the first team, after Anelka's departure.|$|E

There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I should like to bring it <b>back</b> <b>here</b> and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.

500|$|Cole Waterman of PopMatters {{awarded the}} album {{a score of}} eight out of ten, finding the record to be the group's [...] "most {{accessible}} by far".

Pitchfork Media's Paul Thompson scored Oddfellows 6.8 out of ten, considering it [...] "Tomahawk's most straightforward, stripped-down release to date". Thompson considered the group's main dynamic to consist of Denison's compositions and Patton's vocals, finding that bass player Dunn [...] "hangs <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> ably holding down the low end without overasserting himself". Thompson also debated the effect that the album's short germination period had on its overall composition, believing that the brief recording time lent the record [...] "a feeling that, whenever you get these guys in the same room, this music [...] just comes tearing out".|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} <b>back</b> <b>here</b> if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E
500|$|According to Paul Wagenbreth of The News-Gazette, the novel's {{fundamental}} {{weakness is}} that after the slow buildup, [...] "there is a final shying away from a full rendering {{of the nature of}} the beast....there's a curious holding <b>back</b> <b>here</b> as elsewhere from a really probing look at the seductive appeal of vampirism, particularly the sensuality at its core." [...] Susanna Sturgis, agreed, writing in the Women's Review of Books that the plot dragged and that [...] "the reader loses interest" [...] in the core mysteries of the novel. Ong Sor Fern of The Straits Times criticized Kostova's portrayal of women, writing that her unnamed female narrator [...] "feels even more drab and colourless than Stoker's idealised female, Mina Harker". Sturgis criticized Kostova's characterization in general, contending that the major characters seemed more like [...] "disembodied tour guides". Polly Shulman of Newsday also argued that the book [...] "fail to grapple with its supposed themes: evil, death and history". She saw [...] "little of the terror of these periods" [...] in the novel and little of the tension between the Islamic East and the Christian West.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal contested {{the final}} against Chelsea on 4 May 2002. Wenger {{recalled}} Seaman in goal {{from the previous}} fixture, in place of Wright while Campbell was paired up with Adams in central defence. For Chelsea, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Graeme Le Saux passed late fitness tests and were named in the first team; John Terry filled the substitutes bench, having woken up with a virus. Chelsea threatened early with goal efforts from Le Saux and midfielder Frank Lampard, before Bergkamp fashioned the first real chance of the match – he headed the ball over the top, which caught goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini off his line. In the 70th minute Arsenal took the lead: Adams found Wiltord in space, who in turn passed the ball towards Parlour – he kicked [...] "from just beyond the arc", which flew into the top right corner. Ten minutes after, Ljungberg increased the lead, running from the half-way line and shrung off a late challenge by Terry to curl the ball past Cudicini. The win meant Arsenal completed one half of an expected double; Wenger {{was pleased with the}} team's performance, adding: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We have shown a lot of strength to come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it <b>back</b> <b>here</b> to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E
500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength to come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said {{three or four months}} ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will be up there with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E

[...] In response, Hillary Clinton pushed for criminal justice reform, and said, [...] "We need a new New Deal for communities of color." [...] Jim Webb, on the other hand, replied: [...] "As the president of the United States, every life in this country matters." [...] Hillary Clinton was not directly asked the same question, but was instead asked: [...] "What would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?" [...] Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating [...] "Look, I don't believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws". Without policy change, she felt [...] "we'll be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in 10 years having the same conversation."

500|$|Accrington Stanley re-signed McEvilly on {{a one-year}} {{contract}} following his departure from Wrexham. On his return to Accrington he commented; [...] "I am <b>back</b> <b>here</b> because I feel I have unfinished business. I played well for a year here and I {{want to do the}} same again". He had played 10 games in League Two and one game in the League Cup failing to score, and picking up a red card for violent conduct after a stamp on Peterborough United winger Jamie Day in their 2–0 home loss on 1 September. However, McEvilly struggled to hold down a regular place in the Accrington side and was loaned out to former club, Rochdale in November 2007. On his return to Spotland Stadium, he scored the only goal of Rochdale's 1–0 win over Mansfield Town on 24 November, with a shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. McEvilly made a total of seven appearances for Rochdale scoring three goals, before returning in January 2008. He made one more appearance for Accrington, coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute for Paul Mullin in the 2–0 defeat to Stockport County on 12 January, before joining Cambridge United on loan on 18 January. McEvilly made 14 appearances and scored three goals for Cambridge, helping them finish second place in the 2007–08 Conference National, securing a place in the playoffs. In Cambridge's playoff semi-final first leg, they drew 2–2 with Burton Albion away at the Pirelli Stadium with McEvilly scoring both Cambridge's goals. Cambridge were 2–0 down and McEvilly came on as a substitute for Mark Beesley in the 74th minute. Paul Hurst was deemed to have handled in the penalty area, and four minutes later McEvilly converted the penalty four minutes after coming off the bench. He scored his second goal from a direct free kick. In the following leg, McEvilly started the game and had a shot within the opening 30 seconds which Rob Wolleaston managed to score from the rebound, before being replaced by Leo Fortune-West in the 77th minute. McEvilly played in the final, in which Exeter City defeated Cambridge 1–0 at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
