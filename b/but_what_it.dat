Lewis’ white queen gained the aura of historical accuracy through primary research without sacrificing its symbolic links to abolitionism, black Africa, or black diaspora. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> refused to facilitate was the racial objectification of the artist’s body.

25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1500 Vicente Yáñez Pinzon was blown off course by a storm and reached {{what is now the}} north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of Pernambuco. His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary which he named Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce (Saint Mary's River of the Freshwater Sea). However, the land was too far east for the Castilians to claim under the Treaty of Tordesillas, but the discovery created Castilian (Spanish) interest, with a second voyage by Pinzon in 1508 (an expedition that coasted the northern coast to the Central American coastal mainland, in search of a passage to the East) and a voyage in 1515–16 by a navigator of the 1508 expedition, Juan Díaz de Solís. The 1515–16 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a River Plate river in a boat, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.|$|E

[...] Even Pentangle's earliest work is characterised by that synthesis of styles. Songs such as [...] "Bruton Town" [...] and [...] "Let No Man Steal Your Thyme" [...] from 1968's The Pentangle include elements of folk, jazz, blues, and early music. Pete Townshend described their sound as [...] "fresh and innovative." [...] By the release of their fourth album, Cruel Sister, in 1970, Pentangle had moved closer to traditional folk music and begun using electric guitars. By this time, folk music had itself moved towards rock {{and the use of}} electrified instruments, so Cruel Sister invited comparison with such works as Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief and Steeleye Span's Hark! The Village Wait. Pentangle is thus often described as one of the progenitors of British folk rock.|$|E

2500|$|Although she is {{credited}} on the sleeve, the album does not feature Velvet Underground stalwart drummer Maureen Tucker, {{as she was}} pregnant at the time. Drumming duties were performed mainly by bassist Doug Yule, recording engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanero and Doug Yule's brother Billy.

[...] While Morrison contributed guitar tracks to the album, he was also attending City College of New York and juggling his time between the sessions and classes, leaving most of the creative input to Reed and Yule. Doug Yule claimed that [...] "Lou leaned on me a lot in terms of musical support and vocal arrangements. I did a lot on Loaded. It sort of devolved down to the Lou and Yule recreational recording". Of the ten songs that make up Loaded, Yule's lead vocals were featured on four songs: [...] "Who Loves the Sun", which opens the album, [...] "New Age", [...] "Lonesome Cowboy Bill", and [...] "Oh!

2500|$|Philbert Ortiz Dy of ClickTheCity.com {{rated the}} film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote that [...] "all in all, Dukot {{is a pretty}} {{engaging}} film. From scene to scene, it manages to maintain a certain tone and build up the tension. But it’s all in service of a narrative that doesn’t have any thematic follow-through. The film builds so much moral ambiguity, and there’s so much left to dissect as the film raises the volume on the music and jumps to its conclusion. This is a sharp piece of filmmaking, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> ends up saying through its abandonment of its complexity is questionable at best." [...] Nazamel Tabares of Movies Philippines rated the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote that [...] "Dukot {{might not be as}} thrilling or as meaty as the themes it tackles, but it is a well-made suspense thriller that doesn’t come often in Philippine cinemas. It lacks power in its narrative even though it hints some every now and then, but the shots are tastefully done and the story is decent enough that you get to feel the tense of the situation and what the characters are going through emotionally. Well, some of it." [...] Rey de la Cruz Jr. of FHM Philippines rated the film 7.5 out of 10 describing the film as [...] "a well-directed suspense thriller about a real-life kidnapping. Nice to see an actor like Enrique Gil finally show off his acting skills." [...] Oggs Cruz of Rappler in a less positive review wrote that [...] "the film’s failure really lies in its misdirected ambitions. It only provokes partially, quickly retreating from its hefty provocations just when the opportunity to get darker and more vicious opens up. Again, it’s all interesting in premise. Everything else is just too safe." [...] Kevin Tan of Film Police Reviews rated the film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote that [...] "Dukot can be commended on injecting fresh ideas into the local mainstream industry, and it shows Soriano’s maturity in his craft. However, the script lacks the guts to deliver a story as dark and gritty as its visuals. Dukot holds back on depicting hostility and violence that could have rendered audiences more upset and unsettled about today’s reality the moment they exit theaters." ...|$|E
