König was awarded the German Cross in Gold for his fanatical leadership.|$|E
50|$|G#m7 and Gm7 tunings <b>are</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> tuning a semitone or a full step down, respectively. Em7 <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> tuning down by {{a perfect}} fourth.|$|R
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to be the first player to achieve 100% success, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> {{reaching}} the top of four goals. The goals are wealth, happiness, education and career. Wealth <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> having a certain level of money in the bank, shares and cash in the hand, the player normally would earn this money by going to work. Happiness <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> <b>achieving</b> other goals, acquiring goods and taking time off work. Education <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing the available university qualifications, the number of qualifications the player must complete will be dependent on how high the goal level is set. Career <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> climbing the career ladder into a management position in a particular job.|$|R
50|$|To {{allow for}} the {{systematic}} integration of the pragmatic and dialectical dimensions {{in the study of}} argumentation, the pragma-dialectical theory uses four meta-theoretical principles as its point of departure: functionalization, socialization, externalization and dialectification. Functionalization <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> treating discourse as a purposive act. Socialization <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> extending the speech act perspective to the level of interaction. Externalization <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> capturing the propositional and interactional commitments created by the speech acts performed. And dialectification <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> regimenting the exchange of speech acts to an ideal model of a critical discussion. (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 2004, pp.52-53).|$|R
5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
5|$|Another model {{suggests}} humans {{attempt to}} achieve {{all of their}} needs and aspirations via seven modalities: economy, community, occupational groups, government, environment, culture, and physiology. From the global to the individual human scale, {{each of the seven}} modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels. Human sustainability can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities.|$|E
5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors. This could <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> writing an allocator that allocates extra memory {{in which it}} places debugging information. Such an allocator {{could be used to}} ensure that memory is allocated and deallocated by the same type of allocator, and also provide limited protection against overruns.|$|E

5|$|Separation of the 3+ {{actinides}} {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of}} the cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.|$|E
5|$|The color {{matching}} required in a tiling by Wang dominoes can easily <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> modifying {{the edges of}} the tiles like jigsaw puzzle pieces so that they can fit together only as prescribed by the edge colorings. Raphael Robinson, in a 1971 paper which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, {{the twelfth}} grade is {{referred}} to as Year 12. In New South Wales, students are usually 16 or 17 years old when they enter Year 12 and 17-18 years during graduation (end of year). All students in Year 12 work towards getting an ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) or OP (Overall Position, which applies only to students in the state of Queensland), which will allow them access to courses at university. In South Australia, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing the SACE; in Victoria, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing the VCE; in the Australian Capital Territory, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing the AST and in New South Wales this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing the HSC.|$|R

5|$|The {{game has}} two endings, a good ending {{and a bad}} ending. The good ending can only <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> {{completing}} secret minigames, in which various animatronic characters bring a cake to {{what seems to be}} a sorrowful child's soul. This ending is thought to imply that the souls of the murdered children have been set free, although connoted meanings are disputed.|$|E
5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{reliable}} information on yield and root quality of new sugar beet hybrids, the micro varietal trials were {{set up on the}} experimental field of the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Zagreb in the period from 2010 to 2013. The study included a total of 51 sugar beet hybrids owned by five breeding companies present in the Croatian market. There were significant differences among investigated hybrids in root and sugar yield and sugar content in the roots in all years of research, except in the dry 2011. However, a large number of hybrids achieved statistically equal values because the differences were within the statistical tolerance. In 2010, the highest root yield (107. 5 t/ha) and the highest technological sugar yield (13. 5 t/ha) <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the hybrid Elvis. That year, the largest sugar content (15. 68 %) <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the hybrid Markus. In 2012, the highest root yield (86. 4 t/ha), and the highest sugar yield (12. 0 t/ha) <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the hybrid Serenada KWS. The largest root sugar content (17. 37 %) <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the hybrid Denisa KWS. In 2013, the highest root yield (90. 2 t/ha) and the highest sugar yield (10. 8 t/ha) <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the hybrid Terranova KWS.

5|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} with soap, drinking clean water, proper disposal of human waste, and breastfeeding babies {{instead of using}} formula. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts, and sugar). In those who are breast fed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Propagation both by {{seed and}} {{cuttings}} is difficult, reducing potential production by plant nurseries. Germination rates of soil-stored seeds {{have been found}} to increase substantially with the application of heat and aqueous solutions of smoke. The most satisfactory results from cuttings can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> using tip growth, taken six weeks after the cessation of flowering, and kept under a fogging system for twenty weeks. Plantsman Neil Marriott recommends semi-hardened cutting material taken in spring and autumn. Roots of cuttings are brittle and easily damaged.|$|E
