5|$|In 1928, Crawford starred {{opposite}} Ramón Novarro in Across to Singapore, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> role as Diana Medford in Our Dancing Daughters (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as {{a symbol}} of modern 1920s-style femininity which rivaled Clara Bow, the original It girl, then Hollywood's foremost flapper. A stream of hits followed Our Dancing Daughters, including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.|$|E

Rainbow (1999), Carey's sixth studio effort, received triple platinum certification from RIAA. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> first album since Emotions to not reach {{number one in}} the US. Carey parted from Columbia/Sony Music in 2001 and signed a contract with EMI's Virgin Records worth a reported US$100 million, the largest record contract ever signed. She released her next album, Glitter, which was the soundtrack to the film of same name. The album suffered from poor publicity and became a commercial failure.|$|E

She accomplished this through her writing and as an editor for the New York Tribune. However, ten years after their marriage Davis had faded substantially from the literary world. Clarke gave up law and became an editor for The Philadelphia Inquirer as well. As Clarke's success grew, Davis's work became more closely linked {{to that of a}} mother and a housewife. In 1892, Davis received a small critical and popular success with Silhouettes of American Life <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> last. She died at age 79, on September 29, 1910.|$|E

Under Yabuhara's direction she enlists him to kill a foreigner. She attempts to kill Hanada but falls in love with him, which instigates her capture and use as bait by Number One.

500|$|Pfeiffer {{had already}} begun {{to make a name for}} herself as an actress by {{starring}} in the films Tequila Sunrise, Dangerous Liaisons and Married to the Mob in 1988, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> 1989 performance in The Fabulous Baker Boys that ultimately benefited her career the most by leaving the biggest impression on the film industry, becoming one of her defining roles. One of the actress' earliest notable performances, Susie remains Pfeiffer's most critically acclaimed role to-date, having earned her the most enthusiastic reviews of her career thus far. In 2007, Mal Vincent of The Virginian-Pilot called Susie [...] "her greatest role", a sentiment shared by Into Film. According to the Arizona Daily Suns Erin Shelley, Susie is the role that finally [...] "cemented Michelle Pfeiffer's reputation as a movie star." [...] New Woman contributor Adam Platt wrote that, after the successes of The Witches of Eastwick (1987) and Dangerous Liaisons, The Fabulous Baker Boys established the actress as [...] "a Hollywood star". Harper's Bazaars Carolyn Doyle Karasyov agreed that Susie [...] "captivated the critics and solidified [...] position as one of Hollywood's leading ladies." [...] Stephen Rebello of Movieline believes that the Academy Award nomination Pfeiffer received for her performance finally [...] "allowed her to pick the projects she desired" [...] henceforth.|$|E

However, she highlighted [...] "Secret", [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] as the standout tracks from Bedtime Stories. Steve Morse, writer from The Boston Globe journal, criticized the album for lacking [...] "life", and being [...] "flat and listless", and said that Madonna seemed lost throughout the album. Allen Metz and Carol Benson, authors of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, opined that [...] "rather than signify(ing) some bold new direction for Madonna, Bedtime Stories takes hardly any risks at all. [...] it offers neither the pop epiphany of Like a Prayer nor the shameless frolic of Madonna's earlier dance hits". British magazine NME ranked Bedtime Stories as the 30th best album of 1994. At the 38th Grammy Awards in 1996, the album received a nomination for Best Pop Album. Slant Magazine included Bedtime Stories on their list of [...] "The Best Albums of the 1990s" [...] at number 63, with Cinquemani writing, [...] "instead of simply following American trends of the time, Madge infused the album with the edgier trip-hop sounds that were happening {{on the other side}} of the pond. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> refined literary taste, from Proust to Whitman, and both the media and the public's rejection of her sexual politicking that truly informed the singer's seventh album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lauren Everitt from BBC News Magazine {{commented on}} melisma used in Houston's {{recording}} and its influence. [...] "An early 'I' in Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' takes nearly six seconds to sing. In those seconds the former gospel singer-turned-pop star packs {{a series of}} different notes into the single syllable", stated Everitt. [...] "The technique is repeated throughout the song, most pronouncedly on every 'I' and 'you'. The vocal technique is called melisma, and it has inspired a host of imitators. Other artists may have used it before Houston, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> rendition of Dolly Parton's love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s. [...] But perhaps what Houston nailed best was moderation." [...] Everitt said that [...] "n a climate of reality shows ripe with 'oversinging,' it's easy to appreciate Houston's ability to save melisma {{for just the right}} moment." ...|$|E

[...] Another, addressed to married women, asked the question, [...] "Is it desirable, then, for parents to increase their families, regardless of consequences to themselves, or the well-being of their offspring, when a simple, easy, healthy, and certain remedy is within our control?" [...] Advertisements for the [...] "Female Monthly Regulating Pills" [...] she also sold vowed to resolve [...] "all cases of suppression, irregularity, or stoppage of the menses, however obdurate."

2500|$|Despite {{steadily}} {{working in}} pictures, Lucy's movie career never {{advanced to the}} level of a headlining feature-film actress; nevertheless she remained popular with movie audiences. After receiving critical acclaim for her starring role in the 1942 Damon Runyon film The Big Street (with Henry Fonda), Ball came to the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which bought out her contract. It was at MGM that Ball, who had been a blonde, dyed her hair red to complement the Technicolor features that MGM had planned to use her in. MGM used Ball in a variety of films, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> work with funny man Red Skelton in the 1942 film DuBarry Was a Lady that brought Ball's physical comedy into the forefront, earning her the reputation as [...] "that crazy redhead", as Ricky would later call her. Nonetheless, Ball's striking beauty was in sharp contrast to physical antics she did in her films; thus, MGM tried to use her in an array of different film genres that did little to highlight her skills. Given their difficulties in casting her, MGM chose not to renew her contract when it expired in 1946.|$|E
