[...] Ross stated that he kept an extremely small circle during the entire recording process. [...] "I keep my circle extremely small when it comes to me recording my music. I put the music together before I even put the words to the music, because I feel it's easier for me to write the words and make it fit the music versus me finding music that can fit my words." [...] Ross has stated numerous times how he has compared this album to films, and has taken a cinematic approach during the entire development of the album.

Ross said the track [...] "Amsterdam" [...] was based on the red light district, [...] "I kinda flipped it where being a boss you gotta get approval for a green light.

Drizzy came in, as well as Wale, and it's kinda like, 'She could be my diced pineapple. This special lady, she could be what I wake up to every morning and help me get by every day."
