5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the stands of <b>Bur</b> <b>Oak</b> trees. The University of Michigan moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate {{in the early to}} mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a {{reputation}} as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as various student movements.|$|E
25|$|Indiana bats {{were found}} {{in a variety of}} plant {{associations}} in a southern Iowa study. Riparian areas were dominated by eastern cottonwood, hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum). In the forested floodplains, the dominant plants included black walnut (Juglans nigra), silver maple, American elm (Ulmus americana), and eastern cottonwood. In undisturbed upland forest, the most common plants were black oak (Quercus velutina), <b>bur</b> <b>oak</b> (Q. macrocarpa), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), and bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis). Black walnut, American basswood, American elm, and <b>bur</b> <b>oak</b> dominated other upland Indiana bat sites.|$|E

50|$|Oak savanna is {{characterized}} by two layers: an overstory of scattered, widespread <b>oaks</b> (mostly <b>bur</b> <b>oaks</b> and black oaks) with an understory of wildflowers, sedges and grasses.|$|R
50|$|The {{bottomland}} forest comprises 170 acre of cottonwood, silver maple, and elm. Saplings {{of those}} three species plus ash and basswood fill in the understory. The campground and nearby picnic area are within 49 acre of <b>oak</b> savanna. Mature <b>bur</b> <b>oaks</b> dominate, with scattered birch, elm, hawthorn, and red cedar. A further 49 acre of parkland are characterized as open woods with just <b>bur</b> <b>oaks</b> and some elms. Just north of the falls parking lot is an old 2 acre orchard of black walnut. However it was a poorly chosen plot, as the trees are stunted for their age.|$|R
25|$|Riding Mountain National Park is {{also well}} known for its wildflowers and wide range of unique vegetation, most of which is not seen {{anywhere}} else in the prairie regions of Canada. There are 669 species of plants in the park. Vegetation common to the region includes aspen poplar, balsam poplar, white birch or paper birch, white spruce, balsam fir, jack pine, black spruce, tamarack, American elm, Manitoba maple, and <b>bur</b> <b>oak.</b>|$|E
25|$|At lower elevations, {{coniferous}} trees, {{mainly the}} ponderosa pine, surround {{most of the}} monument, providing shade from the sun. Other trees include the <b>bur</b> <b>oak,</b> the Black Hills spruce, and the cottonwood. Nine species of shrubs grow near Mount Rushmore. There is also {{a wide variety of}} wildflowers, including especially the snapdragon, sunflower, and violet. Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser. However, only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.|$|E
25|$|Prior to European {{settlement}} in the 19th century, the vegetation consisted of tallgrass prairie and <b>bur</b> <b>oak</b> savanna on ridgetops and dry upper slopes, sugar maple-basswood-oak forest on moister slopes, sugar maple-basswood forests in protected valleys and on north-facing slopes, wet prairies along the rivers and some mesic prairie on the floodplain farther back from the river. There were probably also oak forests that contained no sugar maple. Marsh and floodplain forests were also common on river flood plains. Prairie was restricted primarily to the broader ridge tops, which were unfavorable sites for trees due to thin soils and shallow bedrock, rapid drainage, and desiccating winds; all these conditions were also good for carrying fires across the landscape. Prairies also occurred on steep slopes with south or southwest aspect (see goat prairie). Natural fire, which has long been vigorously suppressed, was essential for the regeneration of such prairies.|$|E
5000|$|The city of Springfield's park {{district}} {{adopted a}} management plan in 2008 that applies various natural area conservation consensus positions to the park.

500|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824 by land speculators John Allen and Elisha Walker Rumsey. On May 25, 1824, the town plat was {{registered}} with Wayne County as [...] "Annarbour;" [...] this represents the earliest known use of the town's name. Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives, both named Ann, and for the stands of <b>Bur</b> <b>Oak</b> in the [...] of land they purchased for $800 {{from the federal government}} at $1.25 per acre. The local Ojibwa named the settlement kaw-goosh-kaw-nick, after the sound of Allen's sawmill.|$|E

From 1889-1946, Confederate Civil War veterans and families reunited at the site during late-July or early-August, camping under the giant <b>bur</b> <b>oaks,</b> enjoying speeches, concerts, dances, fellowship and food, and raising funds for families of their fallen comrades.|$|R
50|$|Records {{from the}} presettlement General Land Survey of Rice and Dakota Counties {{show that the}} southeastern banks of the Cannon River in the Arb {{historically}} were oak savanna. This can be seen today {{by the presence of}} many old (over a century) <b>bur</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus macrocarpa) in the Arb forests, now overgrown by fire-intolerant species. European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) is a particularly aggressive invader in these degraded oak habitats.|$|R

2500|$|Greenleaf Lake State Recreation Area is {{characterized}} by rolling topography supporting northern hardwood forest, wetlands, grasslands, and croplands. [...] The peninsula and island bear an unusual forest type for Minnesota: rock elm and American elm mixed with basswood, green ash, <b>bur</b> <b>oak,</b> and red oak. [...] The southwest shore of Greenleaf Lake bears an open <b>bur</b> <b>oak</b> woodland with some basswood, green ash, red oak, hackberry, and bitternut hickory. [...] While most of these habitats are secondary forest, some tracts of old-growth forest remain. [...] The elm forest was protected from most wildfires by the lakes, and was minimally affected by the Dutch elm disease outbreak in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|A {{gallery forest}} extends across the prairie {{on either side}} of the Buffalo River. [...] It is {{characterized}} by elm, ash, cottonwood, oak, and basswood.

[...] The drier soil along the lip of the riverbank supports <b>bur</b> <b>oak.</b> [...] Patches of willow, aspen, and boxelder occur on the prairie in spots with poor drainage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{valley floor}} {{supports}} marshes and wet prairie interspersed with bottomland hardwood forest of willow, eastern cottonwood, American elm, silver maple, and green ash. The steep valley walls bear northern hardwood forest, although the cooler, moister north-facing slopes favor sugar maple, basswood, and common hackberry while the drier south slopes {{are characterized by}} <b>bur</b> <b>oak,</b> eastern red cedar, and aspen. [...] A few dry, sunny knolls support prairie characterized by big bluestem and indian grass.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s Denver Busby bought 190 acre {{that became}} known as the Burr Ridge dairy farm. He later {{launched}} the Burr Ridge Estates, with 5 acre home sites. In 1961 the International Harvester Company and the Burr Ridges Estates merged with Harvester, changing the community's name to Burr Ridge. The town name is derived from a group of <b>bur</b> <b>oaks</b> (scientists spell it with one r) on a ridge. By 1963 the population had more than doubled, to 790, and by 1975 it had soared to over 2,200.|$|R
50|$|The nature {{preserve}} features gigantic 200-400 year old-growth forest that often measure 4 feet in diameter, {{reminiscent of the}} Great Black Swamp. There is a small area that preserves the rare ecosystem of Oak Openings, which consists very large specimens of white and <b>bur</b> <b>oaks,</b> but without any ofthe small under story trees. The Indians of the area created an open savanna to facilitate their hunting by keeping the brush and small trees down, by burning in the fall. The first settlers could easily drive their wagons in any direction through the sparsely spaced trees.|$|R
50|$|Brock and his wife, Kathie, operate Pleasant Valley Conservancy State Natural Area, a 140 acre {{preserve}} {{in western}} Dane County, Wisconsin. It consists of extensive restored oak savannas, dry, mesic, and wet prairies, wetlands, and oak woods. Scenic views and wildlife viewing are excellent, and several trails provide {{ready access to}} the Preserve. Especially noteworthy at Pleasant Valley are the fine oak savannas, once common in the Midwest but now very rare. The Preserve has many large open-grown white and <b>bur</b> <b>oaks,</b> which can be viewed from Pleasant Valley Road, and seen close up from the trails. The herbaceous layer in the savanna is highly diverse.|$|R

40|$|Hannibal Woods is a small, oak-ash (Quercus macrocarpa/ Fraxinus pensylvanica) forest relict {{located on}} {{the south and west}} sides of Dannebrog, Nebraska. The site was first studied in 1996 as part of a botanical survey of the Loup River Valley. Since the initial work, plant {{collections}} have been made several times each growing season through 2005, and an annotated list of plant species has been compiled. This study reports a total of 271 plant species representing 62 families including 86 species that are new records for Howard County. The mature <b>bur</b> <b>oaks</b> at this site average 84. 0 cm in diameter. Species that are uncommon in central Nebraska include Agastache nepetoides, Arabis hirsuta var. pycnocarpa, Botrychium virginicum, Bromus ciliatus, Bromus latiglumis, Carex grisea, Carex leavenworthii, Carex molesta, Elymus villosus, and Ulmus rubra. Hannibal Woods is botanically significant in that it supports the growth of plant species which are more representative of sites further east, such as the lower Platte and Missouri River Valleys...|$|R
50|$|During {{that same}} year, the first tree was {{planted on the}} Sioux City campus's Loess Hills Arboretum and Nature Trail. The Advanced Sciences Building, which was started in 2003, was {{dedicated}} and held its first classes in 2005. It added 78000 sq ft of additional instructional space to the Sioux City campus. During 2007, the college saw its first annual homecoming celebration and debuted its new Comets mascot. In 2008, the Sioux City campus expanded significantly, adding 66 acre of undeveloped woodland, prairie, and watershed to its Loess Hills Arboretum and Nature Trail. A new residence hall, the <b>Bur</b> <b>Oaks</b> Suites, was also completed, adding housing for 185 more students. Likewise, the Security Institute, a 37000 sq ft facility, was constructed. The structure is a collaboration of the college, the city, and county, and provides an unprecedented standard of training in real-life, real-time condition of crisis and a new location for county 911 communications and city/county emergency operations. In 2009 the Beltway Center on Highway 75 North in Sioux City was secured as a site for housing transportation related training including truck driving and motorcycle handling.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the last}} ice age most of the {{vegetation}} in the Riding Mountain region was eliminated, and it remained this way after the retreat of the glaciers 12,500 years ago. The Riding Mountain upland and surrounding plains and Manitoba Escarpment were mostly carved in the Tertiary era, but the ice sheets of the Pleistocene period modified the drainage and appearance of the land. Only the movement of {{the last ice}} sheet in this period left a visible effect on the features of the region. About 11,500 years ago a spruce dominated forest began to emerge in its place, with some of the vegetation being ash, juniper, sedges, buffaloberry, and trembling aspen. After this time the climate was dry, and [...] the percentage of spruce decreased. During the Holocene climatic optimum up until 6500 years ago the amount of herbs, shrubs and grasses in the park increased. At the end of this time beaked hazelnut appeared and the amount of <b>bur</b> <b>oak</b> increased, with the climate becoming cooler and moister. Up to 2,500 years ago the amount of grassland species in general decreased and boreal forests migrated into the Riding Mountain region. It was at this moment that ecosystems began to resemble those of today, with species such as tamarack, fir, alder, pine and spruce becoming more common. Several streams that run through the park have headwaters in Riding Mountain's lakes. Clear Lake's water comes from underground springs rather than from streams.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{methods and}} progress {{in developing the}} American Long Oak Chronology (ALOC), an effort to construct an oak tree-ring chronology from the Central US that spans the Holocene. Since 2000, we have collected and measured ring widths on over 550 pieces of subfossil oak (Quercus) wood. Over 330 oak samples have been radiocarbon dated, with ages ranging up to 14, 000 cal yr B. P. A 1, 093 - year-long tree-ring record has been constructed from live and subfossil <b>bur</b> <b>oaks</b> (Q. macrocarpa Michx.) and swamp white oaks (Q. bicolor Willd.) growing along and buried in sediments of streams that flow through northern Missouri and southern Iowa, USA. Here we describe the ALOC for the period A. D. 912 – 2004 to demonstrate its dendrochronological value, display the material quality, and {{emphasize the importance of}} chronology construction. We also report on progress in developing older floating chronologies. The development of more long, multi-millennium chronologies will be an important contribution to dendroclimatology. These chronologies will be particularly useful to the Central US, a region with a continental climate and limited temporal depth of annually resolved paleorecords. Perhaps more critical is its location in the middle {{of one of the most}} important agricultural regions in the world...|$|R
50|$|Rand Freeland, who {{valued the}} giant white pines, <b>bur</b> <b>oaks,</b> and massive elms, the Don river, {{as well as}} the diverse wilflife which {{inhabited}} the surrounding areas of his new establishment, saw the importance of conservation, as did his good friend Charles Sauriol, who co-founded the Don Valley Conservation Association (DVCA) in 1949. The DVCA, of whom Freeland was a passionate member of, was dedicated to preserving the Don Valley as a natural forest and its efforts were especially significant after the devastation caused by Hurricane Hazel in October or 1954. Prior to the hurricane, the Todmorden area had been slated for further development by the city, but as the Don and Humber rivers proved to be vital drainage channels after the flooding caused by the hurricane, authorities came to see the value in Toronto’s ravine system. Tormorden mills was soon deemed as one of the number of sites to be kept under preservation by the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) thanks to its conjoined efforts with the DVCA. Freeland often donated the use of Fantasy Farm’s facilities for the DVCA’s events and celebrations, placing the venue as a monumental beacon {{in the history of the}} Don Valley’s preservation.|$|R
5000|$|According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, {{over the}} {{previous}} two decades the state of Iowa has received more early season rainfall than in years past. [...] This increase in moisture may be what is leading to a more favorable environment for BOB to flourish in. It is unknown if the observed disease {{is caused by a}} new pathogen or if the conditions are simply more favorable for the existing pathogen to thrive. Several changes have been documented in the Iowa annual cycles including warmer nighttime temperatures, more humidity, more spring and summer rainfall, and a shift from the normal late season precipitation. [...] In the latter part of April and into May rains help BOB during its most critical period by slashing conidia from the crustose pychnothyria on the upper surface of the leaf. The amount of rainfall during this critical time of year has been higher than the normal averages since 1895. [...] They also report that there have been no droughts in Iowa from 1989 -2011. This increase in moisture is thought to be responsible for the buildup of primary inoculum. Repeated defoliations due to high concentrations of BOB conidia will eventually lead to a depletion of the <b>bur</b> <b>oak’s</b> food reserves and ultimately cause death.|$|R
