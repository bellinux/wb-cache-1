50|$|After so {{many changes}} in the prior year, it is no {{surprise}} that there were few changes for 1970. Most US makes including Chrysler adopted <b>bias</b> <b>belted</b> tires. They were a short-lived hybrid that combined familiar soft riding bias body plies with tread stabilizing belts used in European style radial tires. One well known brand name at the time was Goodyear’s Polyglas. All 1970 Chryslers featured standard <b>bias</b> <b>belted</b> tires, with Town & Country wagons wearing size J78-15. J identified the second largest size available in load capacity, 78 indicated a cross-section height-to-width, or aspect ratio of 78%, and 15 being the nominal rim diameter in inches, as before.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the overall}} size of 1974 Chryslers was barely {{larger than the}} {{fuselage}} generation that preceded it, weight continued to creep upward. Additional emission controls, safety features, and growing standard equipment lists were having {{the same effect on}} every automaker. The 3-seat T&C tipped the scales at just under 5,000 pounds, about 300 pounds heavier than ’72 fuselage generation T&C. With air conditioning, and a typical complement of power assists, the average ’74 T&C weighed about 5,200 pounds. Standard tires were size L78x15 <b>bias</b> <b>belted</b> on size 6.5x15 inch rims. Steel belted radials were optional.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The power {{consumption}} and load capacity of agricultural machines have grown {{and the effects}} of pressure on the soil by tires have been still little investigated. In concern with sustainable development, the relationship machine-tire-soil must be in balance to give more consistency on the best use of tires for a given load. This study aimed to evaluate four tires of two constructive types, the <b>bias</b> <b>belted</b> tires and radial tires, both with respective rim diameters of 22. 5 and 26. 5 inches with variables measuring the footprint, elastic deformation, sinkage and resistance to penetration. A hydraulic press with an attachment shaft for tire mounting and a box of soil in which the tire has been imposed on a load of 53. 00 kN using nominal pressures recommended by the tire manufacturer. The radial construction tire with rim diameter of 26. 5 inches obtained less sinkage and resistance to penetration; however, greater elastic deformation and footprint compared to other tires. The bias-belted tire with 22. 5 -inch rim presented the highest resistance to penetration and the lowest elastic deformation...|$|E

5000|$|A <b>belted</b> <b>bias</b> tire {{starts with}} two or more bias-plies to which {{stabilizer}} belts are bonded directly beneath the tread. This construction provides smoother ride {{that is similar to}} the bias tire, while lessening rolling resistance because the belts increase tread stiffness. The design was introduced by Armstrong, while Goodyear made it popular with the [...] "Polyglas" [...] trademark tire featuring a polyester carcass with belts of fiberglass. The [...] "belted" [...] tire starts two main plies of polyester, rayon, or nylon annealed as in conventional tires, and then placed on top are circumferential belts at different angles that improve performance compared to non-belted <b>bias</b> tires. The <b>belts</b> may be fiberglass or steel. This technology was a temporary, not invented here stop-gap, introduced by U.S. manufacturers to forestall the radial tire.|$|R
