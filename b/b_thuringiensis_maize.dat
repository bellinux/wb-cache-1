30|$|Of the GM maize applications, 57 % {{contained}} studies {{carried out}} by the applicant with the respective GMP under field conditions in Europe (Table 6). European studies were conducted in one or two countries at one or two locations per country. In two cases, field studies were mentioned, but data of the respective studies were not shown (maize NK 603 and NK 603 Ã— MON 810). Additionally, applicants referred to published field studies on the NTO effects of B. thuringiensis crops. However, the respective GMP used in the literature was generally not indicated when the applicant cited published studies for the discussion of the potential adverse effects of the GMP on NTOs. Applicants also referred to studies in which not the respective GMP that was the subject of the requested approval was used. For example, for Bt 11 maize, the applicant presented a summary report of various surveys of NTOs in <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> fields. This report was not specifically compiled for Bt 11 but for the registration of B. thuringiensis corn by US authorities and consequently contained studies with different <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> events. Five of the 16 studies were conducted with Bt 11 maize. From the total of 16 studies, five were conducted in Europe, however none of these with maize Bt 11. Concerning maize NK 603, seven field studies were cited, but six of these dealt with other GM crop species such as HT soybean or HT wheat. The studies cited for stacked event maize applications generally dealt with the single-event GMPs.|$|E
30|$|For the {{assessment}} of effects on and mediated by TOs, data on the efficacy and on the basic biological effects (e.g. mortality, development time, fecundity, etc.) of the GMPs for all listed target pests are essential. In the laboratory studies submitted in order to demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> events (Table 4), applicants generally tested the bacteria-produced GM proteins instead of the GM plant. By using only purified bacterial proteins in optimized diets, any plant/toxin interactions are excluded, the potential bioactivity of smaller fragments of B. thuringiensis proteins, e.g. as found in maize MON 810, are overlooked [27], and the variability in toxin concentrations in planta[28] is not taken into consideration (see also [7]).|$|E
30|$|Species, {{which are}} EU-wide, nationally or {{regionally}} endangered and/or protected {{may be of}} particular concern if GMPs interfere with their life cycles, habitats, competitors or food resources. Directive 2001 / 18 /EC and its guidelines [15] specifically address endangered species. However, protected species have not been seriously considered {{in any of the}} GM maize applications. This fact, however, has implications for the evaluation of the interactions of the GMP with NTOs. The only substitute species mentioned in <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> applications is the Monarch butterfly, a species with virtually no relevance for European ecosystems. Even for maize 59122, which expresses a coleopteran-active protein, no non-pest, endangered or protected coleopteran species was considered.|$|E
40|$|Public {{concern about}} {{possible}} negative health effects due to consumption of GM plants, together with concerns about possible environmental dangers, {{have led the}} European Commission to limit strictly the distribution of GM plants in the EU. The EU regulations No 49 and 50 / 2000 require the food industry to label, as GMO containing, those food products not certified free of transgenic plant material. Foods are considered "clean" and may be left unlabeled, if the GM content does not exceed 1 %. The presence of GM in food and feed products can be evaluated by detecting the transgenic DNA (PCR technique), or by detecting proteins derived from this DNA (immunological methods). At the Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering both qualitative and quantitative PCR-based tests are standardized. Commonly used primers are designed from the CaMV 35 S promoter for the answer yes/no in general GMO screening procedure. Specific modifications, as in herbicide tolerant RoundUp Ready Soybean or insect resistant maize (Bt 176 corn), are identified by primers designed from specific genes e. g. the EPSPS - gene from A. tumefaciens (for soybean) and the CrylA gene from <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> (for <b>maize).</b> The experimentally determined detection limit is 1 pg, which allows detection of O, 01 % GM DNA in test-samples and meets criteria prescribed for the EU laboratories accredited to issue a certificate...|$|R

40|$|A {{population}} (SERD 3) of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.) with field-evolved {{resistance to}} Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD- 1 (Dipel) and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai (Florbac) was collected. Laboratory-based selection of two subpopulations of SERD 3 with <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki (Btk-Sel) or <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai (Bta-Sel) increased {{resistance to the}} selecting agent with little apparent cross-resistance. This result suggested the presence of independent resistance mechanisms. Reversal of resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai was observed in the unselected SERD 3 subpopulation. Binding to midgut brush border membrane vesicles was examined for insecticidal crystal proteins specific to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki (Cry 1 Ac), <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai (Cry 1 Ca), or both (Cry 1 Aa and Cry 1 Ab). In the unselected SERD 3 subpopulation (ca. 50 - and 30 -fold resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai), specific binding of Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ac, and Cry 1 Ca {{was similar to that}} for a susceptible population (ROTH), but binding of Cry 1 Ab was minimal. The Btk-Sel (ca. 600 -and 60 -fold resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai) and Bta-Sel (ca. 80 -and 300 -fold resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai) subpopulations also showed reduced binding to Cry 1 Ab. Binding of Cry 1 Ca was not affected in the Bta-Sel subpopulation. The results suggest that reduced binding of Cry 1 Ab can partly explain resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai. However, the binding of Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ac, and Cry 1 Ca and the lack of cross-resistance between the Btk-Sel and Bta-Sel subpopulations also suggest that additional resistance mechanisms are present...|$|R
30|$|Efficacy {{data are}} a basic {{element in the}} {{assessment}} of effects on and mediated by TOs and are as well important for the evaluation of the interactions of GMPs with NTOs. For <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> expressing the Cry 1 Ab or Cry 1 F protein, only in 20 % of the applications were the target pest species O. nubilalis and Sesamia sp. evaluated in the field (maize 1507; Tables 3 and 4). For maize 59122, no field data were presented providing evidence that this GM maize is effective in the field against its coleopteran TO as the insects evaluated in the field were not indicated in the application (Table 3). Hence, there is no information whether maize 59122 is actually controlling its TO under representative field conditions in Europe.|$|E
30|$|The {{identification}} of the TO(s) for a particular <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> event by the applicants was {{not consistent with the}} submitted insect resistance management [IRM] plans for B. thuringiensis crops. These were exclusively focused on O. nubilalis or D. v. virgifera, respectively. Other pest species, even if listed as TOs, such as Sesamia spp., were always left unconsidered in IRM plans. Especially lepidopteran pest species that may be affected to a lesser degree by B. thuringiensis toxins (e.g. Spodoptera spp., Agrotis spp.) [21, 22] might develop resistance fairly quickly. A pest species may be classified as a 'non-target pest' for pest control purposes if it is not reliably controlled by a particular B. thuringiensis crop (e.g. Spodoptera spp.), but as a 'target' {{from the perspective of the}} insect resistance manager if it is sublethally affected. Hence, a careful definition and justification of what is a target and a non-target pest is important as it has implications for the evaluation of the interactions of GMPs with NTOs.|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} the toxin {{expressed}} in the GMPs on NTOs were assessed {{at different levels of}} containment (laboratory, greenhouse or field). In 100 % of the applications, the effects of B. thuringiensis proteins on NTOs were evaluated in laboratory studies using a standard set of test species representing a typical toxicological testing regime, e.g. as used for pesticide testing. Most testing was carried out using honeybees, earthworms, green lacewings, parasitic hymenoptera and ladybird beetles (see [14]). Generally, the isolated bacteria-expressed proteins were fed to the test organisms. Additionally, pollen (e.g. ladybird beetles, honeybees, daphnids); protein suspensions (honeybees, adult ladybirds and parasitic hymenoptera); moth eggs coated with bacteria-derived protein solutions (green lacewings); or soils amended with bacteria-produced proteins (earthworms, springtails) were used. The same laboratory toxicity tests were submitted in different applications of different <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> expressing the same class of toxins (e.g. Cry 1 Ab) without taking into account possible event-specific differences. The measured parameters related mostly to mortality and, therefore, acute toxicity. The endpoints used were no-observed-effect-concentration [NOEC], LC 50 or unspecified 'signs of toxicity'. Depending on the species assessed, sublethal parameters were measured in 0 % (parasitic hymenoptera, fish), 20 % (bees), 25 % (pest Lepidoptera), 33.3 % (daphnids, green lacewing larvae), 40 % (earthworms, coccinellids), 50 % (carabids, aphids), 80 % (collembola) and 100 % (mammals, birds and flower bugs) of the laboratory studies with NTOs presented in the applications [14].|$|E

40|$|Ten {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{were produced}} against a k- 1 -type crystal protein of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki. Eight of the antibodies {{belong to the}} immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG 1) subclass, with pI values ranging from 5. 5 to 8. 6, one could be assigned to the IgG 2 b subclass, and one could be assigned to the IgM class. Competitive antibody-binding assays and analysis of antibody specificity indicated that the 10 antibodies recognized at least nine distinct antigenic determinants. Eight antibodies bound to both protoxin and toxin, whereas the other two interacted with protoxin only. One antibody completely inhibited the biological activity of the delta-endotoxin, five antibodies reduced it by 15 to 82 %, and four antibodies did not affect it at all. Based on cross-reaction studies, homologies and differences in the crystal protein structures of different <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subspecies were revealed. All of the monoclonal antibodies strongly cross-reacted with crystal proteins from strains of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. tolworthi, <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. galleriae, <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. dendrolimus, <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. sotto, and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. subtoxicus.

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner based biopesticides {{have been}} {{successfully}} used world over for the control of agricultural pests and vectors of human diseases. Currently {{there are more than}} 200 <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains with differing insecticidal activities are available as biocontrol agents and for developing transgenic plants. However, two major disadvantages are the development of insect resistance and high target specificity (narrow host range). Globally there is a continuous search for new <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains with novel insecticidal activities. The present study aims to study the environmental distribution of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and their toxic potential against insect pests. Soil and grain samples were collected from different environments and were processed by a modified acetate selection method. Initially <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates were screened on the basis of colony morphology and phase contrast microscopy for the presence of parasporal crystal inclusions. The population dynamics showed that <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> is abundant in sericulture environment compared to other niches. Relative abundance of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains in sericulture environment shows the persistent association of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> with Bombyx mori (silk worm) as insect pathogen. The protein profiles of the selected strains were studied by SDS-PAGE. The protein profiles of majority of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates from grain storage facilities predominantly showing the 130 kDa and 68 kDa proteins, which is characteristics of lepidopteran active <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis.</b> However, one isolate BTRX- 4 has 80 - 85 kDa protein, which is novel in that, this strain also exhibits antilepidopteran activity, which is normally presented by <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains having 130 kDa and 68 kDa proteins. The protein profile of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates from sericulture environment shows two different protein profiles. <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates BTRX- 16 to BTRX- 22 predominantly show 130 kDa protein, however, the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates BTRX- 23 to BTRX- 30 have two distinct protein profiles corresponding to 130 kDa and 68 kDa. These results show that there may be more than one <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strain that can infect Bombyx mori. The preliminary bioassay against second instar larvae of Heliothis armigera showed varying mortality rate. In conclusion, despite the ubiquitous presence of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains in different environments, specifically the sericulture environment supports <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> in a significant manner compared to other environments.

Most isolates produced typical bipyramidal crystals, but the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. thuringiensis isolate produced spherical crystals and the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. thompsoni isolate produced a pyramidal crystal. Analysis of the parasporal crystals by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the crystals from the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and aizawai isolates contained a protein of 138 kDa whereas those from <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. morrisoni contained a protein of 145 kDa.

For <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki, resistance ratios were 1, 200 for a spore-crystal mixture and 56, 000 for crystals without spores. Treatment of a spore-crystal formulation of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki with the antibiotic streptomycin to inhibit spore germination reduced toxicity to resistant larvae but not to susceptible larvae. In contrast, analogous experiments with <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai revealed no significant effects of adding spores to crystals or of treating a spore-crystal formulation with streptomycin. Synergism occurred between Cry 2 A and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki spores against susceptible larvae and between Cry 1 C and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai spores against resistant and susceptible larvae. The results show that <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxins combined with spores can be toxic even though the toxins and spores {{have little or no}} independent toxicity.

Using rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting, we established the genetic relationships between Brazilian sympatric populations of B. cereus and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> simultaneously collected from two geographically separate sites. We observed the formation of both <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and <b>B.</b> cereus clusters, as well as strains of B. cereus that are more closely related to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> than to other B. cereus strains. In addition, lower genetic variability was observed among <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> clusters compared to B. cereus clusters, indicating that either the two species should be categorized as separate or that <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> may represent a clone from a B. cereus background...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{generally}} accepted {{that the majority}} of Bacillus thuringiensis populations in natural environments of Japan produce parasporal inclusions with no insecticidal activities. Interestingly, recent investigators have provided evidence that parasporal inclusion proteins of certain noninsecticidal <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates occasionally exhibit in vitro cytocidal activities preferential for human cancer cells (6). Proteins with this unique function are now categorized into a group designated parasporin (7). Currently, parasporins are classified into four families (3). Interestingly these four parasporins have all been isolated from <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates obtained from natural environments in Japan. Previous investigators have reported that natural environments of tropics and subtropics of Southeast Asia are a good reservoir of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> populations with a great diversity of serological and biological characteristics (1). This study examines Vietnamese soils for the presence of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis,</b> and reports on the occurrence of parasporin-producing organisms in this region.

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis {{has been}} {{extensively}} used for the biological control of insect pests. Nematicidal <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains have also been identified; however, virulence factors of such strains are poorly investigated. Here, we describe virulence factors of the nematicidal <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> 4 A 4 strain, using the model nematodes Pristionchus pacificus and Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> 4 A 4 kills both nematodes via intestinal damage. Whole genome sequencing of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> 4 A 4 identified Cry 21 Ha, Cry 1 Ba, Vip 1 /Vip 2 and Î²-exotoxin as potential nematicidal factors. Only Cry 21 Ha showed toxicity to C. elegans, while neither Cry nor Vip toxins were active against P. pacificus, when expressed in E. coli. Purified crystals also failed to intoxicate P. pacificus, while autoclaved spore-crystal mixture of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> 4 A 4 retained toxicity, suggesting that primary Î²-exotoxin is responsible for P. pacificus killing. In support of this, we found that a Î²-exotoxin-deficient variant of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> 4 A 4, generated by plasmid curing lost virulence to the nematodes. Thus, using two model nematodes we revealed virulence factors of the nematicidal strain <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> 4 A 4 and showed the multifactorial nature of its virulence...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{projections}} {{suggest that}} refuges from exposure can delay insect adaptation to environmentally benign insecticides derived from Bacillus thuringiensis, but experimental tests {{of this approach}} have been limited. We tested the refuge tactic by selecting two sets of two colonies of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) for resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai in the laboratory. In each set, one colony was selected with no refuge {{and the other with}} a 10 per cent refuge from exposure to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai. Bioassays conducted after nine selections were completed show that mortality caused by <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai was significantly greater in the refuge colonies than in the no-refuge colonies. These results demonstrate that the refuges delayed the evolution of resistance. Relative to a susceptible colony, final resistance ratios were 19 and 8 for the two no-refuge colonies compared to 6 and 5 for the refuge colonies. The mean realized heritability of resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai was 0. 046 for colonies without refuges, and - 0. 002 for colonies with refuges. Selection with <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai decreased susceptibility to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin Cry 1 Ab, but not to Cry 1 C or <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki.

40|$|A two-step {{procedure}} {{was used to}} place a cryIC crystal protein gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. aizawai into the chromosomes of two <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki strains containing multiple crystal protein genes. The <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> aizawai cryIC gene, which encodes an insecticidal protein highly specific to Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm), has not been found in any <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki strains. The cryIC gene was cloned into an integration vector which contained a <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> chromosomal fragment encoding a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, allowing the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai cryIC to be targeted to the homologous region of the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki chromosome. First, to minimize the possibility of homologous recombination between cryIC and the resident crystal protein genes, <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki HD 73, which contained only one crystal gene, was chosen as a recipient and transformed by electroporation. Second, a generalized transducing bacteriophage, CP- 51, was used to transfer the integrated cryIC gene from HD 73 to two other <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki stains. The integrated cryIC gene was expressed at a significant level in all three host strains, and the expression of cryIC {{did not appear to}} reduce the expression of the endogenous crystal protein genes. Because of the newly acquired ability to produce the CryIC protein, the recombinant strains showed a higher level of activity against S. exigua than did the parent strains. This two-step procedure should therefore be generally useful for the introduction of an additional crystal protein gene into <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains which have multiple crystal protein genes and which show a low level of transformation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{from over}} 300 Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus anthracis {{isolates}} was analyzed by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and <b>B.</b> cereus isolates were from diverse sources and locations, including soil, clinical isolates and food products causing diarrheal and emetic outbreaks, and type strains from the American Type Culture Collection, and over 200 <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates representing 36 serovars or subspecies {{were from the}} U. S. Department of Agriculture collection. Twenty-four diverse B. anthracis isolates were also included. Phylogenetic analysis of AFLP data revealed extensive diversity within <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and <b>B.</b> cereus compared to the monomorphic nature of B. anthracis. All of the B. anthracis strains were {{more closely related to}} each other than to any other Bacillus isolate, while B. cereus and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains populated the entire tree. Ten distinct branches were defined, with many branches containing both B. cereus and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates. A single branch contained all the B. anthracis isolates plus an unusual <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolate that is pathogenic in mice. In contrast, <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki (ATCC 33679) and other isolates used to prepare insecticides mapped distal to the B. anthracis isolates. The interspersion of B. cereus and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates within the phylogenetic tree suggests that phenotypic traits used to distinguish between these two species do not reflect the genomic content of the different isolates and that horizontal gene transfer {{plays an important role in}} establishing the phenotype of each of these microbes. <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates of a particular subspecies tended to cluster together...|$|R

The tetracycline resistance phenotype {{was not lost}} during serial passage of subsp. israelensis without antibiotic selection. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that Tn 916 had inserted into several different sites on the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. israelensis chromosome. Conjugation-like movement of Tn 916 was demonstrated when tetracycline-resistant <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> transconjugants were mated with isogenic recipients. Transfer of pC 194 only occurred when <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. israelensis was mated with a B. subtilis donor containing pC 194 and Tn 916. <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> transconjugants resistant to chloramphenicol and tetracycline were detected at a frequency of 1. 96 x 10 [superscript] - 6 per recipient cell when filter matings were performed.

40|$|The insecticidal {{activity}} of the delta-endotoxins of 14 Bacillus thuringiensis strains belonging to 12 subspecies was determined against Pieris brassicae, Heliothis virescens, and Spodoptera littoralis. Larvae of P. brassicae were highly susceptible to purified crystals of strains of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. <b>thuringiensis</b> and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. morrisoni, whereas H. virescens responded best to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kenyae and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki. The crystals of the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. entomocidus strain were the most potent against S. littoralis. It was shown that the solubility of the crystals within the gut of the three insect species is a first important step {{in the mode of}} action. Predissolution of the crystals especially enhanced the insecticidal activity against H. virescens. When in vitro-activated toxins were applied, the relative potency range varied greatly from one insect species to another. It can be concluded that at least three factors influence the potency of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> delta-endotoxins: the strain-related origin of the toxin, the degree of solubility of the crystals in the gut juice, and the intrinsic susceptibility of the insect to the toxin...|$|R

40|$|A gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. "israelensis" was cloned {{from the}} large {{plasmids}} of this subspecies and was shown to code for a mosquitocidal polypeptide. The gene could be expressed in either Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, or <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. "israelensis" to produce the larvicidal activity. Similarly, a Lepidoptera-specific toxin gene from <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. "kurstaki" was also cloned and expressed in E. coli and B. subtilis. Both cloned genes were sequenced and subjected to computer analysis. A long open translational reading frame coded for the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. "kurstaki" gene product. However, the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. "israelensis" clone was composed of two adjacent open reading frames oriented {{as if they were}} in a transcriptional operon. The products of the cloned genes retained their specificity for either Lepidoptera or Diptera. The control regions immediately preceding the toxin genes of both <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subspecies showed considerable DNA homology, most likely because both toxins are expressed only during sporulation. In addition, the deduced amino acid sequences from the two contiguous <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to select the most active Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) isolated from agricultural soils of Mali through the molecular characterization and the determination of insecticidal activities of the protein crystals, produced by these native isolates. Crystal proteins were extracted from <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> culture, and characterized using the SDS-PAGE techniques. Their insecticidal activities were tested using third-instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera in bioassay tests. The results showed that, of 62 <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> treated, 52 isolates showed fragments varying between 10 and 140 kDa on 12 % polyacrylamide gel. Cry 1 and Cry 2 protein crystals were recognized to be effective against Lepidoptera?s larvae, which were found in 21 % of the tested isolates. In addition to these two expected crystal protein weights, other molecular weights were observed at different proportions, suggesting {{the presence of other}} cry genes in the local <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates.

40|$|Among the {{phytophagous}} insects which attack crops, {{the fall}} armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) is particularly harmful {{in the initial}} growth phase of rice plants. As a potential means of controlling this pest, and considering that the entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner demonstrates toxicity due to synthesis of the Cry protein, {{the present study was}} undertaken to evaluate this toxic effect of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> thuringiensis 407 (pH 408) and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> kurstaki HD- 73 on S. frugiperda. The following method was used. Both bacterial strains were evaluated in vitro in 1 st instar S. frugiperda caterpillars, by means of histopathological assays. The Cry 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac proteins, codified by the respective strains of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis,</b> were evaluated in vivo by bioassays of 1 st instar S. frugiperda caterpillars {{in order to determine the}} Mean Lethal Concentration (LC 50). The results of the histopathological analysis of the midget of S. frugiperda caterpillars demonstrate that treatment with the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> thuringiensis strain was more efficient, because the degradations of the microvilosities started 9 hours after treatment application (HAT), while in the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> kurstaki the same effect was noticed only after 12 HAT. Toxicity data of the Cry 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac proteins presented for the target-species LC 50 levels of 9. 29 and 1. 79 &# 956;g. cm- 2 respectively. The strains and proteins synthesised by <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> kurstaki are effective in controlling S. frugiperda, and may be used to produce new biopesticides or the genes may be utilised in the genetic transformation of Oryza sativa L.

40|$|Abstract Background Gut {{microbiota}} {{contribute to}} the health of their hosts, and alterations in the composition of this microbiota can lead to disease. Previously, we demonstrated that indigenous gut bacteria were required for the insecticidal toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis to kill the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and its associated insecticidal toxins are commonly used for the control of lepidopteran pests. A variety of factors associated with the insect host, <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strain, and environment affect the wide range of susceptibilities among Lepidoptera, but the interaction of gut bacteria with these factors is not understood. To assess the contribution of gut bacteria to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> susceptibility across a range of Lepidoptera we examined larval mortality of six species in the presence and absence of their indigenous gut bacteria. We then assessed the effect of feeding an enteric bacterium isolated from L. dispar on larval mortality following ingestion of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin. Results Oral administration of antibiotics reduced larval mortality due to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> in five of six species tested. These included Vanessa cardui (L.), Manduca sexta (L.), Pieris rapae (L.) and Heliothis virescens (F.) treated with a formulation composed of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> cells and toxins (DiPel), and Lymantria dispar (L.) treated with a cell-free formulation of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin (MVPII). Antibiotics eliminated populations of gut bacteria below detectable levels in each of the insects, with the exception of H. virescens, which did not have detectable gut bacteria prior to treatment. Oral administration of the Gram-negative Enterobacter sp. NAB 3, an indigenous gut resident of L. dispar, restored larval mortality in all four of the species in which antibiotics both reduced susceptibility to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and eliminated gut bacteria, but not in H. virescens. In contrast, ingestion of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin (MVPII) following antibiotic treatment significantly increased mortality of Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), which was also the only species with detectable gut bacteria that lacked a Gram-negative component. Further, mortality of P. gossypiella larvae reared on diet amended with <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin and Enterobacter sp. NAB 3 was generally faster than with <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin alone. Conclusion This study demonstrates that in some larval species, indigenous gut bacteria contribute to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> susceptibility. Moreover, the contribution of enteric bacteria to host mortality suggests that perturbations caused by toxin feeding induce otherwise benign gut bacteria to exert pathogenic effects. The interaction between <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and the gut microbiota of Lepidoptera may provide a useful model with which to identify the factors involved in such transitions. </p...|$|R
