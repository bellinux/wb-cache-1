30|$|Of the GM maize applications, 57 % {{contained}} studies {{carried out}} by the applicant with the respective GMP under field conditions in Europe (Table 6). European studies were conducted in one or two countries at one or two locations per country. In two cases, field studies were mentioned, but data of the respective studies were not shown (maize NK 603 and NK 603 × MON 810). Additionally, applicants referred to published field studies on the NTO effects of B. thuringiensis crops. However, the respective GMP used in the literature was generally not indicated when the applicant cited published studies for the discussion of the potential adverse effects of the GMP on NTOs. Applicants also referred to studies in which not the respective GMP that was the subject of the requested approval was used. For example, for Bt 11 maize, the applicant presented a summary report of various surveys of NTOs in <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> fields. This report was not specifically compiled for Bt 11 but for the registration of B. thuringiensis corn by US authorities and consequently contained studies with different <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> events. Five of the 16 studies were conducted with Bt 11 maize. From the total of 16 studies, five were conducted in Europe, however none of these with maize Bt 11. Concerning maize NK 603, seven field studies were cited, but six of these dealt with other GM crop species such as HT soybean or HT wheat. The studies cited for stacked event maize applications generally dealt with the single-event GMPs.|$|E
30|$|For the {{assessment}} of effects on and mediated by TOs, data on the efficacy and on the basic biological effects (e.g. mortality, development time, fecundity, etc.) of the GMPs for all listed target pests are essential. In the laboratory studies submitted in order to demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> events (Table 4), applicants generally tested the bacteria-produced GM proteins instead of the GM plant. By using only purified bacterial proteins in optimized diets, any plant/toxin interactions are excluded, the potential bioactivity of smaller fragments of B. thuringiensis proteins, e.g. as found in maize MON 810, are overlooked [27], and the variability in toxin concentrations in planta[28] is not taken into consideration (see also [7]).|$|E
30|$|Species, {{which are}} EU-wide, nationally or {{regionally}} endangered and/or protected {{may be of}} particular concern if GMPs interfere with their life cycles, habitats, competitors or food resources. Directive 2001 / 18 /EC and its guidelines [15] specifically address endangered species. However, protected species have not been seriously considered {{in any of the}} GM maize applications. This fact, however, has implications for the evaluation of the interactions of the GMP with NTOs. The only substitute species mentioned in <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> applications is the Monarch butterfly, a species with virtually no relevance for European ecosystems. Even for maize 59122, which expresses a coleopteran-active protein, no non-pest, endangered or protected coleopteran species was considered.|$|E
40|$|Public {{concern about}} {{possible}} negative health effects due to consumption of GM plants, together with concerns about possible environmental dangers, {{have led the}} European Commission to limit strictly the distribution of GM plants in the EU. The EU regulations No 49 and 50 / 2000 require the food industry to label, as GMO containing, those food products not certified free of transgenic plant material. Foods are considered "clean" and may be left unlabeled, if the GM content does not exceed 1 %. The presence of GM in food and feed products can be evaluated by detecting the transgenic DNA (PCR technique), or by detecting proteins derived from this DNA (immunological methods). At the Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering both qualitative and quantitative PCR-based tests are standardized. Commonly used primers are designed from the CaMV 35 S promoter for the answer yes/no in general GMO screening procedure. Specific modifications, as in herbicide tolerant RoundUp Ready Soybean or insect resistant maize (Bt 176 corn), are identified by primers designed from specific genes e. g. the EPSPS - gene from A. tumefaciens (for soybean) and the CrylA gene from <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> (for <b>maize).</b> The experimentally determined detection limit is 1 pg, which allows detection of O, 01 % GM DNA in test-samples and meets criteria prescribed for the EU laboratories accredited to issue a certificate...|$|R

40|$|A {{population}} (SERD 3) of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.) with field-evolved {{resistance to}} Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD- 1 (Dipel) and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai (Florbac) was collected. Laboratory-based selection of two subpopulations of SERD 3 with <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki (Btk-Sel) or <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai (Bta-Sel) increased {{resistance to the}} selecting agent with little apparent cross-resistance. This result suggested the presence of independent resistance mechanisms. Reversal of resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai was observed in the unselected SERD 3 subpopulation. Binding to midgut brush border membrane vesicles was examined for insecticidal crystal proteins specific to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki (Cry 1 Ac), <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai (Cry 1 Ca), or both (Cry 1 Aa and Cry 1 Ab). In the unselected SERD 3 subpopulation (ca. 50 - and 30 -fold resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai), specific binding of Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ac, and Cry 1 Ca {{was similar to that}} for a susceptible population (ROTH), but binding of Cry 1 Ab was minimal. The Btk-Sel (ca. 600 -and 60 -fold resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai) and Bta-Sel (ca. 80 -and 300 -fold resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai) subpopulations also showed reduced binding to Cry 1 Ab. Binding of Cry 1 Ca was not affected in the Bta-Sel subpopulation. The results suggest that reduced binding of Cry 1 Ab can partly explain resistance to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. kurstaki and <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subsp. aizawai. However, the binding of Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ac, and Cry 1 Ca and the lack of cross-resistance between the Btk-Sel and Bta-Sel subpopulations also suggest that additional resistance mechanisms are present...|$|R
30|$|Efficacy {{data are}} a basic {{element in the}} {{assessment}} of effects on and mediated by TOs and are as well important for the evaluation of the interactions of GMPs with NTOs. For <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> expressing the Cry 1 Ab or Cry 1 F protein, only in 20 % of the applications were the target pest species O. nubilalis and Sesamia sp. evaluated in the field (maize 1507; Tables 3 and 4). For maize 59122, no field data were presented providing evidence that this GM maize is effective in the field against its coleopteran TO as the insects evaluated in the field were not indicated in the application (Table 3). Hence, there is no information whether maize 59122 is actually controlling its TO under representative field conditions in Europe.|$|E
30|$|The {{identification}} of the TO(s) for a particular <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> event by the applicants was {{not consistent with the}} submitted insect resistance management [IRM] plans for B. thuringiensis crops. These were exclusively focused on O. nubilalis or D. v. virgifera, respectively. Other pest species, even if listed as TOs, such as Sesamia spp., were always left unconsidered in IRM plans. Especially lepidopteran pest species that may be affected to a lesser degree by B. thuringiensis toxins (e.g. Spodoptera spp., Agrotis spp.) [21, 22] might develop resistance fairly quickly. A pest species may be classified as a 'non-target pest' for pest control purposes if it is not reliably controlled by a particular B. thuringiensis crop (e.g. Spodoptera spp.), but as a 'target' {{from the perspective of the}} insect resistance manager if it is sublethally affected. Hence, a careful definition and justification of what is a target and a non-target pest is important as it has implications for the evaluation of the interactions of GMPs with NTOs.|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} the toxin {{expressed}} in the GMPs on NTOs were assessed {{at different levels of}} containment (laboratory, greenhouse or field). In 100 % of the applications, the effects of B. thuringiensis proteins on NTOs were evaluated in laboratory studies using a standard set of test species representing a typical toxicological testing regime, e.g. as used for pesticide testing. Most testing was carried out using honeybees, earthworms, green lacewings, parasitic hymenoptera and ladybird beetles (see [14]). Generally, the isolated bacteria-expressed proteins were fed to the test organisms. Additionally, pollen (e.g. ladybird beetles, honeybees, daphnids); protein suspensions (honeybees, adult ladybirds and parasitic hymenoptera); moth eggs coated with bacteria-derived protein solutions (green lacewings); or soils amended with bacteria-produced proteins (earthworms, springtails) were used. The same laboratory toxicity tests were submitted in different applications of different <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> <b>maize</b> expressing the same class of toxins (e.g. Cry 1 Ab) without taking into account possible event-specific differences. The measured parameters related mostly to mortality and, therefore, acute toxicity. The endpoints used were no-observed-effect-concentration [NOEC], LC 50 or unspecified 'signs of toxicity'. Depending on the species assessed, sublethal parameters were measured in 0 % (parasitic hymenoptera, fish), 20 % (bees), 25 % (pest Lepidoptera), 33.3 % (daphnids, green lacewing larvae), 40 % (earthworms, coccinellids), 50 % (carabids, aphids), 80 % (collembola) and 100 % (mammals, birds and flower bugs) of the laboratory studies with NTOs presented in the applications [14].|$|E

40|$|Ten {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{were produced}} against a k- 1 -type crystal protein of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki. Eight of the antibodies {{belong to the}} immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG 1) subclass, with pI values ranging from 5. 5 to 8. 6, one could be assigned to the IgG 2 b subclass, and one could be assigned to the IgM class. Competitive antibody-binding assays and analysis of antibody specificity indicated that the 10 antibodies recognized at least nine distinct antigenic determinants. Eight antibodies bound to both protoxin and toxin, whereas the other two interacted with protoxin only. One antibody completely inhibited the biological activity of the delta-endotoxin, five antibodies reduced it by 15 to 82 %, and four antibodies did not affect it at all. Based on cross-reaction studies, homologies and differences in the crystal protein structures of different <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> subspecies were revealed.

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner based biopesticides {{have been}} {{successfully}} used world over for the control of agricultural pests and vectors of human diseases. Currently {{there are more than}} 200 <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains with differing insecticidal activities are available as biocontrol agents and for developing transgenic plants. However, two major disadvantages are the development of insect resistance and high target specificity (narrow host range). Globally there is a continuous search for new <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains with novel insecticidal activities. The present study aims to study the environmental distribution of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and their toxic potential against insect pests. Soil and grain samples were collected from different environments and were processed by a modified acetate selection method. Initially <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates were screened on the basis of colony morphology and phase contrast microscopy for the presence of parasporal crystal inclusions. The population dynamics showed that <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> is abundant in sericulture environment compared to other niches. Relative abundance of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains in sericulture environment shows the persistent association of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> with Bombyx mori (silk worm) as insect pathogen. The protein profiles of the selected strains were studied by SDS-PAGE. The protein profiles of majority of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates from grain storage facilities predominantly showing the 130 kDa and 68 kDa proteins, which is characteristics of lepidopteran active <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis.</b> However, one isolate BTRX- 4 has 80 - 85 kDa protein, which is novel in that, this strain also exhibits antilepidopteran activity, which is normally presented by <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains having 130 kDa and 68 kDa proteins. The protein profile of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates from sericulture environment shows two different protein profiles. <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates BTRX- 16 to BTRX- 22 predominantly show 130 kDa protein, however, the <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates BTRX- 23 to BTRX- 30 have two distinct protein profiles corresponding to 130 kDa and 68 kDa. These results show that there may be more than one <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strain that can infect Bombyx mori. The preliminary bioassay against second instar larvae of Heliothis armigera showed varying mortality rate. In conclusion, despite the ubiquitous presence of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strains in different environments, specifically the sericulture environment supports <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> in a significant manner compared to other environments.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{generally}} accepted {{that the majority}} of Bacillus thuringiensis populations in natural environments of Japan produce parasporal inclusions with no insecticidal activities. Interestingly, recent investigators have provided evidence that parasporal inclusion proteins of certain noninsecticidal <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> isolates occasionally exhibit in vitro cytocidal activities preferential for human cancer cells (6).

40|$|Abstract Background Gut {{microbiota}} {{contribute to}} the health of their hosts, and alterations in the composition of this microbiota can lead to disease. Previously, we demonstrated that indigenous gut bacteria were required for the insecticidal toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis to kill the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and its associated insecticidal toxins are commonly used for the control of lepidopteran pests. A variety of factors associated with the insect host, <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> strain, and environment affect the wide range of susceptibilities among Lepidoptera, but the interaction of gut bacteria with these factors is not understood. To assess the contribution of gut bacteria to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> susceptibility across a range of Lepidoptera we examined larval mortality of six species in the presence and absence of their indigenous gut bacteria. We then assessed the effect of feeding an enteric bacterium isolated from L. dispar on larval mortality following ingestion of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin. Results Oral administration of antibiotics reduced larval mortality due to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> in five of six species tested. These included Vanessa cardui (L.), Manduca sexta (L.), Pieris rapae (L.) and Heliothis virescens (F.) treated with a formulation composed of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> cells and toxins (DiPel), and Lymantria dispar (L.) treated with a cell-free formulation of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin (MVPII). Antibiotics eliminated populations of gut bacteria below detectable levels in each of the insects, with the exception of H. virescens, which did not have detectable gut bacteria prior to treatment. Oral administration of the Gram-negative Enterobacter sp. NAB 3, an indigenous gut resident of L. dispar, restored larval mortality in all four of the species in which antibiotics both reduced susceptibility to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and eliminated gut bacteria, but not in H. virescens. In contrast, ingestion of <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin (MVPII) following antibiotic treatment significantly increased mortality of Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), which was also the only species with detectable gut bacteria that lacked a Gram-negative component. Further, mortality of P. gossypiella larvae reared on diet amended with <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin and Enterobacter sp. NAB 3 was generally faster than with <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> toxin alone. Conclusion This study demonstrates that in some larval species, indigenous gut bacteria contribute to <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> susceptibility. Moreover, the contribution of enteric bacteria to host mortality suggests that perturbations caused by toxin feeding induce otherwise benign gut bacteria to exert pathogenic effects. The interaction between <b>B.</b> <b>thuringiensis</b> and the gut microbiota of Lepidoptera may provide a useful model with which to identify the factors involved in such transitions. </p...|$|R
