The current study examined delays in sentence comprehension in school-age <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> FXS (ages 5 – 12 years), school-age <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ASD (ages 6 – 12 years), and younger <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> typical development (ages 3 – 7 years) {{in terms of}} (1) the extent of delay experienced by <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> FXS relative to cognitive- or vocabulary-level expectations and (2) the relationship between sentence comprehension and phonological memory abilities among <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> FXS or typical development. Further, this study considered the contribution of autism symptom severity to sentence comprehension among <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> FXS or ASD, as well as syntactic complexity by examining the relationship between phonological memory and sentence comprehension for both simple and complex sentence structures. Sentence comprehension was measured using a norm- referenced assessment of receptive syntax. Phonological memory skills were assessed using word recall and digit recall tasks. Findings showed that school-age <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> FXS had lower sentences comprehension abilities than younger typical developing boys who were matched on nonverbal cognitive ability or receptive vocabulary. This study adds to {{what is known about}} cognitive factors that contribute to language abilities in <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> FXS and points to a relationship between phonological memory and sentence comprehension abilities in individuals with and without neurodevelopmental disorders...|$|R

40|$|Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a {{hereditary}} {{x-linked disease}} which causes progressive muscle weakness, and approximately 1 in every 3500 boys is affected. The current study compared information processing skills, verbal working memory and behavioral functioning of 78 Dutch <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (mean age 10. 0 years) with the population mean. Reading performance {{was measured in}} 44 <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and the association between verbal working memory and reading performance was investigated by correlations and by investigating possible differences in reading abilities between <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> an average or normal verbal working memory and <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> a low verbal working memory.

40|$|Language deficits {{are among}} the core {{impairments}} of autism. We previously reported asymmetry reversal of frontal language cortex in <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> autism. Specific language impairment (SLI) and autism share similar language deficits and may share genetic links. This study evaluated asymmetry of frontal language cortex in a new, independent sample of right-handed boys, including a new sample of <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> autism {{and a group of}} <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> SLI. The <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> autism were divided into those with language impairment (ALI) and those with normal language ability (ALN). Subjects (right-handed, aged 6. 2 - 13. 4 years) included 22 <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> autism (16 ALI and 6 ALN), 9 <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> a history of or present SLI, and 11 normal controls. MRI brain scans were segmented into grey and white matter; then the cerebral cortex was parcellated into 48 gyral-based divisions per hemisphere. Group differences in volumetric asymmetry were predicted a priori in language-related regions in inferior lateral frontal (Broca 2 ̆ 7 s area) and posterior superior temporal cortex. Language impaired <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> autism and SLI both had significant reversal of asymmetry in frontal language-related cortex; larger on the right side in both groups of language impaired boys and larger on the left in both unimpaired language groups, strengthening a phenotypic link between ALI and SLI. Thus, we replicated the observation of reversed asymmetry in frontal language cortex reported previously in an independent autism sample, and observed similar reversal in <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> SLI, further strengthening a phenotypic link between SLI and a subgroup of autism. Linguistically unimpaired <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> autism had similar asymmetry compared with the control group, suggesting that Broca 2 ̆ 7 s area asymmetry reversal is related more to language impairment than specifically to autism diagnosis...|$|R

In terms of social development, there is {{an increased risk of}} autism symptomatology. However, it remains unclear how social deficits are related to abnormal brain development and to what degree underlying mechanisms of social dysfunction in 47, XXY are similar to, or different from, those in idiopathic autism (ASD). This study was aimed at investigating the neural architecture of brain structures related to social information processing in <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> 47, XXY, also in comparison <b>with</b> <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> idiopathic ASD. MRI scans of 16 <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> 47, XXY, 16 with ASD, and 16 nonclinical, male controls were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A region of interest mask containing the superior temporal cortex, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insular cortex, and medial frontal cortex was used. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) was used to assess degree of autism spectrum symptoms. The 47, XXY group could not be distinguished from the ASD group on mean SRS scores, and their scores were significantly higher than in controls. VBM showed that <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> 47, XXY have significant gray matter volume reductions in the left and right insula, and the left OFC, compared <b>with</b> controls and <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ASD. Additionally, <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> 47, XXY had significantly less gray matter in the right superior temporal gyrus than controls. These results imply social challenges associated with 47, XXY may be rooted in neural anatomy, and autism symptoms in <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> 47, XXY and <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ASD might have, at least partially, different underlying etiologies...|$|R

40|$|Children with Language Impairment (LI) have {{difficulties}} navigating peer situations, withdraw from social interaction and {{are at risk}} for developing further behavioral and socio-emotional problems. Children with LI often forego interactions, in which language and social skills are naturally trained, including conflict management. Conflict resolution is an especially challenging task with heightened emotional intensity, in which behavioral regulation is required to facilitate perspective taking abilities. Reconciliation, i. e. friendly contact between former opponents shortly following conflict termination, is positively associated with subsequent initiation or resumption of developmental peer interaction after a conflict has run its course. The aim of this thesis was to describe conflict behavior between <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI and determine possible deviations from conflict progression of <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> typical language development (TL). Unstructured free-play between 11 preschool <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI and between 20 preschool <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL was examined. Incidents entailing mutual opposition were identified as conflicts, and coded according to a validated system. The interrelations were examined between social interaction (mutual responsive exchanges) prior to conflict in the pre-conflict period, conflict causes, functions and effects of non-affiliative behavior and reconciliatory behavior in the post-conflict period, and social interaction in the succeeding non-conflict period. In Paper I it was established that the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL demonstrate a sequential non-random pattern of conflict progression, with behaviors associated with previous behavioral exchanges within the conflict and directly preceding conflict outbreak. The conflict cause was linked to whether opponents socially interacted in the pre-conflict period, and subsequently related to the category of exhibited reconciliatory strategy in the post-conflict period. Further, the aggressor and the victim initiated reconciliation at similar rates, with the exception of verbal apologies, which were initiated most often by the aggressor. Also verbal apologies were the reconciliatory behavior that was least accepted by opponents. Finally, a higher rate of social interaction between former opponents in the succeeding non-conflict period was positively associated with both social interaction between opponents in the pre-conflict period and reconciliation. The <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI reconciled a smaller mean proportion of conflicts (47. 3 ± 4. 5 %) than the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL (63. 6 ± 2. 0 %). This main result was shown in Papers II-IV to stem from two behavioral characteristics within the communicative style of the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI. First, the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI exhibited overt withdrawal and non-assertiveness. The distribution of reconciliatory categories and the rates, at which opponents accept a reconciliatory behavior, were similar between the LI group and the TL group. However, the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI displayed reconciliatory behavior in a smaller share of conflicts than the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL. The <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI demonstrated a strong reliance on a reference point in the pre-conflict period in order to attempt reconciliation and functionally reconcile conflicts in similar proportions as the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL. Rather, the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI conducted active withdrawal (left the room) relatively more often than the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL, particularly in conflicts without social interaction in the pre-conflict period. Secondly, the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI often escalated aggressive and emotionally charged behavior and exhibited difficulties concluding these behavioral turns. This lead to the seldom reconciled aberrant caused conflicts, which represented a larger share of LI conflicts than TL conflicts. Aberrant caused conflicts entailed inappropriate behavioral play/protest intensities that without communicative intent escalated to screaming/physical tantrums and thereby hindered the opponent from responding with a behavioral turn. Also, following post-conflict aggression, the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI were unable to overcome, in particular reciprocal and only verbal aggression, and thereafter reconciled a smaller share of these conflicts than the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> TL. Further, the LI group s most representative non-affiliative behavior, active withdrawal, was less conducive to reconciliation than aggression, the most representative non-affiliative behavior in the TL group. In the succeeding non-conflict period, the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> LI socially interacted at lower rates than TL boys, deriving mainly from the negative consequences of the LI lower reconciliation rates when social interaction was absent in the pre-conflict period and the larger share of rarely reconciled aberrant caused conflicts. The results indicate that in addition to traditional psycholinguistic remediation, children with LI may benefit from intervention methods that support initiating and maintaining communicational contact in the cases an immediate communicative referent is unavailable, as well as effectively concluding emotionally intensive and aggressive behavioral turns and providing positive experiences of peer interaction...|$|R
40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether young <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> fragile X syndrome (FXS) exhibit abnormal physiological or behavioral responses to a moderately intense auditory stimulus, as heightened sensory reactivity is believed to contribute to problem behaviors in this population.

To determine the emotion regulation, the 'Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire' (CERQ) is used. The coping strategies are analyzed by using the 'Behavioral Anger Response Questionnaire' (BARQ). Results show that <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> DBD do not differ in frustration tolerance compare to the control group. The effect of negative feedback results in more frustration for both groups. There {{is a difference between}} the DBD and control group in using the strategies 'avoidance' and 'diffusion'. <b>Boys</b> <b>with</b> DBD use less often these strategies compared with the control group. In addition, they do not avoid the stress situation but seek more often confrontation. Also, they focus on their anger. The DBD group is split into <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> a low frustration tolerance and <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> a high frustration tolerance because {{there was no difference between}} the DBD group and the control group. Of all strategies, DBD <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> a low frustration tolerance only use less often an avoidance coping strategy compared with the control group. Based on this study, it can be concluded that <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> DBD use other coping strategies compared with the control group. Specially <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> a low frustration tolerance, avoid stress situations less often and seek confrontation...|$|R
40|$|The {{articles}} {{presented in}} this thesis examined issues of identification and perception of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) {{in a sample of}} 38 <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ADHD and 43 comparison boys without ADHD. The boys were recruited from local schools in the Montreal area as well as through the community. In Article 1, the positive illusory bias was explored in the area of attention using two different tasks in order to improve our understanding of the self-perceptions of <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ADHD. Some evidence for positive illusions was found in that <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ADHD estimated performance at the same level as the comparison group despite performing significantly worse. Additionally, on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test-II (C-CPT-II), significantly more <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ADHD overestimated their performance than comparison boys. However, because the majority of the boys underestimated their performance, it is suggested that in unfamiliar situations <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ADHD do not exhibit positive illusions to the same extent as in familiar situations. In Article 2, the perceptions of ADHD reported by others were examined in relation to an objective measure of attention. Through this, the validity of the C-CPT-II was also examined. Parent and teacher ratings of <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ADHD were compared to boys' performance on the C-CPT-II. Parents completed the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised (CPRS-R) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and teachers completed the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised (CTRS-R). While both parent and teacher ratings on the CPRS-R and the CTRS-R respectively showed significant correlations with performance, teachers' ratings had the highest correlations with the errors of the C-CPT-II. Only the externalizing total T score rating on the CBCL was correlated with performance on the C-CPT-II. Additionally, <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ADHD performed significantly more poorly than comparison boys on the C-CPT-II. However, {{there was no significant difference}} between the performance of <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> ADHD and <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> learning disabilities or between <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> learning disabilities and comparison boys. Using discriminate function analysis, the C-CPT-II was able to correctly classify 72 % of the participants into either an ADHD or comparison group. The final discussion centres on this research programme's contribution to the field...|$|R
