50|$|In antiquity, jewelry often contains, in {{the form}} of chains and applied decoration, large amounts of wire that is {{accurately}} made and which must have been produced by some efficient, if not technically advanced, means. In some cases, strips cut from metal sheet were made into wire by pulling them through perforations in stone beads. This causes the strips to fold round on themselves to form thin tubes. This strip drawing technique was in use in Egypt by the 2nd Dynasty. From the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE most of the gold wires in jewellery are characterised by seam lines that follow a spiral path along the wire. Such twisted strips can be converted into solid round wires by rolling them <b>between</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces</b> or the strip wire drawing method. The strip twist wire manufacturing method was superseded by drawing in the ancient Old World sometime between about the 8th and 10th centuries AD. There is some evidence for the use of drawing further East prior to this period.|$|E

The main focus {{is the effect}} of nonzero tilt between the optical axis and the surface normal on the strength of van der Waals attraction. General expressions for the van der Waals free energy are derived using the surface mode method and the transfer-matrix formalism. To facilitate numerical calculations a temperature-dependent three-band parameterization of the dielectric tensor of the liquid crystal 5 CB is developed. A solid slab immersed in a liquid crystal experiences a van der Waals torque that aligns the surface normal relative to the optical axis of the medium. The preferred orientation is different for different materials. Two solid slabs in close proximity experience a van der Waals attraction that is strongest for homeotropic alignment of the intervening liquid crystal for all the materials studied. The results have implications for the stability of colloids in liquid crystal hosts. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figure...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Eggshells were {{subjected}} to puncture tests and the microstructure of the resulting fractures examined by scanning electron microscopy. The shell material fractured in a manner typical of brittle materials where a cone of material is forced inwards. According to established theory the fractures are due to tensile stress. This explains why the forces required to puncture the egg and to fracture the egg by quasistatic compression <b>between</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces</b> are related; both tests respond to {{the resistance of the}} shell material to tensile fracture. Tests using a punch and die to impose shear fractures showed that the shear strength of the shell is greater than the tensile value. Furthermore, the shear strength of the shell material is directionally dependent with the shell showing greater resistance when punched from the outside. The findings show that comparative studies using the eggshell puncture test must be carefully interpreted, since unknown and confounded factors affect the puncture force.

40|$|The {{response}} of gold nanoparticle dimers is studied theoretically near {{and beyond the}} limit where the particles are touching. As the particles approach each other, a dominant dipole feature is observed that is pushed into the infrared due to interparticle coupling and {{that is associated with}} a large pileup of induced charge in the interparticle gap. The redshift becomes singular as the particle separation decreases. The response weakens for very small separation when the coupling across the interparticle gap becomes so strong that dipolar oscillations across the pair are inhibited. Lower-wavelength, higher-order modes show a similar separation dependence in nearly touching dimers. After touching, singular behavior is observed through {{the emergence of a new}} infrared absorption peak, also accompanied by huge charge pileup at the interparticle junction, if initial interparticle-contact is made at a single point. This new mode is distinctly different from the lowest mode of the separated dimer. When the junction is made by contact <b>between</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> charge at the junction is neutralized and mode evolution is continuous through contact. The calculated singular response explains recent experiments on metallic nanoparticle dimers and is relevant in the design of nanoparticle-based sensors and plasmon circuits. © 2006 Optical Society of America.

40|$|Corn yield, {{topography}} {{and soil}} characteristics were sampled on a 26 ha {{area of a}} centre pivot irrigated cropland. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine relationships between corn yield, field topography and soil characteristics. The study was carried out in the Alentejo region of Portugal. Corn yield was measured with a combine harvester fitted with a grain-flow sensor and positioned by means of the Global Positioning System (GPS). A grid-based digital elevation model (DEM) with 1 -m resolution was constructed and several topographic attributes were calculated from the DEM: the local slope gradient (S), profile curvature (Curv), specific catchments area (SCa), and a steady-state wetness index (W). Yield and topographical attributes were computed for areas of radius 5, 10, 25 and 50 m, being considered its maximum, minimum, range and average values. The soil was systematically sampled with a mechanical probe for a total of 109 soil profiles used for analysis of the following soil superficial (< 0. 30 m) characteristics: extractable phosphorous (P 2 O 5) and extractable potassium (K 2 O), soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and exchangeable bases. With centre pivot irrigation systems, the Wave 50 index was shown to be useful for the identification of field areas in which low corn yields may be due to lack of water. At the same time, SCa was found to be useful for the identification of field areas in which low yields are due to excess water and drainage problems. Higher positive correlation between pH, Ca and Curv were observed; calcium concentration was found on the transition areas <b>between</b> <b>flat</b> <b>surfaces</b> to concave ones, while lower values were detected in convex and concave areas.
