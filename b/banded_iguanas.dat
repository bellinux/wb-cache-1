5000|$|Since 1982 the Fijian {{government}} has {{maintained that the}} entire zoo population of Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguanas</b> was obtained illegally or descended from smuggled animals: [...] "Virtually all of the estimated 50 - 100 <b>banded</b> <b>iguanas</b> in American zoos have been obtained without the knowledge or consent of the Government of Fiji". [...] The husbandry of Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguanas</b> at the San Diego Zoo has been documented as the most successful breeding colony of Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguanas</b> in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguanas</b> are herbivorous,they {{feed on the}} leaves, fruit, {{and flowers}} of trees and shrubs, {{particularly}} hibiscus flowers of the Vau tree (Hibiscus tiliaceus) and fruit such as banana and papaya. [...] Captive hatchlings have been observed eating insects; however, adults usually will not.|$|E
5000|$|Green iguanas are not {{suitable}} lizards for beginners. A pet iguana habituates to humans {{to such a}} degree that humans no longer cause a [...] "fight or flight" [...] reaction. Iguanas achieve this after they have acclimated to their new habitat, as well as brief but constant interaction with their owner. Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguanas</b> are a better iguanid option for less-experienced pet owners because they are smaller and less aggressive; however, they still need specialist care.|$|E
25|$|The Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana</b> (Brachylophus fasciatus) is an {{arboreal}} {{species of}} lizard endemic {{to some of}} the southeastern Fijian islands. It is found in Tonga, where it was probably introduced by humans.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} closely related to the Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana</b> and the Fiji crested iguana. This species was {{described}} after a mitochondrial DNA analysis of 61 iguanas from 13 islands showed that B. bulabula was genetically and physically different from the two other species.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, 140 {{species were}} catalogued {{in a joint}} project between Kula Eco Park, the National Trust of Fiji, the Zoological Parks Board of New South Wales, and the Zoo Friends of Taronga Zoo. As a result, the park {{established}} a captive breeding program for the critically endangered Fiji crested <b>iguana</b> and Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana.</b> Seven juveniles were successfully raised.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 Tom {{was charged}} with {{illegally}} importing reptiles. The charge {{had little effect on}} business as that same year he imported sixteen Gaboon vipers and fourteen Burmese pythons via the Montgomery Zoo. Later, in 1995, Tom was convicted a second time, of illegally smuggling Fiji <b>Banded</b> <b>Iguanas</b> into the United States. The case was tried in district court after complaints that the prosecutor's dissection of Penny Crutchfield's, Tom's wife, sexual behavior was irrelevant in a case about illegally importing iguanas.|$|E
5000|$|Sexually dimorphic, {{males have}} two or three white or pale-blue bands 2 cm wide {{crossing}} their emerald green background with a pattern of spots and stripes on the nuchal region. [...] Females, on the other hand, are solid green with occasional spotting or partial bands. [...] Both sexes have a yellow underside. [...] Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguanas</b> reach 60 cm in length when measured from snout to tail tip and bodyweights of up to 200 g. The crests of these iguanas are very short reaching a length of 0.5 cm.|$|E
5000|$|The Fiji banded iguana is {{endemic to}} the Fiji Islands and is {{found on the}} islands of Wakaya, Moturiki, Beqa, Vatulele, Ono, Dravuni, Taveuni, Nggamea, Vanua, Balavu, Avea (Fiji), Vatu Vara, Lakeba, Aiwa, Oneata, Vanua Levu, Totoya, Kabara, and Fulaga. [...] It was {{introduced}} to the Tonga Islands, New Hebrides, and Wallis and Futuna 300 years ago. [...] It has been introduced to Vanuatu as a feral animal in the 1960s. The current wild population is less than 10,000 individuals in 29 distinct subpopulations. [...] Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguanas</b> inhabit most of the undisturbed habitats on these islands, from high cloud forests to low-lying coastal swamps.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} closely related to the Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana</b> and B. bulabula. Brachylophus is thought to be descended from ancestral iguanas that rafted 9000 km west across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, where their closest {{relatives}} are found. Alternatively, it has been suggested they are the descendants of a more widespread lineage of (now extinct) Old World iguanids that diverged from their New World relatives in the Paleogene.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of Brachylophus vitiensis began when Dr. John Gibbons of the University of the South Pacific {{was invited to}} the screening of the movie The Blue Lagoon. [...] The director filmed part of the movie on a remote island and included shots of the native wildlife to enhance {{the feel of the}} movie, including a large colorful iguanid. [...] Gibbons, who had been studying the Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana</b> at the time, travelled to the island and identified it as a distinct species.|$|R
50|$|In February and March 2007, the <b>band</b> re-entered <b>Iguana</b> Studios {{to record}} its début album, Weltenkraft, which was {{released}} in July through World Chaos Productions.|$|R
5000|$|Courtship {{is similar}} to other iguanids, with males {{approaching}} and tongue flicking the female's back, forelimbs and nuchal regions {{after a series of}} rapid head bobs. The breeding season occurs during the month of November. The Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana</b> is oviparous and has a long incubation period of 160 - 170 days. [...] Females guard the nest of three to six eggs, which is unusual for iguanids. [...] Hatchlings emerge from their eggs in the rainy season and obtain moisture by licking wet leaves.|$|R
5000|$|The Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana</b> (Brachylophus fasciatus) is an {{arboreal}} {{species of}} lizard endemic {{to some of}} the southeastern Fijian islands. It is found in Tonga, where it was probably introduced by humans. It {{is one of the few}} species of iguanas found outside of the New World and one of the most geographically isolated members of the family Iguanidae. [...] Populations of these iguanas have been declining over the past century due to habitat destruction, and more significantly, the introduction of mongoose and house cats to the islands.|$|R
5000|$|... "Again & Again" [...] is a cover {{version of}} an Iggy Pop song, {{published}} under his real name (Jim Osterberg), and originally recorded with his first <b>band</b> The <b>Iguanas</b> in 1965.|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} iguana inhabit {{the islands of}} the Fiji goup: one, the crested iguana, was {{discovered}} as recently as 1979 and the other, the <b>banded</b> <b>iguana,</b> once common enough {{to be an important}} source of food for humans, is now listed in the IUCN Red Data Book. The author, in his three-year study, discovered that both species still exist in relatively dense populations on a few, small uninhabited islands, although they have disappeared from those that are developed. He dis-cusses the threats to their survival and the conservation efforts being made. The iguanine genus Brachylophus of Fiji an...|$|R
5000|$|The Fiji crested iguana {{is a large}} stocky lizard {{distinguished}} from the Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana</b> {{by the presence of}} three narrow, cream to white colored bands on males, rather than the broader bluish bands of the latter species. [...] These whitish bands often have chevrons of black scales close to them. Brachylophus vitiensis is distinguished by its larger size growing to 75 cm in length and weighing as much as 300 g. [...] It is further distinguished by the presence of a taller spiny [...] "crest" [...] on its back with spines as long as 1.5 cm running from the nape of the neck to the base of its tail.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} missing a drummer, the <b>band</b> booked <b>Iguana</b> Studios in Buchheim, Baden-Württemberg, and, {{at the end}} of December 2005, three songs were {{recorded}} {{with the help of a}} drum machine. The songs were released as the Wiege der Finsternis EP in March 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Nearly {{all plants}} and animals {{indigenous}} to Fiji are found on Taveuni, which has suffered less devastation from land clearance than other areas of Fiji. The absence of the mongoose, a major predator, has also {{played a part in}} the survival on Taveuni of land crabs, the unique Fiji fruit bat, the Taveuni silk bat, and some unique species of palm. The island is the second largest in the Pacific Ocean to be free from the mongoose. [...] Other species found on the island include the Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana</b> and both Platymantis vitiensis and P. vitianus frog species. The critically endangered Fijian monkey-faced bat is found only on Taveuni. It was discovered by scientists in 1977. [...] The flowering plant Balaka seemannii, which is endemic to Fiji, is found on the island.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its {{tropical}} forests, Vanuatu has {{a limited}} number of plant and animal species. It has an indigenous flying fox, Pteropus anetianus. Flying foxes are important rainforest and timber regenerators. They pollinate and seed disperse a wide variety of native trees. Their diet is nectar, pollen and fruit and they are commonly called [...] "fruit bats". They are in decline across their South Pacific range. However, governments are increasingly aware of the economic and ecological value of flying foxes and there are calls to increase their protection. There are no indigenous large mammals. The nineteen species of native reptiles include the flowerpot snake, found only on Efate. The Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana</b> (Brachylophus fasciatus) was introduced as a feral animal in the 1960s. There are eleven species of bats (three unique to Vanuatu) and sixty-one species of land and water birds. While the small Polynesian rat is thought to be indigenous, the large species arrived with Europeans, as did domesticated hogs, dogs, and cattle. The ant species of some of the islands of Vanuatu were catalogued by E. O. Wilson.|$|R
5000|$|The Brachylophus vitiensis {{was first}} {{featured}} in a film when Dr. John Gibbons, of the University of the South Pacific, was invited to the screening of the movie Blue Lagoon. The director filmed part of the movie on a remote island, and included shots of the native wildlife to enhance {{the feel of the}} movie, including a large colorful iguanid. Gibbons, who had been studying the Fiji <b>banded</b> <b>iguana</b> at the time, travelled to Modriki and identified it as a distinct species. The species only lives in dry forest habitats, which {{are one of the most}} threatened vegetation types in the Pacific. [...] The species was once known to live on 14 islands in the western part of Fiji; however, recent surveys between 2002 and 2004 have only confirmed the species to be living on three islands: Yadua Tabu, Modriki, and Macuata. Yadua Tabu holds the highest proportion of the species, containing approximately 98% of all individuals, an estimated 6,000 animals. The Yadua Tabu iguanas are the only legally protected population, as Yadua Tabu is a National Trust of Fiji reserve and lacks the feral goats which have destroyed the lizard's habitat on other islands. Monuriki is also a breeding ground for some sea turtles.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Spalding {{moved to}} New Orleans, and {{started working with}} roots rock <b>band</b> The <b>Iguanas.</b> Hurricane Katrina forced him to move once more, this time to Austin, Texas, where he played with Little Elmore Reed's band. In 2007, his career took a new turn when he met Canned Heat drummer Fito de la Parra. After {{performing}} several times together, Fito invited him to join Canned Heat. In 2015, he released a live album with the band, entitled Songs from the Road. Spalding is still performing solo and regularly plays with Poncho Sanchez.|$|R
5000|$|The Prime Movers were a blues band {{based in}} the Ann Arbor, Michigan, formed in 1965. The band {{originally}} consisted of Michael Erlewine (lead singer, harmonica), Dan Erlewine (lead guitar), Robert Sheff (keyboards), Robert Vinopal (bass), and Michael [...] "Spider" [...] Wynn (drums). Vinopal left soon after the band's formation {{and was replaced by}} Jack Dawson. Wynn left a short time later and was replaced by James Osterberg, who would later become famous as Iggy Pop. When he joined the Prime Movers Osterberg took the name [...] "Iggy", from his previous <b>band</b> The <b>Iguanas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He then formed The Jess Roden <b>Band</b> (originally <b>Iguana</b> - {{based in}} Southampton). The initial album {{sessions}} were with Steve Smith (and featured Steve Winwood on Hammond) {{but these were}} eventually discarded in favour of producer Geoff Haslam with whom the groups first two studio album were recorded - Keep Your Hat On and Play It Dirty, Play It Class. Always a major touring draw, the band never achieved significant record sales and disbanded in early 1977 just {{after the release of}} their live album, Blowin which was recorded during capacity shows at Birmingham Town Hall and Leicester University during Autumn 1976. Their final show was, however, also recorded and later issued as Live at the BBC.|$|R
5000|$|Erlewine has {{had several}} careers. As a musician, he {{was active in}} the Michigan folk scene in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1961 he hitchhiked with Bob Dylan, and had {{traveled}} to Greenwich Village, Venice, California, and San Francisco. He and his brother Dan founded a blues band called The Prime Movers, which regularly played Chicago; other members included [...] "Blue" [...] Gene Tyranny (Robert Sheff). When the drummer left, they replaced him with Iggy Pop (James Osterberg), then 18 years old. The Prime Movers gave him the nickname [...] "Iggy" [...] as he had played in the <b>band</b> The <b>Iguanas.</b> According to biographer Jim Ambrose, the two years Osterberg spent in the band made him aware of [...] "art, politics, and experimentation".|$|R
50|$|One of Iggy Pop's first {{band was}} the Iguanas; {{the band was}} formed in 1963 {{when he was still}} in high school, and he was the band's drummer. This {{previously}} unreleased track comes from early demo tapes and is evidently the first song recorded where he was the songwriter. AIP Records has also released a series of compilation albums of unreleased Iggy Pop material named after this <b>band,</b> called the <b>Iguana</b> Chronicles.|$|R
50|$|In 1990/1991, {{with funding}} from Dave Stewart of Eurythmics and Britain’s Channel 4, Mugge {{directed}} (for producers Eileen Gregory and John Stewart) DEEP BLUES, a 91-minute exploration of Mississippi blues made in collaboration with music writer Robert Palmer. In 1992, {{with funding from}} BMG Video and others, he directed PRIDE AND JOY: THE STORY OF ALLIGATOR RECORDS, a portrait of Bruce Iglauer’s contemporary blues label. In 1993/1994, with funding again from BMG Video and others, he directed three films simultaneously: the 101-minute GATHER AT THE RIVER: A BLUEGRASS CELEBRATION; the 71-minute THE KINGDOM OF ZYDECO; and the 86-minute TRUE BELIEVERS: THE MUSICAL FAMILY OF ROUNDER RECORDS. In 1996, with funding from Margaritaville Records, he directed IGUANAS IN THE HOUSE, a 27-minute film about New Orleans <b>band</b> The <b>Iguanas.</b> In 1998/1999, with funding from WinStar Entertainment {{and the support of}} the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame & Museum, he directed HELLHOUNDS ON MY TRAIL: THE AFTERLIFE OF ROBERT JOHNSON, a look at the lasting influence of blues legend Robert Johnson. In 1999/2000, with funding from the State of Louisiana, he directed the 2-hour RHYTHM ’N’ BAYOUS: A ROAD MAP TO LOUISIANA MUSIC. In 2002, with funding from Starz Entertainment Group, he directed LAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI JUKES starring Morgan Freeman and others.|$|R
