60|$|I {{was tired}} and sleepy; but Coombs evidently {{intended}} to get {{the value of his}} seven-fifty out of me--he had a way of exacting the utmost farthing--and after feeding the horse, liberally, I carried fourteen buckets of water to fill a tank from the well before at last supper was ready. We ate it together silently in a long match-boarded room--Coombs, his wife, Marvin the big Manitoban hired man, and a curly-haired brown-eyed stripling with a look of good breeding about him. Mrs. Coombs was thin and angular, with a pink-tipped nose; and in their dwelling--the only place I ever saw it on the prairie--she and her husband always sat with several feet of <b>blank</b> <b>table</b> between themselves and those who worked for them. They were also, I thought, representatives of an unpleasant type--the petty professional or suddenly promoted clerk, who, lacking equally the operative's sturdiness and the polish of those born in a higher station, apes the latter, and, sacrificing everything for appearance, becomes a poor burlesque on humanity. Even here, on the lone, wide prairie, they could not shake off the small pretense of superiority. When supper was finished--and Coombs' suppers were the worst I ever ate in Canada--the working contingent adjourned after washing dishes to the sod stable, where I asked questions about our employer.|$|E

The western distinct population segment (WDPS) of Steller sea lion is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, and the species population in the Aleutian Islands is declining. Atka mackerel and Pacific cod are principal prey species for Steller sea lions in the Aleutian Islands. This proposed action would revise management of the Atka mackerel and Pacific cod fisheries to ensure the effects of these fisheries are not likely to result in jeopardy of extinction or adverse modification or destruction of critical habitat for the WDPS of Steller sea lions.

40|$|Abstract: This Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review/Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis {{analyzes}} {{a proposed}} gear modification to require non-pelagic trawl vessels targeting flatfish in the Bering Sea subarea to use elevating devices on trawl sweeps {{to raise them}} off the seafloor. The action follows from BSAI Amendment 89, Bering Sea Habitat Conservation Measures. The analysis also evaluates changes to the southern boundary of the Northern Bering Sea Research Area to create an area where anyone fishing with non-pelagic trawl gear must use the modified trawl sweeps required by regulation, and changes to the boundary of the St Matthew Island Habitat Conservation Area {{to be consistent with}} the Council’s intent to protect blue king crab habitat. Finally, the document addresses certain housekeeping amendments to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area, which are required to correct typographical and non-substantive errors.

The group designed, modeled, built, and tested a new device that allows quantitative recovery of grams of material that have been subjected to unprecedented pressures.
