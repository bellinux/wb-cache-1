40|$|Purpose: In {{an effort}} to improve {{radiotherapy}} treatments, methods aimed at increasing the quantity of oxygen delivered to tumors were investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of one nitric oxide (NO) donor (isosorbide dinitrate) on pO 2 and blood flow in a murine tumor model. The effect was compared to carbogen, used as a reference treatment. Methods and Materials: Thirty-six liver tumors implanted in mouse thighs were imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 4. 7 Tesla with dynamic Gd-DTPA and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast-enhanced imaging after administration of isosorbide dinitrate or carbogen. The effect on the pO 2 was also tested by EPR oximetry (1. 1 GHz) on 52 mice. Results: A significant increase in MRI intensity was observed for both treatments in comparison with the control group. EPR oximetry showed a dose-dependant increase in tumor pO 2 for isosorbide dinitrate (by 5. 9 mmHg at 0. 2 mg/kg) and a substantially greater change for carbogen breathing (by 23 mmHg). Conclusion: Both tumor blood flow and pO 2 were increased by isosorbide dinitrate and carbogen. Carbogen is more efficient than isosorbide dinitrate in increasing the <b>BOLD</b> <b>image</b> intensity, as well as the tumor pO 2, but as efficient as isosorbide dinitrate in the Gd-DTPA contrast-enhanced imaging. We conclude that the effects of carbogen on improving tumor pO 2 involve both improved blood flow and improved hemoglobin oxygenation, whereas the effects of isosorbide dinitrate are predominantly mediated by improved blood flow alone.

I paint a simple and <b>bold</b> <b>image</b> on canvas. This image, done loosely and intuitively in a direct manner, is based on simple spatial relationships. An object, such as wood or rope, is then added to the canvas setting up an additional play between image and object. In Vema the object, a twig, is placed diagonally over crisscrossing brush strokes, and thus contradicts the illusion of the paint strokes. The shape of the canvas itself is often similarly employed to counter the illusionistic space created by the brush strokes. Two vertical strokes advance to the right in Sunda II while the canvas they are painted on is shaped as to appear to recede to the right, presenting a visual contradiction. The painted canvas with the object added is a construction made solely for me to photograph. The photograph reduces the construction to an image while giving the illusion of dimensionality, of being real. This trompe l'oeil effect acts as an ironic counterpoint to the painted illusion on the canvas. The shallow perspective of the camera overlays that of the painted canvas. The photograph is mounted on a board painted in a similarly direct manner as the original construction. This results in a visual dialogue between the photograph and the painted board.

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} human placental oxygenation during maternal hyperoxia using non-invasive blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI). Methods Eight healthy pregnant women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at gestational weeks 28 - 36 were examined with BOLD MRI, over two consecutive 5 -min periods of different oxygenation: first normoxia (21 % O- 2) and then hyperoxia (12 L O- 2 /min), achieved by controlling the maternal oxygen supply with a non-rebreather facial mask. Selecting three slices showing cross-sections of {{the central part of}} the placenta, we investigated total placental oxygenation by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) covering the entire placenta, and regional placental oxygenation by drawing smaller ROIs in the darker and brighter areas of the placenta. For each ROI, the difference in BOLD signal between the two episodes was determined and the percentage increase in BOLD signal during hyperoxia (BOLD) was calculated. Results In the <b>BOLD</b> <b>image,</b> the normoxic placenta appeared heterogeneous, with darker areas located to the fetal side and brighter areas to the maternal side. During hyperoxia, the placenta became brighter and the structure more homogeneous, and the BOLD signal of the total placenta increased (BOLDtot, 15. 2 +/- 3. 2 % (mean +/- SD), P< 0. 0001). The increase was seen predominantly in the dark areas in the fetal part of the placenta (BOLDfet, 32. 1 +/- 9. 3 %) compared with in the bright areas in the maternal part of the placenta (BOLDmat, 5. 4 +/- 3. 5 %). Conclusion During hyperoxia, placental oxygenation was increased predominantly in the darker placental areas, which, given their anatomical location, represent the fetal circulation of the placenta. To our knowledge, this is the first study to successfully visualize changes in placental oxygenation using BOLD MRI. Copyright (c) 2013 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the leading}} cause of death in the {{developed}} world. Evaluation of coronary function is critically important in the course of CAD management. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is the most popular noninvasive means of probing coronary function. While various imaging modalities have been used to image myocardial perfusion, the current clinical standards usually require the use of ionizing radiation or the exogenous contrast agent. The requirements increase the potential risks and render MPI infeeasible in a large segment of patients with CAD. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) cardiac MRI (CMR) is a newer approach for imaging myocardial perfusion. BOLD CMR utilizes the intrinsic contrast of the deoxygenated blood to probe myocardial oxygenation without ionizing radiation and contrast agent. Developments in the past twenty years have made significant advance in BOLD CMR and recent studies have shown promising results for the clinical application of the approach. However, BOLD CMR still suffer from multiple challenges, such as inadequate accuracy, imaging confounders, limited imaging speed, and sub optimal stress imaging protocols, all which significantly limit its reliability and clinical applicability. In this dissertation, we propose to overcome these limitations from the technical and physiological vantage points to enable a reliable BOLD CMR exam, which can rapidly accelerate the clinical translation and adoption of the approach. The first objective of this dissertation is to develop, test and validate a cardiac MRI technique that is robust, reliable and fast. To overcome the challenging cardiac imaging condition at 3 T and provide reliable and sensitive BOLD signal, this dissertation utilized multiple techniques, such as motion correction, SR preparation, adiabatic pulses and novel reconstruction methods, to realize a confounder-corrected, free-breathing 3 D T 2 mapping technique at 3 T that can be completed within the period of adenosine stress. The technique was tested and validated with simultaneously acquired 13 N-ammonia PET perfusion in a whole-body PET/MR system. Ex-vivo studies demonstrated the proposed approach could be used to overcome the heart-rate dependent changes in T 2 between rest and stress. In canines without coronary stenosis, T 2 under adenosine stress was significantly greater than at rest, which was consistent with the observed increase in PET perfusion measurements. The changes in BOLD signal between rest and stress was highly correlated to myocardial perfusion reserve. In animals with coronary stenosis, perfusion anomalies were consistently detected between the developed technique and PET. These results demonstrate the proposed approach has the capability to enable rapid and reliable measurements of whole heart perfusion. The second objective of the dissertation is to explore innovative vasodilation strategies to improve the reliability and applicability of BOLD CMR exams. Two novel ways of inducing vasodilation (Regadenoson and hypercapnia) for BOLD CMR were studied. Regadenoson is a new pharmacological vasodilator that has a prolonged vasodilation effect compared to the standard stress agent (adenosine). Utilizing the longer vasodilation period, we found that a significantly improved stress image quality and reliability can be achieved by imaging at a delayed time point (10 mins after the regadenoson administration). For validation purpose, BOLD and PET images were acquired simultaneously in healthy animals. The delayed acquisitions showed markedly increased myocardial T 2 from the BOLD images and increased myocardial blood flow from 13 N-ammonia PET perfusion. To further improve the sensitivity and reliability of regadenoson BOLD exam, a repeated <b>BOLD</b> <b>image</b> acquisition strategy was proposed to continuously monitor the dynamics of BOLD signal after regadenoson injection. The BOLD signal changes were used to investigate the coronary dynamics after the peak vasodilation in healthy and diseased subjects. The coronary dynamic parameters (CDPs) were derived and were used to compare to the conventional single time point approach. CDPs showed the capability of extracting greater BOLD response in the healthy subjects and improved performance in disease identification in the animals with impaired coronary arteries. This preliminary study showed the potential of improving BOLD CMR performance with existing stress agents and better-designed strategies to assess coronary vasodilatation. Hypercapnia (elevated arterial CO 2 (PaCO 2)) is a known mediator of carotid vasodilation, but its effects on the coronary arteries had been unclear given the lack of tools to accurately and rapidly alter arterial CO 2. By prospectively and independently controlling PaCO 2, this dissertation first investigated whether a physiologically tolerable hypercapnic stimulus can increase MBF in healthy and diseased animals. The extent of effect on MBF due to hypercapnia was compared to adenosine using quantitative 13 N-ammonia PET measurements. In the healthy animals, MBF under hypercapnia and adenosine were positively correlated; and were not different. Under LAD stenosis, MBF increased under hypercapnia and adenosine but the effect was significantly lower in the affected territories. Mean perfusion defect volumes measured with adenosine and hypercapnia were significantly correlated and were not different. The BOLD MR signal response to the controlled hypercapnia was also investigated under similar setup. In intact canines, changes in myocardial BOLD MR signal were equivalent to changes with adenosine. In addition, BOLD response under repeat hypercapnic stimulations were also tested. Reproducible BOLD responses were observed following repeat stimulation between baseline and equivalent hypercapnic states. In the dogs with coronary artery stenosis, BOLD MR signal changes during hypercapnia and adenosine infusion were also not different. The results demonstrate arterial blood CO 2 tension is an independent variable of MBF, which can induce MBF and BOLD signal to the same level as standard dose of adenosine. In summary, this dissertation culminates in key advancements which have the capacity to reliably advance cardiac BOLD in the clinical arena in the assessment of myocardial perfusion in the setting of ischemic heart disease. The technical and physiological advances direly address the key obstacles present with in the current BOLD techniques and build the foundation for a reliable, robust and practical myocardial BOLD exam...|$|E

Materials and Methods:Cardiac <b>BOLD</b> <b>images</b> were acquired in a canine model (n = 9) with controllable LCX stenosis at rest and during adenosine infusion on a 1. 5 T clinical scanner. Statistical distributions of myocardial pixel-intensities derived from <b>BOLD</b> <b>images</b> were used to compute an area metric (ischemic extent, IE). True myocardial perfusion was estimated from microsphere analysis. IE was compared against a standard metric (segment-intensity-response, SIR). Additional animals (n = 3) were used to investigate the feasibility of the approach for identifying ischemic territories due to LAD stenosis from mBOLD images. Results:Regression analyses showed that IE and myocardial flow ratio between rest and adenosine infusion (MFR) were exponentially related (R 2 > 0. 70, P < 0. 001, for end-systole and end-diastole), while SIR and MFR were linearly related to end-systole (R 2 = 0. 51, P < 0. 04) and unrelated to end-diastole (R 2 â 0, P = 0. 91). Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis that IE was superior to SIR for detecting critical stenosis (MFR â¤ 2) in end-systole and end-diastole.
