5|$|In the Senate, {{the most}} {{prominent}} fight was over {{the need for a}} strong protective tariff, which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing. Payne supported a high tariff, but thought some small reductions would <b>be</b> <b>prudent</b> {{in order to reduce the}} federal government's surplus. He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the debate was to argue against a reduction in the tariff on steel and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to pass in the House, which was controlled by Democrats.|$|E

25|$|Some Green Minibus Unions {{have called}} for the Government to provide a new fleet of buses which can hold up to 20 people, 4 more people than the current 16 people. They say it could help ease traffic {{congestion}} during rush hour and possible push up profits which may turn away possible fare increases. There {{are a few of}} the new buses in service at the moment, but because it is only legal to have 16 passengers in a minibus, the extra area is used as a luggage rack. The Government has responded saying that it would <b>be</b> <b>prudent</b> to first study the implications of such expansion in the context of a Public Transport Strategy Study first, which should take two years ending in 2017 or 2018.|$|E
25|$|Most {{in-flight}} shutdowns are harmless {{and likely}} to go unnoticed by passengers. For example, it may <b>be</b> <b>prudent</b> for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing {{in the event of}} a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine’s inlet and tailpipe. A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine’s inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.|$|E
25|$|Born {{the seventh}} child and third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Arthur was educated by private tutors before {{entering}} the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich {{at the age of}} 16. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the British Army, where he served for some 40 years, seeing service {{in various parts of the}} British Empire. During this time he was also created a royal duke, becoming the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, as well as the Earl of Sussex. In 1911, he was appointed as Governor General of Canada, replacing the Earl Grey as viceroy. He occupied this post until being succeeded by the Duke of Devonshire in 1916. Given his military background, the selection of Arthur proved to <b>be</b> <b>prudent,</b> as he acted as the King's, and thus the Canadian Commander-in-Chief's, representative through the first years of the First World War.|$|E

The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be £150million, which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting {{that there was no}} way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that [...] "the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including the recent history of the TSR.2) suggests that it would <b>be</b> <b>prudent</b> to consider the £150million [...] to turn out much too low." ...|$|E

Historian Robert Scheina commented that they [...] "outclassed the entire [...] Argentinian fleet". Although debates raged in Argentina over whether it would <b>be</b> <b>prudent</b> to counter Brazil's purchase by acquiring their own expensive dreadnoughts, further border disputes—particularly near the River Plate with Brazil—decided the matter, and it ordered two s (no relation to the earlier cruisers) from the Fore River Shipbuilding Company in the United States. With its major rival acquiring dreadnoughts, Chile responded by asking for tenders from American and European countries that would give the country the most powerful battleships afloat.|$|E

500|$|Bupropion {{has been}} used as a {{treatment}} for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) since at least 2004, with reports of positive results in both minors and adults. In a double-blind study of children, while aggression and hyperactivity as rated by the children's teachers were significantly improved in comparison to placebo, parents and clinicians could not distinguish between the effects of bupropion and placebo. The 2007 guideline on the ADHD treatment from American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry notes that the evidence for bupropion is [...] "far weaker" [...] than for the FDA-approved treatments. Its effect may also be [...] "considerably less than of the approved agents... Thus it may <b>be</b> <b>prudent</b> for the clinician to recommend a trial of behavior therapy at this point, before moving to these second-line agents." [...] Similarly, the Texas Department of State Health Services guideline recommends considering bupropion or a tricyclic antidepressant as a fourth-line treatment after trying two different stimulants and atomoxetine.|$|E

The subcritical piles posed little danger, but Groves felt that it would <b>be</b> <b>prudent</b> to locate a critical pile—a fully functional nuclear reactor—at a more remote site. A building at Argonne to house Fermi's experimental pile was commenced, with its completion scheduled for 20 October. Due to industrial disputes, construction fell behind schedule, and it became clear the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed. In early November, Fermi came to Compton with a proposal to build the experimental pile under the stands at Stagg Field.|$|E
500|$|After [...] was commissioned, Brazil {{decided in}} early 1907 to halt three {{obsolescent}} pre-dreadnoughts which were {{under construction in}} favor {{of two or three}} dreadnoughts. These ships, which were designed to carry the heaviest battleship armament in the world at the time, came as an abrupt shock to the navies of South America, and Argentina and Chile quickly canceled the 1902 armament-limiting pact. Argentina in particular was alarmed at the possible power of the ships. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Manuel Augusto Montes de Oca, remarked that even one Minas Geraes-class ship could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. While this may have been hyperbole, either one was much more powerful than any single vessel in the Argentine fleet. Although debates raged in Argentina over whether it would <b>be</b> <b>prudent</b> to counter Brazil's purchase by acquiring their own dreadnoughts, which would cost upwards of two million pounds sterling, further border disputes—particularly near the River Plate with Brazil—decided the matter, and they ordered [...] and Moreno from the Fore River Shipbuilding Company in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Cragh's {{recovery}} {{began the}} day after his hanging, but it was some time– one witness said 15 days– before he was able to stand unaided. That he did not recover more quickly cast doubt on the validity of the miracle, as miracles were supposed to be immediate, but [...] "partial miracles" [...] could be explained by the [...] "lukewarm faith of those who had made the vow". Once sufficiently recovered, Cragh was summoned to appear at Swansea Castle, before Lord and Lady Briouze. The chaplain, William of Codineston, was also present. Cragh explained, [...] "with great fear and apprehension" [...] according to the chaplain, that as he was being taken to the gallows he prayed to Thomas de Cantilupe to save him. His fear resulted from his concern that he might be executed again, and he had good reason to be worried. Although those who survived were usually pardoned, it was not unknown for them to be hanged again. Between the time of his hanging and his appearance at the castle Cragh may have convinced himself that he had been saved by Cantilupe, or he may simply have decided that it would <b>be</b> <b>prudent</b> for him {{to go along with the}} story for his own safety. Cragh went on to claim that as he was hanging from the gallows a bishop dressed all in white appeared, and saved him either by supporting his feet or by replacing his tongue in his mouth.|$|E
