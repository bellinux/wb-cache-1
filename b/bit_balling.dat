30|$|For the hardness-alternating formation, {{there are}} several phenomena: (1) part of the cutters will cut hard rock, these cutters will bear a large impact load, and the impact load can not only cause impact damage of cutters, but also reduce the {{stability}} of PDC bit; (2) DC bit will bear large lateral imbalance force, which lead the reverse circumnutation (whirling motion) of bit. The stress state of cutter change continuously, and the cutting area of each cutter is unstable, which will exacerbate the impact force consequently. Therefore, when design the PDC bit for hardness-alternating formation, {{it is not only}} need to improve the rock-breaking efficiency, but also should reduce the impact load on single cutter, improve the working stability, and prevent <b>bit</b> <b>balling</b> simultaneously.|$|E
40|$|The {{drilling}} process in petroleum industry is directly proportional with economics and if {{even a small}} problems encounters on any point during drilling will might results a commercial loss (i. e. economics and time factor). This study {{is based on the}} study of all those hindrances/problems often encounters during vertical drilling and ways to combat against those problems. Now, these days although the drilling have been an advanced practice but the problems are still of same nature like (bore-hole instability, loss-circulation, drill pipe sticking, gas cuts in a shallow formation, salt dome, kick and back flow). This study focuses above problems which are not natural but it is due to human error or may be the improper handling of the tool during the operation but these are critical with reference to the time factor and also budgeting is there. So, if these occur then the possible remedial actions in order to save the time factor as well as the economics are kept and handled accordingly. This may involve, the proper design of drilling components regarding given geophysical data of formation, proper usage of drilling fluid to avoid <b>bit</b> <b>balling,</b> formation sloughing, maintaining hydrostatic pressure and proper usage of blow out preventor to control abnormal pressures, so that a good drilling performance will be taken into account by setting up a benchmarking process that is termed to be as “a necessity for survival”...|$|E
40|$|Predicting {{the wear}} of drill bits is {{essential}} for all oil companies to maximise drilling efficiency and reduce loss in money and time. Typically, this problem has been dealt with by evaluating the specific energy of the drill bits at drilling formation intervals. Although this technique sometimes provides a good indication of the bit tooth wear, a number of phenomena such as <b>bit</b> <b>balling</b> and high vibration of the drill bit might give misleading results that affect the reliability of these techniques. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop an effective predictive tool for the bit tooth wear rate by both experimental and theoretical approaches. A case study is presented for the evaluation of the specific energy combined with dimensionless drilling parameters method as indicating tools for monitoring the wear of the roller-cone bits. The results were compared with the qualitative tooth wear index of the bits and an agreement was found for limited cases. The case study did not include the mechanical properties of the materials that form the bit, therefore a wear model was needed to combine the drilling parameters with the mechanical properties of the materials forming the bit under the phenomena of three body abrasion where the drill bits are in reality facing this effect. The new formula for quantifying the bit tooth wear is presented and compared with the qualitative bit tooth wear index, where close matching was obtained. Experimental studies were carried out on polycrystalline diamond compact cutters from two manufacturers. The mechanical properties were determined by micro-indentation as well as nano-indentation testing on the diamond and the substrate layers of the cutters. Microstructural properties of the materials forming the PDC cutters found to be effective on the mechanical properties and consequently on the amount of wear. The volume of wear for the PDC cutters was determined experimentally using micro and nano-scratch tests of PDC cutters. The experimental wear was compared with the predicted wear based on current approaches in the literature. The results show that the wear of both layers of PDC cutters in this work can be predicted by the material mechanical properties and the applied load on the indenter. The analytical study based on various scanning electron microscopy techniques revealed that the main dominant wear mechanism for the substrate and the diamond layers is abrasive wear in the format of ploughing and cutting. ...|$|E
40|$|The two phase program {{addresses}} long-term {{developments in}} deep well and hard rock drilling. TerraTek believes that {{significant improvements in}} drilling deep hard rock will be obtained by applying ultra-high rotational speeds (greater than 10, 000 rpm). The work includes a feasibility of concept research effort aimed at development that will ultimately result {{in the ability to}} reliably drill ''faster and deeper'' possibly with smaller, more mobile rigs. The principle focus is on demonstration testing of diamond bits rotating at speeds in excess of 10, 000 rpm to achieve high rate of penetration (ROP) rock cutting with substantially lower inputs of energy and loads. The significance of the ultra-high rotary speed drilling system is the ability to drill into rock at very low weights on bit and possibly lower energy levels. The drilling and coring industry today does not practice this technology. The highest rotary speed systems in oil field and mining drilling and coring today run less than 10, 000 rpm [...] usually well below 5, 000 rpm. This document details the progress to date on the program entitled ''Smaller Footprint Drilling System for Deep and Hard Rock Environments: Feasibility of Ultra-High-Speed Diamond Drilling'' for the period starting 1 October 2004 through 30 September 2005. Additionally, research activity from 1 October 2005 through 28 February 2006 is included in this report: (1) TerraTek reviewed applicable literature and documentation and convened a project kick-off meeting with Industry Advisors in attendance. (2) TerraTek designed and planned Phase I bench scale experiments. Some difficulties continue in obtaining ultra-high speed motors. Improvements have been made to the loading mechanism and the rotational speed monitoring instrumentation. New drill bit designs have been provided to vendors for production. A more consistent product is required to minimize the differences in bit performance. A test matrix for the final core bit testing program has been completed. (3) TerraTek is progressing through Task 3 ''Small-scale cutting performance tests''. (4) Significant testing has been performed on nine different rocks. (5) <b>Bit</b> <b>balling</b> has been observed on some rock and seems to be more pronounces at higher rotational speeds. (6) Preliminary analysis of data has been completed and indicates that decreased specific energy is required as the rotational speed increases (Task 4). This data analysis has been used to direct the efforts of the final testing for Phase I (Task 5). (7) Technology transfer (Task 6) has begun with technical presentations to the industry (see Judzis) ...|$|E
