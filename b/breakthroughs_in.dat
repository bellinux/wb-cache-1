5|$|In {{addition}} to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already-above average intellect, making him a bona fide genius capable of making <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> advanced areas of genetics, robotics, engineering, physics and applied chemistry. The Goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations.|$|E
5|$|Having made {{considerable}} progress {{over the}} previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974. He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening. Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, détente, and MIRVs. While he considered proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty, Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it. There were no significant <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> these negotiations.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the NK 6th Division {{had made}} <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> the US 24th Infantry sector to the south, {{overwhelming}} the regiment and forcing it back. The 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, on the ridges overlooking Haman, was pushed back as its soldiers retreated without orders. Survivors from the 24th Infantry's 1st and 2nd battalions later {{appeared in the}} 35th's lines, and the regimental commanders found that the entire regiment had crumbled under North Korean attack. Kean ordered the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry to move in and help restore the 24th's position.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly {{reproduce}} HeLa cells {{in a laboratory}} setting has led to many important <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> biomedical research. For example, by 1954, Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the polio vaccine. To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory. Additionally, Chester M. Southam, a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to observe if cancer could be transmitted {{as well as to}} examine if one could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in the mid-Atlantic and their withdrawal, meant the Bay of Biscay became {{congested}} with German submarines seeking refuge. Thus, AOC Slessor revisited the interdiction strategy which had been tried, and failed in 1941 and 1943. This time, there were crucial differences. Firstly, the improvement of radar had enhanced detection of submarines, submerged and surfaced, and intelligence <b>breakthroughs,</b> <b>in</b> which the British Ultra organisation had broken the naval Enigma codes and confirmed {{a major change in}} German strategy, enabled the British to focus on the Biscay.|$|E

5|$|Although Italian Renaissance had {{a modest}} impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was {{influential}} in broadening the European worldview, stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through {{the influence of}} wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, Lisbon flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including Pedro Nunes, João de Castro, Abraham Zacuto and Martin Behaim. Cartographers Pedro Reinel, Lopo Homem, Estêvão Gomes and Diogo Ribeiro made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary Tomé Pires and physicians Garcia de Orta and Cristóvão da Costa collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist Carolus Clusius.|$|E
5|$|At the 1932 occasion, Tesla {{claimed he}} had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five years of work, {{he was on the}} verge of {{producing}} proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was “violently opposed” to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the {{distinguished}} Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson promoted {{the ideas that}} Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer-priests. These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by Heinrich Berlin, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, and Yuri Knorozov. With <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> understanding of Maya script since the 1950s, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, and {{the view of the}} Maya as peaceful could no longer be supported. Detailed settlement surveys of Maya cities revealed the evidence of large populations, putting an end to the vacant ceremonial centre model.|$|E

Rustin continues the investigation at a bar that evening and asks two prostitutes—Anette (Charleigh Harmon) and Lucy (Alyshia Ochse)—about any disappearances, but to no avail. By the next morning, there were several <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> the investigation: the body had been successfully identified as 28-year-old Dora Lange; an autopsy revealed she had been strangled, tortured, and possibly raped; and early toxicology reports found traces of lysergic acid and methamphetamine in her bloodstream. Martin, Rustin, and Quesada brief their colleagues with the new evidence.|$|E
5|$|On August 22 the North Korean premier, Kim Il Sung, {{had ordered}} his forces to {{conclude}} {{the war by}} September 1, yet {{the scale of the}} offensive did not allow this. Groups 1 and 2 were to begin their attack at 23:30 on August 31, and Groups 3, 4 and 5 would begin their attacks at 18:00 on September 2. The attacks were to closely connect in order to overwhelm UN troops at each point simultaneously, forcing <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> multiple places that the UN would be unable to reinforce. The North Koreans relied primarily on night attacks to counter UN air superiority and naval firepower, with the North Korean generals believing that such attacks would prevent UN forces from firing effectively and result in heavy casualties from friendly fire.|$|E
5|$|The win {{continued}} Kiprop's meteoric rise of 2010 – a year {{in which}} he had gone from a low-profile circuit runner to the 10,000 metres Kenyan and African champion, with a sub-60 minute half marathon best after wins in Paris and Lille. Silver medallist Zersenay received some consolation as he was given the AIMS/Citizen World's Fastest Time Award days after the competition in respect of his position as world record holder, becoming only the second half marathon athlete to be selected for the accolade after Lornah Kiplagat. There were no surprise <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> the men's race as all the top performers were those predicted to make an impact before the race. However, there were some other achievements of note including: Kitwara's first individual medal for Kenya, personal bests for Birhanu Bekele and Tomoya Onishi in eighth and ninth place respectively, and (much further back in the field) a national record for Bhutanese racer Passang Passang.|$|E

5|$|Though UCSC {{has been}} known for its {{conservation}} efforts and environmentally minded students since it was founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC sustainability movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. This set the scene for huge <b>breakthroughs</b> <b>in</b> 2006, when a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus. Sustainability has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are working toward sustainability in a variety of different ways.|$|E
