40|$|Leek (Allium porrum L.) is an {{important}} outdoor vegetable in West Europe, where it is cultivated on about 30, 000 ha. Most commercial cultivars of leek are open pollinated. One of the major problems with the crop is poor uniformity. Leek is an outbreeding species with up to 20 % self-fertilisation. Much of the variation of open pollinated cultivars is explained by the strong sensitivity to inbreeding depression after selfing. In this study we attempt to analyse in a systematic way the relationship <b>between</b> degree of <b>selfing</b> <b>and</b> agricultural performance in leek. The results obtained confirm a negative correlation <b>between</b> <b>selfing</b> <b>and</b> some agricultural aspects important for vigour such as seedling emergence, plant growth and plant fresh yield. Also negative correlations <b>between</b> degree of <b>selfing</b> <b>and</b> seed individual weight <b>and</b> <b>between</b> <b>selfing</b> <b>and</b> seed individual size were found. The negative relationship between inbreeding and plant weight at harvest is further confirmed in an experiment in which the origin (cross-pollination or self-pollination) of each individual offspring plant analysed was determined using AFLP-markers. Finally, the correlation between chlorophyll deficiency genes {{and the loss of}} vigour that follows selfing was investigated.

25|$|Another {{autonomous}} {{philosophy of}} biology {{is represented by}} Guenther Witzany and his theory of biocommunication: Living nature is structured and organized by language and communication within and among cells, tissues, organs and organisms. This means that besides human language and communication every living entity is competent to use signs with which it can differentiate <b>between</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> non-self. The communicative competence serves for coordination of group behavior (tissues, organs, organisms). Biocommunication research is applied to all organismic kingdoms based on empirical data. Additionally the biocommunication method investigates nucleotide sequences as natural code which is structured according combinatorial, context-sensitive and content-specific rules. Natural genome editing from a biocommunicative perspective consequently is investigated as competent agent-driven generation and integration of meaningful nucleotide sequences into pre-existing genomic content arrangements of host organisms. Such natural genome editing agents can (re)combine and (re)regulate host genome content according to context-dependent (i.e. adaptational) purposes. Such active agent-driven processes contradict passive error replication (mutation) narratives to explain emergence of genetic diversity.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{dissimilar}} {{sequence homology}} <b>between</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> foreign peptide, weak electrostatic interactions between foreign peptide and the MHC can also mimic self peptide to elicit an autoimmune response within the host. For example, charged residues {{can explain the}} enhanced on-rate and reduced off-rate of a particular antigen or can contribute to a higher affinity and activity for a particular antigen that can perhaps mimic that of the host. Similarly, prominent ridges {{on the floor of}} peptide-binding grooves can do such things as create C-terminal bulges in particular peptides that can greatly increase the interaction between foreign and self peptide on the MHC. Similarly, there has been evidence that even gross features such as acidic/basic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions have allowed foreign peptides to interact with an antibody or MHC and TCR. It is now apparent that sequence similarity considerations are not sufficient when evaluating potential mimic epitopes and the underlying mechanisms of molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry, from these examples, has therefore been shown to occur {{in the absence of any}} true sequence homology.|$|E

500|$|Phagocytosis {{is common}} and {{probably}} appeared early in evolution, [...] evolving first in unicellular eukaryotes. Amoebae are unicellular protists that {{separated from the}} tree leading to metazoa shortly after the divergence of plants, and they share many specific functions with mammalian phagocytic cells. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum, for example, is an amoeba that lives in the soil and feeds on bacteria. Like animal phagocytes, it engulfs bacteria by phagocytosis mainly through Toll-like receptors, and it has other biological functions in common with macrophages. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum is social; it aggregates when starved to form a migrating pseudoplasmodium or slug. This multicellular organism eventually will produce a fruiting body with spores that are resistant to environmental dangers. Before the formation of fruiting bodies, the cells will migrate as a slug-like organism for several days. During this time, exposure to toxins or bacterial pathogens {{has the potential to}} compromise survival of the species by limiting spore production. Some of the amoebae engulf bacteria and absorb toxins while circulating within the slug, and these amoebae eventually die. They are genetically identical to the other amoebae in the slug; their self-sacrifice to protect the other amoebae from bacteria is similar to the self-sacrifice of phagocytes seen in the immune system of higher vertebrates. This ancient immune function in social amoebae suggests an evolutionarily conserved cellular foraging mechanism that might have been adapted to defense functions well before the diversification of amoebae into higher forms. However, a common ancestry with mammalian phagocytes has not been proven. Phagocytes occur throughout the animal kingdom, from marine sponges to insects and lower and higher vertebrates. The ability of amoebae to distinguish <b>between</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> non-self is a pivotal one, and is the root of the immune system of many species of amoeba.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Austen's {{views of}} society and economics, Alastair MacIntyre in his 1981 After Virtue offered a {{critique}} of the Enlightenment as leading to moral chaos and decay, and citing Aristotle argued that a [...] "good life for man" [...] is only possible if one follows the traditional moral rules of one's society. In this regard, MacIntrye used Austen as an [...] "Aristotelian" [...] writer whose books offered up examples of how to be virtuous with the English country estate playing the same role that the polis did for Aristotle. By contrast, Mary Evans in her 1987 book Jane Austen and the State depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist concerned with the [...] "stability of human relationships and communities" [...] and against [...] "conspicuous consumption" [...] and the [...] "individualisation of feeling" [...] promoted by the Industrial Revolution. In her 1987 book Desire and Domestic Fiction, Nancy Armstrong in a study much influenced by the theories of Karl Marx and Michel Foucault, argued that all of Austen's books reflected the dominant political-economic ideology of her times, concerning the battle to exercise power over the human body, which determined how and whether a woman was considered sexually desirable or not. The Marxist James Thompson in his 1988 book <b>Between</b> <b>Self</b> <b>and</b> the World likewise depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist searching for a realm of freedom and feeling in a world dominated by a soulless materialism promoted by capitalism. By contrast, David Kaufmann in his 1992 essay [...] "Propriety and the Law" [...] argued that Austen was a classical liberal in the mold of Adam Smith, who felt that virtue was best exercised in the private sphere of the family life rather in the public sphere of politics. Kaufmann rejected the claim that Austen was influenced by Edmund Burke, arguing that for Austen, virtue was not something passed down from time immemorial from a landed elite as Burke would have it, but rather was something that any individual could acquire, thus making Austen into something of a radical. As Rajeswari Rajan notes in her essay on recent Austen scholarship, [...] "the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged". The questions scholars now investigate involve: [...] "the [...] Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' , the clergy, town versus country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied a reformist position between these extremes".|$|E
