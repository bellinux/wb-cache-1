Meet the Parents was displaced from No.1 during the weekend of November 3–5 by the newly released Charlie's Angels while still managing {{to stay ahead of}} The Legend of <b>Bagger</b> Vance, another new release that debuted at number 3. It remained in the Top 10 grossing films until its 11th week. In the United Kingdom, the film had its theatrical premiere on December 15, 2000 and was distributed by United International Pictures (UIP). There, it managed to earn over $21 million during its run.

5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and {{brought up in the}} working-class area of Tinsley. The family later moved to the village of Catcliffe after his father set up a (then-illegal) betting shop. This brought greater {{prosperity}} but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later. Banks left school in December 1952 and took up employment as a <b>bagger</b> with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up his upper body strength. He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys. His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare, however a 12–2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3–1 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh. Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier.|$|E

Either way, viewers will watch their {{emotions}} unfold by getting an up-close and personal look at their skills of craftsmanship that go into making some of the best custom <b>Baggers</b> in world. The Bagger-style motorcycles are cruisers outfitted with saddlebags on their tail which are ideal for touring, hence the name [...] "baggers". The backtrop of Phoenix was chosen because of how well the <b>baggers</b> are represented by the bike shop who produce their own customized cruisers.

25|$|As Tayler (2003) mentions, {{demutualisation}} moves succeeded immediately {{because neither}} Conservative nor Labour party UK governments created a framework which put obstacles {{in the way}} of demutualisation. Political acquiescence in demutualisation was clearest {{in the case of the}} position on 'carpet baggers', that is those who joined societies by lodging minimum amounts of £100 or so in the hope of profiting from a distribution of surplus after demutualisation. The deregulating Building Societies Act 1986 contained an anti-carpet <b>bagger</b> provision in the form of a two-year rule. This prescribed a qualifying period of two years before savers could participate in a residual claim. But, before the 1989 Abbey National Building Society demutualisation, the courts found against the two-year rule after legal action brought by Abbey National itself to circumvent the intent of the legislators. After this the legislation did prevent a cash distribution to members of less than two years standing, but the same result was obtained by permitting the issue of 'free' shares in the acquiring plc, saleable for cash. The Thatcher Conservative government declined to introduce amending legislation to make good the defect in the 'two-year rule'.|$|E

5000|$|The {{generally}} accepted convention for peak <b>baggers</b> {{to consider a}} peak summited is to reach its highest point by any route using only human power (e.g., hiking, climbing, skiing, biking).

This allows for driving to car-accessible summits and declaring the summit [...] "climbed". Drive-ups are allowed by the U.S. State Highpointers club and by the County Highpointers club, whose members are collectively attempting to reach the highest point in all 3,142 U.S. counties.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{production}} of vinyl chloride (VC) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) {{involves the use}} of various chemicals, some known to be toxic and potentially or definitely carcinogenic. The related potential risk often has not been properly investigated. Updated cancer mortality among different subgroups of workers employed in a VC-PVC production plant located in Porto Marghera (Italy) was re-analyzed using an internal reference group of workers with low (or null) exposure to VC. Methods Mortality of 1658 male workers was analyzed by Poisson regression. Relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for blue collar workers and their specific subgroups of PVC <b>baggers,</b> PVC compound, autoclave and other blue collar workers were calculated using technicians and clerks as an internal reference group. The follow-up covered the period 1972 – 1999. Results Significantly increased mortality rates were observed for all causes of death among the whole blue collar workforce (RR = 1. 55; 95 % CI = 1. 03 – 2. 35; 229 deaths), PVC <b>baggers</b> (1. 72; 95 % CI = 1. 04 – 2. 83; 49 deaths) and PVC compound workers (1. 71; 95 % CI = 1. 09 – 2. 67; 72 deaths). Liver cancer, including angiosarcoma, was increased among autoclave workers (9. 57; 95 % CI = 3. 71 – 24. 68; 7 deaths) and cardiovascular diseases among PVC <b>baggers</b> (2. 25; 95 % CI = 1. 08 – 4. 70; 12 deaths). Hemolymphopoietic system tumors, leukemias and lymphomas prevalently, were found only among exposed workers, with 4, 4 and 6 deaths observed among PVC <b>baggers,</b> PVC compound and other blue collar workers, respectively. An excess of lung cancer was found among PVC <b>baggers.</b> Conclusion This cohort analysis, based on internal comparison, confirmed previously reported specific risk excesses for liver tumors and liver cirrhosis among autoclave workers and for lung cancer among PVC <b>baggers,</b> and revealed PVC compound workers as a possible new at risk group for all causes, all tumors and for liver and lung tumors. In conclusion, RRs for all causes of death and all tumors were increased among all blue collar workers. </p...|$|R
