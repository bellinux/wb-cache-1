5|$|Irene {{also caused}} severe {{agricultural}} damage in southeastern Florida totalling to $338million Floodwaters killed 30cattle at one farm, though the owners protected {{the rest of}} their 1700cattle by raising the feeding areas above the flood plain. According to an initial estimate, the flooding destroyed between 5% and 15% of fruit groves along its path. The flooding delayed the winter planting of corn and <b>bell</b> <b>peppers</b> and damaged tomato plants, forcing Miami-Dade County growers to replant damaged crops. The hurricane also damaged sugar cane, vegetables, and citrus crops, with citrus canker spreading after the storm passed through the area. Due to the crop damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared Broward, Collier, Miami-Dade, and Monroe Counties as disaster areas. This qualified eligible farmers for low-interest emergency loans.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E

5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green <b>bell</b> <b>peppers</b> and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E

40|$|Methyl bromide (MeBr), a Class I ozone –depleting substance, {{has been}} banned for {{ordinary}} agricultural uses. In {{the absence of}} an effective MeBr alternative, weed control is a major challenge for commercial tomato and <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> production. Field trials were conducted at Fayetteville, AR, to compare allyl isothiocyanate (ITC), metam sodium, and herbicide programs with the standard MeBr application (mixture of MeBr plus chloropicrin at 67 % plus 33 %, respectively, hereafter referred to as MeBr) for crop injury, weed control, viable yellow nutsedge tubers, and marketable yield in low–density polyethylene (LDPE) mulched tomato and <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> production. In addition, herbicide programs were evaluated for cost of production, gross return, net return, and net return relative to MeBr in LDPE–mulched tomato and <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> production. Allyl ITC and metam sodium did not injure tomato. Weed control and yield in tomato plots treated with allyl ITC at 750 kg ha - 1 or metam sodium at 360 kg ha- 1 were comparable to plots treated with MeBr at 390 kg ha- 1. Likewise, metam sodium at 360 kg ha- 1 and MeBr–treated <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> plots were similar for weed control and yield. Tomato or <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> injury was ≥ 13 % in PRE-applied imazosulfuron or S–metolachlor plots after POST-applied trifloxysulfuron plus halosulfuron at 0. 008 and 0. 027 kg ha- 1, respectively. Herbicide programs consisting of PRE–applied S–metolachlor followed by (fb) POST–applied trifloxysulfuron plus halosulfuron provided comparable weed control to MeBr in LDPE–mulched tomato and <b>bell</b> <b>pepper.</b> Tomato or <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> plots treated with the S–metolachlor–containing herbicide program yielded total marketable fruits equivalent to the plots treated with MeBr. The S–metolachlor herbicide program also provided a net return of 3, 758. 50 and 9, 912. 05 dollars ha- 1 in tomato and <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> production, respectively. Moreover, the S–metolachlor herbicide program added a net return of $ 173. 34 ha- 1 relative to net return with MeBr treatment in <b>bell</b> <b>pepper.</b> In conclusion, metam sodium at 360 kg ha- 1 or PRE-applied S–metolachlor at 1. 6 kg ha- 1 fb POST–applied trifloxysulfuron plus halosulfuron at 0. 008 and 0. 027 kg ha- 1 are viable MeBr alternatives for weed control in LDPE–mulched tomato and <b>bell</b> <b>pepper...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: In 1999, an {{extensive}} study among <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> growers showed a prevalence of 53. 8 % work-related symptoms and 35. 4 % sensitisation to <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> pollen. Experiments with bees to remove pollen from <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> flowers {{have been done}} for a few years. Objectives: It was {{the aim of this}} study to investigate whether bees can reduce the pollen exposure in <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> greenhouses and whether this reduction results in a decrease in allergic complaints in the greenhouse workers. Methods: Eighteen greenhouses were selected for the study. In each greenhouse, pollen exposure was estimated. In 6 and 3 of the greenhouses, high, respectively low, numbers of honeybees were placed throughout the pollen season of the sweet <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> plant. Nine greenhouses without honeybees were used as control. At baseline, as well as after 4 and 8 months, nasal symptoms assessed with a visual analogue score and lung function parameters were used as outcome measure. Results: Forty-four of the 133 employees invited reported work-related symptoms. High numbers of bees reduced the pollen amount in a dose-dependent way to 18 % of the baseline exposure. A significant trend relationship between the visual analogue scale in nasal symptoms and the number of colonies of bees was seen. Conclusions: The interference of bees in <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> greenhouses significantly reduces the pollen amount. This reduction is associated with less work-related rhinitis symptoms in allergic greenhouse workers. This intervention study supports the hypothesis that allergic work-related complaints of greenhouse workers, sensitised to <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> pollen, are caused by occupational exposure to this pollen in the greenhous...|$|R

25|$|Uyghur food shows both Central Asian and Chinese elements. A typical Uyghur dish is polu (or pilaf), a dish found {{throughout}} Central Asia. In a common {{version of the}} Uyghur polu, carrots and mutton (or chicken) are first fried in oil with onions, then rice and water are added, and the whole dish is steamed. Raisins and dried apricots may also be added. Kawaplar (Uyghur: Каваплар) or chuanr (i.e., kebabs or grilled meat) are also found here. Another common Uyghur dish is leghmen (لەغمەن, ләғмән), a noodle dish with a stir-fried topping (säy, from Chinese cai, 菜) usually made from mutton and vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, green <b>bell</b> <b>peppers,</b> chili peppers, and cabbage.
