40|$|This {{study is}} {{primarily}} concerned with differences in returns per pound of wool accruing to Montana wool growers by the alternative methods of sale to various types of buyers. The results presented in the table's indicate that no appreciable difference {{can be attributed to}} selling wool either on a graded or ungraded basis. They do indicate an advantage for the farm flock grower, who produced less than 3, 000 pounds, to sell his wool <b>by</b> <b>consignment</b> to local wool pools. The results also imply an advantage for the farm flock grower producing from 3, 000 to 5, 000 pounds and above, to sell their wool directly to buyers. The results of this study also indicate that net returns are largest on both direct and consignment sales to manufacturers, implying that returns are highest " to growers when handler's margins are not a cost to manufacturers. This indication must-be qualified, however, because of the limited number of manufacturers who bought wool in the state in 1956. In certain instances it may be less costly for the manufacturer to buy in volume from handlers in the central markets. The price paid for wool is affected by the competitive structure of the market and by supply and demand conditions within the market.

The viruses are well-defined {{species of the}} genus Begomovirus, are exclusively transmitted {{by members of the}} Bemisia tabaci species complex and have tomato, as well as a few other crops or weeds, as their hosts. TYLCV is listed on tomato plants for planting, other than seeds, in Annex IIAII of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. While establishment and local spread rely on the Bemisia vector, the viruses can also be disseminated over long distances by movement of infected plants for planting or <b>by</b> <b>consignments</b> of non-host plants carrying viruliferous whiteflies. Establishment outdoors and spread are limited to regions with ecoclimatic conditions suitable for the establishment of vector populations in the open.

He opened a grocery and provisions business in Ballina and, as it proved successful, he later establishing branches in Galway and London between 1910 and 1914; the London-branch would be sold at the outbreak of the First World War. Having founded and organisted the recruitment and funding of the Mayo activities of the IRA he also acted as a justice of the Sinn Féin courts. He was advised to leave the area due to death threats from the Black and Tans and their burning down of his commercial premises in Ballina. On one occasion during that period, according to his military statements, he prevented some over enthusiastic volunteers from attempting the kidnapping and assassination of Prince George Future King of England, sailing and holidaying in the Mayo/Donegal region at the time. Relocating to Dublin, the Irish overseas Trading Company was formed with a former Director of ICI Chemicals & Explosives, he became involved in the Irish nationalist movement and was active in the Mayo and Galway areas during the Irish War of Independence.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been enthusiasm amongst {{commentators}} that shared-resource economic models can both create new commercial opportunities and address policy problems, including in the transport sector. Within the city logistics subsector, this new model is exemplified {{by the emergence of}} Urban Freight Consolidation Centres (UCCs). UCCs replace multiple ‘last-mile’ delivery movements, many of which involving small <b>consignments,</b> <b>by</b> a common receiving point (the consolidation centre), normally on the periphery of a city, with the final part of the delivery being shared <b>by</b> the <b>consignments</b> in a small freight vehicle. Such arrangements can represent a good compromise between the needs of city centre businesses and their customers on the one hand (i. e. high availability of a range of goods) and local and global sustainability objectives on the other. At the same time, by sharing logistics facilities and delivery vehicles, UCCs offer added-value services to both urban economic actors, such as retailers, and network logistics providers. However, UCCs add to the complexity of logistics chains, requiring additional contracts, communications and movement stages. These arrangements also introduce additional actors within the supply of delivery services, notably local authorities present as promoters and funders, rather than simply as regulators, companies specialised in the UFCC operation, and companies which provide specialist technologies, such as electric delivery vehicles. UCCs therefore also represent an example of multi-stakeholder collaboration. Drawing on the results of a 2013 survey in Bristol (UK) and a further survey carried out in 2015 in Cagliari (IT), the present paper provides an in-depth comparison of the differences in the perceptions of urban freight users and stakeholders towards UCCs...|$|R

This Crime can be beriefly defined as achieving other's properties using fraudulent tools. The legal pillar of this crime in criminal law of Iran is the article 1 from the law of enhancement of punishment for perpetrators of embezzlement, bribery and fraud approved by Expediency Discernment Council of the System on December 6, 1988 (15 th of Azar, 1367). As to the criminal law of France, it is the 313 - 1 article of the French Criminal Law. There is particular evolution in French Criminal Law about the admission of loss as an independent element. Nevertheless the property <b>consignment</b> <b>by</b> the loser due to delusion is treated equal to a loss by French jurists; on the other hand, the usufruct of the fraud perpetrator is not required for the realization of fraud which can bring about the particular difference with the criminal law of Iran on financial and moral elements of fraud...|$|R

Here, social media, and under specific circumstances, YouTube, has turned into a special form of an archive of anonymous testimony, activated by those who were filming the events and sharing them via the platform. Furthermore, YouTube has been revealed to be a tool for remote participation, {{as in the case of}} diasporic citizens who are often located in more technologically advanced conditions, allowing them to more easily share video testimonies globally through the platform. Even more importantly, YouTube forms an archive of physical gestures that is defined, as such, by the presence of real bodies (“the people,” as referred to by Judith Butler 6) that have gathered for a cause; by the act of filming portions of reality and history as it it unfolds as part of their being here and now; and <b>by</b> the <b>consignment</b> to the cloud of necessarily incomplete fragments of expressions of agency (in contrast to that of whole events) that are disseminated and kept visible by users who themselves were not present at those events. As a response to political and social urgency, these specific videos, and the new genre they have initiated, play a triple function: they are cathartic for those filming events and uploading footage; they mediate reality for those watching through the screen; and they elevate minor, bottom-up, often incomplete stories of political events from the very people who take part in them. As claimed by Peter Snowdon, for the first time in film and cinema history, citizens are able to tell their history at the same time as it is unfolding (Snowdon, 2014).|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, freight {{groupage}} is {{a common}} practice, since it represents an effective method for achieving cost savings in collecting or delivering large product varieties in low quantities, <b>by</b> consolidating multiple <b>consignments</b> into one large transport load. Studying problems related to freight groupage is certainly a complex task, since it is influenced by many variables. Costs, for instance, are frequently linked to unplanned operational decisions made by operators on a daily basis, due to the constant presence of unscheduled requests or order changes. In this context, costs are difficult to control and manage. Authors propose a new approach for estimating costs, performances and resource utilizations by presenting a computation method capable of calculating transportation costs per delivery point. Cost allocation is achieved through a method of computation easily applicable to real world contests. Model results may also lead to create a dynamic system, enabling operators {{to be aware of}} the effects of their activity in real time. This way, they are constantly alerted and supported in their activities and in real-time decision making, gradually becoming aware of situations capable of creating additional costs and bad service. Thus, the model may both quantitatively assess the effects of the adopted transportation decisions and support in solving daily routing problems. Moreover, applying this approach, companies have major opportunities to improve margins and design new efficient distribution strategies...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades natural and {{man-made}} disasters have been increasing in terms of frequency, size, number of people affected and material damage caused. There is growing awareness {{of the importance of}} adequate national and international legal frameworks for disaster prevention, mitigation and response. The implementation of these frameworks, however, poses serious challenges. This book analyses International Disaster Response Law as developed in recent times and identifies the main existing normative gaps. The authors address the rights and duties of States in preventing and mitigating disasters, in facilitating access to their territory for humanitarian relief actors, as well as issues related to liability and compensation. Due attention is paid to European Union law governing disaster response (and to its reform {{in the light of the}} Lisbon Treaty) and to the main trends in domestic legislation. Human rights obligations are thoroughly examined and the potential relevance of international criminal law is assessed. Additional topics such as the status of relief personnel, the hindrances to the delivery of relief <b>consignments</b> <b>by</b> customs and excise administration, the use of civilian and military defence assets in emergency situations, the mechanisms and procedures available to offer financial support for recovery and rehabilitation, risk insurance, and the issue of corruption during disaster-related activities are specifically addressed. By drawing on the expertise of lawyers, political scientists, economists and humanitarian practitioners, the book promotes much-needed interdisciplinary dialog and sheds light on a largely uncharted field of research. It is therefore a essential reading for academics and practitioners in international and EU law, policy makers, civil protection and humanitarian operators and for anyone interested in exploring the legal facets of the international community’s response to large-scale calamitous events...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to provide EFSA with {{probabilistic}} models for quantitative pathway analysis of plant pest introduction for the EU territory through non-edible plant products or plants. We first provide a conceptualization of two types of pathway models. The individual based PM simulates an individual consignment (or a population of such <b>consignment)</b> <b>by</b> describing the stochastic change {{in the state of}} the individual consignment over time and space. The flow-based PM, simulates the flow of infested product over time and space, without distinguishing individual consignments. We show how these two conceptualisations are mathematically related, and present, as a show case, both models for cut flowers. Second, we developed PMs for five product groups: round wood, sawn wood, cut flowers, plants for planting and seeds. For each product group we have developed a case-study (combination of product, origin and pest) to illustrate the use of the pathway models: (1) oak wood from the USA and Ceratocystis fagacearum, (2) Coniferous sawn wood from China and Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, (3) Cut orchids from Thailand and Thrips palmi, (4) Pot orchids from Thailand and Thrips palmi, and (5) Tomato seeds and Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis from outside the European Union. An uncertainty analysis on the models shows that the pest species-specific parameters appear to be sensitive and uncertain. Third, a practical guidance is provided on i) how to develop a PM, ii) the application of PMs in @Risk (a plugin for MS Excel), and iii) application in R. Finally, future research topics are defined. Further work is needed on interpretation of results, linking quantitative outcomes of pathway modelling to pest risk scoring guidance, and evaluation of management options using pathway models...|$|R
