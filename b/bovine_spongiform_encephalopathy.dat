40|$|Transmissible <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies,</b> {{including}} variant-Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) {{in humans}} and <b>bovine</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> in cattle, are fatal neurodegenerative disorders characterized by protein misfolding {{of the host}} cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) to the infectious scrapie form (PrP(Sc)). However, the mechanism that exogenous PrP(Sc) infects cells and where pathologic conversion of PrP(C) to the PrP(Sc) form occurs remains uncertain. Here we report that similar to the mechanism of HIV- 1 TAT-mediated peptide transduction, processed mature, full length PrP contains a conserved N-terminal cationic domain that stimulates cellular uptake by lipid raft-dependent, macropinocytosis. Inhibition of macropinocytosis by three independent means prevented cellular uptake of recombinant PrP; however, it did not affect recombinant PrP cell surface association. In addition, fusion of the cationic N-terminal PrP domain to a Cre recombinase reporter protein was sufficient to promote both cellular uptake and escape from the macropinosomes into the cytoplasm. Inhibition of macropinocytosis was sufficient to prevent conversion of PrP(C) to the pathologic PrP(Sc) form in N 2 a cells exposed to strain RML PrP(Sc) infected brain homogenates, suggesting that a critical determinant of PrP(C) conversion occurs following macropinocytotic internalization and not through mere membrane association.

40|$|Abstract Background Classical and {{atypical}} <b>bovine</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (BSEs) are cattle prion diseases. Distinct bovine prion gene (PRNP) alleles {{have been}} associated with classical and atypical BSE susceptibility. However, the full extent of PRNP allele association with BSE susceptibility is not known. A systematic sequence-based genotyping method that detects variation throughout PRNP would be useful for: 1) detecting rare PRNP alleles that may be present in BSE-affected animals and 2) testing PRNP alleles for an association with either classical or atypical BSE susceptibility. Findings We improved a Sanger-based sequencing strategy for detecting bovine PRNP variation through all exons, introns, and part of the promoter (25. 2 kb). Our current method can detect 389 known and other potentially unknown PRNP polymorphisms that may be present in BSE-affected cattle. We determined PRNP genotypes for the first U. S.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atypical <b>bovine</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (BSEs) are {{recently}} recognized {{prion diseases}} of cattle. Atypical BSEs are rare; approximately 30 {{cases have been}} identified worldwide. We tested prion gene (PRNP) haplotypes for an association with atypical BSE. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Haplotype tagging polymorphisms that characterize PRNP haplotypes from the promoter region through the three prime untranslated region of exon 3 (25. 2 kb) {{were used to determine}} PRNP haplotypes of six available atypical BSE cases from Canada, France and the United States. One or two copies of a distinct PRNP haplotype were identified in five of the six cases (p = 1. 3 x 10 (- 4), two-tailed Fisher's exact test; CI(95 %) 0. 263 - 0. 901, difference between proportions). The haplotype spans a portion of PRNP that includes part of intron 2, the entire coding region of exon 3 and part of the three prime untranslated region of exon 3 (13 kb).

40|$|Abstract Background Prion {{diseases}} such as <b>bovine</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (BSE) are transmissible neurodegenerative diseases which are presumably caused by an infectious conformational isoform of the cellular prion protein. Previous work has provided evidence that in murine prion disease the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) expression is altered in the brain. To determine if prion-induced changes in ERV expression are a general phenomenon we used a non-human primate model for prion disease. Results Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fasicularis) were infected intracerebrally with BSE-positive brain stem material from cattle and allowed to develop prion disease. Brain tissue from the basis pontis and vermis cerebelli of the six animals and the same regions from four healthy controls were subjected to ERV expression profiling using a retrovirus-specific microarray and quantitative real-time PCR. We could show that Class I gammaretroviruses HERV-E 4 - 1, ERV- 9, and MacERV- 4 increase expression in BSE-infected macaques. In a second approach, we analysed ERV-K-(HML- 2) RNA and protein expression in extracts from the same cynomolgus macaques. Here we found a significant downregulation of both, the macaque ERV-K-(HML- 2) Gag protein and RNA in the frontal/parietal cortex of BSE-infected macaques. Conclusions We provide evidence that dysregulation of ERVs in response to BSE-infection can be detected on both, the RNA and the protein level. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report on the differential expression of ERV-derived structural proteins in prion disorders. Our findings suggest that endogenous retroviruses may induce or exacerbate the pathological consequences of prion-associated neurodegeneration. </p...|$|R

40|$|Follicular {{dendritic}} cells (FDCs) {{are unique}} immunological accessory cells {{located in the}} light and dark zones of the germinal centres in lymph follicles. Characterized by long branching processes forming a three-dimensional network, FDCs create particular microenvironments for germinal centre B and T cells {{and contribute to the}} maturation of B cells into memory cells. An involvement of the FDCs is suspected in various disorders affecting lymphoid tissues, malignant lymphoma or in some viral diseases. Moreover, in prion diseases, FDCs seem to be the major sites of extraneuronal cellular prion protein expression and the principal sites of the infectious agent accumulation in lymph organs. Because no antibody commercially available was specific to bovine FDCs, a new monoclonal antibody directed against bovine FDCs (FDC-B 1) has been produced and characterized in our laboratory. The antigen detected by FDC-B 1 is expressed on FDC surfaces in ruminant (bovine, ovine and caprine) lymphoid organs. This protein seems to be a membrane glycoprotein of more or less 28 kDa whose sequence will be soon determined. Moreover, FDC-B 1 can be used in various applications: immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase, immunogold labellings and western blotting. FDCs are potential targets for therapy or prophylaxis in natural TSEs, such as <b>bovine</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> and scrapie. Thus, it appears of great interest to identify bovine and ovine FDCs in routine lymphoid tissues sections.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{forms of}} atypical <b>bovine</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (H-BSE and L-BSE) {{can be distinguished}} from classical (C-) BSE found in cattle based on biochemical signatures of disease-associated prion protein (PrPSc). H-BSE is transmissible to wild-type mice-with infected mice showing a long survival period that is close to their normal lifespan-but not to hamsters. Therefore, rodent-adapted H-BSE with a short survival period would be useful for analyzing H-BSE characteristics. In this study, we investigated the transmissibility of H-BSE to hamster prion protein transgenic (TgHaNSE) mice with long survival periods. Although none of the TgHaNSE mice manifested the disease during their lifespan, PrPSc accumulation was observed {{in some areas of}} the brain after the first passage. With subsequent passages, TgHaNSE mice developed the disease with a mean survival period of 220 days. The molecular characteristics of proteinase K-resistant PrPSc (PrPres) in the brain were identical to those observed in first-passage mice. The distribution of immunolabeled PrPSc in the brains of TgHaNSE mice differed between those infected with H-BSE as compared to C-BSE or L-BSE, and the molecular properties of PrPres in TgHaNSE mice infected with H-BSE differed from those of the original isolate. The strain-specific electromobility, glycoform profiles, and proteolytic cleavage sites of H-BSE in TgHaNSE mice were indistinguishable from those of C-BSE, in which the diglycosylated form was predominant. These findings indicate that strain-specific pathogenic characteristics and molecular features of PrPres in the brain are altered during cross-species transmission. Typical H-BSE features were restored after back passage from TgHaNSE to bovinized transgenic mice, indicating that the H-BSE strain was propagated in TgHaNSE mice. This could result from the overexpression of the hamster prion protein...|$|R

40|$|Prion diseases, such as <b>bovine</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (BSE), are {{transmissible}} {{neurodegenerative disorders}} affecting humans {{and a wide}} variety of mammals. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a prion disease in humans, has been linked to exposure to BSE prions. This classical BSE (cBSE) is now rapidly disappearing as a result of appropriate measures to control animal feeding. Besides cBSE, two atypical forms (named H- and L-type BSE) have recently been described in Europe, Japan, and North America. Here we describe the first wide-spectrum microarray analysis in whole blood of atypical BSE-infected cattle. Transcriptome changes in infected animals were analyzed prior to and after the onset of clinical signs. The microarray analysis revealed gene expression changes in blood prior to the appearance of the clinical signs and during the progression of the disease. A set of 32 differentially expressed genes was found to be in common between clinical and preclinical stages and showed a very similar expression pattern in the two phases. A 22 -gene signature showed an oscillating pattern of expression, being differentially expressed in the preclinical stage and then going back to control levels in the symptomatic phase. One gene, SEL 1 L 3, was downregulated during the progression of the disease. Most of the studies performed up to date utilized various tissues, which are not suitable for a rapid analysis of infected animals and patients. Our findings suggest the intriguing possibility to take advantage of whole blood RNA transcriptional profiling for the preclinical identification of prion infection. Further, this study highlighted several pathways, such as immune response and metabolism that may {{play an important role in}} peripheral prion pathogenesis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Bovine</b> Amyloidotic <b>Spongiform</b> <b>Encephalopathy</b> (BASE) is {{a variant}} of {{classical}} BSE that affects cows and can be transmitted to primates and mice. BASE is biochemically different from BSE and shares some molecular and histo-pathological features with the MV 2 sub-type of human sporadic Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (sCJD). RESULTS: The present work {{examined the effects of}} BASE on gene expression in circulating immune cells. Ontology analysis of genes differentially expressed between cattle orally challenged with brain homogenate from cattle following intracranial inoculation with BASE and control cattle identified three main pathways which were affected. Within the immune function pathway, the most affected genes were related to the T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation pathways. The differential expression of these genes in BASE challenged animals at 10, 12 and 24  months following challenge, vs unchallenged controls, was investigated by real time PCR.
