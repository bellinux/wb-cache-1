500|$|In {{preparation}} for the race, tire provider Goodyear created new tires, branded [...] "Wrangler", based on a previous dirt tire that the company made. To give the trucks more grip, the tires were widened by one inch to eleven. The bias-ply tires (instead of radial tires) also had treads to remove dirt quicker, in a <b>block</b> <b>pattern,</b> along with being softer. The left-side tires were staggered three inches shorter to 85.5 inches than the right tires (88.5) to assist in handling. Meanwhile, the trucks had mesh shields and hood deflector screens attached to prevent debris from the dirt from entering the radiators and damaging the vehicles. The trucks also had the front spoilers and splitters removed, the grille closed, and the rear spoilers raised and enlarged by 40 square inches to generate more downforce. The trucks' windshields remained, meaning the track crew had to keep the track dry, to prevent mud from making them unable to be cleared. On the hoods, bug deflectors, which were 8 by 12 inches, were installed to prevent stones from hitting the windshield. Teams added under panels to the trucks' chassis to prevent dirt from increasing the trucks' weight.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the relative similarities in regime classification of an index designed to isolate cases of blocking based upon the kinematic properties of the regional flow, and one which describes the amplitude of the planetary-scale eddy field, is undertaken with observations from 28 Northern Hemisphere winters. The occurrence of <b>blocking</b> <b>patterns</b> persisting 5 days or more over the eastern Pacific is found to coincide in 94 % of all cases with the hemispheric flow being characterized by an amplified planetary-scale wave flow regime. However, the occurrence of such an amplitude regime does not necessarily imply {{the existence of a}} <b>blocking</b> <b>pattern</b> in the classical sense. In the eastern Pacific, the split flow blocking developed simultaneously with or during an amplified wave regime episode in 30 of 33 cases. Retrogression of <b>blocking</b> <b>patterns</b> to west of the dateline is a frequent occurrence accompanying the decay of amplified planetary-wave episodes. 3 / 4 of the blocking episodes occurring west of the dateline formed as a part of amplified wave regime events and persisted into their aftermath. Most European blocking episodes (78 %) are a part of an amplified-wave flow regime during some part of their life cycle. Blocking in this sector developed along with or during an amplified wave regime in 30 of 51 cases...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{heterogeneity}} {{of soil and}} weed populations poses a challenge to researchers. Unlike aboveground variability, below-ground variability {{is more difficult to}} discern without a strategic soil sampling <b>pattern.</b> While <b>blocking</b> is commonly used to control environmental variation, this strategy is rarely informed by data about current soil conditions. Fifty georeferenced sites were located in a 0. 65 [*]ha area prior to establishing a long-term field experiment. Soil organic matter (OM) and weed seed bank populations were analyzed at each site and the spatial structure was modeled with semivariograms and interpolated with kriging to map the surface. These maps were used to formulate three strategic <b>blocking</b> <b>patterns</b> and the efficiency of each pattern was compared to a completely randomized design and a west to east model not informed by soil variability. Compared to OM, weeds were more variable across the landscape and had a shorter range of autocorrelation, and models to increase blocking efficiency resulted in less increase in power. Weeds and OM were not correlated, so no model examined improved power equally for both parameters. Compared to the west to east <b>blocking</b> <b>pattern,</b> the final <b>blocking</b> <b>pattern</b> chosen resulted in a 7 -fold increase in power for OM and a 36 % increase in power for weeds...|$|R

50|$|A {{jet stream}} {{perturbation}} model is employed by Weather Logistics UK, which simulates {{the diversion of}} the air streams in the upper atmosphere. North Atlantic air flow modelling is simulated by combining a monthly jet stream climatology input calculated at 20 to 30°W, with different <b>blocking</b> high <b>patterns.</b> The jet stream input is generated by thermal wind balance calculations at 316mbars (6 to 9 km aloft) in the mid-latitude range from 40 to 60°N. Long term <b>blocking</b> <b>patterns</b> {{are determined by the}} weather forecaster, who identifies the likely position and strength of North Atlantic Highs from synoptic charts, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns. The model is based on the knowledge that low pressure systems at the surface are steered by the fast ribbons (jet streams) of air in the upper atmosphere. The jet stream - blocking interaction model simulation examines the sea surface temperature field using data from NOAA tracked along the ocean on a path to the British Isles. The principal theory suggests that long term weather patterns act on longer time scales, so large <b>blocking</b> <b>patterns</b> are thought to appear in a similar locations repeatedly over several months. With a good knowledge of <b>blocking</b> high <b>patterns,</b> the model performs with an impressive accuracy that is useful to the end user.|$|R

500|$|In {{the case}} of Hurricane Sandy, two major factors {{contributing}} to the size and strength of the storm were unusually warm ocean surface temperatures {{and an increase in}} <b>blocking</b> <b>patterns,</b> both of which are expected to occur more frequently due to global warming. As they drift north, Atlantic hurricanes are typically moved to the east and out to sea by the jet stream's prevailing winds. This typical <b>pattern</b> was <b>blocked</b> by a ridge of high pressure over Greenland, resulting in a negative Arctic oscillation, forming a kink in the jet stream and causing it to double back on itself off the East Coast; Sandy was caught up in this northwesterly flow. The <b>blocking</b> <b>pattern</b> over Greenland also stalled an arctic front, which combined with the cyclone. Mark Fischetti of Scientific American argued that the jet stream's unusual shape was caused by the melting of Arctic ice. Noting that these <b>blocking</b> <b>patterns</b> are unusual in the fall but have been increasing, meteorologist Jeff Masters said that three studies in 2011 found [...] "that the recent record decline in Arctic sea ice could be responsible, since this heats up the pole, altering the Equator-to-pole temperature difference, forcing the jet stream to slow down, meander, and get stuck in large loops." [...] Trenberth said that while a negative Arctic Oscillation and a blocking anticyclone were in place, the null hypothesis remained that this was just the natural variability of weather.|$|R

40|$|Provision of {{variable}} block sizes and multiple reference frames in motion estima-tion (ME) significantly improves the compression efficiency of H. 264. The involved computation for finding the best reference picture and ME mode in the rate-distortion minimization sense, however, is usually intimidating. In this paper, a new H. 264 fast in-ter-mode decision algorithm {{is presented to}} resolve the performance-complexity dilemma. The proposed method employs the coded <b>block</b> <b>patterns,</b> correlated modes and rate-distortion costs to avoid exhaustive mode evaluation. Specific values of coded <b>block</b> <b>patterns,</b> which reflect the accuracy of 16 × 16 ME, are used to identify whether large par-titioning blocks are suitable. Inter-frame correlation in terms of modes and rate-distortion costs, is further incorporated for fast mode decision. Accuracy of the proposed expediting criteria is verified through comprehensive evaluations. Compared with state-of-the-art fast mode-decision algorithms, the proposed method achieves consistently better time savings. In addition to the reduction in computational complexity, the proposed method is elegant without any ad-hoc thresholds...|$|R
