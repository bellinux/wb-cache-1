Less still {{is known of}} mammalian ageing, {{in part due to}} the much longer lives of even small mammals such as the mouse (around 3 years). A model organism for studying of ageing is the nematode C. elegans, thanks to its short lifespan of 2–3 weeks, our ability to easily perform genetic manipulations or to suppress gene activity with RNA interference, or other factors. Most known mutations and RNA interference targets that extend lifespan were first discovered in C. elegans.|$|E

Despite this, she still courageously seeks Warner {{in an effort to}} win him back, leaving him unimpressed ("Serious (Reprise)"). Elle runs from the party, only to meet Emmett, who struggles to {{understand}} Elle's love problems. He has Elle assess her priorities until she realizes it is her obsession with Warner that keeps her from earning his respect ("Chip On My Shoulder"). Freed from her need to please Warner, she defeats him in a classroom debate. Elle then helps Paulette in a way that proves she is <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> law. Warner and Vivienne win two of Callahan's coveted internship positions, and Warner proposes to Vivienne on the spot right in front of Elle. Vivienne accepts with a kiss. Before Elle's heart can break, Emmett shows her the internship list. Below the names of Vivienne, Warner, and classmate Enid Hoopes is the name Elle Woods, at which she is ecstatic ("So Much Better").|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, 97% of all American {{households}} owned a television set, and preschool children watched {{an average of}} 27 hours of television per week. Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively. Children from low-income families, however, had fewer resources than children from higher-income families {{to prepare them for}} school. Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested [...] "substantially lower" [...] than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school.

500|$|The {{invention}} {{that brought}} Lawrence to international fame {{started out as}} a sketch on a scrap of a paper napkin. While sitting in the library one evening in 1929, Lawrence glanced over a journal article by Rolf Widerøe, and was intrigued by one of the diagrams. This depicted a device that produced high-energy particles by means of a succession of small [...] "pushes". The device depicted was laid out in a straight line using increasingly longer electrodes. At the time, physicists were beginning to explore the atomic nucleus. In 1919, the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford had fired alpha particles into nitrogen and had succeeded in knocking protons out of some of the nuclei. But nuclei have a positive charge that repels other positively charged nuclei, and they are bound together tightly by a force that physicists were only just <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> To break them up, to disintegrate them, would require much higher energies, of the order of millions of volts.|$|E

On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there.

2500|$|As {{children}} {{move forward}} with their reading skills, they {{learn a great deal}} about what is really inside a word; the stem, roots, prefixes and suffixes that make up morphemes of the language. [...] By this stage, children already know about the common bound morphemes such as [...] "s" [...] and [...] "ed" [...] because these are attached to many words. [...] Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as [...] "sight chunks" [...] that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, but {{it is a matter of}} being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word—its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings—fast enough that they have time to think and comprehend what they are seeing. [...] The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend what had just been read. Decoding readers are just <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to figure out what they are really reading.|$|E

Not long into the run, Fry had a nervous breakdown and fled to Belgium, where he remained for several days, and the play closed early. In 2007, Mayall said of the incident: [...] "You don't leave the trenches … selfishness is one thing, being a cunt is another. I mustn't start that war again." [...] Edmondson poked fun at the event during their stage tours.

2500|$|Russell Barkley {{believes}} labeling is {{a double-edged}} sword; {{there are many}} pitfalls to labeling but by using a precise label, services can be accessed. He also believes that labeling can help the individual understand and make an informed decision how best {{to deal with the}} diagnoses using evidence-based knowledge. Furthermore studies also show that the education of the siblings and parents has at least a short-term impact on the outcome of treatment. Barkley states this about ADHD rights: [...] "... because of various legislation that has been passed to protect them. There are special education laws with the Americans with Disabilities Act, for example, mentioning ADHD as an eligible condition. If you change the label, and again refer to it as just some variation in normal temperament, these people will lose access to these services, and will lose these hard-won protections that keep them from being discriminated against. ..." [...] Psychiatrist Harvey Parker, who founded CHADD, states, [...] "we should be celebrating the fact that school districts across the country are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and recognize kids with ADHD, and are finding ways of treating them. We should celebrate the fact that the general public doesn't look at ADHD kids as [...] "bad" [...] kids, as brats, but as kids who have a problem that they can overcome". However, children may be ridiculed at school by their peers for using psychiatric medications including those for ADHD.|$|E
2500|$|The 20th {{century was}} a golden era for electrophysiology. In 1902 {{and again in}} 1912, Julius Bernstein {{advanced}} {{the hypothesis that the}} action potential resulted from a change in the permeability of the axonal membrane to ions. Bernstein's hypothesis was confirmed by Ken Cole and Howard Curtis, who showed that membrane conductance increases during an action potential. In 1907, Louis Lapicque suggested that the action potential was generated as a threshold was crossed, what would be later shown as a product of the dynamical systems of ionic conductances. In 1949, Alan Hodgkin and Bernard Katz refined Bernstein's hypothesis by considering that the axonal membrane might have different permeabilities to different ions; in particular, they demonstrated the crucial role of the sodium permeability for the action potential. They made the first actual recording of the electrical changes across the neuronal membrane that mediate the action potential. This line of research culminated in the five 1952 papers of Hodgkin, Katz and Andrew Huxley, in which they applied the voltage clamp technique to determine the dependence of the axonal membrane's permeabilities to sodium and potassium ions on voltage and time, from which they were able to reconstruct the action potential quantitatively.* * * * [...] Hodgkin and Huxley correlated the properties of their mathematical model with discrete ion channels that could exist in several different states, including [...] "open", [...] "closed", and [...] "inactivated". Their hypotheses were confirmed in the mid-1970s and 1980s by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann, who developed the technique of patch clamping to examine the conductance states of individual ion channels.* * [...] In the 21st century, researchers are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the structural basis for these conductance states and for the selectivity of channels for their species of ion, through the atomic-resolution crystal structures, conduction and selectivity | journal = Science | volume = 280 | pages = 69–77 | doi = 10.1126/science.280.5360.69 | pmid = 9525859 | issue = 5360|bibcode = 1998Sci...280...69D | author2 = Morais Cabral J | author3 = Pfuetzner RA | author4 = Kuo A | author5 = Gulbis JM | author6 = Cohen SL | display-authors = 6 | last7 = Chait | first7 = BT | last8 = MacKinnon | first8 = R }}* * [...] fluorescence distance measurements* * [...] and cryo-electron microscopy studies.* ...|$|E
