5000|$|Knocked Down Flange - A {{knocked down}} flange is a {{critical}} seam defect and it occurs when the cover and <b>body</b> <b>hooks</b> do not interlock dues to a bent can flange before double seaming.|$|R
5000|$|False Seam - A [...] "false seam" [...] is a seam or {{portion of}} the seam which is {{completely}} unhooked, and in which the folded cover hook is compressed against the folded <b>body</b> <b>hook.</b> A false seam is not always detectable in an external examination.|$|R
5000|$|Tight First Operation Seam - Tight first {{operation}} seams {{can create}} flatness {{at the bottom}} of the first operation seam throughout its length. The cover hook may also be turned into the <b>body</b> <b>hook.</b> Overly tight first operation seams tend to create more reverse wrinkles in the cover hook.|$|R
5000|$|Cover Vee - [...] "Vees" [...] or [...] "lips" [...] are {{projections}} of the double seam below {{the bottom of a}} normal seam that resemble a [...] "V" [...] shape. There is usually no overlap of the cover <b>hook</b> with the <b>body</b> <b>hook</b> and these defects usually occur in small areas of the seam.|$|R
5000|$|Seam bump - Seam bumps are a {{relatively}} short area of the double seam, where the seam thickness suddenly increases by 0.004" [...] (0.1 mm) or more. They are predominantly found on welded and two-piece cans with long <b>body</b> <b>hooks</b> and are usually seen on the can filler's end when hot filled products exceed 185 degrees (Fahrenheit). The cover hook radius may be {{pulled away from the}} body wall.|$|R
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} innovation since the introduction of double seams is the welded side seam. Prior to the welded side seam, the can body was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick side seam. The thick side seam required that the side seam end juncture at the end curl to have more metal to curl around before closing in behind the <b>Body</b> <b>Hook</b> or flange, with a greater opportunity for error.|$|R

5000|$|Traditional teardown. Although pretty rare, in {{this case}} the {{external}} measurements are made (usually consisting of seam length, seam thickness and countersink). Internal parameters are evaluated by tearing down the seam, then measuring the cover <b>hook</b> and <b>body</b> <b>hook</b> parameters mechanically. Then, various calculations are made to evaluate overlap. This procedure is generally considered bad form as it does not evaluate all the seam parameters on the same exact point, which can lead to missing serious defects (including false seams).|$|R

The five layers in the final seam are then called; a) End, b) <b>Body</b> <b>Hook,</b> c) Cover <b>Hook,</b> d) <b>Body,</b> e) Countersink. All sanitary cans require a filling medium within the seam because otherwise the metal-to-metal contact will not maintain a hermetic seal. In most cases, a rubberized compound is placed inside the end curl radius, forming the critical seal between the end and the body.|$|R

5000|$|The Complete Wizard's Handbook was {{published}} in 1990, written by Rick Swan. The book covers three aspects of wizards in detail: their school of magic (such as illusion or necromancy), their [...] "wizard kit" [...] (subclass, such as mystic, witch, or militant wizard), and by their career (such as alchemist or treasure-hunter). The book also includes new spells, and rules for spell research, adjudicating illusions, and casting spells in unusual conditions. The book introduced the wizard kit, a character package for a wizard with role-playing <b>hooks</b> <b>linked</b> to game benefits and limitations; some examples of wizard kits include the Academician, the Anagokok, the Amazon Sorceress and the Witch.|$|R

Each kit {{is built around}} one recognizable stereotype of a fantasy spell-caster. Examples include the Academician, who suffers a penalty to attack rolls because he lacks a killer instinct, but his scholarly reputation earns him positive reaction bonuses when he meets fellows in his field; the Anagokok, a primitive wizard from a frigid or equatorial climate, who suffers penalties when in a hostile environment, but in his home climate he is masterful, capable of finding food and water {{in even the most}} desolate lands, and hardy enough to endure the most brutal weather conditions; and other kits such as the Amazon Sorceress and the Witch.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{there are}} several {{parameters}} {{that can be used}} to judge seam quality, the FDA regulation specifies the most critical parameters: [...] "The most critical attributes to consider in judging the quality of the double seam are overlap and tightness (wrinkle). If one of the can seam measurements (i.e., <b>body</b> <b>hook)</b> is slightly beyond the specified guidelines but the rest of the seam is evaluated and the overlap and tightness (wrinkle) are within specified guidelines, then adjustments to the seamer can be made at the next scheduled shut-down. In this instance, the manufacturer should identify the out-of-guideline measurement and document they have evaluated the rest of the double seam, but did not find immediate corrective action necessary. However, if overlap measurement or tightness rating evaluation are below the minimum guidelines a resample from the questionable seaming station should be made. If the resample continues to show out-of-guideline measurements in overlap and/or wrinkle the machine should be stopped and adjusted." ...|$|R

40|$|Leaf {{epidermal}} {{features are}} very important in grass systematics for characterization of broad groups, within subfamilies and tribes. Numerous species belonging to sub-tribe Ischaemineae, tribe Andropogoneae, family Poaceae are endemic to the Indian subcontinent, but their micromorphological reports were very scares. Therefore, foliar micromorphological characters of subtribe Ischaemineae have been studied in detail for 16 taxa of subtribe Ischaemineae from Gujarat, India. All the epidermal peels were prepared after following routine scraping method, representative areas were photographed and presented here. Structural diversity as well as metric values for both the epidermises has been recorded. In general, intercostals zones and costal zones are uniform in nature in terms of sinuous papillate long cells, cross-dumbbell-nodular shaped silica cells and triangular-low domed shaped subsidiary cells on stomata. From all the studied micromorphological characters, papillae and microhairs {{are found to be}} most useful character to segregate species and genera in subtribe Ischaemineae. Additionally, intercostal silica <b>bodies,</b> <b>hooks,</b> prickles and bulliform cells are also found to be helpful for the same.

5000|$|A {{rhinolith}} is a calculus {{present in}} the nasal cavity. The word {{is derived from the}} roots [...] and , literally meaning [...] "nose stone". It is an uncommon medical phenomenon, {{not to be confused with}} dried nasal mucus. A rhinolith usually forms around the nucleus of a small exogenous foreign body, blood clot or secretion by slow deposition of calcium and magnesium salts. Over a period of time, they grow into large irregular masses that fill the nasal cavity. They may cause pressure necrosis of the nasal septum or lateral wall of nose. Rhinoliths can cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis, headache, sinusitis and epiphora. They can be diagnosed from the history with unilateral foul smelling blood stained nasal discharge or by anterior rhinoscopy. On probing probe can be passed around all its corners. In both CT and MRI rhinolith will appear like a radiopaque irregular material. Small rhinoliths can be removed by foreign <b>body</b> <b>hook.</b> Whereas large rhinoliths can be removed either by crushing with luc's forceps or by Moore's lateral rhinotomy approach.|$|R

50|$|A liver punch {{is usually}} {{made with the}} left hand, or the left hook in infighting, or the regular short <b>body</b> <b>hook,</b> in a short and quick manner. The drive is usually made under and {{to the front of}} the ninth and tenth ribs upward to the base of the {{shoulder}} blade toward the spine. The punch shocks the liver, the largest gland organ, and a center of blood circulation, and causes the victim to lose focus and drive, and can cause a breathless feeling in the victim. It is usually delivered when feinting an opponent to lead with his right, which leaves the body exposed; the attacker then steps in and delivers a short, stiff uppercut, over the liver, which will likely leave the average man incapacitated. Most of the time, however, a liver punch is unintentional. It begins as a left <b>hook</b> to the <b>body,</b> but as the defending boxer puts his elbow down and begins to roll with the punch, the back is exposed. Thus, the attacking boxer is frequently offered either the arm or the back of the ribs, the latter of which he will usually take instead of the arm.|$|R
