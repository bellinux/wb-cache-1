25|$|Germ cell {{tumors of the}} ovary develop {{from the}} ovarian germ cells. Germ cell tumor {{accounts}} for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are teratomas and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, {{when one of the}} germ layers in the tumor develops into a squamous cell carcinoma. Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s–30s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group. Germ-cell tumors can include dysgerminomas, teratomas, yolk sac tumors/endodermal sinus tumors, and choriocarcinomas, when they arise in the ovary. Some germ-cell tumors have an isochromosome 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other. Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They {{are more likely to be}} stage I at diagnosis. Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers.

The presence of a pregnancy test that is still positive {{as well as an}} empty uterus upon transvaginal ultrasonography does, however, fulfill the definition of pregnancy of unknown location. Therefore, there may be a need for e.g. follow-up pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy, including an ectopic pregnancy. [...] An incomplete miscarriage occurs when some products of conception have been passed, but some remains inside the uterus. However, an increased distance between the uterine walls on transvaginal ultrasonography may also simply be an increased endometrial thickness and/or a polyp. The use of a Doppler ultrasound may be better in confirming the presence of significant retained products of conception in the uterine cavity.

They have rarely been associated with chronic kidney disease (secondary to reduced hCG clearance) and hyperthyroidism (given the structural homology with TSH). These cysts resolve after pregnancy. Rarely, when the theca-lutein cysts are stimulated by gonadotropins, massive ascites can result.

Distinctive clinical features of Graves’ disease include the presence of ophthalmopathy, diffuse goitre and pretibial myxoedema. Also, hyperthyroidism must be distinguished from gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, a self-limiting hyperthyroid state due to the thyroid stimulatory effects of <b>beta-hCG</b> [...] This distinction is important since the latter condition is typically mild and will not usually require specific antithyroid treatment.

30|$|The often advised initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> cutoff {{level of}} 2, 000  IU/l {{should not be}} handled as a rigid upper limit for {{accepting}} expectant management in asymptomatic patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy.

Because of the heterogeneity in patient profiles, the best treatment option is case specific.

30|$|Korhonen et al. {{have shown}} a rise in serum <b>beta-hCG</b> in 49 % of the {{patients}} requiring surgical intervention [8]. This supports our observation in serum <b>beta-hCG</b> trend, i.e., increase in <b>beta-hCG</b> ratio in the unsuccessful expectant group and decrease in the successful expectant management group. In the unsuccessful expectant management group, the mean <b>beta-hCG</b> ratio at intervention was 2.5 (99 % CI, 1.56 – 3.50), whereas at the highest point, the mean <b>beta-hCG</b> ratio was 1.1 (99 % CI, 0.99 – 1.22) in the successful expectant management group. This finding suggests that if expectant management is chosen for, a rise of initial <b>beta-hCG</b> concentration by {{one and a half}} should be interpreted as an indication for surgical intervention. Of course, the before mentioned censure in follow-up when serum <b>beta-hCG</b> levels rise above 2, 500  IU/l also influences this result. However, we reasoned that prolonged follow-up of these patients would probably lead to an even higher serum <b>beta-hCG</b> level. By respecting lower levels, we are likely to stay on the safe side of the limit, but we should keep in mind that these limits are not rigid. Table  2 illustrates that the upper limit of our protocol was not obliged rigidly. Serum <b>beta-hCG</b> levels even above 3, 000  IU/l occur in our expectant management group. However, none of these cases were successful. Furthermore, 67 % (N[*]=[*] 6) of the cases with an initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> level above 2, 000  IU/l, who also developed acute symptoms during follow-up, had an initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> above 3, 000  IU/l.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: There is {{evidence}} that ectopic pregnancies present different behavioral patterns. These distinct evolutions of ectopic pregnancies represent two different natural histories. To evaluate these evolution patterns, we compared patients undergoing medical treatment and expectant management according to their gestational age and initial <b>beta-hCG</b> levels. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective study at the Department of Obstetrics of Universidade Federal de São Paulo, a tertiary center. METHODS: Among 119 cases of unruptured ectopic pregnancies diagnosed from April 1999 to February 2004, 57 received systemic treatment with methotrexate 50 mg/m² (body surface area) intramuscularly and 62 were managed expectantly. In this study we evaluated the <b>beta-hCG</b> levels at presentation and amenorrhea duration. RESULTS: There {{was a significant difference}} between the two groups regarding amenorrhea duration and initial <b>beta-hCG</b> levels (p < 0. 001). The group with decreasing <b>beta-hCG</b> levels (managed expectantly) had longer amenorrhea (mean: 8. 87 ± 1. 71 weeks) and lower initial <b>beta-hCG</b> levels (mean: 648. 8 ± 754. 7 mIU/ml). On the other hand, the group treated with methotrexate had shorter amenorrhea (mean: 6. 81 ± 1. 88 weeks) and higher <b>beta-hCG</b> levels at presentation (2642. 7 ± 2315. 1 mIU/ml). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that ectopic pregnancies can be categorized into two groups: those with early diagnosis and shorter amenorrhea, increasing or maintained <b>beta-hCG</b> levels over 24 and 48 -hour intervals and higher <b>beta-hCG</b> levels requiring medical treatment; and those with late diagnosis and longer amenorrhea, decreased <b>beta-hCG</b> levels over 24 and 48 -hour intervals and lower <b>beta-hCG</b> levels requiring expectant management...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} semen quality and {{hormonal}} status between patients with testicular cancer and normal versus increased serum levels of <b>beta-hCG.</b> Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Academic research environment. Patient(s) : All 203 patients with testicular cancer who required chemotherapy {{in the period}} 1995 - 2003 were included. Intervention(s) : In 107 patients semen samples were stored by cryopreservation; 62 patients could be analyzed because both semen was stored and hormones were determined before starting chemotherapy (median age 25 years, range 17 - 49 years). Main Outcome Measure(s) : Total motile sperm count, T, E(2), LH, FSH, and PRL. Result(s) : Total motile sperm count was decreased in patients with increased <b>beta-hCG</b> (median 11. 9 x 10 (6)) compared with patients with normal <b>beta-hCG</b> (median 21. 5 x 10 (6)). Testosterone, E(2), and PRL were significantly higher in patients with increased <b>beta-hCG</b> levels, whereas LH and FSH were lower. Semen quality was significantly and negatively correlated with <b>beta-hCG,</b> E(2), and PRL. Conclusion(s) : Patients with increased <b>beta-hCG</b> had an inferior spermatogenesis compared with patients with normal <b>beta-hCG.</b> Increased <b>beta-hCG</b> appears {{to be associated with}} impaired spermatogenesis and increased levels of E(2) and PRL.

30|$|An initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> cutoff {{level of}} 2, 500  IU/l for {{expectant}} management {{can be used}} for asymptomatic patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy. This is also suggested by a small prospective study by Lurie et al. [9] in which patients with rising serum <b>beta-hCG</b> levels were successfully managed expectantly and a serum <b>beta-hCG</b> cutoff level of 2, 500  IU/l was used. However, the current protocol of the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology states that expectant management is justified in asymptomatic patients with a serum <b>beta-hCG</b> value until 2, 000  IU/l. By raising <b>beta-hCG</b> cutoff from 2, 000 to 2, 500  IU/l in our clinic, unnecessary surgery was prevented in 14 % of the patients eligible for expectant management, while complication rates and the number of patients with acute presentation are comparable in both intervention groups.|$|E
30|$|Various {{treatments}} for EP have been studied, i.e., surgical intervention (laparoscopy/laparotomy), medical treatment, and expectant management.

However, for over 10  years, asymptomatic patients with suspected EP and an initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> titer below 2, 500  IU/l were treated with expectant management.

30|$|The optimal <b>beta-hCG</b> cutoff was {{determined}} for asymptomatic patients using a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve.

30|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate expectant management in asymptomatic patients with an initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> titer of < 2, 500  IU/l and to determine the independent ability of initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> titers and trend of serum <b>beta-hCG</b> to predict successful expectant management. A cohort of patients (N[*]=[*] 418) with suspected ectopic pregnancy (EP) between January 1991 and July 2008 is described. Three groups were defined: group I (n[*]=[*] 182), immediate surgical intervention (< 24  h); group IIa (n[*]=[*] 130), unsuccessful expectant management (surgical intervention during follow-up), and group IIb (n[*]=[*] 99), successful expectant management (spontaneous regression of trophoblast). Hospital protocol was not complied in 35 cases (Table 1). <b>Beta-hCG</b> levels > 3, 000  IU/l occur in our expectant management group; however, none of these cases were successful. Unnecessary surgery was prevented in 14 % (n[*]=[*] 7) of asymptomatic patients with initial <b>beta-hCG</b> of > 2, 000  IU/l. The success rate of expectant management was 49 %, without a rise in complication rate or number of acute cases. In conclusion, the initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> cutoff level of 2, 000  IU/l is not a rigid upper limit for accepting expectant management in suspected EP and best practice is case specific. In asymptomatic patients, the serum <b>beta-hCG</b> cutoff level of at least 2, 500  IU/l can be used for expectant management. This cutoff could be higher, but interpretation is limited due to censure in follow-up inherent to the predefined clinical protocol.

40|$|Background. Elevated <b>beta-HCG</b> serum {{levels are}} usually an {{indication}} of pregnancy or pregnancy-related disorders, but <b>beta-HCG</b> can also be elevated in testis and germ cell tumors.

CA- 125 expression in patients with osteosarcoma has not previously been documented. Case report. Elevated <b>beta-HCG</b> and CA- 125 serum levels were observed in a female patient of 57 years of age with metastatic osteosarcoma during screening investigations prior to participation in a phase I clinical trial.

30|$|The ROC curve did not {{indicate}} an optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for successful expectant management. The best trade-off reached was at a serum <b>beta-hCG</b> cutoff level of 1, 275.5  IU/L with a sensitivity of 65.3 % and specificity of 87.1 %. None of the successful expectant management cases had an initial <b>beta-hCG</b> level above 3, 000  IU/l, while there were cases with an initial <b>beta-hCG</b> level above 3, 000 in the unsuccessful group (IIa).|$|E
30|$|Success rate of {{expectant}} {{management was}} 49 %. In 14 % (n[*]=[*] 7) {{of the cases}} with an initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> above 2, 000  IU/l, expectant management was successful (Table  1). However, there were also nine cases in this group who presented with severe symptoms during follow-up and therefore needed surgery. Of these nine cases, seven had an initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> level above 2, 500  IU/l (six above 3, 750  IU/l and one of 2, 671  IU/l). The other two had initial <b>beta-hCG</b> levels of 2, 360 and 2, 364  IU/l, respectively.

30|$|Since EP is {{expensive}} to diagnose and exclude, mainly {{due to the}} many assessment visits needed [6], determining the appropriate treatment early in the diagnostic pathway could potentially {{save a lot of}} costs. The logistic regression model could be indicative in early decision making. However, because the model is drawn up solely from the presented cohort, conclusions about absolute cutoff levels cannot be made. Interpretation of the calculated probabilities should be left {{in the hands of the}} gynecologist with knowledge of the specific case. Overall, the model shows that an increase in serum <b>beta-hCG</b> level at the second visit strongly raises the probability of having surgery during follow-up. Although a decrease of serum <b>beta-hCG</b> level at the second measurement evidently lowers the chance of culminating into an acute surgical case, these patients should still be observed with caution, especially in those with a high initial serum <b>beta-hCG</b> level (i.e., > 2, 500  IU/l) who, despite a decreasing serum <b>beta-hCG</b> level during follow-up, still have a high chance of culminating into an acute situation. This is also illustrated by the published cases of patients with rupture of EP while serum <b>beta-hCG</b> level is disappearing [11, 12]. A recent study showed that a serum <b>beta-hCG</b> level of > 1, 500  IU/l is associated with a higher rate of tubal rupture than a <b>beta-hCG</b> level of < 1, 500  IU/l [13]. Therefore, frequent follow-up and clear patient instructions are necessary for safe expectant management.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{prognostic}} significance of elevated urinary beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (<b>beta-hCG)</b> {{in patients with}} bladder cancer. Patients and methods Total <b>beta-hCG</b> was measured in the urine of 142 patients referred for cystoscopic examination. Patients were followed {{for a minimum of}} 17 months and grouped according to stage of disease. Because the water output by individual patients varied, urinary creatinine levels were measured as an indicator of the concentration of the urine sample. Patient outcomes were correlated with urinary total <b>beta-hCG</b> levels both corrected and uncorrected for creatinine concentration. After correcting for urinary creatinine levels, 40 patients were excluded because the sample was too dilute (undetectable <b>beta-hCG</b> and a creatinine level of 3. 74 IU/mmol/L creatinine. There was no significant association between urinary total <b>beta-hCG</b> concentrations and the rates of recurrence or progression for Ta–T 1 disease at 17 months of follow-up. For patients with T 2 –T 4 disease there was a significant association with widespread metastasis (P< 0. 01) and mortality (P< 0. 01) at 17 months of follow-up. These associations persisted when urinary total <b>beta-hCG</b> levels were not corrected for urinary creatinine concentration (metastasis, P< 0. 01; mortality, P= 0. 07; Kaplan–Meier survival time analysis, uncorrected for creatinine P= 0. 027, corrected for creatinine P< 0. 001). This association could not be accounted for by differences in age, histopathology or treatment. Conclusion Although sample concentration was a serious confounding factor, after correcting for dilution using the creatinine content, the elevated urinary levels of total <b>beta-hCG</b> indicated those T 2 –T 4 lesions which were likely to metastasize and those patients likely to die early. If this test is to be used clinically, concentrated samples, i. e. early-morning urine, and a more sensitive <b>beta-hCG</b> assay are required.

Methods A prospective observational study was carried out between April 2002 and November 2006 at the Federal University of São Paulo in 65 patients with an ectopic pregnancy treated with a single dose of 50 mg/m(2) of methotrexate administered intramuscularly. the following predictive factors were evaluated: <b>beta-hCG</b> level on the day of hospital admission and the percent increment in <b>beta-hCG</b> in the 48 -h interval prior to treatment. Results Treatment was successful in 49 cases (75. 4 %). in these cases, <b>beta-hCG</b> levels at hospitalization were lower when compared to the levels found in cases of therapeutic failure (1, 928. 9 vs. 4, 828. 6 mIU/ml, respectively; P < 0. 01), and the increment in <b>beta-hCG</b> level in the 48 -h interval prior to treatment was smaller (13. 1 vs. 36. 3 %, respectively; P = 0. 01). A <b>beta-hCG</b> measurement <= 2, 685 mIU/ml on the day of hospitalization and an increment in <b>beta-hCG</b> level <= 11. 1 % in the 48 h preceding treatment were factors indicative of therapeutic success with sensitivity of 79. 6 and 61. 7 %, respectively, and specificity of 75 and 81. 3 %, respectively. Conclusions the lower the <b>beta-hCG</b> measurement on the day of hospital admission and the lower its increment in the 48 -h interval prior to treatment, the greater the likelihood that treatment of ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate will be successful. the margin of safety for treatment with methotrexate is high when <b>beta-hCG</b> measurement on the day of hospitalization is <= 2, 685 mIU/ml and its increment in the 48 h prior to treatment is <= 11. 1 %.
