There is a duty on {{the part}} of the rich to the poor and to the needy, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> going to help people express that duty and satisfy it if you punish them fiscally so viciously that they leave this city and this country. I want London to be a competitive, dynamic place to come to work." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Khudai Khidmatgar {{was founded}} on {{a belief in the}} power of Gandhi's notion of Satyagraha, a form of active non-violence as {{captured}} in an oath. He told its members: [...] "I am going to give you such a weapon that the police and the army {{will not be able to}} stand against it. It is the weapon of the Prophet, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> aware of it. That weapon is patience and righteousness. No power on earth can stand against it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 12, 1942, Bong flew {{very low}} ("buzzed") over {{a house in}} nearby San Anselmo, {{the home of a}} pilot who had just been married. He was cited and {{temporarily}} grounded for breaking flying rules, along with three other P-38 pilots who had looped around the Golden Gate Bridge on the same day. For looping the Golden Gate Bridge, flying at a low level down Market Street in San Francisco, and blowing the clothes off of an Oakland woman's clothesline, Bong was reprimanded by General George C. Kenney, commanding officer of the Fourth Air Force, who told him, [...] "If you didn't want to fly down Market Street, I wouldn't have you in my Air Force, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> to do it any more and I mean what I say." [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "We needed kids like this lad." [...] In all subsequent accounts, Bong denied flying under the Golden Gate Bridge. Nevertheless, Bong was still grounded when the rest of his group was sent without him to England in July 1942. Bong then transferred to another Hamilton Field unit, 84th Fighter Squadron of the 78th Fighter Group. From there, Bong was sent to the Southwest Pacific Area.|$|E

6000|$|... "Because <b>you</b> <b>were</b> such {{a perverse}} creature, {{as the old}} lady said.
