50|$|After the war, the Federal was {{gradually}} re-equipped with railroad-owned lightweight sleepers and coaches from Pullman-Standard, including New Haven coaches of the 8600-8702 series, sleepers of the 14-roomette, 4-double bedroom Point-series of 1948 and the 6-section, 4-double bedroom, 6-roomette Beach-series of 1955. Food service {{was provided by}} a <b>buffet-lounge</b> <b>car</b> which also contained 6 double bedrooms, from the prewar and postwar PRR Falls-series until 1960, and a 1955 New Haven State-series car of similar configuration thereafter. Other PRR coaches and sleepers could sometimes be found as well on the postwar Federal, though its consist was mostly New Haven by joint agreement.|$|E
500|$|The two {{trainsets}} {{remained in}} use until March 19, 1953, when the Union Pacific introduced conventional lightweight equipment powered by EMD locomotive sets. The Union Pacific finalized the consist on January 10, 1954. Each {{of the two}} new consists included the following: a baggage car, a coach-lounge (the [...] "Pub", replacing the [...] "Frontier Shack"), two 44-seat coaches, a twin-unit dining car, four sleeping <b>cars,</b> and a <b>buffet-lounge.</b> The <b>cars</b> were drawn from both the Union Pacific and the Chicago and North Western. The sleeping cars included two 10-roomette 6-double bedroom Pacific-series cars, a 12-section car, and a 4-compartment 4-double bedroom 1-compartment car. For a brief period in the late 1950s two leased Pennsylvania Railroad 21-roomette sleeping cars operated on the City of Denver {{to compete with the}} slumbercoaches on the Denver Zephyr. After the discontinuance of the Chicago–Pacific Northwest Olympian Hiawatha in 1961, the Milwaukee Road's Super Dome dome lounges could be found on the City of Denver as well.|$|R
2500|$|Until late 2012 the Ocean route was {{supported}} by three Renaissance train-sets, but a reduction in service to 3 departures in each direction per week late that year reduced the need to only 2 sets of equipment. These sets range from as few as 14 cars in the off season {{to as many as}} 21 cars during the peak summer period, and each consist includes a baggage car, several coach cars, a dining car bracketed by two service cars, multiple sleeping cars, a transition car (see discussion above) and a [...] "Park" [...] Sleeper <b>Buffet-Lounge</b> Dome Observation <b>Car.</b> The Ocean is almost invariably hauled by a pair of London, Ontario-built GM F40PH locomotives, of which all have been upgraded by CAD Railway Industries of Montreal to the F40PH-3 model. A third locomotive is sometimes added in the fall and winter to help deal with difficult track conditions. For several years prior to 2012, one set of Renaissance equipment was removed from service in the winter months for upgrade work, and was replaced with a set of Budd-built stainless steel [...] "HEP1" [...] equipment (including a baggage car, coaches, a [...] "Skyline" [...] dome car, a dining car, [...] "Chateau" [...] sleepers, and a [...] "Park" [...] car). This practice ended after the service reduction, as only 2 sets of equipment were required. However, in 2014 and again in 2015, Via added extra trains over the Christmas holiday period, which they ran using a set of [...] "HEP1" [...] equipment much like in past years. These runs have been popular with both railfans and many among the travelling public, as they provide more types of sleeping accommodations, a dome accessible to coach passengers, and a full dining car with meals cooked on board (a contrast to the catered meals in the normal Renaissance dining cars).|$|R
