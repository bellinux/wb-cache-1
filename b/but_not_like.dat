25|$|As more {{types of}} mesons were {{discovered}} in accelerator experiments later, it was eventually found that the mu meson significantly differed {{not only from the}} pi meson (of about the same mass), but also from all other types of mesons. The difference, in part, was that mu mesons did not interact with the nuclear force, as pi mesons did (and were required to do, in Yukawa's theory). Newer mesons also showed evidence of behaving like the pi meson in nuclear interactions, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the mu meson. Also, the mu meson's decay products included both a neutrino and an antineutrino, rather than just one or the other, as was observed in the decay of other charged mesons.|$|E

500|$|Campbell {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the single most important and influential editor in the early history of science fiction. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote: [...] "More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf." [...] After 1950, new magazines such as Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction moved in different directions and developed talented new writers who were not directly influenced by him. Campbell often suggested story ideas to writers (including [...] "Write me a creature that thinks as well as a man, or better than a man, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> a man"), and sometimes asked for stories to match cover paintings he had already bought.|$|E

500|$|Before {{discovering}} Larkin, Disney {{had been}} insisting on auditioning exclusively performers who {{were capable of}} singing {{as well as they}} could act. However, after Williams' recruitment, the studio relented in favor of casting [...] "strong actors" [...] instead. When Larkin first auditioned for the role, [...] "A Whole New World", Jasmine's only surviving song, had not yet been written; she admitted, [...] "there's no way I would have even auditioned... {{if there had been a}} song from the beginning." [...] After writing Jasmine's first song, the filmmakers asked Larkin if she would be interested in recording it and providing the character's singing voice. Larkin immediately declined, joking, [...] "I do ... <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> a princess!" [...] Thus, Disney decided to recruit a singer who could mimic Larkin's speaking voice instead, despite the actress' fear that the studio would completely replace her with a professional singer altogether.|$|E

500|$|With {{temperatures}} reaching 122° on {{the artificial}} turf at Texas Stadium, the Giants played the Dallas Cowboys on September 16. The Giants dominated {{from the outset}} and used backup players heavily throughout the game. Lawrence Taylor batted a Troy Aikman pass high into the air, which he caught and returned for a touchdown. The Giants' defense held the Cowboys to 20 rushing yards and 156yards of total offense, while the Giants' offense gained 369 yards. The Cowboys totaled only nine first downs, averaged 1.8yards per rush and were dominated in time of possession, 41:40 to 18:20. Despite the 28–7 victory, Giants center Bart Oates still felt the offense could improve its play: [...] "e missed a lot of assignments.

[...] Contessa Gayles of The Boombox wrote that [...] "Beyoncé rocks the racy shoot in satin hot pants, garters and a slinky wrap dress", further describing her look and the set as [...] "sexy". Matt Donnelly of Los Angeles Times described the video as [...] "sultry" [...] and further found [...] "a Jessica Rabbit vibe". Donnelly also wrote, [...] "The video carries the standard Bey DNA—wind machines, plunging necklines and lots of hair. Not that we're complaining." [...] Derek Johnson of Long Island Press commented that the video is [...] "heating up the Internet and we're pretty sure we know why", referring to Beyoncé's figure. He further commended Beyoncé for taking viewers {{back to the days}} of black and white television and [...] "into the office of a lonely detective on a rainy day.

2500|$|Alexis Bledel {{was cast}} in the key role of Rory despite having no {{previous}} acting experience. Sherman-Palladino was drawn to her shyness and innocence, which she said was essential for the character, and felt she photographed well. Lauren Graham was pursued by the casting directors {{from the start of}} the process, but she was committed to another show on NBC. A week before shooting, they had still failed to cast Lorelai so they asked Graham to audition anyway. Sherman-Palladino cast her that day, on the hope that Graham's other show (M.Y.O.B.) would be cancelled, which it soon was. She later explained how Graham met all the criteria she had been looking for: [...] "Lorelai’s a hard fucking part. You’ve got to be funny, you’ve got to talk really fucking fast, you’ve got to be able to act, you’ve got to be sexy, but not scary sexy. You’ve got to be strong, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> ‘I hate men,'". Graham and Bledel only met the night before they started filming the pilot.|$|E

No recorded version is known to survive. However, according to author Allen J.

A few months later George Harrison played on a live version which was recorded in Copenhagen with Delaney and Bonnie and Eric Clapton which came out on an unauthorized release, though a legitimate version was also recorded in concert in England (and released in 1970). In 1972 Ringo Starr drummed on, and produced a brief version with Elton John on piano and T. Rex singer Marc Bolan on lead vocal. Lastly, in the 1990s Paul McCartney did a (professionally recorded) soundcheck singing [...] "Tutti Frutti" [...] <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> Elvis or Little Richard but instead like an extremely laid-back Pat Boone of 1956 (Boone's real version was more lively).
