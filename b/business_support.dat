500|$|A second key {{criticism}} of the Act is that it lacked support from the business community, and thus was doomed to failure. <b>Business</b> <b>support</b> for national planning and government intervention was very strong in 1933, but had collapsed by mid-1934. Many studies conclude, however, that <b>business</b> <b>support</b> for NIRA was never uniform. Larger, older businesses embraced the legislation while smaller, newer ones (more nimble in a highly competitive market and with less capital investment to lose if they failed) did not. This is a classic problem of cartels, and thus NIRA codes failed as small business abandoned the cartels. Studies of the steel, automobile manufacturing, lumber, textile, and rubber industries and the level and source {{of support for the}} NIRA tend to support this conclusion. Without the support of [...] industry, the Act could never have performed as it was intended.|$|E
