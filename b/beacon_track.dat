5000|$|In {{addition}} to the communication and maintenance van, other AN/MSQ-77 trailers were the 33 ft radar van with roof-mounted Cassegrain antenna, [...] "control and plotting van, two diesel generator vans, and an administrative and supply van" [...] which were emplaced as a military installation at the surveyed site. [...] The primary modification for the AN/MSQ-77 was the control equipment for aircraft guidance (ballistic computer, guidance/release circuitry, and UHF command equipment). The central also had an added beacon tracking capability used when the aircraft had a receiver/transmitter (e.g., Motorola SST-181 X Band Beacon Transponder)http://www.1stcombatevaluationgroup.com/1CEVG_skyspot_history.PDF to increase the range so the radar site could be located farther from the hostile region of bombing targets. <b>Beacon</b> <b>track</b> upgrades included radar circuitry to switch the heterodyne receiver to demodulate the transponder frequency, compensation for the transponder delay, and modification of the central's plotting board circuitry to allow display for increased ranges. The plots were of tracks calculated by the computer's Aircraft Coordinates and Plotting Group which converted radar spherical data to plotting board cartesian coordinates (non-inertial east, north, up coordinate system) using sine/cosine voltages and radar-estimated range respectively from the Antenna Group (azimuth/elevation resolvers) and from the Track Range Computer. Additional A/C Coordinates amplifiers computed the velocity components (not plotted) which along with the track position components were provided as initial bomb conditions to the ballistic computer (Bomb Trajectory Group).|$|E

40|$|Miniaturized {{satellites}} such as CubeSats {{continue to}} improve their capabilities to enable missions that can produce significant amounts of data. For most CubeSat missions, data must be downlinked during short low-earth orbit ground station passes, a task currently performed using traditional radio systems. Free-space optical communications {{take advantage of the}} high gain of a narrow optical beam to achieve better link efficiency, allowing more valuable data to be downlinked over the mission lifetime. We present the Nanosatellite Optical Downlink Experiment (NODE) design, capable of providing a typical 3 U (30 x 10 x 10 cm) CubeSat with a comparatively high data-rate downlink. The NODE optical communication module is designed to fit within a 5 x 10 x 10 cm volume, weigh less than 1 kg, and consume no more than 10 Wof power during active communication periods. Our design incorporates a fine-steering mechanism and beacon-tracking system to achieve a 10 Mbps link rate. We describe the system-level requirements and designs for key components, including a transmitter, a <b>beacon</b> <b>tracking</b> camera, and a fast-steering mirror. We present simulation results of the uplink <b>beacon</b> <b>tracking</b> and fine steering of the downlink beam, including the effects of atmospheric fading and on-orbit environmental disturbances to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Advances in attitude determination have {{led to the development of}} several CubeSat-sized attitude sensors capable of achieving fine attitude knowledge, most of which utilize natural light sources as references, such as in the case of star trackers and sun sensors. However, inertial-based attitude sensors often limit ground tracking capability of the satellite due to high ephemeris uncertainty of most CubeSats. Laser <b>beacon</b> <b>tracking</b> directly measures of the satellite’s attitude relative to a ground station or target, eliminating attitude errors induced in the coordinate frame conversion process.
