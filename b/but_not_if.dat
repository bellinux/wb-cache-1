25|$|However, a {{child whose}} {{father is a}} foreign diplomat who enjoys {{immunity}} in Singapore will not be granted Singaporean citizenship even if his or her mother is Singaporean.

25|$|Children {{typically}} {{use their}} fathers' last names only.

25|$|The {{placebo effect}} {{makes it more}} {{difficult}} to evaluate new treatments. Clinical trials control for this effect by including a group of subjects that receives a sham treatment.

However, Pliny's placement of the Frisiavones in northern Gaul is not near the known location of the Frisii, which is acceptable if the Frisavones are a separate people, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>if</b> they are a part of a greater Frisian tribe.|$|E

25|$|On weekdays of {{the first}} week of Great Lent, fasting is {{particularly}} severe, and many observe it by abstaining from all food for some period of time. According to strict observance, on the first five days (Monday through Friday) there are only two meals eaten, one on Wednesday and the other on Friday, both after the Presanctified Liturgy. Those who are unable to follow the strict observance may eat on Tuesday and Thursday (<b>but</b> <b>not,</b> <b>if</b> possible, on Monday) in the evening after Vespers, when they may take bread and water, or perhaps tea or fruit juice, but not a cooked meal. The same strict abstention is observed during Holy Week, except that a vegan meal with wine and oil is allowed on Great Thursday.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} from bane to deodand remains obscure. By {{the second half}} of the thirteenth century, however, the coroner's rolls are replete with references to vats, tubs, horses, carts, boats, stones, trees, etc. The rules on which they depended were not easily explained by the old commentators. The law distinguished, for instance, between a thing in motion and a thing standing still. If a horse or other animal in motion killed a person, whether infant or adult, or if a cart ran over him, it was forfeited as a deodand. On the other hand, if death were caused by falling from a cart or a horse at rest, the law made the chattel a deodand if the person killed were an adult, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>if</b> he were below the years of discretion.|$|E
25|$|At 16:00, the CVR {{showed that}} Captain Tsu left the cockpit; five seconds later, the CVR stopped recording. Tests {{indicated}} that a click would be heard on the CVR recording if the CVR circuit breaker had tripped normally, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>if</b> it had been pulled out manually. As there was no click, {{it is likely that}} Captain Tsu pulled out the CVR circuit breaker before leaving the cockpit. The NTSC and NTSB investigators thought that if Captain Tsu was responsible for the crash, he must have made up some excuse to get the First Officer to leave the flightdeck prior to disabling the FDR (which would have immediately triggered a Master Caution on both pilots' control panels), so his actions would not be noticed. Several minutes later, as recorded by Indonesian ground radar, the aircraft entered a rapid descent, disintegrated, and crashed into the Musi River.|$|E

25|$|The six spoiler {{actuators}} {{were sent}} to the Royal Norwegian Air Force's facility at Kjeller for examination. Radiographic examinations confirmed that they were all in a closed and locked position. A simulation was carried out in a flight simulator to see if, given the conditions, a 146 could land at Sørstokken without operative spoilers. It concluded that this would be possible with a dry runway, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>if</b> it is wet. An extensive investigation of the spoiler system was carried out by Aviation Engineering, who published their findings on 10 May 2011. AIBN quickly started working out from a hypothesis that the spoilers did not deploy and investigated three possible causes: a mechanical failure in the lever, a failure in two thrust lever micro switches, and an open circuit breaker in the lift spoiler system. In the latter it would have been necessary for two of four to fail, although one could have failed without being detected.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} {{files in}} a case calculated {{to lead to a}} judgment, the judges would exchange their views informally on the salient legal points of the case, and a time limit for producing a judgment would then be set. Then, each judge would write an anonymous summary containing his opinion; the opinions would be circulated among the Court for 2 or 3 days before the President drafted a judgment containing a summary of those submitted by individual judges. The Court would then agree on the decision that they wished to reach, along with the main points of argument they wished to use. Once this was done, a Committee of 4, including the President, the Registrar and two judges elected by secret ballot, drafted a final judgment, which was then voted on by the entire Court. Once a final judgment was set, it was given to the public and the press. Every judgment contained the reasons behind the decision and the judges assenting; dissenting judges were allowed to deliver their own judgment, with all judgments read in open court before the agents of the parties to the dispute. Judgments could not be revised except on the discovery of some fact unknown when the Court sat <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>if</b> the fact was known but not discussed because of negligence.|$|E
500|$|In the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon {{opened his}} first Big Man Camp, where he teaches young frontcourt players {{the finer points}} of playing in the post. While Olajuwon never {{expressed}} an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players. When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, [...] "For a big man who is just big, maybe. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>if</b> you play with speed, with agility. It will always be a big man's game if the big man plays the right way. On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots. On offense, he draws double-teams and creates opportunities. He can add so much, {{make it easier for the}} entire team." [...] He runs the camp for free. Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players, including power forward Emeka Okafor, and center Yao Ming. In September, 2009, he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake. More recently he has been working with Dwight Howard, helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus. In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon. [...] Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar'e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried.|$|E
