5|$|Over 190 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} near the bay, some of which {{use it as a}} feeding ground during their migrations. Waders and wildfowl often over-winter on the reserve. The populations of whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) and <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwit</b> (Limosa limosa) are internationally important. Significant populations of dunlin (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope) also frequent the bay. In early winter the wigeon select Puccinellia maritima in preference to Agrostis stolonifera and Festuca rubra. Avocets have become regular autumn and winter visitors to the area in recent years, favouring the lower reaches of the River Parrett, and, {{for the first time in}} over 50 years, bred on the reserve in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Several rivers, {{including}} the Parrett, Brue and Washford, drain into the bay. Man-made drainage ditches from the Somerset Levels, {{including the}} River Huntspill, also {{run into the}} bay. The mud flats provide a habitat {{for a wide range}} of flora and fauna. These include some nationally rare plants, beetles and snails. It is particularly important for over-wintering waders and wildfowl, with approximately 190 species recorded including whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwit</b> (Limosa limosa), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope). Fishing has taken place using shallow boats, known as flatners, and fixed wooden structures for hundreds of years. It was also the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing'. There are several small harbours along the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwit</b> (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E

50|$|In flight, its bold {{black and}} white wingbar and white rump can be seen readily. When on the ground it can be {{difficult}} to separate from the similar Bar-tailed <b>Godwit,</b> but the <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwit's</b> longer, straighter bill and longer legs are diagnostic. <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>godwits</b> are similar in body size and shape to bar-taileds, but stand taller.|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} of continental <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits,</b> Limosa limosa limosa, has steadily declined since the 1980 's. Agri-environment schemes (AES) {{have been implemented}} to stop the decline, but have proven ineffective. This study looks at habitat phenology and selection of <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> during the breeding season {{in order to understand}} how agricultural management may affect their reproductive success. I studied <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> in the Haanmeer, a small nature reserve in the north of the Netherlands and compared insect density, insect biomass, soil resistance, vegetation structure and earthworm abundance amongst management types. I found that monocultures have a higher soil resistance compared to herb-rich meadows. Differences in insect abundance and biomass were limited, however, with vegetation variables being a better explanation of the differences than weather variables. There was no difference in earthworm abundance between habitat types. Across most variables, differences between individual meadows were much larger than between habitat types. In conclusion, this suggests that soil resistance, and in turn water-levels, and vegetation structure are key characteristics of the habitat of <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|In Europe, <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwits</b> {{are only}} hunted in France, with the annual total killed {{estimated}} at 6,000 to 8,000 birds. This puts additional {{pressure on the}} western European population, and the European Commission has a management plan {{in place for the}} species in its member states. In England, <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwits</b> were formerly much prized for the table. Sir Thomas Browne (1605-1682) said: [...] "Godwits were accounted the daintiest dish in England and I think, for the bignesse, of the biggest price." [...] Old names included Blackwit, Whelp, Yarwhelp, Shrieker, Barker and Jadreka Snipe. The Icelandic name for the species is Jaðrakan.|$|R

25|$|Yanga National Park and the {{surrounding}} Lowbidgee floodplain {{has been identified as}} a nationally important habitat for colonially-nesting waterbirds. This includes providing habitat for threatened species such as the Australasian bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus), <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwit</b> (Limosa limosa), blue-billed duck (Oxyura australis) and freckled duck (Stictonetta naevosa). This area has also been identified as an important area for migratory waterbird habitat in New South Wales. There are 11 migratory species covered by the international agreements for migratory birds (JAMBA, CAMBA, and ROKAMBA) recorded in Yanga National Park and adjacent areas.|$|E
25|$|This {{area has}} been {{identified}} {{as one of the most}} significant wetland habitats for waterbirds in eastern Australia. Lignum floodways are a popular breeding habitat for a large range of waterbird species including ibis, and flooded areas of red gum forest provide habitat for nesting egrets, spoonbills and cormorants. Migratory species under the Japan–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA), the China–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA) and the Republic of Korea–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (ROKAMBA) that have been recorded to regularly use wetlands within the Yanga National Park and surrounding areas include the Caspian tern, Latham’s snipe, cattle egret, and the <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{birds that}} have been seen on the reserve include Cetti's warbler, and a female smew. Common and Mediterranean gulls are seen {{annually}} on the reserve. <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>godwits</b> are seen every few years on the reserve.|$|R
40|$|<b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> were {{implanted}} with satellite transmitters to study their migration and wintering patterns in 2009. In the breeding season of 2010 {{the discovery of}} a clutch with strangely shaped eggs suggested that the transmitters might negatively affect reproduction. One year later a similar strangely shaped egg was found in the territory of one of the transmitter birds. We used molecular DNA techniques to prove that this egg had been laid by this transmitter female. This suggests that birds with implanted transmitters show normal breeding behaviour and try to reproduce, but that as the eggs are deformed, implanted satellite transmitters physically prevent reproduction in <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>godwits...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{population}} level effects of diffuse pollution, {{in the form}} of heavy metals, on <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> breeding on contaminated soils in The Netherlands are studied. In a polluted and a reference site concentrations of heavy metals in soil, earthworms, feathers and eggs of <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> were measured and population studies were conducted. The data on vital rates were inferred in a matrix population model and an elasticity analysis was performed, to determine which vital rates are most important in determining the population growth rate and how much these rates need to increase for a population to remain stable. Finally, recommendations for management in the light of heavy metal pollution are given. ...|$|R
500|$|The ruff {{normally}} feeds using {{a steady}} walk and pecking action, selecting food items by sight, {{but it will}} also wade deeply and submerge its head. On saline lakes in East Africa it often swims like a phalarope, picking items off the surface. It will feed at night as well as during the day. It is thought that Ruff use both visual and auditory cues to find prey. [...] When feeding, the ruff frequently raises its back feathers, producing a loose pointed peak on the back; this habit is shared only by the <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwit.</b>|$|E

40|$|Capsule <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> first {{return to}} the nest {{location}} of the previous year, even when moving to a different nest location later that season. Aims To examine the use of space by <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> during the two months before egg-laying to two weeks afterwards. Methods We compare the spatial distribution of sightings of eventually site-faithful birds with birds that changed nest location, and relate this to the change of the distance to their previous year's and current nest-site in the period until egg-laying. Using a log-likelihood model we establish how the differences in distance to the respective nests change {{over the course of}} the season. Results All birds were observed first near their previous year's nest-site, and remained there for most of the pre-laying period. Birds that subsequently changed nest location made the move only about five days before egg-laying and were more wide-ranging earlier on. Conclusion The {{return to the}} previous nest-site suggests that a decision to move is made only after considerable time investment near the previous nest-site. This indicates that site-faithfulness in <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> is conditional on experiences after return to the nesting area...|$|R
40|$|Expedition report, University of Groningen & Global Flyway Network, The Netherlands December 2016 Concentrating {{our efforts}} in Senegal, we used remote sensing {{products}} (Modis EVI 16 day time series) and 3. 5 years of good quality locations of <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwits</b> (equipped with PTT satellite tags) {{to generate a}} spatially and temporally explicit habitat prediction model using MaxEnt modelling. We found that during the non-breeding period <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwits</b> show a preference for stable habitats within a relatively low productivity range (EVI value 0. 1 - 0. 2), likely associated with open wetlands, low vegetation cover and shallow surface water. However, remote sensing data is difficult to interpret without accurate ground-truthing information. In this study we aimed to conduct a rapid survey along a north-south transect of the Senegal coastal region, categorizing and describing habitats important for <b>black-tailed</b> <b>godwits.</b> Between 28 November and 11 December 2016 we visited the most import areas in Senegal to record resightings of individual birds and describe godwit habitat.

40|$|For a long time, {{agricultural}} areas had considerable ornithological value, an ecological richness which in The Netherlands was epitomised {{by the term}} ‘meadow birds’. However, over the last half century, agricultural intensification has negatively affected the quality of meadow bird habitats. Here we provide a quantitative characterization of agricultural habitats and their use by <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> Limosa l. limosa in the south-western part of the province of Friesland, The Netherlands, in 2009, to provide a yardstick to evaluate further change. We used groundwater level, vegetation typology, relief in the landscape, the occurrence of foot drains, land use and soil characteristics such as textures and peat to describe the landscape that comprised 43 polders covering 8480 ha. We used a Principal Component Analysis to summarize landscape characteristics and find {{that much of the}} habitat variation is explained by a combination of herb richness of the vegetation, {{the presence or absence of}} foot drains and groundwater level. The modern agricultural landscape of southwest Friesland consists of 80 % of uniform, intensively managed landscape with herb-poor meadows and low groundwater levels, the remaining 20 % being taken by remnants of the former herb-rich meadows. The whole study area was searched weekly and <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> were mapped between arrival and egg-laying. The positive relationship between godwit density and the first PC axis indicates that <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> preferred herb-rich polders with high groundwater levels and the presence of foot drains. Soil texture was poorly correlated with godwit breeding densities for intensively managed (herb-poor) parcels, but for herb-rich meadows, soils of sandy clay loam and sandy clay harboured the highest densities of <b>godwits.</b> To protect <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Godwits,</b> areas should have a herb-rich vegetation, contain foot drains and high groundwater tables should be re-established. ...|$|R
