5000|$|Not all {{generating}} {{plants are}} suitable for <b>black-start</b> capability. Wind turbines are not suitable for black start because wind may not be available when needed. Wind turbines, mini-hydro, or micro-hydro plants, are often connected to induction generators which are incapable of providing power to re-energize the network. The <b>black-start</b> unit must also be stable when operated with the large reactive load of a long transmission line. Many high-voltage direct current converter stations cannot operate into a [...] "dead" [...] system, either, since they require commutation power from the system at the load end. A PWM-based (voltage-source converter) HVDC scheme has no such restriction.|$|E
50|$|To {{provide a}} black start, some power {{stations}} have small diesel generators, normally called the black start diesel generator (BSDG), {{which can be}} used to start larger generators (of several megawatts capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for boiler feedwater pumps, boiler forced-draft combustion air blowers, and for fuel preparation. It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so <b>black-start</b> power must be provided over designated tie lines from another station. Often hydroelectric power plants are designated as the <b>black-start</b> sources to restore network interconnections. A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the intake gates and provide excitation current to the generator field coils), and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations. Certain types of combustion turbine can be configured for black start, providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants.|$|E
50|$|Littlebrook D {{was one of}} {{a number}} of {{stations}} throughout the UK with <b>black-start</b> capabilities, meaning that it was able to start generating without an external power supply - the station would be one of the first to start generating should the UK experience a partial or complete blackout. Littlebrook D played a vital role in restoring power supplies to the South East of England in the days following the storm force winds of October 1987. The <b>black-start</b> capability was facilitated by the presence of three open-cycle gas turbines (OCGTs), each capable of generating 35 MW, which was sufficient to operate the station auxiliary equipment and allow a main unit to be started. Each OCGT set incorporated two Rolls-Royce Olympus jet engines which are industrial derivatives of those that were used on the Concorde aircraft. As well as providing <b>black-start</b> supplies to the station, the fact that they could synchronise and ramp up to full load in under five minutes means they were used to generate at the request of National Grid Company (who operated the UK electricity grid system) to deal with short-term peaks in demand. Such peaks typically arise during the winter months, where evening demand is higher due to lighting and heating requirements. A further facility provided to the National Grid Company by the OCGTs was one of system protection. They would start automatically should the system frequency (50.0 Hz in the UK) fall to 49.6 Hz, which would indicate that the supply from generation was not sufficient to meet the demand. The National Grid Company are obliged to ensure that there is enough operating reserve available at all times and as such, low frequency events are rare and will only arise where a substantial loss of generation has occurred.|$|E

50|$|In the North American {{independent}} system operators, {{the procurement}} of black start varies somewhat. Traditionally, black start {{was provided by}} integrated utilities and the costs were rolled into a broad tariff for cost recovery from ratepayers. In those areas which {{are not part of}} organized electricity markets, this is still the usual procurement mechanism. In the deregulated environment, this legacy of cost-based provision has persisted, and even recent overhauls of <b>black-start</b> procurement practices, such as that by the ISO New England, have not necessarily shifted to competitive procurement, although deregulated jurisdictions have a bias for market solutions rather than cost-of-service (COS) solutions.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the grid}} {{operator}} has commercial agreements {{in place with}} some generators to provide black start capacity, recognising that black start facilities are often not economic in normal grid operation. It is typical of power stations from the CEGB era to {{have a number of}} open-cycle gas turbines (i.e. no heat recovery modules attached) that can run the entirety of the plant necessary to operating a full generating unit; these would normally be started by diesel generators, fed in turn by battery backups. Once up to speed these gas turbines are capable of running the entire plant associated {{with the rest of the}} power station, negating the need to bring power in from other sources. An example of this is the Didcot power stations where the 'A' station (a large coal-fired station consisting of four 500 MW generating units) was fitted with a gas turbine for each unit, enabling <b>black-start</b> capability for the entire station. The newer gas-fired 'B' station built adjacent (consisting of two 700 MW generating modules) was not fitted with its own Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT)'s, instead relying on the 'A' station to start first. With the closure of the 'A' station under the European Union's Large Combustion Plant Directive, the supplies and controls for the small gas turbines have been transferred to the 'B' station, ensuring that the Didcot site maintains independent <b>black-start</b> capability.|$|E
30|$|These <b>black-start</b> scheme {{generation}} and evaluation processes are generally carried out offline. Default scenarios used offline {{may be different}} from actual <b>black-start</b> situations, so a <b>black-start</b> scheme may not play its role as expected.|$|E
30|$|Evaluation {{methods are}} {{available}} to choose the best from the feasible solutions offered by black start schemes such as those above. A hierarchical process-based method using fuzzy analysis is proposed to assess <b>black-start</b> schemes [24].

40|$|As {{the first}} stage of power system {{restoration}} after a blackout, an optimal <b>black-start</b> scheme is very important for speeding up the whole restoration procedure. Up to now, much research work has been done on generating or selecting an optimal <b>black-start</b> scheme by a single round of decision-making. However, less attention has been paid for improving the final decision-making results through a multiple-round decision-making procedure. In the group decision-making environment, decision-making results evaluated by different <b>black-start</b> experts may differ significantly with each other. Thus, the consistency of <b>black-start</b> decision-making results could be deemed as an important indicator in assessing the <b>black-start</b> group decision-making results.

The system sectionalizing strategy consists of determining the proper splitting points to sectionalize the entire blackout area into several subsystems, so that parallel restoration can be carried out within the subsystems. For a large-scale power system, this system sectionalizing problem is quite complicated when considering <b>black-start</b> constraints, generation/load balance constraints, and voltage stability constraints. This paper presents an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) –based system sectionalizing method, by which the splitting points can be found quickly.

30|$|The {{emergence}} of microgrids embedded in power systems enhances self-healing capability and allows distribution systems to recover faster {{in the event}} of an outage. A microgrid can operate in an islanded mode in isolation from the connected system during an outage. In [68], a graph-theoretic restoration strategy is presented incorporating microgrids that maximizes the restored load and minimizes the number of switching operations. Spanning tree search algorithms are applied to find the candidate restoration strategies by modeling microgrids as virtual feeders. A simultaneous bidirectional approach in [69] deals with <b>black-start</b> restoration sequences. The control strategies to be adopted for microgrid <b>black-start</b> and subsequent islanded operation, as well as the appropriate rules and conditions, are derived and evaluated by numerical simulations. Ref. [70] deals with the multi-stage restoration scheduling problem in an islanded microgrid system with multiple distributed generators and a radial configuration. Two stochastic methods are used to solve it. Under appropriate conditions, distributed generation (DG) can maintain power supply for loads in microgrid after blackout, and can give some power support for adjacent microgrids, or even the main grid if properly synchronized [71].|$|E
30|$|Recent {{development}} in {{wind farm control}} has enhanced the integration of wind power into power system. However, the risk of power system blackouts is also increased due to the volatility and uncertain nature of wind power generation. There has not been much research on the potential restoration function of wind farms in power systems. Since the starting time of wind turbines is shorter than non-black-start (NBS) generating units, some wind farms {{have the potential to}} function as <b>black-start</b> power sources in certain circumstances. The firefly optimization algorithm is used in [72] to find the optimal final sequence of NBS unit restoration, the optimal transmission path, and the optimal load pick up sequence with and without integration of wind farms in the system. Ref. [73] introduces a hybrid <b>black-start</b> unit containing combustion gas turbine, wind farm and static synchronous compensator and a three-level control model to achieve comprehensive functionality. A control scheme can allow variable speed wind turbines to participate effectively in system frequency and voltage regulation as Ref. [73] describes.
